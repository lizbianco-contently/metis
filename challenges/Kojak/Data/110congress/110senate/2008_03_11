Mr. President, after reviewing the budget proposed by \nthe other side of the aisle, one thing is clear: the people who wrote \nit were more interested in growing the size and scope of Washington \nspending than in growing the American family's budget. But Americans \nexpect more from government than a $1.2 trillion tax hike and billions \nof dollars in new spending, especially in these difficult economic \ntimes.\n  But even with a giant tax hike, the new spending in this budget isn't \nreally accounted for. Democrats say they want to ``pay for'' massive \nspending by--among other gimmicks--closing what they like to refer to \nas the ``tax gap.'' This is the gap that exists between what people \nactually owe in taxes and what they pay.\n  Well, we need only look back at last year to see that Congress hasn't \nbeen very successful in attempting to close the ``tax gap''. In 2007, \nCongress passed the Democrat budget resolution which promised to reduce \nthe tax gap by $300 billion over 5 years. Unfortunately, this promise \nwas never followed up on with actual legislation to make it law and no \nprogress was made.\n\n[[Page S1826]]\n\n  In other words, Democrats are counting on a direct deposit from a job \nthey never completed. That doesn't work in the family budget, and it \nshouldn't work in the Federal budget.\n  While Congress did enact a few--a few--of the tax gap proposals \nincluded in the President's 2008 budget, those amounted to only a tiny \nfraction of the tax gap, hardly enough to rely upon for offsetting the \nbillions of dollars in the new spending Democrats are proposing. As the \nranking member of the Finance Committee reminded the Senate yesterday, \nthe promises didn't come close to matching reality. During the first \nyear of this Democrat majority the enacted tax-gap provisions amounted \nto two-tenths of 1 percent of the tax gap.\n  Two-tenths of 1 percent; that is 99.8 percent short of the promised \nrevenue. That is hundreds of billions of dollars short of the revenue \nthey projected to pay for their new Washington spending.\n  That is not even close, not even in the same ballpark.\n  There are serious disagreements between the parties on taxes. The \nother side supports higher rates. We want to keep tax rates low. But we \nshould all agree that people have a responsibility to pay what they \nlawfully owe.\n  Over and over again the Democrat majority has failed to enact any \nsort of serious and substantial strategy for closing the tax gap. And \nas a result, their numbers simply don't add up. Faulty numbers don't \npay the bills, and funds that aren't collected won't shrink the \ndeficit.\n  So if the budget written by our friends across the aisle is going to \nrely on these funds to balance the budget, we need to think again, or \nthe family budget is going to shrink to make up for the red ink in \nWashington's budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/11/senate-section/article/S1826-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Democratic budget is about three things: \njobs, jobs, jobs. It is about green-collar jobs, jobs rebuilding \nAmerica, jobs relating to education and job training.\n  The one thing my friends on the other side of the aisle never talk \nabout is where we are now. They want more of the same. We don't want \nmore of the same. We have had enough. The American people have had \nenough. The economy is in a downturn, spiraling down. The housing \nmarket is in a state of tremendous distress. The stock market is \ndropping as we speak. Oil is now at $109 a barrel.\n  Everything you hear from the Republicans is a buzzword for status \nquo--keep things the way they are; the way things are is just fine; \nlet's just let things work out.\n  We don't believe in that. We have a recipe for change. Is it \nsomething that has never been done before? No. Look at the Clinton \nyears, where we were taking in X number of dollars. If we brought in \n$10, we only spent 8 of those dollars. That is the way it was during \nthe Clinton years. We paid down the national debt.\n  The budget we have, led by Senator Conrad, who has been chairman of \nthe Budget Committee for many years, is a program that creates jobs, \njobs, and jobs. That is what is important to the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/11/senate-section/article/S1826-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about the budget.\n  First, I express my respect for the people who have worked on this \nbudget, my staff especially but also the Democratic staff, and the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Conrad.\n  We are, however, in an extraordinarily difficult time as a nation. We \nconfront major issues. We confront international issues involving the \nthreat of Islamic terrorism. We confront domestic issues of even more \nor equal significance--not equal significance; nothing is more \nsignificant than the threat of a terrorist attack with some sort of \nweapons of mass destruction, but we confront huge domestic issues such \nas the projected bankruptcy of the Nation. That is a pretty big issue, \nthat is an undeniable fact that is going to occur unless we take some \naction because of the fact that the baby boom generation is beginning \nto retire, and the cost they will put on the Federal Government and, \ntherefore, on our children who support them through taxes is going to \nbe extraordinary. We also confront the extremely difficult issue of \nenergy policy and the cost of gasoline. A barrel of gasoline went over \n$107. It is not projected to come down. The effect on the economy is \ndevastating. We confront the fact that we have a Federal Government \nwhich is spending and continues to spend significantly more than it is \ntaking in and, as a result, is spending the Social Security surplus and \nis significantly adding to the debt of the Nation.\n  One would hope that in light of these very large issues--the threat \nof terrorism, the issue of the retirement of the baby boom generation \nand the fiscal devastation that is going to bring to our children's \nability to have an affordable lifestyle, the issue of the cost of \nenergy, the issue of the size of the Federal Government and its growth \nat a pace which it cannot sustain, the tax on the American people, \nwhich gasoline now represents, which is undermining the economy, and \nthe general tax policy of the proposed budget which will undermine it \neven further--that the Democratic leadership of Congress would have \ncome forward with a budget that showed some imagination, some \ncreativity, some initiative in the area of addressing some of these \ncrucial problems.\n  Regrettably, what we got was the same old-same old--a budget filled \nwith taxes; a budget filled with spending on this special interest \nprogram and that special interest program, a budget which underfunds \nthe national defense, a budget which dramatically increases taxes on \nworking Americans, a budget which dramatically increases the debt of \nthe Federal Government and therefore the debt passed on to our \nchildren, a budget which raids the Social Security trust fund, a budget \nwhich has no creativity in the area of trying to address entitlement \nreform, a budget which uses gimmick after gimmick after gimmick and \neven gimmicks its own gimmicks in the area of pay-go, in the area of \ndiscipline, in the area of revenues. To say the least, it should be an \nembarrassment because it is such a mediocre presentation. It passes the \nproblems on to the next generation. It doesn't confront them. It \ndoesn't even try to confront them and simply aggravates those problems \nfor the next generation.\n  That is unfortunate because we are running out of time here. We are \nthe generation of leadership, the baby boom generation. We have some \nobligation to fix the problems we are going to pass on to our children. \nI believe we have a significant obligation to do that. But this budget \ndoesn't accomplish anything in that area. This budget has one thought \nin mind. It is not jobs, jobs, jobs, as the majority leader said; it is \nreelect, reelect, reelect--win the next election rather than trying to \nsolve the problems which we are passing on to the next generation.\n  The horizon of this budget is somewhere this July, this August, as we \nmove into the full-scale election cycle, when they can go to this \ninterest group and say, we have given you this money, and this interest \ngroup and say, we have given you this money, and then deny that they \nare taxing people because the taxes for those costs won't hit people \nuntil after the election and deny that they are fudging the numbers \nthrough using gimmicks because those events won't occur until after the \nelection.\n  It is truly a budget that fails on all counts to take on what is the \nreal issues facing our Nation--how we fight\n\n[[Page S1827]]\n\nterrorism, how we support our troops in the field, how we deal with \nthis looming, massive, unfunded liability of the retirement of the baby \nboom generation which will put unsustainable costs on our children and \nmake their lives essentially less viable in the way of affluence than \nours has been, a budget that dramatically increases taxes on working \nAmericans in the name of raising taxes on high-income Americans, a \nbudget that dramatically grows the debt and raids Social Security \nfunds.\n  This list, as shown here, is what it does. I think I pretty much \noutlined it. It raises taxes by $1.2 trillion. It dramatically \nincreases spending. I will get into that a little bit. It dramatically \ngrows the debt. It gimmicks its own enforcement mechanisms--pay-go and \nall the other enforcement mechanisms it allegedly has in place. Then it \ndoes nothing to address the $66 trillion unfunded liability, which is \nsuch a huge number nobody can understand it. So to try to put it in \ncontext, it means, I think, that every American today has a $120,000 \ndebt. This budget adds $24,000 to that debt. This budget does nothing \nto try to improve that situation.\n  The chairman of the committee said:\n\n       We need to be tough on spending.\n\n  The number of spending cuts in the Democratic budget: zero. The \nnumber of spending increases: $22 billion over this baseline this year \nstated on the discretionary side. On the entitlement side: $466 \nbillion--increases in spending. They allege it is $18 billion, but they \nplay another one of their games, another one of their budget games. \nThey take $4 billion in what is known as advanced appropriations--that \nmeans they take it out of next year and spend it this year--$4 billion \nadditional doing that.\n  It has been done in the past. I have opposed it in the past. But this \ntime they plus up the number a little bit so their numbers can work so \nthey can say to their different constituencies: We are going to spend \nmoney on you. You can have this money. We got it for you. We are going \nto borrow it from next year's budget--$4 billion.\n  Mr. President, $22 billion in new spending. That is a pretty big \nnumber: $22 billion. That would literally run the State of New \nHampshire for 3 or 4 years. But that is not the whole number because \nyou have to put it in a 5-year context. It is actually over $200 \nbillion of new discretionary spending because once you spend that $22 \nbillion this year, it does not come out of the budget next year, it \ngoes into what is known as the baseline. It becomes the floor, and we \nbuild on that.\n  Last year, they wanted to spend $22 billion more too, so over 2 years \nthey have bumped things up--or tried to bump things up--$44 billion. \nPlus last year they put in a supplemental for another $21 billion. I \nknow these numbers are starting to be thrown around like crazy here, \nbut the simple fact here is, it is big money--big money--being spent on \nconstituencies that vote for them.\n  The chairman of the Budget Committee said: I am prepared to get \nsavings out of long-term entitlement programs. How many savings are \nthere out of long-term entitlement programs in this budget? Zero net \nsavings; zero. While the deficit in the long-term accounts goes up \ndramatically--$66 trillion is owed to those accounts we cannot pay \nfor--this budget adds $466 billion into those accounts. It is a \nstaggering amount of money. There is no attempt to adjust that at all.\n  Now, it is interesting, we will hear from our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle--let me go to this one first, and then I will get \ninto that. The national debt goes up over $2 trillion under this \nbudget. Mr. President, $2 trillion is added to the national debt. My \ncolleagues on the other side: ``I really believe increasing the debt is \nthe threat.'' That is one of Senator Conrad's great phrases: The debt \nis the threat. I agree with him. The problem is, he is aggravating the \nthreat with this budget. Now, he does not have too much choice because \nhe is spending so much money we don't have that he is aggravating the \ndebt.\n  And now, the famous wall of debt chart. It goes up, and goes up \ndramatically, under this budget. We will hear from the other side of \nthe aisle: But the President's budget does the same thing, or it is \neven worse. That is a canard. That is a straw dog. The President does \nnot sign the budget. The President is not part of the budget process \nother than he has an obligation to send a budget up here for the \npurposes of our review, which is, depending on the President, uniformly \nrejected by the party in power.\n  He sends up the budget. He announces what his priorities are. But, \nuniquely, the budget instrument--and this is an important point--is a \nchild of the Congress. It is a child of the Congress. Congress produces \nthe budget. The Senate produces a budget. The House produces a budget. \nIt goes to conference committee. It comes back to the Senate and comes \nback to the House. But do you know what it does not do, as with most \nlaws? It does not go to the President to be signed. He cannot veto a \nbudget. He cannot sign a budget. He simply gets a budget in the form \nthe Congress wants. It is a resolution. It is not a bill.\n  Why is that? Because the Founding Fathers, in their wisdom, and the \npeople who put together the Budget Act--some of whom are still here, \nSenator Byrd and Senator Domenici being two of the key players in that \nin 1976, I think--knew the power of the purse, which is what the budget \nis all about, lies with the Congress. The Congress has the first and \nprimary responsibility on the budget.\n  So when you throw out: Well, but the President did this and the \nPresident did that, you are trying to hide in the weeds. Congress has \nthe responsibility for the budget. It is the Congress which passes the \nresolution that creates the budget, and the President does not sign it \nat all. So it is the Congress you should turn to and say: You are the \nresponsible party here. Are you being responsible? That is the issue: \nAre you being responsible as a Congress? This Congress is not being \nresponsible because the big issues we face as a nation are either being \nfinessed, gamed, ignored, or aggravated under this budget.\n  As I said before, this budget adds $27,000--$27,000--to the debt that \neach child born today has to pay. So if you are having a child or you \njust had a child--I just had a niece this year. She is a wonderful \nlittle girl. She came into the world. She got a $27,000 bill from the \nDemocratic leadership of this Congress--a pretty stiff bill to stick \nher with, a pretty stiff bill to stick any American with who is just \ngetting started. It is not fair at all.\n  Let's get into some specifics about this budget.\n  First is the allegation that there is some sort of disciplining \nmechanisms around here. I take this on first because it is such a fraud \nthat it has to be taken on first. I have heard more Senators on the \nother side of the aisle saying: We are going to use pay-go to \ndiscipline the budget, darn it. When we use pay-go, we limit spending \naround here.\n  ``Pay-go'' is a motherhood term, regrettably. It is a title that has \nbeen put on supposedly a procedure which requires you to pay for new \nspending and to pay when you cut taxes. Well, time and time again, our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, when they were confronted \nwith a choice of actually having to use pay-go--which would have caused \nthem to have to cut spending somewhere in order to increase spending \nsomewhere else--gamed the system. They moved a year here or a year \nthere so they would not be subject to pay-go.\n\n  They cut programs from reasonable funding levels such as SCHIP by 85 \npercent in 1 year, so they would not be confronted--knowing it was \nnever going to happen--so they would not be confronted with pay-go \nenforcement mechanisms. They took the MILC Program and put it in a \nsupplemental bill so they could build it into the base and not be \nsubject to pay-go.\n  Time after time after time--15 different times--they gamed pay-go to \nthe tune of $143 billion. I call it ``Swiss cheese-go.'' I think that \nis a much more truth-in-labeling act. There is no reason we should ever \ncall this thing pay-go again. Let's just call it ``Swiss cheese-go'' \nbecause that is what it is. Whenever it is inconvenient for the \nDemocratic leadership to have to subject themselves to their own \ndiscipline rules, they waive them, game them, or ignore them.\n  The first obligation of a national government is national defense. \nThe most important thing about national defense is to make sure your \nsoldiers\n\n[[Page S1828]]\n\nwho are in the field have the resources they need to do the job we have \nasked them to do. Whether you agree with what they are doing, you \nshould never send a soldier into the field and not support that soldier \nwith everything he or she needs.\n  I understand there is a huge debate, especially on the other side of \nthe aisle, as to whether we should cut the legs out from underneath our \ntroops in Iraq. We all understand that. We voted on it here 43 times in \nthis Congress. But there should be no question that those soldiers need \nthe support as long as they are in the field. It is totally \ninappropriate and a total abrogation of responsibility of the Congress \nnot to support those soldiers in the field.\n  Now, in this exercise, the White House does not come with clean \nhands. I was fairly aggressive in complaining about their decision to \nsend up a request for only $70 billion--which is a lot of money, but \nthat is nowhere near what it is going to cost to keep our soldiers in \nthe field over the next year. To their credit, at least, the people at \nthe Pentagon--Secretary Gates, when confronted with that number, said: \nNo, that is wrong. Even though OMB may have sent it up here in the \nPresident's presentation, it is wrong. We are going to need something \nlike $150 billion to $170 billion, somewhere between $80 billion and \n$100 billion more than they have in the budget.\n  The chairman of the Budget Committee agreed. He said:\n\n       And we know, I think with great certainty, $70 billion is \n     not the right answer for 2009, zero is not the right answer \n     for 2010.\n\n  Those are the two numbers the White House had. And Secretary Gates \nsaid: No, it is not the right answer, when he was asked. He said: It \nhas to be a higher number.\n  So the documentation is pretty clear, even if the White House did not \nsend up the right number, by the time we acted--and remember, once \nagain, it is the Congress that does the budget, not the White House--by \nthe time we acted, we should have put a number in here that adequately \nreflects what our soldiers are going to need to remain safe.\n  Now, even if you oppose this war vehemently, as some do on the other \nside of the aisle--to the point where they are willing to take soldiers \nout next week, which you cannot physically do; we all know it will take \n6 months to a year to get the soldiers out of there--with this number, \nyou cannot get the soldiers back with $70 billion, literally. This \nnumber does not allow you to get the soldiers back.\n  What happens with this number is you are going to have our soldiers \nin the field without ammunition, without resupply, without the \nfacilities they need, and without the equipment they need. This number \nassumes we are going to leave our soldiers in the field unprotected--\nunprotected. It is an inexcusable, irresponsible number to put in the \nbudget simply to make your budget look better. This number should have \nbeen at least $70 billion to $100 billion higher to have an accurate \nbudget.\n  Then the budget moves on. We have heard more about how there are \nuncollected taxes, and if we collect the uncollected taxes, we will \nsolve all our problems. I call it the ``Wizard of Oz'' approach to \nbudgeting. There is somebody behind a curtain somewhere who owes us a \nlot of money. We are going to find that person. We are going to get the \nmoney. That is going to take care of everything. We will all be happy.\n  Last year, they suggested we do this to the tune of $300 billion. \nLast year, they were given the benefit of the doubt. They had never \ndone a budget before, so you have to give them some benefit of the \ndoubt. OK. Let's see how much they got. The chairman of the committee \nagain:\n\n       If we just collect 15 percent of the [tax gap]--\n\n  That is what is referred to--\n\n     that would be over $300 billion. That alone would come close \n     to meeting the revenues needed under our budget resolution.\n\n  That was last year. Do you remember how much they collected last year \nfrom the tax gap? Zero. In fact, they cut in their budget the \ncollection capabilities of the IRS. Not only was the IRS not able to go \nout and collect more money that was owed, they were having trouble \ncollecting what they did get which was owed because their collection \nprocess has been cut.\n  So you would think after such a pathetic performance they would \npresume not to do this again. It would take incredible--I don't know--\nverve to claim one more time that you are going to generate these types \nof revenues. But they do. They do: $300 billion. They are going to get \nit from out there in the virtual land of tax policy. What they got was \nzero--zero.\n  This budget at its essence is a massive tax increase. That is \nessentially what it is. It is a massive tax increase, the purpose of \nwhich is to expand the size of the Federal Government--grow the Federal \nGovernment--and, in my humble opinion, as a result, make it much more \ndifficult for us as a government to produce a positive and strong \neconomy and to give people an opportunity to live lives that are as \naffluent and, hopefully, as successful as prior generations.\n  The amount of tax increase in the bill is $1.2 trillion--the largest \ntax increase in history: $1.2 trillion. Under the assumptions of this \nbudget, every tax goes up to rates which were fairly high and which the \nCongress agreed were too high back in the early 2000s. The marriage \npenalty goes up. The child tax credit goes up. Rates go up. Capital \ngains go up. Dividends go up. The estate tax goes up. They are all \nassumed to go up. AMT is assumed to be continued for every year but \nthis year.\n\n  We have a new chart called the ``Wall of Taxes'' because that is what \nthis budget does. It generates a wall of tax increases, climbing every \nyear as a percentage of GDP. It is important to know it has \nhistorically been the case that we have presumed the Federal Government \nwould take something akin to 18.2 percent of Gross National Product in \ntax revenues. That has been the case since the end of World War II. \nThis budget blows through that number. But equally important, it should \nbe noted that in blowing through that number and adding $1.2 trillion \nin new taxes, it doesn't address the outyear issues which are going to \ncause taxes to go up even higher. The failure to do anything on \nentitlement reform and then use up all the revenues to fund this group \nand that group that you happen to be happy about giving money to for \nthe next election puts you in an even worse position when, hopefully, \nthe Congress gets around someday to addressing the biggest fiscal \npolicy issue, which is entitlement reform.\n  In addition, it needs to be noted this tax increase of $1.2 trillion \nis the beginning. It is the beginning of the Democratic proposals. \nBecause if we listen to their two national candidates for President, in \nthe case of one, they have already offered and put in place over $300 \nbillion--$300 billion of new programs in 1 year. That adds up to \nsomething like $1.2 trillion of additional programs over 5 years. That \nis on top of this number.\n  Now, when Senator Obama makes that representation: I am going to add \n$300 billion of new programs every year, the practical effect is he has \nto pay for it somehow. His claim is he is going to pay for it by taxing \nthe rich. He is going to tax the rich and pay for his--he actually, \nironically, has the same number here: $1.2 trillion of additional \nspending over that 5-year period. Well, if you tax the rich, which \nwould mean you raise the top bracket from 35 percent to 39.6 percent, \nwhich was the bracket under President Clinton, you generate how much \nincome to the Federal Government? Twenty-five billion dollars. Multiply \nthat by 5 years, which is what this number is--the $1.2 trillion \nSenator Obama has suggested we spend in new programs--and you have $225 \nbillion. So he is about $1 trillion short in order to pay for what he \nis suggesting in new programs.\n  But there is another irony. This tax number already assumes that $225 \nbillion. This tax number assumes the rates have been increased to 39.6 \npercent for the top income brackets, with the practical effect of that \nbeing it has already been spent. This budget already spends the money \nand the tax revenues candidate Senator Obama has suggested he is going \nto spend on his new programs. So he doesn't have any money available to \nhim.\n  So now we have a Democratic budget which increases taxes by $1.2 \ntrillion, increases spending dramatically, as I have gone through \nalready, and then you have layered on top of that a national \ncandidate--two national candidates, because Senator Clinton is\n\n[[Page S1829]]\n\nnot far behind Senator Obama in suggesting new programs--who is going \nto add another $1.2 trillion on top. The numbers become staggering. But \nwhat does it all translate into? Huge tax increases on working \nAmericans--huge, absolutely staggering.\n  To try to put this in context, without the Obama tax increases or the \nClinton tax increases, 27 million small businesses in this country, \nunder the Democratic budget, will see their taxes go up $4,100 each per \nyear. Now, you can double that if Senator Obama were to put in all his \nprograms. Eighteen million seniors will see their taxes jump $2,200 \neach because of this budget--$2,200 each. That is a lot of money.\n  Let's try to put that in context. That basically buys groceries for \nmost Americans for, I think it is half a year. It certainly buys a fair \namount of gas, although not as much as we would like because the price \nof gas is so outrageous. It certainly helps with a mortgage payment or \nmaybe a child going to school or helping a grandchild go to school in \nthe case of a senior. But serious money: $2,200. That is what this \nbudget in new taxes is going to cost average seniors in this country.\n  Something else should be pointed out. This budget assumes the capital \ngains and dividend rates are going to go up, and the primary benefit of \ncapital gains and dividend rates flows through senior citizens. As a \npercentage, seniors take more advantage of dividend rates and more \nadvantage of capital gains than any other demographic group. So it is \ndirectly targeted on the tax increase.\n  All of this works out to--for the average American family, there is a \n$2,300 tax increase in this bill, and that doesn't include how much it \nwould be increased if you were to put the Obama or Clinton programmatic \ninitiatives on top of that. It would almost double this number. The \nappetite to raise taxes on the other side of the aisle is unquenchable. \nIt is huge. Let's put it that way. It is unstoppable, it appears. When \nthis budget passes, John Q. Public is going to have to write Uncle Sam \na check for $2,300. That is a pretty expensive experience for the \nAmerican people.\n  What do they get for it? What do they get for it? Let's come back to \nwhat they get for it. Not a lot. Do they get the troops properly \nsupported when they are fighting for us overseas? No. No, they are $100 \nbillion short on that. Do they get entitlement reform that helps us \ndown the road with the pressure that is going to be put on our children \nby the cost of the expansion of the entitlement programs due to the \nretirement of the baby boom generation? No. No, they don't get that. Do \nthey get health care reform? No. There is no health care reform in \nhere. Do they get tax reform? No. There is no tax reform in here. Do \nthey get programmatic initiatives which make sense and which are \npresented in a coherent and orderly manner? Are there programs \neliminated that have maybe been around too long in exchange for adding \nprograms? We have study after study that tells us about programs we can \neliminate. No, not one program is eliminated in this budget--just an \nexpansion. Just add to the base; bump it up another $200 billion over \nthe next 5 years and pass that bill on to our children.\n  Passing the problem on, that is what this budget is. Courageous? \nCreative? Imaginative? Addressing the core issues which we confront as \na nation and which do threaten us, whether it is terrorism, the cost of \nenergy, the cost of the Government, the retirement of the baby boom \ngeneration? These issues are not going away, but you wouldn't know they \neven existed if you looked at this budget. It is a regrettable missed \nopportunity in a very difficult time. It is unfortunate that all it has \nbecome is your classic liberal tax-and-spend initiative.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I wish to welcome back the ranking member \nof the Budget Committee. I have listened with great interest to his \npresentation this morning, a highly imaginative presentation. It is \nhighly imaginative. The presentation he has made that purportedly is \nabout the budget we have offered has virtually nothing to do with the \nbudget that is before us. It is largely a concoction, although I must \nsay when he talks about creativity, I give him high marks for \ncreativity because this is complete make-believe, what we have heard \nfrom the other side, in terms of a description of what is on this \nfloor.\n  Maybe a good place to start is to look at what the Senator said last \nyear about our budget because it is almost identical to what he has \nsaid about this year's budget. He said last year we were going to have \n$1 trillion of tax increases if our budget passed. Well, our budget \npassed, and now we can go check the record. We don't have to have a \nbunch of projections or suggestions about what might happen; we can now \nlook back and see what actually did happen. Last year, the Senator from \nNew Hampshire, the ranking member of the Budget Committee--by the way, \nfor whom I have high regard. We work together very closely. We have \nsubstantive differences, as will become more clear as these days wear \non, but I have high regard for the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  But let's check the record. Did we increase taxes, as he asserted \nwould happen last year, by $1 trillion? No. Did we increase taxes at \nall? No. Did we cut taxes? Yes. How much did the Democratic Congress \ncut taxes? Well, here it is. It is not a projection. This is not make-\nbelieve. This is a fact. The Democratic Congress has cut taxes $194 \nbillion, with $7 billion of revenue raisers. So that is the factual \nrecord with respect to tax cuts. The Democratic Congress cut taxes by \n$194 billion, most of this in the stimulus package passed to give lift \nto the economy.\n  Now, the Senator talks about where we are headed under this budget, \nbut perhaps the best way to anticipate where we are headed is to look \nback and see where we have come from. When they controlled everything--\nthey controlled the House, they controlled the White House, they \ncontrolled the Senate--here is their record. Here is what they did. \nThey started with budget surpluses, and they ran up record deficits. \nYou can see this is the record of the Bush administration: $413 billion \nwas the biggest deficit in the history of the United States. In fact, \nthey have five of the biggest deficits in the history of the United \nStates. That is their record. Revenue was flat. They increased spending \nabout 50 percent, and the result was they have exploded the debt of the \nUnited States. Again, this is not a projection. This is not a forecast. \nThis is their record.\n  Our friends controlled it all. They controlled the White House, they \ncontrolled the Senate of the United States, they controlled the House. \nHere is what happened to the debt. They have built a wall of debt that \nis unprecedented. They took us from a debt at the end of the \nPresident's first year of $5.8 trillion. They have run it up to over $9 \nbillion last year, and by the end of 2009, which will be the 8 years \nthis President is responsible for, they will almost have doubled the \ndebt of the country in 8 years. It is a stunning record, and I don't \nmean stunning in a good way.\n  Now, the Senator from New Hampshire says we have this massive \nincrease in spending. Well, not in this budget. That is not the case. \nHere is a chart that shows the President's spending, which is the red \nline. The green line is the spending under this resolution. This is \nover the 5 years of this budget. You will see that they are very close \nto each other. In fact, the difference in spending over the 5 years \nbetween our budget and the President's budget is 2.1 percent. We have \n2.1 percent more spending than the President's budget. Why? Because we \nhave restored cuts he made in things such as the COPS Program that has \nput 100,000 police officers on the street. The President's budget \neliminates the COPS Program. The President's budget eliminates the \nweatherization program in this country, a program to go back and \nweatherize homes so they are more energy efficient. He says: No, we \ndon't want to do that anymore. The President's budget cuts the grants \nto first responders, our emergency medical personnel, our ambulance \ncrews, and other first responders, including our firefighters, and cuts \nthose by 78 percent. We didn't think that was a good idea.\n  So, yes, we do spend some more. We also spend more to reduce our \ndependence on foreign energy because we think that is a smart \ninvestment. We do spend some more on education because we think that is \ncritical for the\n\n[[Page S1830]]\n\nfuture strength of the country. And we do spend some more money on \ninfrastructure because we don't want any more bridges collapsing, as we \nsaw happen in Minnesota, where the bridge over 35W collapsed with \npeople on it.\n  So, yes, we spend 2 percent more over the 5 years. For this year, the \ntotal spending in the President's budget is $3.04 trillion, and in our \nbudget it is $3.08 trillion. That is a difference of 1 percent.\n  All this great spending the Senator just described--the problem is \nthe facts. The thing that gets in the way of his recitation is the \nfacts. The facts are that we spend 1 percent more than the President in \n2009.\n  The Senator also said we have not been responsible with the troops. \nLet me just indicate that if we have not been responsible, then the \nPresident hasn't been responsible either because we have the identical \namount in our budget for defense and the war as the President had in \nhis budget--identical, not a dime of difference. So if we have been \nirresponsible, then the Senator is saying the President has been \nirresponsible because we match him dollar for dollar.\n  The Senator said something that is quite jarring. Do you remember \nwhat he said about the President's role in the budget? He said the \nPresident doesn't have anything to do with the budget. Really? The \nPresident of the United States has nothing to do with the budget of the \nUnited States? I don't think so. The President sends us a budget. If \nyou look at the historic record, what you find is that Congress gives \nthe President, in the budget, very close to what he asks for. That is \nthe record going back 40 or 50 years.\n  Now, he added to that by saying the President cannot veto or sign a \nbudget. That is true. The way the process works is the President sends \nus his budget, and then a budget is developed by Congress that does not \ngo to the President for his signature or his veto; that is true. But to \nsuggest that the President really doesn't have anything to do with the \nbudget, that is not true.\n  The President sends us his budget blueprint, and then he has the \npower of the veto to enforce all of the provisions that flow from a \nbudget. He can veto any appropriations bill; those are the bills that \nspend money. He can veto any revenue bill; those are the bills that \nraise money. So to suggest the President doesn't have anything to do \nwith the budget is really misleading to people. I think if you just \nthink of it in a commonsense way, of course the President of the United \nStates would have a lot to do with the budget policy of the country. He \nshould have, and he does have. It is true he does not sign the budget \nresolution. He cannot veto it. But he does have the capability to \nenforce its spending and its revenue because he has the power of the \nveto.\n  Let's look at the question of revenues. Again, our colleague said we \nare going to raise taxes a trillion dollars. That is exactly what he \nsaid last year: Democrats are here to raise your taxes a trillion \ndollars. I think he just likes that number. It doesn't matter what \nbudget we present; he says a trillion dollars. I have already shown \nthat what Democrats have done once we have controlled the House and \nSenate was actually reduce taxes by $194 billion. That is our record so \nfar. That is a fact. There is additional revenue in our proposal over \nthe 5 years. You can see the difference. On this chart, our revenue \nline is the green one, and the President's is the red line. You can see \nthey are very close. If you look at the numbers, over the 5 years of \nthis budget, the President has $15.2 trillion in revenue; that is the \nproposal he sent to us. We have $15.6 trillion in revenue. That is a \ndifference of 2.6 percent.\n  I don't know where the Senator comes up with this trillion dollars \nbecause that is not our proposal. Our proposal--when the Baucus \namendment is adopted--is to raise $15.6 trillion, in comparison to the \nPresident's $15.2 trillion, which is a difference of 2.6 percent.\n  Now, the other day the Senator put up a sign that said--he quoted me \nin a ``60 Minutes'' interview saying that the first thing we need is \nmore revenue. That is true, I did say that. They didn't include the \nwhole quote. Here is the whole quote from the transcript. Steve Kroft \nis talking to me, and he is asking me about the head of the General \nAccounting Office, who is warning the country that we are on an \nunsustainable course because of the long-term commitments that have \nbeen made. He says:\n\n       What do you think about David Walker and what he's doing?\n\n  I said:\n\n       I think David Walker is providing an enormous public \n     service.\n\n  Mr. Kroft asked:\n\n       Do you agree with his figures and his projections?\n\n  I said:\n\n       I do. You know, I mean, we could always question the \n     precise nature of this projection or that projection, but \n     that misses the point . . . The larger story that he is \n     telling is exactly correct.\n\n  Mr. Kroft:\n\n       Are most people in Washington aware of how bad it is?\n\n  I said:\n\n       Yes, they know in large measure here, Republicans and \n     Democrats, that we are on a course that doesn't add up.\n\n  This is one place Senator Gregg and I are in complete agreement--that \nwe are on an unsustainable course.\n  Mr. Kroft asked:\n\n       Why doesn't somebody do something about it?\n  My answer:\n\n       Because it's always easier not to, because it's always \n     easier to defer, to kick the can down the road. . . .\n\n  Mr. Kroft asked:\n\n       Do you think taxes ought to be raised?\n\n  My response:\n\n       I believe, first of all, we need more revenue.\n\n  But then the Senator didn't include the next sentence:\n\n       We need to be tough on spending. And we need to reform the \n     entitlement programs. We need to do all of it.\n\n  That was my answer. I believe it is the truth.\n  Not only have I said that, but Senator Gregg has said we need more \nrevenue. Senator Gregg himself said:\n\n       We also know revenues are going to have to go up, if you \n     are going to maintain a stable economy and a productive \n     economy, because of the simple fact that you are going to \n     have this huge generation that has to be paid for.\n\n  He is talking about the baby boom generation.\n  So if we are going to be honest with the American people, we do need \nto be tough on spending, we do need to have more revenue. I have said \nrepeatedly that before we ask for a tax increase from anyone, we ought \nto go after the tax gap, the difference between what is owed and what \nis paid. The Internal Revenue Service says that back in 2001 that gap \nwas over $300 billion in a year. I think it is unfair to the vast \nmajority of us who pay what we owe to allow others to escape.\n  But it doesn't end there. We also have offshore tax havens. Our \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations has indicated that we are \nlosing $100 billion a year to those offshore tax havens. We have had an \nadditional report in the last 2 weeks of more of these tax havens \nproliferating. If you go on the Internet and put in ``offshore tax \nhavens,'' you will get a million hits because there are a lot of con \njobs going on. We ought to shut them down before we ask for a tax \nincrease from anyone.\n  In addition, there are these abusive tax shelters, where some \ncompanies are actually buying European sewer systems and writing them \noff on their books in the United States to lower their taxes and then \nleasing the sewer systems back to the European cities that built them.\n  Mr. President, the Senator also went after the pay-go rule. He calls \nit ``Swiss cheese-go,'' which is humorous, and I always appreciate the \nhumor. But let's give both sides of the story.\n  The pay-go rule says that if you are going to have new mandatory \nspending or tax cuts, they must be offset or must get a supermajority \nvote. This is a means of disciplining the budget process that has \nworked well in the past. We have instituted it.\n  When Senator Gregg was in charge of the Budget Committee, he said \nthis about pay-go when he supported it:\n\n       The second budget discipline, which is paygo, essentially \n     says if you are going to add a new entitlement program, or \n     you are going to cut taxes during a period, especially a \n     period of deficits, you must offset that event so it becomes \n     a budget-neutral event that also lapses. If we do not do \n     this, if we do not put back in place caps and paygo \n     mechanisms, we will have no budget discipline in this \n     Congress and, as a result, we will dramatically aggravate the \n     deficit, which will\n\n[[Page S1831]]\n\n     impact a lot of important issues, but especially Social \n     Security.\n\n  He had it right when he was an advocate for pay-go.\n  We had a strong pay-go rule from 1991 to 2000. We climbed out of the \ndeficit ditch. We produced surpluses. And then our friends came into \npower, and in 2000 they dramatically weakened pay-go, and look what \nhappened. We went right back to an ocean of red ink. We have now put \npay-go back into effect, since the 2004 elections. Let's look at the \nrecord. The number of times pay-go was raised was 13. The number of \ntimes pay-go was waived was zero. Pay-go was raised 13 times and waived \nzero.\n  Pay-go is working. Excluding the AMT legislation that passed last \nyear, the Senate pay-go scorecard has a positive balance of $1.3 \nbillion over 11 years. Every bill sent to the President--other than AMT \nand the stimulus package just passed--has been paid for or more than \npaid for. Pay-go also has significantly produced a deterrent effect. \nAnybody who doubts that should sit in my seat for 1 week and see the \nnumber of times colleagues decide not to offer spending proposals \nbecause of the pay-go rule.\n  On the other side, they have said that there is $143 billion that \nthey claim pay-go has been violated. Let's look at each one of their \nclaims. And I only have 2 minutes left before Senator Stabenow will be \ntaking over.\n  Immigration reform. They claim there is a $30 billion loophole. In \nfact, zero. The immigration reform bill never passed the Senate. \nRemember, the test is what goes to the President of the United States. \nThe bill never went to the President of the United States.\n  The energy bill--the final bill that was sent to the President--was \nmore than paid for. They claim a $4.2 billion shortfall. In fact, it \nwas more than paid for and had a surplus of $52 million.\n  Mental health parity. That bill hasn't yet gone to the President. \nThey are claiming a $2.8 billion shortfall. That bill hasn't gone to \nthe President; it is still in conference. The promise has been made by \nthe conferees that it will comply with pay-go.\n  The prescription drug user fee amendments. The final bill sent to the \nPresident was more than paid for. They are claiming a $200 million \nshortfall. In fact, it was $4 million to the good.\n  The minimum wage increase was fully paid for on a unified basis. They \nclaim a $50 million shortfall. In fact, it was zero.\n  The Water Resources Development Act. The final bill sent to the \nPresident was more than paid for. It passed the Senate on a vote of 81 \nto 12.\n  Other items they have mentioned. The children's health insurance \nreauthorization was more than paid for over 6 and 11 years. They claim \na $45 billion shortfall. In fact, it is a savings of $207 million.\n  The farm bill--more than paid for over 6 and 11 years. By the way, \nthat has not yet gone to the President. They are claiming a $27 million \nshortfall. In fact, there are savings.\n  Higher education reconciliation--more than paid for over 6 and 11 \nyears. They show a $26 billion shortfall. In fact, the savings will \ncontinue to grow in decades beyond the budget window, and over 6 and 11 \nyears that bill is completely paid for.\n  The 2007 supplemental, county payments, payment in lieu of taxes, and \nMILC. They claim a $6.5 billion shortfall.\n  The pay-go rule applies to mandatory spending and revenues, not to \nappropriated accounts. Discretionary is controlled by separate caps.\n  The 2008 budget resolution established a new 60-vote point of order \nto limit changes in mandatory spending on appropriations bills and to \nstrengthen pay-go even further.\n  They call pay-go ``Swiss cheese-go.'' Their pay-go was ``easy \ncheese''--``easy cheese'' because what they allowed under their pay-go \nwas for the debt to explode. No forecast, no projection, just the \nfacts, just the record. They have increased the debt from $5.8 trillion \nto over $9 trillion today, and under the President's proposal, it is \ngoing to go to over $10 trillion. That is the record.\n  We have now reached the 11 o'clock hour. Senator Stabenow is going to \ntake the chair, and there are other Senators awaiting recognition. We \nhave a meeting to try to determine where we go with the rest of the \nday. But I hope we have a good, substantive debate. I look forward to \nit.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Mr. President, Americans have important expectations for \ntheir public servants. They expect us to act for the common good. They \nexpect us to advance our common values. But first and foremost, they \nexpect us to have common sense.\n  Last week's Department of Defense tanker procurement decision raises \nserious questions of common sense.\n  As some of my colleagues have already discussed, the Defense \nDepartment last week awarded a $40 billion contract for a new \ngeneration of Air Force tanker aircraft to the European Aeronautic \nDefense and Space Company, or EADS, the parent company of Airbus.\n  Receiving this major contract is an enormous victory for the European \ncompany. It is a victory for thousands of French, German, and Spanish \nAirbus workers this contract will employ. It is also a victory for U.S. \ncontractors who will work on the project. Yet I have serious questions \nabout whether this is a victory for good American policy or American \ncommon sense.\n  My concern for this deal is not over the Defense Department's \nprocurements. I leave that to my colleagues on the Appropriations \nCommittee. I do not question the merits of one tanker plane over \nanother. I leave that to my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee. \nBut I certainly am concerned and have serious questions about this deal \nfrom the perspective of international trade. This responsibility falls \nto me as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.\n  The United States values competition and acknowledges the right of \nforeign companies, such as EADS's subsidiary Airbus, to pursue American \nmarkets and customers. American consumers, including the Federal \nGovernment, should have the right to buy the product that best suits \ntheir needs. That is only fair.\n  But Airbus is not just another company competing in open markets on \nthe merits of its products. It is not just a commercial venture. \nRather, Airbus is the product of four decades of explicit government-\nindustrial policies to create a European aircraft industry, an industry \ndesigned not just to compete with American companies but to defeat them \nwith massive government funding. Don't take my word for it. Former \nFrench Prime Minister Lionel Jospin himself publicly pledged:\n\n       We will give Airbus the means to win the battle against \n     Boeing.\n\n  True to Mr. Jospin's promise, decade after decade, project after \nproject, European governments have injected massive amounts of \nsubsidies into Airbus, including $15 billion in launch aid.\n  These subsidies underwrote between 60 percent and 100 percent of \nAirbus's commercial aircraft development costs, including the A330 \naircraft on which this tanker aircraft is based.\n  These subsidies allowed Airbus to develop aircraft under terms \nunavailable to unsubsidized market participants or, as a former British \nTrade and Industry Secretary boasted:\n\n       We are not standing to one side and leaving everything to \n     the market. . . .\n\n  In fact, European subsidization of Airbus was so extreme and so \nanticompetitive that 3 years ago, the U.S. Trade Representative \ninitiated a dispute settlement case in the World Trade Organization. \nThe USTR does not file these cases frivolously. They do so when the \ndamage is real, the case solid, and all other means of resolution have \nfailed.\n  This case is still ongoing. A WTO panel is currently weighing the \nfacts of the case, the effects of these subsidies on our aerospace \nindustry, and the compatibility of these subsidies with international \ntrade laws.\n  What defies common sense to me is that one arm of the administration,\n\n[[Page S1832]]\n\nthe U.S. Trade Representative, argues subsidies to Airbus hurt our \ncompanies, skew global markets, and violate the rules of the game. Yet \nanother arm of the administration, the Defense Department, rewards a \nsubsidized company with a $40 billion contract to purchase illegally \nsubsidized aircraft.\n  That is the kind of Government decisionmaking that does not add up. \nIt is not common sense, and it raises serious and fundamental questions \nabout how this administration goes about its business.\n  Does the right hand of the Government know what the left hand is \ndoing? Does one agency respect international rules and their effect \nwhile the other one does not? What was USTR's role in this procurement \ndecision? And why did the Defense Department appear to have disregarded \nit? These and other questions need answers, and I look forward to \npursuing these answers with my colleagues.\n  Until we hear a full accounting of this issue, I am left with an \nuneasy feeling that last week's decision by the Defense Department does \nlittle for the common good or common sense.\n  Mr. President, I wish now to speak on an amendment I am going to \noffer when we get to the budget resolution. I will offer the amendment \nwhen we are on the resolution. I can either make my statement now or \nwait until we get to the resolution.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. Con. Res. 70, which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 70) setting forth the \n     congressional budget for the United States Government for \n     fiscal year 2009 and including the appropriate budgetary \n     levels for fiscal years 2008 and 2010 through 2013.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the budget resolution \nand about an amendment I will offer when that amendment is in order. As \nI understand, that will be after the luncheon hour.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the author and poet, Cervantes, had a \ncharacter say:\n\n       My wages . . . I have earned with the sweat of my brows.\n\n  And so it is with America's hard-working families. They have earned \ntheir wages with the sweat of their brows. This afternoon, along with a \nnumber of other Senators, I intend to offer an amendment that would \ntake the surplus in the budget resolution and give it back to hard-\nworking American families who earned it.\n  First, our amendment makes the 10-percent tax bracket permanent. That \nis a tax cut for all taxpayers.\n  Second, we are making permanent changes to the child tax credit. That \nis a $1,000 tax credit per child. This tax credit recognizes that a \nfamily's ability to pay taxes decreases as their family size increases. \nUnless we act, the child tax credit will fall to $500 per child in \n2010.\n  We are making permanent the marriage penalty relief. Couples should \nnot pay more taxes because they are married. This relief makes sure a \nmarried couple filing a joint return has the same deductions and tax \nbrackets as they would if they filed as individuals.\n  We are making permanent the changes to the dependent care credit. \nThis credit is important to working families. It recognizes the \nincreased cost of child care for thousands of Americans, especially \nchild care for households where both parents work outside the home.\n  We are making permanent the changes to the adoption credit. Most \nadoptions cost more than $20,000. This provision offers a credit of \n$10,000 for those willing to give a child a home.\n  This amendment is also important because in it we believe it is \nimportant to pause and reflect on the sacrifices our men and women in \nuniform make for us every day.\n  Nearly 1.5 million U.S. service men and women have served in Iraq, \nAfghanistan or both. Nearly 30,000 troops have been wounded in action.\n  In September, I went to Iraq. I was impressed by what an amazing job \nour troops are doing. It is astounding. I met many Montanans from small \ntowns such as Roundup and Townsend. I saw firsthand what a heavy burden \nour troops bear for all of us. They face hardships, they face danger, \nbut they keep at it every day. Today, one small way to support them is \nto make the Tax Code a little more troop friendly. We can extend the \nspecial tax rules that make sense for our military that expire in 2007 \nand 2008. We can also eliminate roadblocks in the current tax laws that \npresent difficulties to veterans and servicemembers.\n  One problem this amendment would address is how the Tax Code treats \nsurvivors of our fallen heroes. The families of soldiers killed in the \nline of duty receive a death gratuity benefit of $100,000. But the Tax \nCode restricts survivors from putting this benefit in a Roth IRA. \nToday, we can make sure family members of fallen soldiers can take \nadvantage of these tax-favored accounts. Another hazard in the tax laws \nimpedes our disabled veterans. I am thinking of the time limit for \nfiling for a tax refund. Most VA disability claims filed by veterans \nare quickly resolved, but many disability awards are delayed due to \nlost paperwork or the appeals of rejected claims.\n  Once a disabled vet finally gets a favorable award, the good news is \nthe disability award is tax free, but the bad news is many of these \ndisabled veterans get ambushed by a statute that bars them from filing \na tax refund claim. Today we can give disabled veterans an extra year \nto claim their tax refunds.\n  Most troops doing the heavy lifting in combat situations are the \nlower ranking, lower income soldiers. Their income needs to count \ntoward computing the earned-income tax credit, or EITC. Under current \nlaw, however, income earned by a soldier in a combat zone is exempt \nfrom income tax. This actually hurts low-income military personnel \nunder the EITC.\n  The EITC combat pay exception allows combat zone pay to count as \nearned income for purposes of determining the credit. That way, more \nsoldiers qualify for EITC. But this EITC combat pay exception expired \nat the end of 2007.\n  The EITC is a beneficial tax provision for working parents. It makes \nno sense to deny it to our troops. Today we can help to make combat \nduty income count for EITC purposes.\n  In this amendment, we are making permanent provisions to allow combat \npay as earned income for purposes of the EITC. This amendment allows \nhard-working, low-income military personnel to get the full benefit of \nthe EITC.\n  A soldier's rucksack is heavy enough as it is without loading it down \nwith tax burdens. We owe the soldiers fighting in our Armed Forces an \nenormous debt of gratitude. This amendment is one small way we can \nsalute our men and women in uniform for all they do.\n  Also in this amendment, we are giving some certainty to American \nfamilies on the estate tax. Lowering the estate tax to 2009 levels is \nthe least we can do as we move toward estate tax reform. This is the \nminimum that we can and will achieve.\n  And we are committed to exploring what more we can do. We are \nconducting thorough studies of the issue in hearings on that subject \nthis week.\n  I plan to offer a second amendment that would dedicate enough \nadditional funds to estate tax reform that we can achieve a $5 million \nexemption and a 35-percent rate.\n  Through these efforts, Congress will show that we support America's \nsmall businesses, ranchers, and farmers. Today's amendment also helps \nto address the housing crisis. Our amendment would allow middle-income \ntaxpayers who do not itemize their deductions to nonetheless get a tax \ndeduction for property taxes. That would give some relief to hard-\nstrapped homeowners.\n  Now, this amendment will not do everything. But we will do more. As\n\n[[Page S1833]]\n\nchairman of the Finance Committee, I am fully committed to tax reform. \nTax reform can mean giving tax relief to American families and \nbusinesses through simplification and sound tax policy.\n  This year, the Finance Committee will do the spade work. We will hold \nhearings and prepare for the fundamental tax reform that we all want \nand expect next year, so when the next President takes office, he or \nshe will make a major recommendation to the Congress on tax reform. We \nare holding hearings on that so we are ready.\n  But today the amendment we will offer shows our commitment to \nAmerican families. American families earned their wages with the sweat \nof their brows. This amendment takes the surplus and gives tax relief \nto those hard-working families. It is no less than what they have \nearned.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the Senate budget \nresolution. This is going to be considered for an entire week. It does \nprovide the American people with Congress's blueprint for spending and \nfiscal policies and priorities. And while not binding, it does \nestablish the direction for later consideration of our appropriations \nbills.\n  I, like many of my colleagues, have been reviewing the chairman's \nmark that came out of committee and the results from last week's \nmarkup. I am impressed with parts of this budget. There are some \npriorities in here that I share with the chairman and the committee. It \nfully funds the defense budget. It fully funds NASA, including the \nadditional $1 billion that Senator Mikulski and I sought last year to \nreimburse the agency for the Columbia disaster, because we know NASA \nhas been pulling from operating funds to repair the damage done from \nthe Columbia disaster, and this has kept it from keeping up its \nresearch commitment.\n  We cannot have an agency that is supposed to be doing the state-of-\nthe-art research and pushing the envelope not only in aeronautics but \nin science and medicine. Yet we have a billion-dollar shortfall taken \nfrom the research that could fuel scientists for years to come.\n  It funds the America COMPETES Act, which improves education, and that \nis such an important priority for us to remain competitive. We need \nmore of our young people to go into science and engineering, the \nphysical sciences, the hard sciences.\n  We are losing our edge in this global marketplace. Congress, in a \nbipartisan way, did pass the America COMPETES Act, and there is funding \nfor much of that in this bill.\n  We must extend the sales tax deduction, which is a provision that is \nclose to my heart because my State and seven others have a sales tax \nbut no State income tax. So we believe it is a matter of equity that \nsales taxes be deductible, rather than just the State income taxes \nwhich is available to all of the other States but not available to the \nseven States that do not choose to fund their Government with an income \ntax.\n  These parts of the budget deserve our attention and support. However, \nthis budget has a major flaw. Before long the budget had increased $22 \nbillion above the President's request. We have now found that over the \nperiod of time that it has languished in the Senate committee, we are \nnow looking at what appears to be a ballooning of that increase in \nspending. Yet the budget projects a surplus of $177 billion in 2012, \n$160 billion in 2013, and yet the budget has increased by $210 billion \nover 5 years.\n  Now, how can we have this increase in spending and yet still have \nsurpluses? My economics 101 tells me there has to be a catch because we \nknow there is no free lunch. So in addition to the large spending \nincreases, the budget includes the largest tax increase in the history \nof America, $1.2 trillion. The budget allows the incredibly beneficial \ntax cuts from 2001 and 2003 to expire.\n  Now, these are the tax cuts that spurred our economy and created \nmillions of new jobs in our country. It spurred the growth in our \neconomy. When these tax provisions expire, 43 million families with \nchildren will have to pay an average of $2,300 more each year, and 18 \nmillion senior citizens will owe $2,200 more on average. Twenty-seven \nmillion small businesses, the engine of economic growth in America, \nwill owe $4,100 more in taxes on average. Almost 8 million low-income \nworkers will be added back to the tax rolls.\n  Especially during this time of economic uncertainty, why would we ask \nour fellow citizens to pay more and rob the jobs that have been created \nwith the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003?\n  The first thing we did when we saw the slowing economy was, on a \nbipartisan basis, have an economic stimulus package. And what was the \ncrux of the stimulus package? It was to give money back to the people \nwho have paid taxes in rebates to help spur the economy. So why would \nwe turn around in this budget and increase taxes and ask the people to \nwhom we just gave rebates, that will be in the mail in the next 6 \nweeks, to pay more?\n\n  Consider what a $2,300 tax burden would pay if the average American \nfamily could keep the money they earned in that amount: groceries for \nabout 8 months, health care expenses for about a year, electricity and \nhome heating oil for about a year, and gasoline for the car that we \nknow is now rising as we speak.\n  How can we consider taking money away from families when we are \nseeing the strain of this economy be a burden on those same families? \nThis budget makes great promises for American families, but it also \npulls the rug out from under them by saying: Here is the burden we are \ngoing to give to you to pay for this big Government spending budget.\n  So I hope as we consider the budget this week that we will take a \nserious look at keeping some of the major priorities, but having the \ngood sense to cut in other places or to remain steady in other places \nwhere there is not the essential need right now. We do need a budget \nthat looks out and says for the long-term competitiveness and vitality \nof our country and our society and our work concerns and our work \nforce: We do need to spur investment. We need to spur research. We need \nto have more engineers and scientists graduating from our universities, \nand we can do that by funding NASA fully, by funding the American \nCOMPETES Act. We must do that for the long term. But why not do what \nevery family in America does when we have essential needs for long-term \nplanning, but we are on a limited budget and we want to bring down that \ndeficit? And that is, make choices.\n  Can we not come together and make choices just as we came together \nfor the stimulus package? The last thing we want to do, since we did \npass a bipartisan stimulus package which the President's supported, is \nto wipe it all out and say: Well, we are going to give you back a \nlittle bit but we are going to take more. We are going to take more at \na time when we know America is a little jittery about the economic \ncondition and looking to the future of the economy and our country.\n  I hope we will do what we can on a bipartisan basis and hash out what \nthe priorities are and that we can have the priorities in spending \nwithout the ballooning budget and the tax increases they propose to pay \nfor this ballooning budget.\n  We do not need tax increases. We need to make the tax cuts permanent \nthat have helped so many people get back to work, get on their feet, \nsmall businesses make investments, and keep our economy going when this \nhome mortgage crisis is trying to sort itself out.\n  Unless we can make some major changes in this budget, I cannot \nimagine supporting it. But we do have time. We do have time to do the \nright thing. I am hoping we go through the amendment process, that we \nmake the choices that will take the taxes out, will put the priorities \nin, and will get our 10-year plan started that will create jobs, that \nwill create more opportunities for scientists and engineers to graduate \nfrom our colleges and universities and have good careers, solid \ncareers, because we have made the right investments in 2008.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, in a moment I am going to yield to \nSenator\n\n[[Page S1834]]\n\nWhitehouse, but I do want to respond for a moment because what my \nfriend from Texas is talking about, frankly, in terms of focusing on \nmiddle-class families, is exactly what this budget does. It will be \nenhanced by the Baucus amendment, that takes surplus dollars that are \nin the budget and targets them right back to middle-class families, \nputting dollars into their pockets in terms of extending the middle-\nclass tax cuts that we all support.\n  But we also do more than that. We focus on jobs. We focus on health \ncare, investing in education and opportunity for the future. We are not \nmore of the same. This budget resolution is not more of the same of \nwhat has been occurring since 2001, in the last 8 years, particularly 6 \nyears of that when we have seen our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle and the White House basically controlling all of the agenda in \nterms of the priorities in the budget and spending and so on.\n  We create a budget that offers a change, a set of priorities based on \nthe values that are important to the American people, American \nfamilies, American jobs here, investing here. Let me first say, \noverall, we have a situation where basically we have seen, under this \nPresident, more debt, more tax cuts for the wealthy, more spending in \nIraq, less investment in America. That is what we have seen.\n  In listening to the outline of what I understand will be a Republican \nbudget alternative that will be presented this week, it is more of the \nsame. It is more of the same. We want to reduce that and balance the \nbudget by 2012, focus tax cuts on middle-income workers, hard-working \nAmericans who have not seen tax relief or investments in their future \nand in their children's future.\n  We want to refocus. Instead of talking about the spending in Iraq, we \nwant to be focused on spending at home. We have somewhere near $12 \nbillion to $15 billion a month being spent right now in Iraq. Even \nthough we know the Iraqi Government is receiving dollars in oil \nrevenues, we continue to be the ones investing in rebuilding their \ncommunities and their jobs, their infrastructure.\n  Our budget invests in America--American jobs, American families, \nAmerican communities. I am hopeful we will see a strong vote for the \nbudget resolution we are presenting.\n  I now yield up to 30 minutes to my friend and colleague from Rhode \nIsland, Senator Whitehouse.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I salute the leadership and the energy \nof the Senator from Michigan in this area. The Senator is clearly \npassionate about the economic issues we see across the country but \nthose that particularly affect her State. There is not a person in this \nbody who is not aware of how deeply she cares and how hard she fights \nfor the people of Michigan. I am pleased to join her on the floor.\n  Last month we received the President's budget request for fiscal year \n2009. I am a member, like Senator Stabenow, of the Budget Committee. \nThis is the last budget we will receive from President Bush, and I \nthink it is an opportune time to look at how this administration's \npolicies have affected our economic circumstances and how average \nAmericans will suffer as a result.\n  The Bush policies have generated what deserves to be known as and \nwhat I will call today, ``the Bush Debt,'' a legacy of indebtedness \nthat will burden our children and grandchildren for generations to come \nand cost us the opportunity to help millions of Americans all over this \ncountry lead lives of promise, prosperity, and happiness. As I have \ntraveled across my State, Rhode Islanders have told me over and over \ntheir stories about struggling to make ends meet--from seniors \nstretching fixed incomes to pay for prescription drugs and housing to \nworking families trying to heat their homes and send their children to \ncollege. Yet President Bush in his budget for fiscal year 2009 has \nproposed deep cuts to Medicare, deep cuts to home heating assistance \nfor low-income families, and deep cuts to Federal student aid, \nweakening access to citizens' basic needs.\n  The administration cites the need for fiscal discipline. The \nPresident says discipline is necessary to address our Nation's growing \nbudget deficits. What the President does not say--and probably never \nwill say--is that his own ill- advised, misguided policies created \nthose record deficits. It did not have to end this way. But it did, and \nthe President must bear the responsibility.\n  Seven years ago this January, George Bush stood on the western steps \nof this hallowed building and took his oath of office as President of \nthe United States. In his first address to the Nation, George Bush \npledged to call for responsibility and try to live it as well. After a \ndivisive election, many Americans found comfort and hope in those \nwords. On the budgetary front there was good reason for optimism on \nthat cold January morning. After decades of deficit spending, \nbipartisan cooperation between President Clinton and a Republican \nCongress had set the Nation on its healthiest fiscal path in \ngenerations. After 28 straight years of multibillion dollar budget \ndeficits, our Nation saw surpluses beginning in 1998. In President \nClinton's last full year in office, we saw the largest budget surplus \nin our Nation's history--$236 billion.\n  The good budgetary news wasn't behind us. The month George Bush moved \ninto 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the Congressional Budget Office, the \nnonpartisan accounting arm of Congress, projected we would see \nsurpluses straight through the decade. These budget surpluses, the \nproduct of responsible governing--some might even say fiscally \nconservative governing--were projected to be enough to completely wipe \nout our national debt by 2009. Let me say that again: to completely \nwipe out our national debt by 2009. In other words, the hard work had \nbeen done. If President Bush had stayed the course of fiscal \nresponsibility, he could have been the first President of the United \nStates since Andrew Jackson in 1836 to govern a debt-free United \nStates, an America with the power and the freedom to support its people \nas they sought new opportunities and new frontiers. Imagine that.\n  This President's fiscal year 2009 budget, instead of including debt \nservice payments, could have requested significant funds for Pell \ngrants, for LIHEAP, the badly needed overhaul of our health care \nsystem, bridge construction, investment in small and environmentally \nfriendly business, and countless other valuable programs for ordinary \nAmericans.\n  When President Bush took office, leading economists were debating the \nconsequences of this great Nation debt free, standing tall in the world \nwith no claim on it by foreign powers. But this President made a \ndifferent choice. Instead of keeping our Nation on the path to economic \nsecurity and prosperity, to new investments in our health care system, \nstudents, seniors, and veterans, the President who called for \nresponsibility squandered away the surpluses he inherited, mortgaged \nour children and grandchildren's futures, and compromised the quality \nof working Americans' lives.\n  How can we measure the magnitude of the harm done to our economy and \nour people by this administration's decision to deviate from the \nresponsible policies of President Clinton?\n  The first chart shows the budget plans of President Clinton as he \nleft office and the budget formulated by President Bush. As you can \nsee, the Clinton line, represented in blue, based on his levels of \ntaxation and spending, has budget surpluses for every single year of \nthis decade. In contrast, the Bush budget line, represented in red, has \ndeep record-setting deficits in every year after 2001.\n  This next chart illustrates the value of the differences between the \nbudget landscape planned by President Clinton and the one created by \nPresident Bush. As we can see, the difference between the two is a \nstaggering $7.7 trillion. This number represents the fiscal harm \nPresident Bush has inflicted on our Nation. This number is ``the Bush \nDebt.'' It consists of a decade of foregone surpluses and new \nborrowing, much of it from foreign nations such as China, Japan, and \nSaudi Arabia. We have even become a debtor nation to Mexico.\n  Mr. President, $7.7 trillion is more than double the amount of public \ndebt when President Bush took office. Like most concepts of enormous \nsize, this amount takes some thought to comprehend: $7.7 trillion is \n$25,000 owed by every adult or child in the United States, squandered \nsurpluses and new debt created by this President.\n\n[[Page S1835]]\n\n  How did we move from the path of surpluses away from the promise of \nwiping out our national debt to trillions of dollars in new national \nliabilities? One would hope this administration could at least justify \nthe Bush Debt by pointing to borrowing policies that improved average \nAmericans' lives. Unfortunately, nothing could be further from the \ntruth. Rather, this dramatic change of course stems largely from two of \nthis President's many poor decisions over the past 7 years: first, tax \ncuts that overwhelmingly benefited the wealthy at the expense of the \nless fortunate and, second, the President's endless, misguided, unpaid \nwar in Iraq. In the same inaugural address in which he called for \nresponsibility, President Bush vowed to reduce taxes, even though the \nAmerican economy was booming in the 1990s, under tax levels set by \nPresident Clinton which were low by both historical and international \nstandards.\n  The irony, of course, is that President Bush's tax cuts of 2001 and \n2003 were the height of irresponsibility. Because these massive tax \ncuts were predominantly directed at high-income families rather than \nlow-income families, many Americans most in need of assistance were \nshortchanged. These extravagant tax cuts are weighted heavily toward \nthe wealthiest Americans. In fact, 71 percent of the value of the tax \ncuts in 2009 will go to the wealthiest fifth of Americans, with a \nstaggering 28 percent of the value of the tax cuts going to the top 1 \npercent and almost nothing at all going to the lowest earning fifth, \nfamilies who earn $15,000 a year or less. This is George Bush's idea of \nfair tax cuts. And President Bush's insistence on forcing through these \ncuts without making up for the lost revenue, to defer that pain to \nlater administrations and later years, was not only cowardly \nleadership, but it left our budget in precarious straits. The Bush tax \ncuts cost a staggering $1.9 trillion and account for 25 percent of the \n$7.7 trillion Bush Debt measured from the start of the Bush presidency \nthrough 2010, when the tax cuts are set to expire.\n  Every American knows the importance of balancing his or her own \nhousehold budget. Every American knows the struggle of keeping spending \nin line with income, making sure there is enough money to pay for \nclothing, food, home heating, college tuition, and maybe a little for \nvacation or going out to the movies. Most Americans do a good job of \nbalancing budgets but not President Bush. Rather than living by his \ninaugural pledge of responsibility, President Bush preferred to score \npolitical points by delivering massive tax cuts to his wealthiest \nsupporters. He chose not to remain on a responsible fiscal path and \ninstead put this country under the crushing burden of a multitrillion-\ndollar debt, the Bush Debt.\n  These tax cuts, while a large slice of the Bush Debt pie, are \nunfortunately not the whole story. There is also a large spending \ncomponent to the Bush Debt, driven principally by the war in Iraq. By \nthe end of this year, the price tag for the war in Iraq will have \nexceeded $600 billion. Even if we are successful in pressuring this \nPresident or the next President to begin redeploying our troops, \nAmerican taxpayers will still have spent at least $740 billion on this \nmisguided war by 2010.\n  Even if the next President gets us quickly out of Iraq, as I hope she \nor he will, we will be paying costs related to this war for years to \ncome. We must care for our veterans and for the families of fallen \nsoldiers. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the cost of \nmedical care, disability payments, and compensation for the families of \nfallen soldiers will cost between $10 billion and $13 billion in the \nnext 10 years alone. We have a moral obligation to take care of the \nbrave men and women who sacrificed their youth, health, limbs, and \nsometimes their lives to serve their Nation. These are costs, however, \nthat we need never have had to bear. While they pale in comparison to \nthe personal cost incurred by service members and their families, these \nmonetary costs are nonetheless significant, and they will affect \nAmerica's security for decades to come.\n  Like all debt, the Bush Debt requires interest payments. Every day \nAmericans make interest payments on mortgages, car loans, student \nloans, or credit cards. According to President Bush's proposed budget \nfor fiscal year 2009, next year alone, America will owe $260 billion in \ninterest on the Bush Debt. Two hundred sixty billion in interest \npayments equates to $857 to our creditors in Japan, China, and Saudi \nArabia for every man, woman, and child in the United States, next year \nand the year after that and long into the future.\n  To make matters worse, if you can believe this--hold on to your hat--\nthe Bush administration is borrowing the money to make the interest \npayments, further adding to the debt. Imagine if we could take the $7.7 \ntrillion Bush Debt off budget and set up a separate revenue system to \nmake the interest payments--to feed the beast. Then every taxpayer \nwould see we are doing something about this unprecedented debt. We \nshould consider forming a commission, a Bush Debt repayment authority, \nto study the possibility of bringing the Bush Debt off the budget to \nshow the American people how much this President has cost them, to pay \nthe Bush Debt down responsibly over time, the way Government often \nsteps in to pay down a disaster debt responsibly over time, and to show \nour children and grandchildren that we were not all cowards pushing our \ncosts onto them.\n  This enormous interest payment isn't an abstract idea dreamed up by \neconomists. This $260 billion is precious cash flow that could \notherwise be spent improving our health care system, building new \nschools, repairing our roads and bridges, or helping our businesses \ncompete against foreign competition.\n  Individual Americans may not be writing $857 checks to Japan or China \nor Saudi Arabia, but each one of us pays a steep price for the Bush \ndebt--a price that is already evident in the President's budget for \nthis year.\n  The budget request that included $260 billion for interest payments \nalso included tough talk about belt tightening. The President proposes \nto hold discretionary spending growth to 1 percent--effectively a cut \nsince the consumer price index grew 4.1 percent last year.\n  His budget plan slashed funds for low-income heating assistance; the \nCOPS Program, which keeps police officers on the beat to protect local \ncommunities; Federal student aid programs, which help young people \nafford a college education; and community development grants, which \nprovide badly needed assistance for low-income families and small \nbusinesses. The President's budget also calls for tremendous cuts in \nMedicare and Medicaid over the next 5 years--cuts that would surely \naffect medical care for American families.\n  President Bush is asking for more money to continue his misguided war \nin Iraq, more money to service the debt he created, and more money to \npay for tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, but less money to help \nthe millions of people all across this country who need health \ninsurance or food for their families or better schools for their \nchildren or a home they can afford. Those are not the correct \npriorities for America, President Bush.\n  What if President Bush had never cut rich Americans' taxes or taken \nus to war in Iraq? What if the fiscally responsible policies of the \nClinton administration had continued to the present day? What if our \npublic debt had been paid entirely by the end of next year, leaving us \nfree to invest in our people and our future? What if there were no $7.7 \ntrillion Bush debt and no $260 billion in interest payments next year? \nWhat could this country--the land of opportunity and possibility--be \ndoing with an extra $260 billion a year?\n  Well, for just $5 billion--or 2 percent of the interest cost of the \nBush debt in 2009--we could provide health insurance to 3.8 million \nmore children through the Children's Health Insurance Program--the very \ninitiative President Bush vetoed last year. Actually, according to the \nKaiser Family Foundation, we could provide health insurance to every \nuninsured American--adults and children--for $173 billion. So well \nwithin the amount of money we will need to spend next year to service \nthe Bush debt, we could completely cover every American with quality \nhealth care.\n  There are many other worthy programs we could fund with the remainder \nof the $260 billion interest payment. Our Head Start Program, which\n\n[[Page S1836]]\n\nhelps prepare preschool-age children from low-income families to \nsucceed in kindergarten and beyond, currently has barely enough \nresources to cover half of the 2 million children who are eligible. The \nremaining 1 million children could be covered for an additional $7 \nbillion.\n  Pell grants, named after my distinguished Senator from Rhode Island, \nClaiborne Pell, help college students afford the steep costs of their \neducation. We made progress last year in increasing funding for the \nPell Grant Program, but Pell grants only fund a small fraction of \ntuition for many students. It used to fund about half of the tuition. \nIt has slipped to less than a third today. We could double every single \nPell grant next year, raising the maximum grant to over $8,400, for $18 \nbillion.\n  With the remaining $62 billion in our ``world without Bush,'' we \ncould bring up to code 95 percent of the structurally deficient and \nfunctionally obsolete bridges in the country, with all the work and \njobs that would entail. My home State of Rhode Island has the unhappy \ndistinction of having the highest percentage of structurally deficient \nbridges in the country. But following the tragic bridge collapse in \nMinneapolis last year, there is a renewed awareness of the urgency of \nupdating our national transportation infrastructure. That $62 billion \ncovers 95 percent of our Nation's deficient bridges and funds those \nrepairs in fiscal year 2009. What about the other 5 percent? Well, we \nwill have another $280 billion in Bush debt interest payments coming up \nin 2010. We could spend it--if we could--to fix those bridges.\n  Another year of tragic lost opportunities. We will make annual \ninterest payments of this magnitude until a future President takes on \nthe daunting challenge of paying down the principle of the national \ndebt left for us by President Bush.\n  Well, that is quite a list: cover every uninsured American with \nhealth insurance, fully fund the Head Start Program, double each and \nevery Pell grant, and repair our deficient bridges. Sadly, we do none \nof that. We use that money to pay the interest on the Bush debt. We \nwill be making payments for the Bush debt for decades into the future.\n  An often ignored yet critical aspect of the Bush debt is the effect \ninterest payments have on our national security--the very interest the \nadministration purports to be advancing through its misguided war in \nIraq. This chart illustrates the point.\n  To service the Bush debt, we have borrowed more money from \nforeigners, more money from other nations, such as China, Japan, and \nSaudi Arabia, under George Bush than under all 42 of his predecessors \ncombined. The result of this foreign borrowing is that a large portion \nof the interest payments we make gets sent overseas, supplementing the \nincome of foreigners and allowing foreign nations to invest in their \neconomies and infrastructures. If not for the Bush debt, that money \ncould be invested here at home, helping to grow American businesses and \ngenerate income and strength for our own future generations. Instead, \nthe Bush debt has helped, and will continue to help, boost the Chinese \neconomy at the cost of our own. The Bush debt will send trillions of \ndollars to foreign nations over the coming years, giving them even more \ndollars to buy up our American businesses.\n\n  When the Presidency of George W. Bush comes to its long-anticipated \nend on January 20, 2009, it will leave in its destructive wake \ntrillions of dollars in debt owed to other nations, many of which do \nnot have America's best interests at heart. This administration will \nleave behind an America whose standing in the world and whose regard \namong its fellow nations has been weakened and degraded by a war that \nseems to have no end--a fiscally weakened nation, a borrower, with a \nfalling economy, struggling under the Bush debt.\n  Worst of all, this President will leave behind millions of Americans \nwho, had this administration merely stayed the course of fiscal \nresponsibility chartered by President Clinton, would be far better off \nthan they are today. They would be, starting in 2009, in a debt-free \nUnited States that could afford to assist working families with the \ncosts of a college education, to overhaul our health care system, to \nrepair our crumbling infrastructure, to invest in small and green \nbusinesses, and to improve the lives of average Americans in countless \nother ways.\n  We cannot ignore the Bush debt. While George Bush starts packing for \nhis retirement on his Texas ranch, those of us who care about the \nfuture of our Nation--the future of our children--must work toward \nundoing the damage this President has done.\n  Mr. President, I submit that we need to see the Bush debt as a \nserious national problem, a fiscal, economic, and national security \nthreat, and engage in a solemn and serious way, as the trustees of our \nnational welfare, to confront the Bush debt.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I believe I am scheduled to give a speech \nfor about 10 minutes or so.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I spoke last week in the Budget Committee, \nof which I am a member, about the differences between this year's \nconsideration of the budget resolution and last year's.\n  Last year, we were obligated to accept the assurances from the \nmajority that under their new regime pay-go would be respected, \nspending would be curbed, the entitlement crises would be addressed, \nand the debt would be attacked.\n  I do want to take a moment to respond to the attempt of my colleague \nfrom Rhode Island--who just left the floor--about trying to say this is \nall President Bush's problem. It is not. It is all of our problem. For \nexample, the budget we have before us has over $2 trillion that it adds \nto the national debt. There are some basic reforms we have to do if we \nare going to correct the debt problem that has been accruing over the \nyears. We have to reform entitlements especially.\n  We now, however, have results in this budget, not predictions. When \nall was said and done last year, there was an $83 billion increase in \ndiscretionary spending. There was $143 billion in pay-go violations. We \ndid not close the tax gap. We added to the debt. We did nothing for \nentitlement reform. Reconciliation was used to add spending, not reduce \nit. Reconciliation was originally put in for that sole purpose: to \nreduce spending. We assumed tax increases.\n  So as we begin consideration of the fiscal year 2009 budget \nresolution, I hope everyone is aware of what was promised last year and \nwhat transpired. I hope they will use that knowledge when considering \nthis budget document.\n  I would like to talk about the items that concern me in this budget. \nNow that our economy is trending in the wrong direction, and when we \nreally need the benefits of a reasonable and progrowth tax policy, we \nare going to depress our economic growth by adding to the debt and \nincreasing taxes in this budget.\n  We are not addressing the entitlement crises in this budget. Everyone \nknows it is there. It is a huge avalanche of debt waiting to bury our \nfuture. The sooner we act, obviously, the better. The longer we wait, \nthe more drastic it will be, and more expensive. But we do nothing. We \nare not even doing something as productive as fiddling. We are just \ntalking, year after year, and perhaps wishing our national debt will go \naway.\n  In this budget, we are raising taxes on the middle class. This budget \ncannot be paid for by closing the tax gap. It cannot be paid for by \nclosing loopholes. It cannot be paid for by shifting dates around on \nrevenues or outlays. And it surely cannot be paid for by increasing the \ntaxes paid by the super-rich, the rich, or just the very-well-to-do. It \nwill only be paid for by reaching down into the average earners and \nraising their taxes as well. Under this budget, the average family with \nchildren will pay $2,300 more each year. Seniors will pay $2,200 more \neach year. Small businesses will pay $4,100 more each year.\n  When we consider these tax increases, let's remember, last year we \nwere assured we would see tax relief. The first vote we were presented \non the budget last year was to budget for an\n\n[[Page S1837]]\n\nalleged middle-class tax cut. But this never materialized.\n  What has materialized is spending increases. This budget adds $210 \nbillion over 5 years. The gross debt will expand by $2 trillion by \n2013. This year, we are spending three-quarters of a billion dollars of \nthe Social Security surplus. This year, we are increasing spending by \n$22 billion, without fully funding the war.\n  Now, about that. I know there will be those who say they are just \nfollowing the President. But the budget is a congressional document. \nSay what you want about the ideas in this document, but it was written \nand prepared on the sixth floor of Dirksen, not in the White House. The \n``they did it first'' argument is not one I accepted from my children, \nand I am not going to accept it here.\n  We know the war is expected to cost $170 billion this year. We have \nan obligation to budget for that amount. It is honest budgeting. I will \nbe offering an amendment to do just that. If we are going to pay for \nthis war, fiscal discipline and legitimate budgeting requirements \ndemand that we include those costs.\n  There are those who do not want to fund our campaign in Iraq. There \nare those who want to end the war as soon as possible, regardless of \nthe damage that might do. They are entitled to those views. But there \nis no legitimate reason to fail to include the known estimates of the \nwar into our budget. Failure to do so is pure gimmickry and devalues \nthe budget exercise in which we are engaged. Hiding the war costs from \nview, when every Member knows we will be spending more, is ridiculous.\n\n  On that topic, my second great concern with this budget is the budget \ncontinues the erosion of fiscally responsible processes. We are seeing \nincreases in reserve funds. There are 37 this year, up from 24 last \nyear. They contain up to $300 billion in spending that hangs over our \nTreasury and taxpayers as a threat. I have heard them referred to as \nharmless, but any device that serves to weaken the authority and \nlegitimateness of our budget is simply not harmless.\n  Many feel these reserve funds have become an overcomplicated type of \nsense of the Senate, but they weave weakness into what should be a \nrigid and honest budget document.\n  Another erosion of fiscal discipline is the use of reconciliation--a \nprocess originated to cut Government spending--for spending increases. \nWe saw that last year. We have heard rumors and intentions of it being \ndone again this year. Unfortunately, this will be something we are not \nsure of until it is too late, and that is when the conference report is \nbefore us.\n  We also see pay-go rules being verbally respected but ultimately \ndodged through various ploys. The first year test of deficit neutrality \nwas dropped. We have shifted the timeliness of tax payments and \nspending costs to meet technical definitions that have no basis in \nreality. We have enacted wildly unrealistic program cuts and sunsets to \nhide true costs. Pay-go has been promised and praised, but it allowed \n$143 billion in deficit spending to occur.\n  I noticed when we started the session this year, Senator Gregg, our \nranking top Republican on the Budget Committee, was pointing to his \nSwiss cheese example of how they have been able to get around the pay-\ngo rules.\n  I believe Congress, and especially the Budget Committee, should be \ncommitted to rigid budget discipline, not politically expedient \ngamesmanship. I would urge a return to a tighter and more credible \nbudget document. I plan to offer several amendments to shore up the \nfiscal discipline we are seeing erode in this budget.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, rather than do that----\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I withdraw that request.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I know we are waiting for other \ncolleagues to come to the floor, but let me summarize our priorities \nfor a moment in terms of this budget resolution.\n  There are a number of things we are doing that are very important, \nsuch as restoring the cuts the President made overall in health care \nand the fact he wanted to eliminate the COPS Program that puts \nthousands of police officers on the streets in our communities. We have \nrestored those and other essential dollars for homeland security, \nfirefighters, and so on.\n  We have also picked three priorities, as we did last year, to focus \non in terms of new investments, given what is happening to middle-class \nfamilies across the country and given the fact that middle-class \nfamilies feel squeezed on all sides. Gas prices are up. In fact, I saw \ntoday they are inching toward $4 a gallon. According to the Detroit \nNews, a paper in Michigan, the chances that gas prices will hit $4 a \ngallon in the summer are growing with every uptick in the price of oil. \nWe are hearing all about what is happening to families in terms of the \nprice of gas, the price of health care, the price of college and on and \non and on. People are being squeezed on all sides.\n  We also know the best economic stimulus is a good-paying American \njob. So to address that, we have focused on three priorities in this \nbudget. It is very simple: jobs, jobs, jobs. What do I mean by that? We \nare focusing on three areas, one that also addresses our dependence on \nforeign oil. It addresses the critical issue of global warming and \nwhere we need to go as we look to the future for our families. But it \nalso creates jobs. There is a green-collar jobs initiative to invest in \nthose new technologies, the new energy efficiency jobs, weatherization \njobs, innovation for the future, green-collar jobs. We know we can \ncreate thousands and thousands of jobs by focusing in this area, and we \ndo that.\n  The second area is jobs for rebuilding America. We know for every $1 \nbillion we put into rebuilding our roads and bridges and schools and \nwater and sewer, we create 47,500 new good-paying American jobs. You \ncan't outsource those jobs. Those are jobs here in America, and that is \nwhat we need to do.\n  Then, finally, there is a focus on education and job training. We \nknow that for the future, for ourselves, and for our children and \ngrandchildren, it is opportunity, it is education, it is fully funding \nthe law that was passed called Leave No Child Behind and creating job-\ntraining opportunities. People in my State have lost their jobs because \nof trade, so we have something called trade adjustment assistance that \nhas been consistently underfunded. Yet we have individuals, through no \nfault of their own, who have seen their jobs go overseas. They are \nmiddle-class families trying to care for their families, trying to pay \nthat mortgage we are all talking about right now with the housing \ncrisis and trying to have the American dream for their families. Yet \nTAA, which was set up to help them go back to school, get training, \nhelp cover their health care costs for 2 years while they are doing the \ntraining, has been consistently underfunded. We have legislation to \nfully fund and expand the support for families under TAA.\n\n  So we wish to make sure job training and education are also a part of \nthis. This is jobs, jobs, jobs.\n  I wish to focus for a moment on one of those areas because it \ndirectly relates to what I said a moment ago as it relates to gas \nprices inching up toward $4 a gallon. We have to change this scenario. \nI know our Presiding Officer understands this and has spoken about \nthis. We have to get off foreign oil, invest in the new alternative \nenergies that create jobs, that create alternatives in terms of being \nindependent of foreign oil, and address gas prices directly, which are \nhitting people right between the eyes right now in terms of what is \nhappening.\n  Our green-collar jobs initiative focuses on energy efficiency and \nconservation, investment in battery technologies, retooling older \nplants so we are keeping our jobs here in America, and biofuels \nproduction and access. We have to have the pump available. You can grow \nthe fuel, you can make the vehicle, but the pumps, if they are not \navailable, we are not going to achieve the goal.\n  Finally, there is a green-collar job initiative. These are five areas \nwe have focused on in terms of investing in the future of our country. \nThat is what we are all about. For us, this is all about focusing on \nAmerica, about focusing on folks who every day get up, play by the \nrules, work hard every day, and want to know America is going to work \nfor\n\n[[Page S1838]]\n\nthem and that they are going to be able to keep their home and be able \nto send their kids to college and have the health care they need and \nhave that job which is going to allow them to be able to keep their \nstandard of living and, in fact, live the American dream. That is what \nour budget resolution is all about: jobs, jobs, jobs. I am very pleased \nwe have, in fact, put together something that makes sense for American \nfamilies.\n  I see my colleague from Maryland is here and who is a distinguished \nmember of the Budget Committee. He was a distinguished leader in the \nHouse of Representatives before coming to us. So I yield now to the \nSenator from Maryland for whatever time he wishes to consume.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Michigan for her \nfriendship, but more importantly I thank her for her work on this \nbudget resolution we have before us. She has been a very articulate and \neffective leader on the Budget Committee to make sure our budget \nresolution focuses on job growth in America and that invests in the \npeople of this country so we can compete internationally and keep jobs \nhere in America. I thank her very much for her leadership on the \ncommittee and for what she has done to help the people of our country.\n  This budget resolution, as the Senator from Michigan pointed out, is \nour blueprint. It is what we believe are the priorities of America in \nterms of what we need to do to move this Nation forward. I think we can \nperhaps judge how important this budget resolution is, based on what \nhappened last year. I heard a lot of my friends comment about last \nyear's budget resolution, whether it would make a difference in the \nlives of people in our country. When we look at the budget resolution \nwe enacted last year, based upon the President's submission, I think we \nhave a right to be proud of how important this debate is for the \nAmerican people. Let me point out that if we didn't pass that budget \nresolution last year--my colleagues know about the higher education \nbill that passed and was signed into law and supported by almost all my \ncolleagues; that is going to make a major difference in the ability of \nfamilies to afford higher education, the largest single increase in \nfinancial aid since the GI bill after World War II. Well, that bill \ncouldn't have happened but for the ability of the budget resolution to \nallow it to be considered. So I think we should be very proud we were \nable to accomplish that. My colleagues seemed to support that, although \nsome seem to have questions about this budget resolution. The \nPresident's budget would not allow us to have had that.\n  I have heard most of my colleagues talk in glowing terms about what \nwe did last year to help our veterans through veterans health care. Let \nme remind my colleagues it was our budget resolution, not the \nPresident's, that made that a reality. It is important what we include \nin a budget resolution. It speaks to the priorities of our country.\n  We had significant bipartisan support--two-thirds of our Members--who \nsupported the Children's Health Insurance Program. We made room for \nthat in the budget. I regret that the President vetoed it. The \nPresident was wrong. We are going to come back to that. But we, as \nMembers of the Senate, spoke to the priorities to take care of our \nchildren's health care needs. That was in last year's budget. What we \ndid last year is create a glidepath that is going to bring us to a \nbalanced budget faster than the President. So not only are we investing \nin America's future, we are doing it in a more fiscally responsible \nway.\n  I also appreciate--and I might speak parochially for one second for \nthe people of Maryland--the cuts to the Chesapeake Bay program would \nhave been very severe if the President's budget was passed. \nFortunately, we had our budget resolution that allowed our committees \nto come in with resources so the Federal Government could continue to \nbe a partner in the Chesapeake Bay.\n  So I think this debate is very important. I think the budget \nresolution that is before us, as my friend from Michigan pointed out, \nspeaks to investing in the people of this country and speaks to job \ngrowth in America. Now, how is that done? Well, this budget resolution, \ncompared to the President's, allows us to invest in education. Last \nyear, we did it in higher education. This year, we can invest in \nteacher quality and in schools in our communities so every child can \nget a quality education. That should be our goal. Our budget moves us \ntoward a Federal partnership to achieve those goals; whereas the \nPresident's budget would not let us move forward.\n  We all talk about how we are going to become energy independent and \nhow we are going to become friendlier toward the environment. Our \nbudget resolution allows us to move in that direction; once again, \ncompared to the President's budget, it wouldn't happen.\n  In health care, our budget provides for the expansion of the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. I know we have a difference with \nthe President on this. We are going to win this battle. If it is not in \n2008, we will win it in 2009. Over 100,000 children in my State have no \nhealth insurance. The Children's Health Insurance Program needs to be \nexpanded. We need to make sure every child in America--quite frankly, I \nthink every family in America--should have access to affordable, \nquality health care.\n  For infrastructure needs, meaning investing so we can create jobs, is \nvery important. I came from a meeting with biotech leaders in my State \nwhere we talked about what we need to do as a Federal partner to help \nin the biotech industry and to help with new, creative innovations in \nAmerica. We talked about the NIH budget and how the Bush \nadministration's budget would level fund--which is a reduction--the \nnumber of projects NIH could participate in. The budget resolution we \nhave before us today would allow us to invest in research in America to \nhelp keep jobs here in America, to develop the type of technology that \nwe know Americans are capable of doing.\n  But the Federal Government should be a partner, and NIH always has \nenjoyed bipartisan support. Our budget allows NIH to expand to cover \nmore of the very worthy requests that they receive every year.\n  The budget provides for dealing with the housing crisis. We have a \ncontinuing housing crisis in all parts of our Nation. In my State of \nMaryland, we have record numbers of foreclosures--people who cannot \nafford their mortgages because of the adjustable rates coming in that \nwere subprime mortgages. We can do better than that. We have already \nheard bipartisan support for giving the Government more authority to \ndeal with refinancing loans, giving better counseling to people who are \nin the market to buy a home and take out a mortgage. I hope to provide \nadditional incentives so people can stay in their homes, and so they \ncan buy homes, and so homeowners can sell their homes. We need to do \nthat for the sake of the individuals involved. We need to do it to \npreserve communities, property tax revenues for local government, and \nwe need to help spur economic growth.\n  This budget allows for those types of programs to reach the floor of \nthis body for consideration. The President's budget would not allow us \nto do that. This budget provides for middle-income tax relief. You have \nheard the chairman talk about it. The AMT is very important. It is \nimportant that we extend that relief; otherwise, literally hundreds of \nthousands of Marylanders will fall within the AMT, and millions of \nAmericans will fall into a tax we never intended for them to have to \npay. Our budget resolution provides for that type of relief.\n  One more thing about this budget resolution. This budget resolution \nactually moves us toward a balanced budget faster than the President's \nbudget. I could go back and talk about 7 years ago, and how we had all \nthese surpluses, and how the Bush policies have led to these huge \ndeficits. I can talk with a lot of credibility on it because I didn't \nsupport the President's economic plan. I said it was wrong for us to \nspend the surplus before it was fully there, wrong for us to do this \nwar funding without paying for it, wrong to give out tax cuts to \nwealthy people when we were in a deficit. I thought we owed it to our \nchildren and grandchildren to pay for our bills today. But I was \noutvoted and we did it. Now we\n\n[[Page S1839]]\n\nhave the Bush deficits that we have to deal with, and we cannot rewrite \nhistory. It is our responsibility to balance the Federal budget.\n  The budget resolution we have before us, offered by the Budget \nCommittee, puts us on a glidepath to balancing the budget at a faster \nrate than the President's budget would. So we are acting fiscally \nresponsible and investing in America's future, investing in jobs, and \nproviding the appropriate tax relief for middle-income families.\n  I thank Chairman Conrad for his cooperation and leadership and for \nbringing us all together on the Budget Committee. I particularly thank \nhim for the help on an amendment I was able to get into the budget \nresolution, which will help in providing dental care particularly to \nour children.\n  I mention that whenever I can because a little over a year ago, a 12-\nyear-old boy from Maryland, who lived about 6 miles from here, Deamonte \nDriver, had a toothache. His mom tried to get him to a dentist. Social \nworkers made numerous phone calls to try to find a dentist to take care \nof his needs. That was in 2007, in the United States of America, in my \nown State of Maryland. They could not find a dentist who would take \ncare of him. He only needed an $80 tooth extraction. Instead, he \nsuffered from abscessed teeth and he had to go through two brain \nsurgeries, costing a quarter of a million dollars, and he lost his life \nbecause we would not invest in access to affordable dental care for our \nchildren.\n  I thank Chairman Conrad for allowing an amendment to be added to this \nbudget bill that will allow the Finance Committee to bring a bill to \nthis floor that will make sure we will have no more tragedies like \nDeamonte Driver's in America, and make sure our children have access to \ndental care. It is the No. 1 leading disease affecting children. The \nnumber of children who have untreated tooth decay is alarming, \nparticularly in minority communities and in rural areas. We can do much \nbetter. This budget resolution will allow us to move in that direction.\n  I thank Chairman Conrad for allowing us to move forward with NIH \nresearch so we can do much better. In the 1990s, we were committed to \ndoubling the amount of money in NIH. It was a great day for this \nNation. But the Bush budgets would have us fall back and lose our \ncompetitive advantage. The budget before us will allow us to continue \nto make progress in the Federal Government on NIH research.\n  On Amtrak funding, I thank the chairman and the committee for \nallowing us to move forward. Senator Lautenberg has been particularly \neffective in bringing this issue to our attention. We need an efficient \nrail system in this country.\n  We have read recently about how we have to monitor our water more \neffectively. The budget before us gives us a much better chance of \nachieving those objectives than the President's budget. This budget is \na good investment for America's future--that is what it is--so we can \nbecome more competitive and pay down our debt, so we can provide the \nappropriate relief to middle-income families. It is about choices, and \nwe made tougher choices. We could not do everything we wanted to do.\n  I want to make this point: Considering the legacy of the Bush \ndeficits we have to deal with, considering the economic problems this \nNation is confronting, considering the political realities we have to \nwork with, where there are serious differences between the majority in \nCongress and President Bush, considering all those issues, considering \nthe Bush budget and how that would lead us into red ink by providing \ntax relief to individuals who I don't believe need it--particularly \nwhen we are asking our children and grandchildren to pick up those \ncosts--considering all that, and considering that this budget puts a \npriority on job growth and the competitiveness of our Nation, I urge my \ncolleagues to support this resolution. I think it is worthy of strong \nsupport in this body. I am certain when we pass this resolution and \nreconcile it with the House, many of the implementing bills are going \nto enjoy large bipartisan support.\n  This budget resolution deserves that support. I am proud to endorse \nit, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/11/senate-section/article/S1839-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1839]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. CARDIN.

The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is the amendment about which I spoke \nthis morning. This amendment would take the surplus in the budget \nresolution and give it back to the hard-working American families who \nearned it. It would make permanent the 10-percent tax bracket. It would \nmake permanent the child tax credit. It would make permanent the \nmarriage penalty relief. And it would make permanent the changes to the \ndependent care credit. Further, it would make changes to the tax law to \nhonor the sacrifices our men and women in uniform make for us every \nday. We lower the estate tax to 2009 levels. And it would allow middle-\nincome taxpayers who do not itemize their deductions to nonetheless \ntake a deduction for property taxes.\n  I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, Senator Bayh, Senator \nPryor, Senator Nelson of Florida, Senator Salazar, Senator Rockefeller, \nSenator Tester, Senator Brown, Senator Menendez, and Senator Bingaman.\n  The amendment shows our commitment to American families. The \namendment takes the surplus and returns it as tax relief to those hard-\nworking families. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \namendment.\n  I spoke at length about this amendment earlier today. This is a very \nbrief summary, now that we are on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Baucus, if I might be listed as an original \ncosponsor as well.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I make that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Baucus, for this excellent amendment. This will \nextend the middle-class tax cuts, the 10-percent bracket, the childcare \ncredit, and the marriage penalty relief provisions. All those tax cuts \nwill be extended.\n  In addition, as I understand it, the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee has crafted an amendment that will include significant estate \ntax reform because we are now in this unusual situation of where, under \ncurrent law, the estate tax will go from a $3.5-million exemption per \nperson in 2009 to no estate tax in 2010, and then in 2011, the estate \ntax comes back with only $1 million exemption per person. The amendment \nof the Senator from Montana would make certain it stays at $3.5 million \nand is allowed to rise with inflation.\n  The Senator from Montana has also added provisions for those who are \nserving in the military and also has provisions that will provide for \nproperty tax relief because we know that across the country, at the \nvery time house prices are falling, property taxes in many \njurisdictions are rising, and people don't get the benefit of the \ndeduction because of the formalities of the current Tax Code. All these \nitems are addressed in the amendment of the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee.\n  I wish to express my appreciation. This will still permit the budget \nto be in balance by the fourth year and to stay in balance in the fifth \nyear. The President's budget, by contrast, balances in the fourth year, \nbut then it quickly slips right back out of balance again. Ours does \nnot.\n  I take this moment to again thank the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee for his work on this amendment and to thank his staff as \nwell. I know they put a great deal of time and effort into this \namendment, meeting with many interested parties, as one can imagine \nwith an amendment of this magnitude. It makes a very, I think, \nimportant contribution to the consideration of this resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, there is one point in this amendment that \nneeds explanation, and the Senator from North Dakota touched on it. It \nis basically this: Under our tax laws today, only those tax filers who \nitemize their deductions can take advantage of the property tax \ndeduction. Only those Americans who itemize their deductions can take a \nproperty tax deduction which, therefore, lowers their income taxes. \nAbout two-thirds of Americans do not itemize. Two-thirds of Americans \ntake the standard deduction. If they take the standard deduction, they \ncannot, therefore, deduct their property taxes from their income taxes.\n  This amendment says all homeowners can take the standard deduction; \nthat is, it makes no difference whether you itemize or whether you take \nthe standard deduction. In either case, you are able to take full \nadvantage of the property tax deduction to lower your property taxes.\n  This will help in some small way to prevent the reduction of housing \nprices in some parts of the country where it is a real problem. It is \nclearly not the full answer, but it at least is a way to help and also \ngives tax relief to middle-income taxpayers because those taxpayers who \ndo not take the standard deduction, those taxpayers who itemize are \nprobably a little bit wealthier than are taxpayers who take the \nstandard deduction.\n  We are saying, if you take the standard deduction, you now can \nitemize this one item; that is, your property taxes. Technically, it is \ncalled above the line. Basically, it means if you take the standard \ndeduction, you get full benefit of your property taxes; you can take \nthe deduction against your income. And that is in this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee. I also ask him, as I understand it, the Defenders of Freedom \nTax Relief Act is also part of this package.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct. Basically, it is in this amendment, \nhonoring our men and women who are standing up for us in Afghanistan \nand Iraq.\n  Mr. CONRAD. And that package would provide, as I understand it, \nsignificant tax relief for our fighting men and women overseas, and it \nwill continue to help them save for retirement and expand their \nopportunities for home ownership. It will also help the employers of \nreservists and National Guard who are called to Active Duty. This is a \npackage that passed the Senate last year by unanimous consent. It did \nnot get to the President's desk but is included in this package, which \nI think will make it even more attractive to our colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I know Senator Murray was here seeking recognition. \nThen I think Senator Cornyn would like to be recognized.\n\n[[Page S1841]]\n\n  I will conclude, if I may, on this matter. This amendment is an \nimportant amendment, and I hope my colleagues will support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this amendment is a game. Last year, we saw \nthe same game. Last year, the Democratic Congress was in its first year \nof having the majority in both the House and the Senate, so people gave \nit the benefit of the doubt. They said: OK, you claim you are going to \ndo something, we certainly hope you will.\n  So last year they once again set up a false surplus and then they cut \ntaxes and then they brought forward the Baucus amendment to pick up all \nthat surplus as part of the tax cut, claiming both a surplus and a tax \ncut, which was good talking but a little inconsistent.\n  Their tax cut last year, the Baucus amendment had in it the extension \nof the 10-percent bracket, the extension of the $1,000-per-child tax \ncredit, and the extension of the marriage penalty. I believe it had \nsome estate tax language in it. It might have. But I know it didn't \nhave this property tax itemizer in it. It had those four items in it \nfor sure. So all the Members voted for it and took credit: Oh, we are \nfor these tax extenders because we think they help middle Americans, \nwhich they do, obviously, which is why President Bush proposed them \noriginally, and that is why it passed under a Republican Congress.\n  So what happened after this amendment was voted for and everybody \nsent out their press releases from the other side of the aisle saying: \nMy goodness, we are for these tax cuts, we are going to vote for them \nright here on the floor of the Senate--even though they could have put \nthem in the original Senate bill, which they didn't do because they \nwanted to have a bill reported out of committee with a big surplus so \nthey could talk about that, knowing when they got to the floor they \nwere going to eliminate these surpluses for the tax cuts--what happened \nafter they put out all their press releases? Where are these tax-cut \nextenders they claimed they were going to pass last year? They don't \nexist. They never marked them up. They never voted on them. The real \naction of extending these tax cuts never occurred, even though they \ntook credit for them last year.\n  They said: My goodness, that is a great idea, we get a press release \nout saying we are for cutting taxes; let's do it again. They did not \ncut the taxes because the taxes are still there, so they say let's do \nit again. So we see the same cynical action brought forward in this \namendment. They are offering this amendment to cut the same taxes they \ncut last year--at least they took credit for cutting last year but they \nactually didn't cut.\n  It is to say the least a game--a game. That is why I call this the \n``fudge it'' budget because so much of it is built around this \ngamesmanship in language and setting up false hopes and then proceeding \nwith the press releases and then proceeding with not following through \non what they claim they were going to do.\n  It also should be noted that left out of the Baucus amendment are a \nlot of fairly important issues of tax policy. For example, the present \nrate on capital gains and dividends is not in the Baucus amendment. So \nthey are presuming it will go back up. That is a pretty stiff hit for a \nlot of Americans, especially senior citizens. Ironically, senior \ncitizens benefit uniquely from capital gains rates being at their \npresent level. Senior citizens benefit uniquely from dividend rates \nbeing at their present level because much of a senior citizen's retired \nindividual income is capital gains income or dividend income to the \nextent they have some income beyond their basic pension, and many of \ntheir pensions are, of course, based off capital gains and dividends. \nSo they are going to raise those rates. They are going to double the \ncapital gains rate, essentially. The dividend rate will not only \ndouble, it goes up by 2\\1/2\\ times for some Americans under their \nproposal.\n  The deduction for qualified education expenses is not extended. Small \nbusiness expensing--that is a pretty important item, especially in an \neconomic slowdown that should be extended--is not extended in this \nbill.\n  Other extenders that are left out of the Baucus amendment include the \nresearch and development tax credit, that is pretty important; the \nenergy tax credit, that is pretty important; State and local tax \ndeduction, some people think that is important. AMT relief is left out.\n  The practical effect is even though they make this representation \nthey are going to reduce taxes, the exact same representation they made \nlast year on these ``motherhood'' tax extenders, let's call them, which \nthey never followed through on last year, they leave on the table \nmassive increases in taxes--massive increases in taxes--which will fall \non working Americans.\n  We hear all this gobbledygook from the other side of the aisle that \nthey are just going to tax the rich, we are taxing the rich, we are \ntaxing the rich. I bet I heard their Presidential candidate, Senator \nObama, use that term to justify his spending policies probably 15 times \nin the last debate I listened to in which he participated. We are just \ngoing to tax the rich, the wealthy Americans. Well, fine, OK. The only \nproblem is they cannot raise enough money to pay for their budget by \njust taxing the rich. If you take the basic rates and you move them \nback to the Clinton days, when we had high tax rates in this country, \nyou take the top rate on the high-income individual, 35 percent, and \nyou raise it back to 39.6 percent, what do you generate in income in an \nannual year? About $25 billion.\n  Mr. GREGG. What do they plan to spend? Senator Obama plans to spend \n$300 billion under his plan. In order to reach the numbers they want to \nspend in this bill, there is a lot of spending in this bill. There is \n$200-plus billion in discretionary spending increases.\n  There are $400-plus billion entitlement increases in this budget. \nThere are big holes that we know are going to have to be filled, or at \nleast we hope they will be filled, because otherwise you are going to \nend up with our troops stuck overseas without being able to get home, \nbecause their budget does not fund the cost of bringing them home, much \nless supporting them while they are in the field.\n  We know these expenditures are going to occur, and those expenditures \nhave to be paid for, and the way they are paying for them is by \nincreasing taxes, not on the wealthy--they do on the wealthy too, but \non every American. The average American's taxes will go up about $2,400 \nunder this bill. Senior citizens' taxes will go up about $2,100; small \nbusiness taxes will go up about $4,700; $2,400 for an individual family \nwith $50,000 of income. That is what their tax increase goes to: for \nseniors, about $2,100; for small businesses, about $4,700.\n  That is a lot of money. You can buy a lot of groceries and at least \nget some relief from the cost of energy if you get to keep that money \nrather than have it taxed away as is proposed in this bill. It should \nnot come as a surprise to people that they are doing this in their \nbudget, because that is what they do well; they like to spend money and \nthey love to raise taxes.\n  Then they claim, well, we are going to tax the rich. It turns out \nthey are not only taxing the rich, they are taxing senior citizens, \nworking Americans, small business Americans, Americans who get their \nincome from small businesses, they are taxing R, they are taxing \nenergy, the production of energy.\n  In addition, there is a little game being played here on their own \nrules. We hear the sanctimonious discussion about how they are going to \nuse pay-go to discipline the budget. They are going to use pay-go to \nmake sure we stay within our spending priorities, and that we do not \nraise taxes without offsetting these taxes.\n  Well, this amendment is set up to game pay-go. Pay-go is not going to \napply when this amendment is passed or, if it does apply, it is going \nto be structured in a way that it can be waived. There is no \nexpectation that there will be any pay-go applied to the Baucus \namendment, should it ever actually be brought to the floor.\n  It is a game. It is, of course, one of the reasons why I think the \nAmerican people get a little cynical about their Government. Here is \nthe second year in a row that we are going to have press releases \nflying out of the Democratic Senatorial Committee claiming that they \nvoted for these tax cuts. And then what happens? The tax cut never gets \npassed. This is a nice charade; that is\n\n[[Page S1842]]\n\nall it is. We wish they were sincere when it came to cutting taxes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, first, I recognize the ranking Republican \non the Budget Committee, Senator Gregg, to thank him for his \ncooperation in bringing this budget resolution to the floor. While we \nhave serious substantive differences, and we will be discussing those, \nI do have a high regard for the Senator from New Hampshire for the way \nhe conducts himself.\n  He, in the Budget Committee, did something I want to recognize \npublicly. One of our members was ill. We have a rule in the Senate \nBudget Committee that Senators are not allowed to vote by proxy. We are \nthe only committee in the Senate that has that rule. We have that rule \nbecause we are the only committee with the power to bring a fast track \nvehicle to the floor for immediate vote. That rule has been a long-\nstanding rule in the Senate Budget Committee. Senator Gregg and Senator \nMcConnell, when we told them of the problem we were confronted with, \none of our members was ill--with only a 12-to-11 margin on the \ncommittee, that would have meant we could not report a bill to the \nfloor.\n  In a gracious way, in a way that I think reflects well on the Senate, \nin fact, makes me proud to be a Member of this body, Senator Gregg and \nSenator McConnell allowed a unanimous consent motion to come to the \nfloor of the Senate so all Senators could pass judgment on whether we \nshould exempt one member from the requirement to be present because he \ncould not be.\n  I want to start by thanking Senator Gregg for that professionalism, \nfor that graciousness, and I do. I give my appreciation to Senator \nMcConnell as well.\n  Now, on the substance of what the Senator has said: I do not think \nanybody would be surprised that we have a strong disagreement with \nrespect to the way he characterizes this amendment. This amendment \nis to a 5-year budget resolution. This amendment specifically extends \nthe middle-class tax cuts and provides for estate tax reform and for \nprovisions that are of assistance to our men and women in uniform, and \nwill provide for certain property tax relief as well.\n\n  With respect to the middle-class tax cuts, it is true we offered a \nsimilar amendment last year. It is true we offered it containing estate \ntax reform as well. It is true that final action was not taken because \nthere was no need to take final action in 2007. There is no need to \ntake final action in 2008. There is no need to take final action in \n2009, because all of these tax cuts under current law do not expire \nuntil 2010.\n  It is not a game; it is reality. The reality simply is, this is a 5-\nyear budget resolution that is recognizing that we will extend those \ntax cuts, we will do it in a way that still allows the budget to be \nbalanced in the fourth year, and remain in balance in the fifth year, \nand there is no need to take the final action, because all of those tax \ncuts exist until the end of 2010. That is a fact.\n  The second point the Senator makes and makes repeatedly is all of \nthese tax increases in this budget. No, there are not. He made the \nexact same speech last year. Second year, second verse. He said we were \ngoing to increase taxes last year $1 trillion. Now we can go back and \nlook at the Record. We do not have to resort to rhetoric, we do not \nhave to resort to projections, we do not have to resort to forecasts; \nwe can look at the Record of the Congress last year and the beginning \nof the year.\n  What has happened? Taxes did not increase by the trillion dollars the \nSenator warned about last year. In fact, taxes have been cut by $194 \nbillion. This is with offsets of $8 billion. So on a net basis, taxes \nhave been reduced by $186 billion by this Democratic Congress that my \ncolleague claimed last year would increase taxes by $1 trillion. Those \nwords ring pretty hollow when you compare them to the actual record.\n  Now, how did Democrats cut taxes by a net of $186 billion since last \nyear? In two ways: No. 1, the stimulus package. The stimulus package, \nsupported by the President of the United States, passed by the House of \nRepresentatives, passed by the Senate, and the alternative minimum tax \nrelief provided last year. That combination has provided a net \nreduction in taxes to the American people of $186 billion. Not a tax \nincrease, a tax cut. When the Senator says this budget is going to \nincrease individual taxes $2,400, no. With the adoption of the Baucus \namendment, which virtually every Democrat will support, we will extend \nthe middle-class tax cuts.\n  When he says: You are going to increase taxes on this category and \nthat category, the fact is, you could accomplish the revenue numbers in \nour budget, which is 2.6 percent more revenue than is in the \nPresident's budget--that is how much more revenue we have, 2.6 \npercent--we believe that amount of revenue can be achieved not by tax \nincreases--in fact, I think it would be unwise to ask the American \npeople for a tax increase before going after three other categories of \nrevenue: No. 1, offshore tax havens. Offshore tax havens, according to \nthe Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, are now causing us to \nlose $100 billion a year. Offshore tax havens. That abuse is \nproliferating.\n  No. 2, abusive tax shelters. Let me give you an example. Right now we \nhave the spectacle in the United States of U.S. companies buying \nforeign sewer systems, not because they are in the sewer business but \nbecause they want to depreciate those systems on their books for U.S. \ntax purposes. They then lease the sewer systems back to the European \ncities that built them in the first place. They are not just doing it \nwith sewer systems, they are doing it with European city halls. \nCompanies and wealthy investors in this country are buying European \ncity halls, writing them off on the books in the United States to \nreduce their tax obligation here, and then turning around and leasing \nthem back to the European cities that built them in the first place. \nThat is a scam. It ought to be closed down. The estimates are that is \ncosting us $40 billion a year.\n  On top of that, the tax gap, which in 2001 was identified at over \n$300 billion a year, the difference between what is owed and what is \npaid--while the vast majority of us pay what we owe, we have a number \nof people, unfortunately an increasing number, who do not pay what they \nowe, companies and individuals. Before we ask for a tax increase from \nanybody, we ought to go after those folks.\n  Now we will have a debate on these issues, but to suggest there is a \nmassive tax increase here, no, there is not a massive tax increase \nhere. The exact same speech was given last year, $1 trillion of tax \nincreases. What happened? On net, this Congress reduced taxes by $186 \nbillion. That is a fact.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. First, let me thank the Senator from North Dakota for his \nkind comments relative to our efforts to make sure that the unfortunate \nsituation with one of our members did not inappropriately impact the \nmajority position on the committee. We were happy to do that as a \ncourtesy, because it is part of the proper comity of the Senate, quite \nhonestly.\n  To move on to the substance of his comments, his actual praise of me \nwas not inconsistent; I thought it was brilliant. But there is such \ninconsistency in the substance of what he said that I am amazed. I \nmean, first, the argument is made: Well, the reason the Baucus \namendment did not have to be actually executed is because we did not \nneed the money or we did not need to extend those tax cuts because they \ndo not lapse until 2011 or 2012.\n  Well, why did you offer the amendment then? To put out the press \nrelease? It appears that is the only purpose of the amendment. Why are \nyou offering the amendment this year? To put out the press release \nagain? It appears that is the only purpose of the amendment.\n  What he is basically saying, if you read between the lines, is last \nyear we did not execute on that, we did an amendment here, we got a \npress release--in fact, I have the press release here from last year: \nMarch 10, 2007. Baucus budget amendment funds children's health, tax \nrelief for America's working families. That is the title of the release \nthat was put out last year when this amendment was offered.\n  Of course, it never happened because the tax relief never occurred \nbecause the amendment was never passed.\n\n[[Page S1843]]\n\n  This year, I guess we will get another press release from Members on \ntheir side saying: Senator so-and-so voted for tax relief for American \nfamilies and for health care for American families by voting for the \nBaucus amendment which will not ever be executed on. It is a touch \ninconsistent, to be kind, to first claim that you didn't need to do the \nextensions until the year 2010 or 2011 or 2012, and therefore, last \nyear, when you passed the amendment, it didn't mean anything, and then \nto bring the amendment forward again and take credit for cutting taxes. \nAt what point does the American public simply shake their heads and \nwalk away?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. I will finish my statement, and then I will yield.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GREGG. The second point the Senator makes is that there are no \ntax increases in this budget. That is true if you look at this year. \nBut this is a 5-year budget. It assumes revenues over 5 years and takes \ncredit for those revenues which exceed the President's number and which \nreflect an increase in taxes of about $400 billion. That is their \nnumber. I actually believe it is higher.\n  Giving them the benefit of the doubt, they have a $400 billion tax \nincrease built into their budget. That tax increase is built in on the \nassumption made by OMB that the capital gains rate will go back up, \nthat the dividend rate will go back up, that the basic rates will go \nback up, that other expiring tax provisions will go back up, R, \nenergy, qualified education spending, that those tax extenders will go \nback up. So you won't see a dramatic increase in taxes as a result of \nthis budget because they turn around and spend the money. It is not \nthat they not only increase the taxes and presume those tax revenues \nwill come in, they spend the money.\n  Then the argument is made: But we don't really have to do it by \nallowing those provisions to expire. We can raise it all from this \ninfamous tax gap, which last year they also took credit for for $300 \nbillion, or claimed they would, if they were successful. Then they \nended up cutting the IRS accounts. So the IRS not only did not collect \nthis additional money, they didn't even have the resources to collect \nwhat they were supposed to collect the first time around.\n  So the tax gap is mythical. It is virtual. It may exist. It does \nexist. But the collecting of it has been proven to be a lot more \ndifficult than just putting it in a budget and claiming you will get \nit. In fact, the IRS Commissioner, when he testified before our \ncommittee, made it very clear that he felt the maximum amount, even \nwith all the resources he asked for, which he never got, that we would \nbe able to collect out of the tax gap was somewhere between $20 and $30 \nbillion. That is over 5 years, as I recall.\n  So if the Senator's position is that we don't need to raise dividend \ntaxes to get the $400 billion, we don't need to raise taxes on capital \ngains to get the $400 billion, we don't need to raise taxes on the \nestate and death tax to get the $400 billion, we don't need to raise \nthe brackets back up in order to get the $400 billion, I know that in \norder to stand behind that position, he is going to want to vote for \nthe amendment which Senator Cornyn or I will offer which will do \nexactly that. It will say: Don't raise the dividend rate. Don't raise \nthe capital gains rate. Don't raise the brackets. Because the Senator \nfrom North Dakota said we don't need to do that, he will want to be \nwith us on that.\n  I am happy to yield to the Senator for a question.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would just ask the Senator----\n  Mr. GREGG. My question is, You will be with us on that amendment, \nwon't you?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I have not yet had a chance to study the amendment. I \nwould be happy to do so and give you an answer after I have had a \nchance to review it.\n  Let me ask the Senator, did your budget resolution in 2006 extend the \nmiddle-class tax cuts?\n  Mr. GREGG. They didn't expire within the budget window.\n  Mr. CONRAD. You mean the same argument I have just made with respect \nto ours?\n  Mr. GREGG. Reclaiming my time, the point is, there is a 5-year budget \nwindow. They start to expire in 2010, not in 2007; therefore, your \nbudget has to deal with that expiration. My budget didn't have to deal \nwith that expiration because it was not within the 5-year window.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Did you not assume in your 2006 budget resolution the \nextension of all the President's tax cuts?\n  Mr. GREGG. I would certainly hope I did, but I don't recall.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Well, the answer is, you did. And the second question \nwould be, Did you then execute on extending those tax cuts in 2006?\n  Mr. GREGG. I would certainly like to have. But unfortunately, at the \ntime, again, we were not within the budget window. But you are within \nthe budget window, and you are taking credit for those tax extenders \nlapsing. Are you not taking credit for $400 billion under the baseline? \nThat number is reached by CBO by presuming that the tax extenders \non cap gains, dividends, and rates will expire? Are you not taking \ncredit for that in your budget resolution?\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. For precisely the same reason that the Senator has given \nfor his including extending the middle-class tax cuts when he last \nwrote a budget resolution in 2006. It would have covered the years \n2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011. The Senator included the extension of \nthose middle-class tax cuts, just as I have done, because it was a 5-\nyear budget resolution, and then the Senator's side did not execute, \njust as we did not last year, because there was no necessity to do it \nbecause those tax provisions do not expire until 2010.\n  This is a case of the pot calling the kettle black. You extended the \nmiddle-class tax cuts in your 2006 resolution and then did not execute \nbecause there was no need to do so because those tax cuts don't expire \nuntil 2010. That is precisely what we have done.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, reclaiming my time, there is a pretty \nsignificant difference. We are talking about 3 years, which is massive \namounts of revenue. Secondly, you spend the money. The difference is \npretty significant. We are talking about this budget at this time, and \nyou can try to go back to other budgets, which I am happy to do. We can \nobviously debate old budgets. But the budget that is on the floor right \nnow--and it appears the Senator is agreeing with my assessment--has a \n$400 billion tax increase, which tax increase CBO assumes will be \naccomplished by not extending the rates on dividends, capital gains, \nand the basic rates, along with research credit, energy credit, the \nqualified educational expenses, and the small business expensing. That \nis where you generate your revenue from. That is a tax increase. That \ntranslates into $2,400 per family. That is your budget. You are in \ncharge of the budget. You brought the budget forward. You have a \n$2,400-per-family increase in here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we have no such tax increase assumption in \nour budget. Here are the facts. It is true we have $400 billion more in \nrevenue over the 5 years than the President has in his budget. That is \na difference of 2.6 percent. We believe that revenue can be attained \nwithout a tax increase. How? The pool of money I am talking about is \nthe tax gap, the difference between what is owed and what is paid. The \nvast majority of us pay what we owe, but we have a group of people who \ndon't. No. 2, offshore tax havens. The Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations has told us we are losing $100 billion a year to \noffshore tax havens. I have shown many times on the floor the Ugland \nHouse in the Cayman Islands, a little five-story building that claims \nto be the home to 12,600 companies. How can that be, that a five-story \nbuilding in the Cayman Islands can be the operational home to 12,600 \nbusinesses? They are not engaged in business out of that building. They \nare engaged in monkey business. That monkey business is costing us a \nlot of money.\n  Now we have new evidence from the Boston Globe of another building in \nthe Cayman Islands, this time a four-story building. In that building, \nthey are also engaged in massive tax fraud. How? The company that is \nhiring the contractors for the United States in Iraq, KBR, is using \nthat operation in the\n\n[[Page S1844]]\n\nCayman Islands to avoid paying their Medicare and Social Security taxes \nin the amounts of hundreds of millions of dollars for one company.\n  The New York Times has just reported in Liechtenstein that they have \nuncovered massive tax fraud.\n  I would say to the American people, before we ask for a tax increase \nfrom anyone, we ought to go after these tax scams. What is the amount \nover 5 years? The estimates are at least $2.7 trillion. If we get 15 \npercent of that--not 50 percent, 15 percent of the abuse in tax havens, \nthe abuse of tax shelters, the tax gap, 15 percent of it--we can \nbalance this budget with no tax increase. Yes, additional revenue, \nrevenue acquired by going after people who are cheating.\n  Senator Dorgan and I are perhaps the only two Members who have \nactually audited the books and records of major corporations, because \nwe used to be the tax commissioners for our State. I have looked at the \nbooks and records. I have audited the books and records. I found tens \nof millions of dollars from my little State of North Dakota. One of the \nthings I learned when I did it and actually examined the books and \nrecords is how much fraud is going on. This is fraud not just from my \nconclusion or Senator Dorgan's conclusion, this is what has happened as \na result of investigations by our own Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations that have uncovered massive fraud, massive cheating. We \nought to go after it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, CBO scores zero in this budget for money \ncoming from the tax gap that is represented by Senator Conrad as \nexisting. The point being, of course, that you can talk about the tax \ngap all you want; it would be nice if we could generate some money from \nthe tax gap. But IRS gives us no credit for generating money. They \nclaim you can't generate the type of dollars the Senator has been \ntalking about, and CBO doesn't give us any score for tax gap unless we \nsignificantly increase IRS funding, which we do not do.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GREGG. Just a second. Furthermore, what you have to recognize is \nCBO does score the $400 billion, which the Senator refers to as \nrevenue, I refer to it as a tax increase--I mean, it is a tax \nincrease--and CBO gets that $400 billion number because they assume the \ntax rates on capital gains, dividends and the personal rates, along \nwith the other items I have listed, will go back up when they expire. \nThat is how the number comes about. It doesn't come about from the tax \ngap.\n  You can say: I am going to get money from Liechtenstein as a way to \ncover the American tax gap, and therefore no Americans are ever going \nto have to pay any more in taxes. You can make that statement, but that \nis not the way the budget works. CBO tells us how they are going to \nscore it. We all work off of the CBO baseline. The CBO baseline \nassumes, under the Democratic budget, that taxes will go up above what \nthe President asked for. That is clearly because they want to repeal \nthe tax rates that are in place today and were put in place by \nPresident Bush. I don't know why they resist so aggressively admitting \nto this. Their Presidential candidates, that is all they talk about. So \nclearly, that is the game plan. Why try to obfuscate it with this tax \ngap debate?\n  In addition, we have this issue of what happened under our budget \nversus what happened under their budget. This is their budget. It is \nnot our budget. They are responsible for this budget. The U.S. Congress \nhas to pass a budget. The President doesn't sign it. Congress passes \nit. This is what they have brought forward. Their budget assumes, \ntakes, and spends--and that is the important part--a tax increase which \nresults from basically raising the tax rates on capital gains, raising \ntax rates on dividends significantly, which will dramatically impact \nall Americans, raising rates, raising a variety of other taxes such as \nR and energy. That is where they get the revenue which they then turn \naround and spend. We didn't do that in our budget. We accepted a higher \ndeficit and didn't raise the tax rates. So there was a difference. It \nis substantive between the two. The core of it goes to the fact that \nthey need revenue to spend, and to get that revenue, they are going to \naggressively raise taxes $2,400 on working Americans.\n  The tax gap is a smokescreen for what is really going on. I don't \neven know why they put it up because there is no contention out there \nin the public arena about what the game plan is.\n  Senator Clinton and Senator Obama have said over and over and over \nagain they intend to raise taxes. They claim it is just going to be on \nthe wealthy, but they cannot get where they want to go by just raising \ntaxes on the wealthy because, as I pointed out before, if you raise the \nmarginal rates on the highest earners from 35 percent to 39.6 percent, \nyou do not generate anywhere near the amount of money you would have to \ngenerate to cover all the spending that is proposed in this budget and \nhas been proposed for new programs by Senator Obama and Senator \nClinton, as they have been campaigning.\n  It will be, and this budget is, a general increase on the taxes of \nworking Americans--to the tune of $2,400 for most families in the \n$50,000 range, to the tune of $2,100 for 18 million seniors, and to the \ntune of $4,700 for 24 million small businesses. There are no two ways \naround it. That is what is going to happen if this budget is extended \nthroughout the 5-year experience it is planning to budget for.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I know the Senator insists on his point of \nview on this, but I have to say there is another point of view which I \nhave articulated and have articulated repeatedly. There simply is not \nan assumption that there is a tax increase embedded in this budget. In \nfact, what is included, after the Baucus amendment is adopted, is \nsignificant additional tax reduction: tax reduction for middle-class \nfamilies, tax reduction for estates, tax reduction for those who would \notherwise be subjected to the alternative minimum tax--some 20 million \nfamilies.\n  So that is the fact. If you go to the record of what this Congress \nhas done so far, after the Senator gave his same speech last year, \nalmost verbatim, saying we are going to increase taxes by $1 trillion, \nwhich is his favorite number--I tell you, I do not think it would \nmatter what document we brought to this floor, the Senator would say \nthere is a trillion dollar tax increase because that is what he said \nlast year. Let's go back and check the record. What happened?\n  Since last year, this Congress, controlled by Democrats, has reduced \ntaxes on a net basis by $186 billion. It is not a statement. It is not \na speech. It is a fact. This Democratic Congress--after all the \nwarnings last year: We are going to increase taxes $1 trillion--has \nreduced taxes, in 1 year, by $186 billion.\n  Now, the Senator says: The CBO does not score tax gap provisions. \nWell, let's be clear. The CBO does not score tax provisions. That is \nthe job of the Joint Committee on Taxation. That is not the job of the \nCongressional Budget Office. All of us who serve on the Finance \nCommittee know that is the case. CBO does not score tax provisions. \nThat is the responsibility of the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n  The Senator has asserted we have a $400 billion tax increase. No, we \ndo not. We have $400 billion more in revenue over 5 years than the \nPresident has. That is a difference of 2.6 percent.\n  As I have asserted repeatedly, I believe additional revenue could be \nobtained by going after the tax gap, by going after these tax havens, \nby going after abusive tax shelters--a pool of money over this 5 years \nthat is some $2.7 trillion--$2.7 trillion. And that is probably a \nconservative estimate. So we would only have to get $1 in every $7 in \nthat pool to balance this budget, with no tax increase on anyone.\n  I believe the first thing that ought to be done is to go after those \nabusive tax havens, those abusive tax shelters, and that tax gap, where \nthe vast majority of us pay what we owe, but some number of us do not.\n  One other thing: The Senator referenced his budget. The fact is, he \nhas no budget. They have no budget. If our budget is so egregious, why \nhaven't they offered a substitute budget? They have not. They have not \noffered a budget. They did not offer a budget in the committee. They do \nnot have a budget on the floor. They do have the President's budget, \nand we have compared,\n\n[[Page S1845]]\n\nrepeatedly, our budget to the President's budget because it is the only \nalternative that is out there. They have chosen not to offer an \nalternative. That is their right.\n  The majority has the responsibility to offer a budget, but the \nminority, if they feel it is grievous, can offer a substitute, and they \nhave not.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we will go to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I think people watching this on C-SPAN or \nwherever they may be watching--from the Galleries--can be forgiven if \ntheir head is spinning after this back and forth of how their tax \ndollars are being spent.\n  At a time when our economy has undergone tremendous growth over the \nlast 5 years but has now hit a soft stretch, particularly in the \nhousing area, where we are talking about the credit crunch coming from \nthe subprime credit crisis, we have acted in a bipartisan way to try to \nget the economy moving again by passing a stimulus package. The \nSpeaker, the Republican leader of the House, and the White House have \njoined to try to do what can be done on a bipartisan basis to get the \neconomy moving again.\n  But the fact of the matter is, there is no better stimulus for the \nAmerican economy other than leaving people with their own hard-earned \nmoney to spend it as they see fit. That is what helps create jobs in \nthis country. The last thing we would want to do or should do is to see \ntaxes be increased, particularly on small businesses, which are the \nprimary job generator in this country, because it is through jobs and \nopportunity that people are able to achieve their own life and their \nown dreams and not depend on Government.\n  We ought to aspire to be a country where everyone can declare their \nown independence on Government and not say we must be more dependent on \nGovernment, which seems to be the conflicting visions we see play out \non the Senate floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a parliamentary \nquestion?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I will.\n  Mr. GREGG. I apologize for interrupting the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we proceed to the time on \nthe resolution so the time during the debate will run against the \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, unless \nstated otherwise, the time comes off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for his \ncourtesy.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, so the question presented by this budget \nis whether we are going to make it easier for the average American to \nmeet the obligations of their family budget or whether we are going to \ngrow the size of the Federal Government to the point that it makes it \nvirtually impossible for them to balance their own budget. This budget, \nunfortunately, does nothing to bring down the price of gasoline at the \npump or to make it more affordable to buy your own health insurance, \nwhich are the two primary cost drivers which are making it harder and \nharder for people working in this country to make ends meet.\n  Instead, what this resolution does is, it adds additional burdens \nonto the average taxpayer. I know, as I said a moment ago, the heads of \nthe people who are listening must be spinning trying to keep up with \nthe various arguments that are being made back and forth. But the fact \nof the matter is, this budget resolution is the blueprint which \nauthorizes additional activity, such as tax cuts.\n  The Baucus amendment is nothing more than an authorization, which if \nthere is no action to actually cut those taxes, nothing will happen. \nThat is what happened, that is what occurred last year. Under the very \npay-go principles, the pay-as-you-go principles--which is sound, \ncertainly, in theory, which says the Federal Government will not spend \nmoney it does not have, that it will pay as you go--that is a promise \nmade to the American people that is honored more in the breach than in \nthe observance.\n  I agree with the Senator from New Hampshire, the ranking member of \nthe Budget Committee. This class rhetoric of: Well, we are just going \nto tax the rich--let me give you an example of how that usually turns \nout. The best example I can think of is the alternative minimum tax, \nwhich back in the 1960s was designed to target about 155 taxpayers who \ndid not otherwise pay Federal income tax because of deductions they \nhad.\n  Well, as a result of the failure to index that tax, 155 taxpayers \nturned into, last year, 6 million taxpayers and would have turned into \n23 million middle-class taxpayers if we had not acted to provide some \ntemporary relief on a 1-year basis last year.\n  That is exactly what happens every time the Federal Government says: \nWe are just going to tax the rich. Because people will be amazed at how \nmuch the Federal Government considers ultimately the middle class, \nthose people who are the most productive in our society, those people \nwho create the jobs--by creating the small businesses that produce that \nopportunity--those are the producers who basically the Federal \nGovernment all too often seems at war with in the way we spend their \nhard-earned money.\n  Now, this budget does set out the framework over a period of 5 years. \nIt contemplates a source of revenue in order to pay the bills. Under \nthe pay-go principles that Congress has embraced, the only way those \nbills can be paid is if you have additional revenue or taxes to pay for \nthem. So that is why, under this resolution, you will see, for example, \n18 million seniors who will incur an additional tax burden of $2,200 \neach. You will see 43 million families incur an additional tax burden \nof $2,300 each. You will see the small businesses--27 million small \nbusinesses--incur additional tax obligations of $4,100 each.\n  Now, if our goal is to create jobs, it ought to be to lower the \nburden, to lower taxation, to lower the regulatory burden, and to \nreduce frivolous litigation to the point that small businesses can \nprosper and create jobs, not add to their burden. Additional taxes for \neach of these categories of taxpayers will do nothing but depress job \ncreation in this country, not encourage it.\n  But I have to tell you, the most discouraging part of this budget is \nnot what it does but what it fails to do. As the distinguished chairman \nof the Budget Committee knows, because he is the chief sponsor, along \nwith the ranking member, of a bill that creates a task force to deal \nwith runaway entitlement spending, this budget does nothing to deal \nwith $66 trillion of future obligations of the American Government \nunder entitlement spending, under Medicaid, Medicare, and Social \nSecurity.\n  As a matter of fact, if we do nothing, within the next decade we will \nsee both Medicare and Social Security become insolvent. That is \nbecause, irresponsibly, we are spending the surplus of Social Security \ntoday to try to balance the books of the Federal Government, by \nspending Social Security taxes that are paid by average American \nworkers. We are spending that in order to try to fund the operations of \nthe Federal Government today.\n  So what this plan does, by inaction, is it creates the additional \ndebt for our children of $27,000 each. I believe, if I am correct, the \nunfunded liabilities going into the future of $66 trillion, if you \ndivide that by each and every American man, woman, and child, would \nresult in $175,000 of debt for each of those men, women, and children. \nThis budget does exactly zero to address that.\n\n  I don't blame people across this country who look at Washington and \nare absolutely convinced that Washington is broken, because rather than \nsolving problems, rather than trying to work together on a bipartisan \nbasis to address these legitimate concerns, all they hear is more and \nmore talk and precious little action, and particularly when it comes to \nthe growing threat of entitlement spending and the increased debt that \nis passed down to our children and grandchildren.\n  I know we didn't get here overnight. This has been a long time \ncoming, but\n\n[[Page S1846]]\n\nI hope we have the courage to deal with this today because, frankly, it \nis no mystery why change is the most dominant word in our political \ndiscourse today. The status quo is broken because Washington is not \nworking, and people increasingly are turned off by what they see coming \nout of our Nation's Capital. They feel as if it is absolutely \nirrelevant to their lives or, if relevant, that Washington is burdening \nthem and not helping them with their day-to-day concerns.\n  By raising taxes by $1.2 trillion over the next 5 years, by \ndramatically increasing spending, by growing debt by $2 trillion, by \nplaying gimmicks with things such as pay as you go, which is more \nhonored in the breach than in the observance, by ignoring $66 trillion \nin unfunded liabilities into the future, this budget resolution is a \nfailure. We can and we should do better. We should focus on what we can \ndo to help the average American balance their family budget and not \npresent a budget that is a train wreck upon delivery. This budget will \nnot work. If the average American tried to conduct their business--if a \nsmall business man or woman tried to conduct their business as the \nFederal Government, they would find themselves bankrupt or else they \nwould find themselves in jail. It is only the Federal Government that \ncan operate this way. It is only the Federal Government that can \noperate in a way that every man, woman, and child in this country \ncannot, and we can do better. I urge my colleagues to do better by \nturning down this budget and coming up with one that will help the \naverage American balance their budget and not wreck the Federal budget \nin the process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Joint \nCommittee on Economics be recognized at 5 o'clock for 1 hour for their \nHumphrey-Hawkins testimony--5:15 I am now told--that the Joint Economic \nCommittee be recognized for 1 hour at 5:15. That would involve both the \nchairman of the committee and the ranking member of the committee for \nthat 1 hour.\n  Mr. GREGG. And the time would be equally divided.\n  Mr. CONRAD. And it would count against the resolution. That would be \ncorrect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Senator held up a chart about the \ngrowth of the debt. The exact same chart applies to the President's \nbudget--precisely the same. In fact, his is worse in terms of \nadditional debt burden put on the American people by the President's \nbudget compared to ours.\n  The Senator also raised the point, as did the ranking member earlier, \nof why we have not addressed in this 5-year budget resolution the long-\nterm entitlement challenges that we face as a nation, the shortfall \nbetween what we are spending and what we are raising, and the \nentitlement obligations this country has made but has not funded. Let \nme say I have never believed that the long-term entitlement challenges \nthat are 10, 15, 20-year problems are going to be resolved in a 5-year \nbudget resolution. That is why I joined with the ranking member of the \ncommittee on something where we do agree, which is an approach to \naddress these long-term imbalances by creating a working group of 16 \nMembers--8 Democrats, 8 Republicans--given the responsibility to come \nup with a plan to deal with our long-term challenges, and only if 12 of \nthe 16 could agree would legislation advance. If they could agree, 12 \nof the 16, then we would have a circumstance in which there would be a \nvote in both Houses of Congress. Not only would it involve Congress, it \nwould also involve the administration, because if we are going to \naddress these long-term challenges, it has to be done with all of the \nplayers at the table.\n  This is something Senator Gregg and I are advancing. I believe it is \nvery important. I believe it is the only way we are going to deal with \nthese long-term challenges. I don't believe it is ever going to happen \nin a 5-year budget resolution. No. 1, it is too short term. No. 2, it \nis typically carried just by one party. That is the way budgets are \naround here. These longer term challenges can only be addressed by both \nsides coming together and grappling with it in a joint way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the chairman outlining for the \nbody the initiative which he and I have pursued in the area of \nentitlement reform. I appreciate his leadership on that and I look \nforward to continuing to work with him on it. I certainly hope we can \npass it. It is one way to get at the fundamental fiscal imbalance our \ncountry is facing and the threat it represents to our children having \nan affordable government. But that should not mute or sideline \nlegitimate efforts to try to begin the process of controlling \nentitlement costs in a way that is fair and does not unfairly impact \nbeneficiaries.\n  The President did make suggestions in this area. The President's \nbudget is not on the floor. I would note that the reason we don't offer \na budget is for the same reasons the Senator from North Dakota didn't \noffer a budget when I was the chairman and the Republicans controlled \nthe Senate. In fact, I will quote him. He said:\n\n       The chairman--\n\n  At that time he was referring to myself--\n\n     well knows the majority has the opportunity to offer a \n     budget, and our responsibility is to critique the budget.\n\n  That is the way the Senator from North Dakota viewed the budget \nprocess and it is the way I view this budget process. But independent \nof that, the President's budget, as he sent it up, at least had \nguidelines which I thought were very constructive in the area of trying \nto control our costs in Medicare specifically. He had three different \nproposals. The first suggested that people with high incomes should pay \na larger burden of the cost of their drug benefit, Part D premium. \nToday, if you are Warren Buffett--we use Warren Buffett because he is \nnationally known, obviously, and is extraordinarily successful--if you \nare Warren Buffett, you qualify for the Part D drug program, but you \ndon't have to pay the full cost of that program. You don't pay a full \npremium. You pay about 25 percent of the cost of that premium. That \nmeans that John and Mary Jones, working at a restaurant in Epping, NH, \nor Sally and Fred Upton, working in a real estate firm in Concord, NH, \nare paying 75 percent of the cost of the drug benefit which goes to \nwealthy Americans, and specifically the example I used would be Warren \nBuffett. That seems totally inappropriate to me.\n\n  So the President sent up a proposal which said if you make more than \n$80,000 as an individual--which is a good deal of income for an \nindividual, a single individual, especially a retired individual--or if \nyou make more than $160,000 jointly, you and your spouse, if you are \nretired and you qualify for the drug benefit, then you have to pay \nmore. You don't have to pay the full cost even, you just have to pay \nmore. It was a reasonable proposal and it would help with the imbalance \nof the Medicare accounts.\n  He also suggested we should improve our use of technology within the \nhealth care industry, making more information more available to more \npeople so they can make better decisions. That scores, interestingly \nenough, as a savings, not surprisingly, because if more people have \nmore information about, first, the cost of a medical procedure and, \nsecond, the outcomes of a medical procedure at A hospital versus B \nhospital or at an A group of family practitioners versus a B group of \nfamily practitioners, they can make a thoughtful, intelligent decision \nas to which group they use, especially if they are a corporation with a \nfair number of people they are insuring or self-insuring. So that \nproposal was a step in the right direction toward cost containment and \nscored in a very positive way.\n  The President sent up ideas--ideas that made sense--and they didn't \nimpact ordinary beneficiaries. The only beneficiaries who were impacted \nunder the President's proposals were high-income beneficiaries who \nwould be asked to pay a fair share of the cost. I do think that type of \nreform should have been carried in this bill, and we will offer an \namendment--I will offer it or Senator Ensign, I suspect, will offer it \nbecause he offered it last year, Senator Ensign from Nevada--asking \nthat high-income individuals pay a fair share of\n\n[[Page S1847]]\n\ntheir drug benefit costs, and that is only right. Hopefully that will \nbe approved and put into this budget.\n  So there are initiatives that can occur here which I think should \noccur and we should not simply leave this massive fiscal imbalance \nwhich we are facing in these entitlement accounts to be fixed by this \ntask force which hopefully we will get in place, but we should start \nthe process now. This budget unfortunately punts that issue and has \nzero--zero--savings in the area of Medicare--net savings in the area of \nMedicare. In fact, it ends up with an expansion in entitlement costs of \nabout $466 billion.\n  Mr. President, at this point I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this is an area where there is agreement \nbetween the ranking member and myself.\n  This is a statement Senator Gregg made in the Senate Budget Committee \nabout the proposal he and I have made to deal with these long-term \nchallenges. This is a quote from Senator Gregg, and one I agree with:\n\n       We have come to the conclusion that everybody who puts \n     policy on the table first ends up getting it shot at by the \n     different interest groups, and that putting policy on the \n     table simply doesn't work in our institution; that the only \n     way to do this is--\n\n  Talking about the long-term gap between spending and revenue and the \ncommitment on entitlements--\n\n     the only way to do this is to create a procedure which is \n     viewed as absolutely fair, absolutely bipartisan and that \n     that decision by that task force will then be voted up and \n     down by the Congress.\n\n  The task force we are talking about which Senator Gregg and I have \nproposed would address the long-term fiscal imbalance, would include a \npanel of lawmakers and administration officials, 16 in number, with \neverything on the table, with fast-track consideration. That means \nCongress ultimately would have to vote, and that would require a \nbipartisan outcome because it would require a supermajority.\n  The ranking member referenced what the President has called for. Let \nme put up what the President has called for in his budget. He has \ncalled for savings from Medicare and Medicaid of $536 billion over the \n10 years of his budget proposal, but at the same time he calls for $2.4 \ntrillion of additional tax cuts, most of which goes to the wealthiest \namong us. Those are priorities we don't share. I don't think the answer \nis to cut Medicare over $500 billion, Medicare and Medicaid, at the \nsame time cutting taxes $2.4 trillion disproportionately on the \nwealthiest among us. Who would be affected by these Medicare \nreductions? I will tell my colleagues one group that would be affected: \nthe rural hospitals I serve as a representative from the State of North \nDakota in the Senate. Rural hospitals already on average have negative \nmargins. That means they are losing money. Why? Because they get one-\nhalf of the reimbursement rate of more urban hospitals to treat the \nvery same illnesses. In other words, if you have a heart attack, you go \nto an urban hospital, that hospital gets twice as much under Medicare \nto treat you as a rural hospital. Unfortunately, there are no rural \ndiscounts available to those rural hospitals. When they go to buy \ntechnology, they don't get a rural discount.\n  When they go to attract a doctor, they don't get a rural discount. In \nfact, it costs more to attract doctors to rural areas than to urban \nareas. That is proven by the MediPAC studies.\n  The proposal by the President would cut these hospitals. Can I tell \nyou what that would mean in my State? Hospitals would shut down. We \nhave more than 40 hospitals in my State. My State is a very large \nState, although sparsely populated. At least eight hospitals in my \nState would fail under these provisions. So, no, we don't support that. \nI certainly don't support it. I don't think most Democrats think this \nis the priority--cut Medicare, cut Medicaid, and at the same time you \nare cutting taxes on the wealthiest among us. I think many of the \nwealthy would say that should not be the priority.\n  Warren Buffet points out that he pays a lower effective tax rate than \nthe woman who is his secretary and than the woman who is his \nhousekeeper. Why? Because most of his income comes from dividends and \ncapital gains that are taxed at a 15-percent rate and his housekeeper \nis paying at a higher effective rate than that. How can that be fair? I \ndon't think it is. So even Warren Buffet doesn't think it is fair. He \nhas pointed this out on repeated occasions. He questioned, How can you \nhave an equitable tax system in which he, the richest man in the world, \nis taxed at a lower rate than his own housekeeper and his own \nsecretary?\n  Mr. President, we talk about debt. Here is what happens if all of the \nPresident's tax cuts are extended without being paid for. The debt \ntakes off like a scalded cat, the debt that is already out of control, \nalready burgeoning, already burdensome to future generations. If you \nextend all these tax cuts without paying for any of it, what happens? \nThe debt grows inexorably, and in a way that fundamentally threatens \nthe economic security of this country.\n  Mr. President, I hope very much that as we continue this debate we \nwill focus not just on the 5 years of this budget resolution but also \nthat we remind ourselves and the American people of the very daunting \nchallenges we face long term. This is one place where I am in complete \nagreement with the Senator from New Hampshire, the ranking member of \nthe committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate that explanation on Warren \nBuffett because I think it confirms my prior representation, which is \nthat this proposal increases capital gains and dividends. It is assumed \nby CBO that it does that. Language he has used relative to the view of \nthe Senator from North Dakota would imply the same also. I think it is \nimportant to know--not important, but I think the record ought to show \nthe charts that reflected the savings that were reflected in the \nPresident's proposals on Medicaid and Medicare were not reflective of \nthe proposal that came up on Medicare in this budget. They were a prior \nproposal.\n  Second, I think the proposals that came from the President involve \nthe Part D premium, IT, malpractice reform, all of which were \nreasonable, all of which could be accomplished, in my opinion, without \nhaving any significant impact on beneficiaries. Yes, they would impact \nproviders because, as a practical matter, the IT improvements would put \nmore pressure on providers to basically deliver good-quality services. \nEssentially what the administration proposed was to take savings that \noccur from significant improvements in IT and those savings which \nbasically end up in the pockets of the providers and say to the \nproviders that we will split the difference; you get half and we get \nhalf, but you are still going to get half of the savings you create out \nof IT. I don't think it affects the actual providers. It affects how \nmuch they save.\n  At this point, I see the Senator, the ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee, the former chairman, so I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to discuss with my colleagues one \nof the sources of revenue that the chairman of the Budget Committee \nclaims would bring in $100 billion per year to offset the cost of \nextending existing tax policy, and that would be the issue of shutting \ndown offshore tax havens.\n  I feel that I have been very aggressive as a member of the Finance \nCommittee in combating abusive tax shelters offshore or otherwise, so I \nam not here to find fault with anything in the budget about going after \nabusive offshore tax havens. But I do have a degree of disagreement on \nthe amount of revenue that will come in and whether this is the ``goose \nthat laid the golden egg'' that will solve all of the problems we have \nwith the budget.\n  So I have worked hard on this subject for a long period of time. In \nfact, I would go to a bill that we passed in 2004 called the JOBS Act. \nIt shut down the tax benefits for companies that enter into corporate \ninversion transactions and abusive domestic and cross-border leasing \ntransactions. The JOBS bill also contained a package of 21 anti-tax \nshelter provisions--not just 1 or 2 but 21.\n  Now, of course, I am ranking member of the Finance Committee, but \nhaving a good working relationship with Senator Baucus, we have been \ncontinuing\n\n[[Page S1848]]\n\nto look at all these abusive parts of the Tax Code, or these parts of \nthe Tax Code that are abused, and look at where we can get \nsome additional revenue. We are not out to tax people who would not \notherwise be taxed or to change the rate of taxation, and we are not \nout to get people who should pay more money than what we are paying if \nthey are doing it in a legal way. We are after subverting the Tax Code \nin a way that wasn't intended by Congress.\n\n  So in my role on the minimum wage small business tax relief bill that \npassed the Senate last year, we also included provisions that contained \nanti-tax loophole provisions, including shutting off tax benefits for \ncorporations that inverted--after Senator Baucus and I issued a public \nwarning on that issue that legislation would stop these deals, shutting \noff tax benefits from abusive foreign leasing transactions that weren't \ncaught in the passage of the JOBS bill, and, of course, doubling \npenalty and interest for offshore financial arenas.\n  In that particular bill, the minimum wage bill I referred to--it \nhappened to be that the House Democrats rejected our offsets. It was \nkind of surprising to me, but they did that. I use it as one example \nthat is a somewhat unrealistic account on these offsets in the budget \nresolution.\n  The chairman of the Budget Committee went on and on yesterday about \nabusive foreign sewer systems and city hall leasing deals on which U.S. \nbanks were claiming depreciation deductions. I didn't disagree. I led \nthe effort to shut down these deals on a prospective basis, which we \ndid in the 2004 bill, and I have continued to lead the effort to \nlegislatively deny future tax benefits for deals that were entered into \nbefore the 2004 legislation. But here again, people, for reasons I \ndon't know--and it was quite surprising to me--in the other body, the \nleadership of the Ways and Means Committee over there has continued to \nstop us cold. In fact, while the chairman of the Budget Committee was \nholding up a chart of a German sewer system during last year's budget \ndebate--I am referring to last year's budget debate, but it is a prop \nthat can be used this year as well--the chairman of the Ways and Means \nCommittee at that time was holding a hearing that sympathized with U.S. \nbanks that entered into these very same deals.\n  So I sure hope this distinguished chairman, my friend, the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, is not counting on any revenue for doing something \nthe House Democrats have rejected over and over again. But do you know \nwhat. My distinguished friend and chairman of the committee, it seems \nto me that he is counting on that revenue. Well, maybe he will have \nbetter luck a second time. We didn't do very well the first time.\n  The Budget Committee chairman is also continuously referring to the \nbillions of dollars that the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations \nsays we can get through offshore tax scams. Well, those of us who have \nto do this heavy lifting in this area, by passing tax legislation, know \nthat whatever numbers the Permanent Subcommittee comes up with have \ntended to be meaningless. We all know there is not a dollar's worth of \ntax legislation that can be based on the Permanent Subcommittee's \nestimates. That is not their expertise, nor their job. That falls into \nthe area of the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n  So having studied these issues and having legislated in these areas \nfor a long period of time, I consider my views on tax policy directed \nat tax shelters and tax havens to be credible. From what I can tell, \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee views the problem of offshore tax \nhavens in two categories: one, the ability of U.S. multinationals to \nshift income to these tax havens, and two, the evasion by U.S. citizens \nwho hide assets and income in these tax havens.\n  We have seen Democratic Senators, including the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, hold up a picture of the Ugland House, a law firm's \noffice building in the Cayman Islands, which is home to 12,748 \ncorporations. Senator Baucus and I asked the GAO to investigate the \nUgland House. In fact, the Government Accountability Office is down \nthere doing that right now. As often as that building is used to \njustify a pot of tax haven gold, it will be good to get an independent \nagency, such as the Government Accountability Office, to give us an \nobjective perspective on this issue.\n  I would like to give Senators some background on where that picture \ncomes from and what issue it is aimed at. The picture comes from an \narticle published in the Bloomberg Market, August 2004, titled ``The \n$150 Billion Shell Game.'' The article focused on the ability of U.S. \nmultinationals to shift income to low-tax jurisdictions through \ntransfer pricing.\n  ``Transfer pricing'' is the term for how affiliated corporations set \nprices for transactions between those corporations. Transfer pricing is \nimportant because it determines how much profit is subject to tax in \nthe different jurisdictions involved in related party transactions.\n  The $150 billion figure is an academic estimate of the annual amount \nof profits that corporations shift outside the United States with \nimproper--and I emphasize ``improper''--transfer pricing--in other \nwords, trying to violate the law.\n  One of the Democrats' revenue raisers that is still on the shelf \npurports to target this transfer pricing problem. But you would not \nknow it by looking at the language of the proposal because it doesn't \nmake any changes to our transfer pricing rules. Instead, the proposal \nwould eliminate deferral for income of any U.S. multinational foreign \nsubsidiaries incorporated in certain black-listed jurisdictions. It is \ncalled the tax haven CFC proposal.\n  Deferrals have been part of our Tax Code since 1918. Deferral means \nthat U.S. multinationals do not pay tax on the active income of their \nforeign subsidiaries until that income is repatriated to the United \nStates. Passive income is subject to tax on a current basis. Deferral \nonly applies to active income.\n\n  I agree with the premise of this proposal that the U.S. \nmultinationals should pay their fair share of U.S. taxes. I think I \nproved that with closing some of these tax shelters and improper \noffshore activities in previous legislation. I have already talked \nabout that issue. U.S. multinationals who use improper transfer pricing \ndo so to obtain the benefit of deferral on profits that economically \nshould be subject to tax in the United States on a current basis.\n  Here is my quote from this Bloomberg article:\n\n       We have to get on top of corporate accounting and \n     manipulation of corporate books for the sole purpose of \n     reducing taxes.\n\n  My view is that stronger transfer pricing rules and stronger \nenforcement of those rules is the way to target this problem in our \ncurrent international tax system.\n  The IRS is taking steps to tighten our transfer pricing rules. For \nexample, the IRS has proposed regulations that would overhaul the rules \nfor the so-called cost-sharing arrangements. These are arrangements by \nwhich multinationals of our country are able to transfer intangible \nproperty to subsidiaries in low-tax jurisdictions. Based on the volume \nof complaining I have seen from lobbyists and their leveling it at the \nTreasury and the IRS, the proposed IRS regulations would go a long way \nto prevent this artificial income shifting. I hope to see these \nregulations finalized soon, and I believe they will be. Others have a \nwhole different view. They would eliminate deferrals altogether.\n  Another quote in the Bloomberg article succinctly states this view. \nThis is a quote from Jason Furman. He is a former aide to Senator \nKerry:\n\n       American companies should pay taxes on their profits in the \n     same way whether they earn them in Bangalore or Buffalo.\n\n  That is where these proposals to eliminate or curtail deferrals on a \npiecemeal basis are headed. They are headed to the complete elimination \nof deferrals for U.S. multinationals.\n  Without a significant corporate tax-rate reduction--and thank God \nsome candidates for President are talking about that. There are Members \nof this body who believe we ought to reduce the corporate tax rate so \nwe can be competitive on an international basis but without a \nsignificant corporate tax rate reduction. Eliminating deferrals \naltogether would have the effect of exporting our high tax rates and \nputting U.S. multinationals at a competitive disadvantage in the global \nmarketplace.\n  Understand, our corporate tax rate is the second highest in the \nworld. We are\n\n[[Page S1849]]\n\nnot even learning from Germany yet, a socialist country that decided \nthey have to reduce their marginal tax rate to be competitive in the \nworld market. Ireland found that out in 1986 and has economically \nadvanced since they did that. Everybody understands our tax rates make \nus uncompetitive. Do we want to make it worse so we lose more jobs? I \ndon't think so, but I don't think people have thought about it.\n  The Senate is on record as wanting to protect the competitiveness of \nU.S. businesses in the global marketplace. The Senate passed the \nAmerican Jobs Creation Act of 2004. I referred to that bill before in \nmy remarks this afternoon. That bill contains several international \nsimplification provisions, and it passed with a vote of 69 Senators, \nincluding 24 Democrats. The Senate version of the JOBS bill, which also \ncontained these provisions, received a vote of 92 Senators, including \n44 Democrats.\n  There has been a longstanding debate about whether our international \ntax system should be fundamentally changed, and that is a legitimate \ndebate. Some say the transfer pricing regime used by virtually every \nmajor country is broken and calls for taxing all foreign income on a \ncurrent basis. Others argue for completely exempting active foreign \nincome under a territorial system, as many of our trading partners do \nand, consequently, one of the reasons behind our uncompetitiveness. But \nwe want to have that debate, and if we do, then it is a fair debate.\n  The budget resolution does not contain specific proposals, but if the \nDemocratic record is assumed on offshore tax issues, then we can count \non a lively debate from this side to eliminate deferrals because we do \nnot intend to do anything to make our businesses in America that create \njobs more uncompetitive. We have to do things to make us more \ncompetitive.\n  We have already seen what the House Democrats would do, and I am a \nreferring to points I referenced already this afternoon. I may disagree \nwith most of the international proposals in that bill that was referred \nto as ``the mother of all tax bills'' last fall--that is what the \nchairman of the Ways and Means Committee called his tax reform plan--\nbut at least the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee raises the \nissue in an intellectually honest way, setting the stage then for \nfundamental reform and also proposes to lower the corporate tax rate to \n30.5 percent. That rate may still be too high, but at least the Ways \nand Means Committee chairman recognizes the concern that I laid out \nearlier about exporting our high tax rates.\n  The piecemeal cutbacks on deferral for active foreign income that we \nhave seen in the Senate would do nothing but complicate the Tax Code \nand create opportunities for tax planning around these cutbacks.\n  The other offshore issue identified by the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee is U.S. tax evasion by individual taxpayers who hide their \nassets and income in foreign bank accounts and foreign corporations. \nLet's go back to the beginning of the Tax Code in 1913. Our Tax Code \nhas subjected U.S. citizens to tax on their income wherever it is made \nworldwide. No matter what the Internet purveyors of tax evasion say, \nthis principle cannot be avoided by putting passive assets and income \ninto foreign corporations. The Tax Code has rules to prevent that. \nTaxpayers who willingly violate these rules are guilty of tax fraud \nand, in many cases, criminal tax fraud.\n  The problem of offshore tax evasion is not that our laws permit it; \nthe problem is there are some taxpayers who are intent on cheating and \nhiding their income from the Internal Revenue Service.\n  The IRS has been successful in catching many of these tax cheats, but \nmore can be done. The IRS has difficulty detecting tax evasion and \nobtaining the information necessary to enforce our tax laws. One \nimportant tool for the IRS is information exchanged with other \njurisdictions. Our double-tax treaties contain an article on \ninformation exchange designed to help the IRS obtain quality \ninformation to enforce our tax laws.\n\n  In addition, administrations, past and present, have entered into \nover 20 tax information exchange agreements with jurisdictions that are \noften referred to as tax havens. We are seeing this information \nexchange network in action as we speak, providing the IRS and other \ncountries with information related to the use of bank accounts in \nLiechtenstein. Sensible solutions to this problem should aim to improve \non our tax information exchange network and not put that network at \nrisk or the efforts at risk.\n  Underreported income is the largest piece of the tax gap. We should \nkeep in mind that hiding assets and income from the IRS is not just an \noffshore tax problem, it is not an offshore tax haven problem; it may \nalso be an onshore problem. In fact, it is an onshore problem.\n  An article in USA Today last year noted that ``there is a thriving \nmini industry that has capitalized on real or perceived gaps in \ndomestic and corporation laws and virtually nonexistent Government \noversight to promote some U.S. States as secrecy rivals of offshore \nhavens.''\n  The picture of the Ugland House in the Cayman Islands that I referred \nto earlier makes for good grandstanding, but as I am sure the \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee is aware, there are also \noffice buildings in some States that are listed as addresses for \nthousands of companies that are incorporated in those States for \nsimilar reasons as those incorporated in the Cayman Islands: secrecy of \nownership and a permissive regulatory environment. Whatever additional \nsolutions the Finance Committee comes up with to shine sunlight on tax \nevaders will need to consider both offshore and onshore evasion of \ntaxes.\n  I emphasize that I am all for shutting down inappropriate tax \nbenefits from offshore arrangements. The chairman of the Budget \nCommittee has said he thinks we could get, I believe, $100 billion from \nthis source. I have not seen any proposals scored by the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation that come close to bringing in this kind of \nmoney, and the Joint Committee on Taxation is the official scorer. The \nlast score I have seen for a tax haven CFC proposal is about $1.5 \nbillion per year. The more fundamental ``mother'' bill that I referred \nto from the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee in the other body \nwould raise about $10 billion per year.\n  I wish to emphasize to my colleagues another point. Each of these \nproposals that would eliminate or curtail deferral involve tax policy \nchanges that raise taxes, which is the last place the distinguished \nchairman of the Budget Committee said he wanted to go to raise revenue.\n  On the offshore evasion issue, Senators Levin, Coleman, and Obama \nhave introduced a bill that contains several proposals, and these \nproposals are aimed at offshore tax havens. Yet, again, I have not seen \na Joint Committee on Taxation score of that bill, and they are the \nofficial scorer.\n  Once again, it will be the Finance Committee's responsibility to come \nup with real, sensible, effective proposals that combat offshore and \nonshore tax evasion, which I am glad to do, but the likelihood that \nthey will be scored by the Joint Committee on Taxation to bring in the \nkind of money assumed in this budget resolution is very remote at best.\n  Given these facts, it should be obvious how much of a shell game is \ngoing on and how unreal this budget resolution is.\n  Mr. President, as my colleagues know, within the Finance Committee, \nwe have jurisdiction over health care issues. I wish to address those \nhealth care issues in this budget resolution as well.\n  The biggest health care issue in this budget resolution is a stealth \nprovision--stealth. You cannot see it, but it is there. And I am going \nto talk about the issue of reconciliation, a process that was supposed \nto be used to save money, but I think in a stealthy way, before this is \ndone and out of conference, it is going to be used to increase \nexpenditures.\n  It is true there are no reconciliation instructions for spending in \nthe Senate resolution, but there is in the House version, and that is \ngoing to make it conferenceable.\n  Last year there was a single committee instruction in the House-\npassed resolution but not in the Senate-passed resolution. The final \nconference version last year deferred to the House, no reconciliation. \nSo I am willing to bet that the House instructions will be\n\n[[Page S1850]]\n\nthe final budget that comes back from the House-Senate budget \nconference.\n  Truthfully, it makes no sense for the House to have reconciliation \ninstructions in the first place. The House does not need reconciliation \nprotection. The Speaker and the Rules Committee make sure the House is \nstrictly controlled by a majority vote. Reconciliation is only \nimportant for the purposes of the Senate to avoid filibuster, to avoid \na 60-vote supermajority, to get to finality in the process, limiting \nthe role of the minority. And, remember, the Senate is the only \ninstitution in our political system where minority rights are meant to \nbe protected and are, in fact, protected.\n  I do not think the other side wants a debate in the Senate about \nreconciliation, so they have hidden the reconciliation instructions in \nthe House bill so they can drop it in their final budget. Since I am \npretty confident it will be there in the final budget, I want to bring \nattention to the problems this creates as we consider all the work, and \nthree-fourths of it comes out of the Finance Committee over the next \nfew months of this session.\n  It is true, of course, that reconciliation can be a very useful and \npowerful tool for actually making policy to reign in Government \nspending. Reconciliation can be used to pass controversial reductions \nin entitlement spending. By design, the reconciliation process greatly \nreduces the role of the minority, be it Democrats for 12 years prior to \nnow or Republicans now. But let us review the basics on how to make law \naround here. To make law, not only does Congress have to pass it but \nthe President has to sign it or you have to have votes to override a \nveto. In the last 20 years, precisely four vetoes have been \noverridden--not a very high percentage.\n  Pursuing an override strategy is an uphill battle as anyone such as \nSenator Baucus and I, who have worked so hard on the SCHIP bill last \nyear, found out. To have the President sign it means the bill will have \nto be bipartisan. The President is not going to sign a partisan bill. \nThe President will not sign a bill that lacks involvement and support \nfrom the minority as well as the majority.\n  Since reconciliation cuts Republicans out of the process, it ain't \ngoing to work. Likewise, what do you have to have to override a veto? \nRepublicans, of course. About 16 in the Senate and 60 in the House if \nyou are going to get anything done. Since reconciliation is a partisan \nprocess, it is passed with only partisan support, it is pretty clear it \nwill not work. It will be a pointless political exercise. It will not \nbecome law, plain and simple.\n  If you want to make law around here, it has to be bipartisan. That \nmeans in this body involving the Republicans, and since you will need \nRepublicans to make law, you do not need reconciliation to get a bill \npassed in the first place. If the effort is bipartisan, you do not need \nthe restrictive rules of reconciliation to get it done. I think Senator \nBaucus and I, working together in this legislative process in this \nbody, have proved that over and over and over in the 8 years we have \nbeen working together.\n  What we are considering today is not about making policy. So what is \nthe point of it? Well, I think it is about playing politics. We are in \nan election year. In fact, it is a Presidential election. We all know \nthe stakes are very high. So why on Earth should anyone believe that \ntrying to move a partisan Medicare and Medicaid reconciliation bill \nmakes any sense at all?\n  Exactly what bill does the majority want to pass that will not have \nbroad bipartisan support? Fortunately, the chairman of the House Ways \nand Means Committee answered that question for all of us. He confirmed \nthat he wants to include the House-passed Medicare bill from last year \nin reconciliation, a bill better known in the health care circles as \nthe CHAMP Bill, acronym C-H-A-M-P, CHAMP.\n  You may be wondering what it is in the CHAMP bill that would not pass \nunless it would be included in reconciliation. Fortunately, there is an \nanswer. The House CHAMP bill includes drastic cuts to home health care, \nto hospital care, and skilled nursing care. The House CHAMP bill also \nwould end availability of Medicare Advantage plans and their extra \nbenefits in most of rural America. It would also drastically cut \nbenefits for rural seniors who are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans \nthroughout the country. It would also cut other benefits such as \npreventive health benefits that seniors rely on when they enroll in \nMedicare Advantage plans.\n  The House CHAMP bill would also result in higher out-of-pocket costs \nfor lower income seniors who are enrolled in Medicare Advantage. The \nHouse CHAMP bill also has some changes in the State Children's Health \nInsurance Program that merit further discussion, to be sure. It would \nturn the capped SCHIP block grant program into an uncapped entitlement \nprogram. Childless adults would be allowed to stay on SCHIP \nindefinitely. Remember, we had that debate last year. Everybody said a \nchildren's health insurance bill is for children, not for adults. We \ndid things in this body to make sure adults were not covered by the \nchildren's health insurance bill because it cheats children.\n  So why would you want to go back to something we debated and carried \nby a two-thirds vote in this body? And it would add coverage for \nimmigrants who have come here illegally to the SCHIP program as well.\n  None of those provisions were included in the bipartisan package we \nworked out together last year. I have got a chart here that will \nemphasize this. It is the whole to-do list that is hidden in their \nagenda for the year. It is hidden in their stealth plan to do a \nreconciliation bill this year.\n  One logical question you might ask is: Why would they be thinking \nabout using reconciliation this year? The answer is simple. They know \nthey do not have the votes to pass these kinds of dramatic Medicare \ncuts and they do not have the votes for these bad policies we changed \nin SCHIP last year. So they want to force it through the process by \nstuffing it into a partisan reconciliation bill.\n  Now, focusing back on Medicare, let us consider what is at stake. We \nhave until the end of June to pass a Medicare bill that the President \nsigns into law. If the Democratic leadership insists on using budget \nreconciliation for this Medicare bill, they will fail to get a bill \nenacted. Failure to get this done by June 30 has serious consequences \nfor seniors and disabled Americans who rely on this important \nGovernment program we call Medicare for their health care. Failure to \nget the bill done and signed means that severely disabled and injured \nMedicare beneficiaries will not be able to get the therapy they need \nbeginning in July. Failure means that sorely needed doctors and other \nhealth care professionals in rural areas are going to see drastic \nreductions in their Medicare reimbursement. It means low-income \nbeneficiaries who need help with their Part B premium will not be able \nto get it because the Qualified Individuals Program in Medicare will \nhave expired. It means patients with end stage renal disease who need \ndialysis will still be in the system in need of payment reform. \nNecessary reforms are needed to improve how end stage renal disease \nfacilities are paid so they have stronger incentives for improved \ncritical outcomes and enhanced quality of care.\n\n  Reforms are also needed to eliminate incentives for the overuse of \ndrugs in that program. It means that seniors' reliance on ambulance \nservices in rural areas will be put at risk because of underpayments \nfor rural ambulances. It means that beginning in July, Medicare \nbeneficiaries will have their health care threatened when family \ndoctors, surgeons, medical specialists, and nurse practitioners all \nacross the country will have Medicare payments cut by more than 10 \npercent.\n  I hope you realize how demoralizing that will be to doctors in this \ncountry when they face a 10-percent reduction. In many areas, doctors \nare already in short supply. With a 10-percent pay cut, some may solve \ntheir problem by not accepting Medicare beneficiaries. New \nbeneficiaries may also have trouble finding a doctor.\n  Failure also means other important initiatives will not get done. It \nmeans that legislation to strengthen incentives for physicians to use \nelectronic prescribing will not happen. This means we will continue to \nhave higher rates of dangerous medical errors, that people have their \nlives put at risk.\n  It means our Nation's seniors and disabled Americans will still be in \nthe health care system that rewards poor\n\n[[Page S1851]]\n\nquality care, because enacting hospital value-based purchasing in \nMedicare is not going to happen. These are some of the reasons why we \nshould not be thinking about reconciliation as a way to avoid this set \nof outcomes in July. I hope we can set aside this reconciliation \ncharade. I hope we can continue to work in this body in a bipartisan \nway, as we have a reputation for doing in the Finance Committee, to get \na Medicare bill passed and signed by the President by the end of June.\n  It is quite clear: The stakes for failure are too high. So let us not \nkid ourselves about including a reconciliation instruction in the final \nbudget, meaning what comes out of conference. It is not about making \npolicy. No one should mistake it for a serious effort. It is about \njamming a bill through Congress and forcing the President to veto it. \nIt is about making politics that threaten the Medicare Program and the \nseniors who rely on it. I will have nothing to do with that sort of a \nprocess. I do not think very many people on this side of the aisle will \neither.\n  What we are considering today is not about making policy. Then what \nis the point? It is politics. If we are going to have a serious effort \nat legislating, I hope the other side would decide not to pursue a \npartisan reconciliation bill. Instead we need to work out a bipartisan \nbill that can become law.\n  The bottom line is that reconciliation is a bad idea. It is partisan. \nIt will not become law. We have serious work to do before the end of \nJune, and a sham political reconciliation exercise is not getting us \nany closer to getting the job done.\n  While the stealth reconciliation instruction is the most disturbing \nfacet of this budget, it is not the only problematic health care \nprovision. The budget misses the opportunity to continue the \nbipartisanship that was forged in the Senate over the State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program last year that passed this body, sometimes \nwith 69 votes.\n  Last year, SCHIP reauthorization was a top health priority. It was a \ndifficult and it was a bruising battle. But the $35 billion compromise \nbill garnered 68 votes in the Senate. It was a true show of \nbipartisanship.\n  Now, rather than come back to the second session of this Congress to \nroll up their sleeves and finish the job, it looks to me as if the \nDemocratic majority is abandoning that bipartisan work from last year.\n  Now you might say, how do I know that? Well, it is very clear, \nbecause the budget before us returns to the $50 billion reserve fund \nfor SCHIP from last year's Democratic budget, a figure that was soundly \nrejected by the Senate last year in the compromise that was put before \nus that got those 68 votes.\n  My colleagues know that a key feature of last year's SCHIP deal was \nto cap spending at $35 billion. But they did not include the $35 \nbillion for SCHIP that had bipartisan support. So where, then, is the \nbipartisan spirit on SCHIP that was here last year? Why is it not here \nthis year?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, I will yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill.) The Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I asked that same question myself. Why do we not put in \nthe $35 billion figure? And the answer was: It is up to $50 billion so \nit would accommodate the $35 billion compromise, but it also was with \nthe understanding that a year later, maybe that would need to be $36 or \n$37 billion, to have the same force and effect.\n  I would say to the Senator, there was no intention here to leave an \nimpression that we were not eager to continue the bipartisan effort.\n  I wish to salute the Senator. He made an enormous effort, as did \nSenator Baucus, Senator Rockefeller, and Senator Hatch. They spent many \nhours putting together a bipartisan agreement on SCHIP. We certainly \ndon't want to in any way leave the impression that we don't want to \npursue that again.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Senator from North Dakota backed us on that effort, \nand I thank him for that. And the extent to which you say you would be \nwilling to work, I assume you are speaking as a person, for $35 billion \ninstead of 50, I accept that. But I am saying for the public who is \nlooking at this document we call the budget resolution, that has $50 \nbillion in it. You draw other conclusions.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If the Senator will continue to yield, that is why the \nlanguage in the resolution says up to 50. Again, I say to my \ncolleagues, I have every intention to pursue again the effort that you \nand the chairman of the committee pursued so vigorously last year.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator. I am happy to yield to the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. In order to accomplish the goals the Senator wishes to \naccomplish and which have been subscribed to by the chairman of the \ncommittee, you wouldn't need reconciliation to accomplish that, would \nyou?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. No, you would not. In fact, it detracts from it. \nBecause too often reconciliation tends to be a partisan issue, and we \nwill never get SCHIP through here that is not bipartisan. I think you \nare making the case that I have taken a long time to make, that \nreconciliation is not a process we need to accomplish most of the major \ngoals in some of these areas that there is bipartisan agreement to \nreach.\n  Mr. GREGG. That was my point. I think the Senator from Iowa has made \nan excellent case for why this reconciliation, I think he called it a \nstealth vehicle floating around here, should not be used. It is \ninappropriate and certainly undermines the integrity of the process to \nuse reconciliation for this type of an issue.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Based upon what the Senator from North Dakota said \nabout SCHIP, I will not go on making my case about that. He has pointed \nout what the intention is, which is not to preclude something less than \n$50 billion, and that brings us back to the possibility of a bipartisan \ncompromise, assuming we don't have reconciliation.\n  I will go on then to certain CMS regulations and how they are treated \nin the budget resolution. I know some people have concerns with the CMS \nMedicaid regulations. I will not argue that these regulations are \nperfect. In fact, I have written for my constituents a lot of letters \nto CMS raising questions about some of these regulations. However, the \nregulations do address areas where there are problems in Medicaid. \nSomehow I read this budget resolution as not recognizing those real \nproblems. States don't have clear guidance and could be inappropriately \nspending taxpayers' dollars. We ought to make sure that since Medicaid \nis a Federal-State program, that we have 50 States to deal with, they \nought to have as much assurance as they can have in our basic law and \nregulations as to what they can do and not do. We ought to be concerned \nthat they know that. Because if they do something wrong, we pay over \nhalf. In my State, we pay 62 percent of the cost of Medicaid. So let's \ntalk about how many dollars might be involved.\n  The budget resolution provides for $1.7 billion that is going to be \naddressed by these regulations. The amount is only to delay the \nregulations until the end of March of next year in hopes the next \nadministration will pull back those regulations. Of course, that is \nwhat the people who are supporting this provision are hoping for. What \nwould it cost if we tried to completely prevent these regulations from \never taking effect? Not the $1.7 billion that is in this budget \nresolution to get us through to March of next year. It would actually \ncost taxpayers $19.7 billion over 5 years and $48 billion over 10 \nyears. Let me emphasize that, $48 billion over 10 years. It is a farce, \nfrom my position, an absolute farce for anyone to argue that all those \ndollars are being appropriately spent and that Congress ought to walk \naway from these issues, forget about what CMS is trying to do to bring \nsome rationale to the spending of taxpayer dollars.\n  CMS still has a fundamental responsibility to combat fraud, to \nprevent inappropriate spending, and to protect the integrity of the \nMedicaid Program. This budget resolution tells CMS to stop your work. \nTake the rest of the year off. Your work is no longer necessary.\n  This is a serious mistake. What we ought to do is have an instruction \nthat requires the Finance Committee to replace the regulations. Instead \nof making the regulations go away, the Finance Committee ought to be \ntasked\n\n[[Page S1852]]\n\nwith replacing them with a policy that fixes the problems. That is what \nwe should be doing for the American taxpayer.\n  So let's review what we have in the budget resolution. First, we have \na stealth reconciliation provision that promises to place politics over \ngetting important policies accomplished. Second, we have an SCHIP \nprovision that abandons the bipartisan progress made in 2007, \nrecognizing the dialog I had with the chairman of the Budget Committee \non that point, after I made my point. Third, we have a Medicaid \nprovision that carelessly abandons the integrity of programs in several \nkey areas, costing, if it would stay in place forever, $48 billion over \n10 years. With spring training in full swing, I would like to borrow a \nbaseball analogy. That is one, two, three--well, you know all the rest.\n\n  I have some comments I wish to make about the provisions that might \nbe offered in what is called the tax relief measures and particularly \nthose that might not be included in an amendment that is going to be \noffered from the other side of the aisle. I would like to define for my \ncolleagues some of the widely applicable expiring tax relief provisions \nthat are not going to be covered by an amendment that I think is going \nto be offered by my friend from Montana, Senator Baucus, in an \namendment he has. I know already that Senator Gregg, the ranking \nRepublican on the Budget Committee, has pointed this out, that the \nlower rates on capital gains and dividends would rise after 2010, under \nthe pending amendment. That means that lower income taxpayers', those \nin the 10- and 15-percent tax brackets, capital gains rates rise from \nthe current zero rate to 10 percent.\n  It means for dividends for the same group, the tax rate would go from \nzero rate to either 10 or 15 percent. Why would anybody want to \ndiscourage people who are in those brackets, usually lower income \nearning people, from having to pay a higher rate of tax on their \nsavings, when the rate of savings in this country is at such a low \nlevel compared to other countries? In fact, last year it was a negative \nsavings rate for all America. For all other taxpayers, though, the \ncapital gains rate would go up 33 percent, from 15 percent to 20 \npercent. For those taxpayers, the dividend rate would go from 15 \npercent to as high as 39.6 percent on dividends as opposed to capital \ngains.\n  As important are marginal tax rate hikes that would kick in after the \nyear 2010. Here I am talking about all the tax brackets above the 15-\npercent bracket. We have a chart that tells exactly what is going to \nhappen with each of these and how many families and individuals are \nbeing affected by these tax rates--who are going to have the tax rate \nincrease. The chart shows the current law brackets and the number of \ntax-paying families and individuals in each bracket. The data is the \nlatest available from the Internal Revenue Service Statistics of Income \nOffice. There are four brackets above 15 percent. The first is a 25-\npercent bracket which contains 22 million families and individuals. The \nnext bracket is 28 percent. There are almost 4 million tax-paying \nfamilies and individuals in that bracket. The next bracket is the 33-\npercent bracket. There are 1.5 million tax-paying families and \nindividuals in that bracket. And the top bracket is 35 percent, and in \nthat 35-percent bracket is almost a million people. This is a group \nwhom you will hear most about from the other side. Even it is a sizable \ngroup, 963,000 people. It contains a lot of stable and long-term small \nbusiness owners who create most of our jobs. The other side would like \nto leave the impression that these are nothing but Wall Street moguls.\n  If we were to raise this rate, as proposed, to 39.6 percent, the \nsmall business owners would be facing a 13-percent penalty vis-a-vis \nthe largest corporations in the land.\n  Now where do you get the idea that is good for America, that small \nbusinesspeople, sole proprietors filing individual taxes and in the \nbusiness of creating jobs, ought to pay 13 percent more than what \ncorporations pay? In fact, the whole purpose of the 2001 tax bill was \nto make sure there was parity between sole entrepreneurships creating \njobs and corporations creating jobs. We are talking about a small group \nof people, 963,000.\n  If you total the number of tax-paying families and individuals \naffected by these marginal rate increases, it is a total of 28 million \nfamilies and individuals. Keep in mind, as I said yesterday, that is a \ngroup of tax-paying families who start paying on taxable income of \n$63,000, and for individuals it starts for as low as $32,000 of taxable \nincome. This large group of taxpayers would face various marginal rate \nhikes, if the policy underlying the pending amendment were to become \nlaw.\n  The better way to deal with these current law levels of taxation \nwould be to make them permanent because permanency of tax policy is the \nbest tax policy that is going to create the most jobs.\n  There will be an amendment to be offered by Senator Graham that \nensures capital gains and dividend rates stay at the current low levels \nfor lower income taxpayers. The Graham amendment will ensure that \nroughly 28 million families and individuals would not face marginal tax \nrate increases after that.\n  For those Members waiting to speak, I have one more fairly short \ncomment I wish to make on another provision in the bill that was put \nin, in committee. I come before you to discuss payment limitations, \nmeaning payments to farmers.\n\n  For years I have been leading an effort to put a very hard cap on the \namount of Federal subsidies going to farmers. Last year, as everybody \nknows, I stepped aside. I wish to say I graciously stepped aside during \nthe budget debate when--\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I will yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, let me say there have been a number of \nexamples last year and this year of what I think distinguishes the \nSenate. The actions by the Senator from Iowa last year were an example \nof courtesy and graciousness that I will never forget. I want to say \npublicly, as I have said before, how very much I appreciate what the \nSenator did last year to withhold an amendment that would have \notherwise taken down the budget. It was an act of great courtesy, and I \nthank the Senator for it.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Well, Madam President, I appreciate the Senator's kind \nwords. I am going to kind of use some words that I think he spoke to me \nlast year, and I would not say they are an absolute quote, but it went \nsomething like this: Chuck--that is my first name. This was in private. \nYou do not call us by our first name on the floor of the Senate. But \nsomething like this was said to me: Chuck, hold off on this. We will do \nthis on the farm bill in 2007.\n  Well, we did do the farm bill in 2007, but we do not have it done \nyet. Anyway: Chuck, hold off on this. We will do this on the farm bill \nin 2007. You know you have the votes there.\n  So I backed off and I waited, as has been verified by the chairman of \nthe committee. Everyone knows what happened. His colleague, Senator \nDorgan of North Dakota, and I worked hard over a period of a couple \nyears to be able to offer an amendment of a $250,000 hard cap to the \ncommodity programs on the Senate floor to the farm bill. Do you know \nwhat. We had a majority. We had 56 Senators who voted to support this \nhard cap. I can tell by looking at some other Senators here, we \nprobably had 58, but there were reasons otherwise for voting. But \nleadership--and all I can say is in a generic way--leadership imposed a \nsupermajority requirement on the amendment. We did not have 60 votes. \nSo if you do not have 60 votes around here, sometimes you do not get \nanything done.\n  At this point there is no guarantee we are even going to have a farm \nbill. I think we will, but I cannot guarantee it. I do not like to say \nthis because I am very hopeful that we will, but there are a lot of \nhurdles to jump before we get there. We have not been able to come up \nwith acceptable offsets that the administration can agree to. We have \nnot been able to find a structure for the Finance Committee's \nassistance that the House can live with. The House has not even named \nconferees, so we have not even begun to engage in the very serious, \nsubstantive policy issues that get us to finality, even though there is \na lot of talk going on and there are a lot of meetings going on. So \nthis year, we are back where I\n\n[[Page S1853]]\n\nwas a year ago on the budget. Last week, Senator Allard and I offered \nan amendment on payment limits during committee consideration of the \nbudget resolution. This amendment would limit commodity payments and \nallocate the savings to nutrition. The amendment was agreed to by a \nbipartisan vote of 13 to 9.\n  Here I am to put everybody on notice that this $250,000 hard cap \nshould be carried through to the conference report. I want to have an \nadequate safety net for family farmers in the tradition of farm \nprograms for six, seven, or eight decades, where it was targeted toward \nsmall- and medium-sized producers, people who maybe cannot ``weather \nthe storm'' as the big gigantic farmers can. That storm can be natural \nor it can be politically instituted or it can be internationally \ninstituted--a lot of things beyond the control of the family farmer. So \nwe have had a safety net to guarantee a stable supply of food for our \npeople, both for social cohesion as well as for national defense.\n  Now, in recent years, however, assistance to farmers has come under \nincreased scrutiny by urban communities and the press.\n  Do we have a chart? Yes, we have a chart here I wish to have you look \nat.\n  The law that is now being administered maybe has unintended \nconsequences, but they are real consequences. The law creates a system \nthat is clearly out of balance. If we look at the results posted on \nthis chart, we have a system where 10 percent of the farmers--the \nbiggest farmers--get 73 percent of the benefits out of the farm \nprogram, and the top 1 percent gets 30 percent. I am not saying these \ncorporate farms should not have a safety net like everyone else. This \namendment is not means testing anybody. But it is saying at some point: \nEnough is enough. We have to set a hard cap, a hard level of payments \nthat is equitable to all producers, no matter their size, with emphasis \nupon helping small- and medium-sized farmers.\n  My amendment adopted in committee and included in this resolution \nwill help revitalize the farm economy for young people, at the same \ntime saving taxpayers money or, better yet, using that money in \nnutrition where it will do some good for lower-income people.\n  The amendment will put a hard cap on farm payments at $250,000. I \nwant to make a very clear distinction here. Even if we have a farm \nbill--because the arguments are going to be made against this bill: We \nare in negotiations on a farm bill. Why mess with this in a budget? \nWell, if we do have a farm bill, I have a feeling it is going to end up \nrelaxing payment limit laws that we have in the 2002 farm bill. The \nHouse of Representatives, in their farm bill, actually increases direct \npayment caps. And both the House and the Senate totally eliminate the \ncap on marketing loan gains, making them virtually unlimited.\n  So you have farm bills passed by both Houses that you could drive a \ngigantic 9620 John Deere tractor through--and those are big tractors. I \nwill support trying to lower the adjusted gross income limits, but I \nhave seen a lot of data that suggests that not many farmers are going \nto be kicked out of the program if they are filthy rich, do not need \nthe help, do not need the support, do not need to be subsidized to get \nbigger. They have the ability to get bigger on their own economic \nentrepreneurship. We should not have to subsidize them.\n  In addition, I have evidence that the U.S. Department of Agriculture \nis not even enforcing current law, the current adjusted gross income \ncap of $2.5 million. So what makes us think they are going to enforce \nsomething at $500,000?\n  This to me is more than just economics of the farm program. This is \nabout good government. This is about responsibility to the taxpayers. \nMost importantly, this is about protecting the livelihood of America's \nsmall and midsize farmers who you might say are protected anyway \nbecause there is a safety net for them.\n\n  But my point is, you pay these 10 percent of the biggest farmers 73 \npercent of all the money out of the pot that is set aside for support \nfor farmers, and we are going to lose urban support for the farm safety \nnet, and small, medium, or big, there is not going to be any farm \nsafety net, and someday you are going to wonder why there is not enough \nfood in America.\n  I want to take a minute to outline some of the folks who have \nsupported this in the past. All 12 Democrats on the Budget Committee \nhave voted to support this measure at one time or another. Last week, \nwe had 13 votes in favor of a $250,000 hard cap, including a majority \nof Democrats. We have support from groups that are concerned about \nhunger in America or hunger in the world. We have the support of \nenvironmental groups. We have churches backing this. We have small and \nbeginning farmer advocates.\n  Let me remind this body of a report that was put out because of the \n2002 farm bill. Remember, we had this argument in 2002. We won \noverwhelmingly in the Senate. It was taken out in conference because of \nbig corporate farm interests that were on the House Agriculture \nCommittee, and they are probably still there, even though it is under \nDemocratic leadership.\n  We did not get these limits. So we had a commission report: Let's \nstudy this. Let's find out what we can do to make sure that 10 percent \nof the biggest farmers do not get 73 percent of the benefits out of the \nprogram.\n  Well, do you know what the report said. After about 2 years of study, \nit said: Do exactly what was done in the Senate in 2002. And that is \nexactly what we got 56 votes to do a couple months ago when the farm \nbill was up in the Senate--but not 60 votes to get over that hurdle.\n  The report also said that the 2007 farm bill is the time for these \nreforms to be made as part of a change in permanent law.\n  Well, that time has come. By supporting the policies included in the \nAllard-Grassley amendment, we can allow young people to get into \nfarming and lessen the dependence upon Federal subsidies. This will \nhelp restore public respectability for public farm assistance by \ntargeting this assistance to those who need it.\n  You might remember the last time we had a vote on payment limits was \non the budget bill. Many of our colleagues said they agreed--no. The \nsecond time back we had a vote on this was on a budget bill. Well, at \nthat time it was argued: Wait until the 2007 farm bill. It needs to be \ndone on a farm bill. Well, you know what happened. You change the rules \nin the middle of the game. You think 51 votes will get an amendment \nadopted around here. Then somebody says: Well, we can't beat Dorgan and \nGrassley with a majority vote, so we will somehow scramble around and \nwiggle the rules--and I don't know what all it takes; and it will never \nbe in the history books--but it happens that all of a sudden you need \n60 votes to get something done around here. We only got 56 votes, so we \ndid not get it done.\n  But to all my colleagues who said: Wait, a couple years back during \nthe budget debate, we are done waiting. We will not be brushed off \nagain. Payment limits must be done now, and waiting for a stalled farm \nbill is not an appropriate strategy. I call upon my colleagues to back \nthis commonsense measure which a majority of this body has supported \nnumerous times in the past. I hope we can count on our Senate \ncolleagues to support the Senate position on payment limitations in \nconference.\n  I yield the floor and thank all of my colleagues who were patient \nwhile I expressed my views.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Iowa. You do \nnot have to agree with all the Senator has observed. I do not agree \nwith everything he said here, but I do have great respect for him. He \nhas conducted himself as a gentleman, especially with respect to these \nbudget matters. I very much appreciate that. I want to make certain I \nsay it publicly.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Stabenow, who has now waited \nwell over an hour, be recognized for 15 minutes, to be followed by \nSenator Graham on the other side for 15 minutes, before we go to the \njoint economic presentation which has already been locked in at 5:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I was assured I would have time at 5 \no'clock to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n\n[[Page S1854]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, why don't we go to Senator Stabenow for \n15 minutes, and then we will hopefully work out this matter with our \nother colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from Kentucky for his courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Could we amend the unanimous consent to say that after \nSenator Stabenow speaks for 15 minutes we go to Senator Graham for 10 \nminutes and then to Senator Bunning for 10 minutes and the time that \nwas supposed to start at 5:15 be moved to 5:20?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Well, the only problem with that is I might need to \nrespond. Why don't we do this: Why don't we proceed with the \nunderstanding of Senator Stabenow for 15 minutes--and then the desire \nis to go to Senator Graham; is that correct?\n  Mr. GREGG. For 10 minutes, and then Senator Bunning for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would like to reserve the right to be able to respond \nto Senator Graham, if I might. Will Senator Bunning be speaking on the \nsame subject?\n  Senator Bunning has been gracious. Why don't we do that. We will have \n15 minutes for Senator Stabenow, 10 minutes for Senator Graham, and \nthen we will go to Senator Bunning for 10 minutes, and then I will \nreserve time in case it is needed to respond. We thank the Senator from \nKentucky for his courtesy.\n  Mr. GREGG. Then we will amend the agreement so the Humphrey Hawkins \ntime will start at----\n  Mr. CONRAD. At roughly 5:20. We pose that unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, as my friend from Iowa is leaving the \nfloor, I thank him for his incredible leadership on children's health \ninsurance and the bipartisan way we came together around that measure. \nWe hope to be able to do it again because we have millions of children \nand families who are still waiting for children to be able to receive \nhealth insurance.\n  I wish to speak, though, as a cosponsor of the Baucus amendment, to \nthe middle-class tax relief amendment, which is so significant. I find \nit interesting: my friend from Iowa was referring to a chart that \nrelated to the payment limitation issue, with 73 percent of the \nbenefits going to 10 percent of the farmers, where you could cross that \nout and put President Bush's tax cuts at the top, and you could have \nthe very same kind of ratio or even more of a difference. You could \ntake estate tax repeal and put that up there and have the very same \nkind of ratio. So I hope when we get to a debate of a permanent \nextension--which I understand is coming--of the President's tax cuts, \nthat we will see that same kind of concern about where tax benefits are \ngoing in America. I have middle-class families, working families who \nare still waiting, frankly, to receive the benefits they have heard so \nmuch about.\n  That is what this amendment, the Baucus amendment, is all about: \nfocusing on the extension and addition of tax cuts for middle-class \nfamilies and for our brave men and women who are serving in harm's way \nright now around the globe, particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan, and \ntheir families. This is a very important amendment.\n  Let me start by saying what we want to address is the situation that \nis now occurring. We want to change what is now occurring as it relates \nto tax policy. Last year, in 2007, those who were earning more than $1 \nmillion a year received a tax cut of $119,557. So, roughly, it is fair \nto say $120,000 in average tax cuts for somebody earning over $1 \nmillion a year. That is more than twice what the average hard-working \nperson in Michigan is earning, the paycheck that they are earning every \nsingle year.\n  What we are seeing across the country are folks in the middle class \nbeing squeezed on all sides and actually seeing their incomes going \ndown. Too many times we are seeing jobs being lost overseas. We are \nseeing people being asked to take less in terms of a paycheck. But \ngasoline now is projected to be inching up toward $4 a gallon, if my \ncolleagues can believe it. Health care costs are going up. The cost of \ncollege is going up. Everything is going up, while wages, for most \npeople, are either staying the same or going down.\n  So when we talk about where we want to focus tax cuts for this \ncountry, it ought to be the folks who are working hard every day, who \nlove this country and want to have the American dream available for \nthemselves and their families but have not seen the tax cuts that have \nbeen talked about so much by the administration. So that is what this \namendment talks about. Instead of $120,000 a year for somebody earning \nover $1 million, let's focus on middle-class families.\n  The Baucus amendment would permanently extend the 10-percent income \ntax bracket. Everybody would get relief, but proportionately it would \nbe relief for low- and moderate-income families. It would extend the \nrefundable child tax credit. We want to make sure those families \nwho have more than one child--two, three, four children or more--are \nable to benefit from the child tax credit. The marriage penalty--we \nwant to make sure that is extended. Certainly, we ought not to be in \nAmerica penalizing folks because they are married when it comes to \ntheir tax returns. This permanently extends marriage penalty tax \nrelief.\n\n  We also permanently extend the tax credit for childcare expenses. No \none who has a child in America today will speak about childcare \nexpenses as a frill. It is a necessity. If we care about children, \nchildren's well-being, and families, we need to make sure we are \nrecognizing that childcare expenses are a very important and expensive \ncost for families, and we need to address that by permanently extending \nthe tax credit for childcare expenses.\n  We also permanently extend the increased adoption tax credit. We want \nto make sure families who are reaching out to children, who want to be \nable to adopt a child, have support and incentive to do that. \nCertainly, the biggest incentive is that beautiful baby, but we want to \nmake sure the Tax Code will help them with their costs and expenses as \nwell. Again, this is a pro-family, pro-children, pro-middle class \namendment. I am hopeful it is one that we are all going to embrace.\n  We all want to bring certainty to the estate tax law. No one, I \nbelieve, wants to see in 2010 the old law take place. We don't want to \nhave uncertainty for families, for family farms, and small businesses. \nThis permanently extends the tax relief that has already been adopted, \nthe tax cuts that have already been adopted.\n  Something else is very important for families right now as they are \nstruggling to keep their homes. We are all very focused and have spent \ntime on the floor talking about what we need to do. Senator Reid has \nput forward a very important proposal addressing what we can do to help \nwith the home crisis and so many families losing their homes. This \nparticular amendment includes a first of its kind standard deduction \nfor property taxes for Americans who don't itemize on their Federal \nincome tax returns but would allow them a tax deduction for their \nproperty taxes. This is a very important piece for supporting families \nwho are working hard to be able to literally keep their home.\n  The other provision that is so significant is to focus on those \nthings that are needed in the Tax Code to support our brave men and \nwomen who are serving us in Afghanistan, in Iraq, and around the globe. \nWe have men and women now who are on third and fourth redeployments. \nThey have made tremendous sacrifices, and their families are as well, \nand we need to be doing everything we can to support them. So this does \na number of things. It has a permanent allowance for soldiers to count \ntheir nontaxable combat pay when they figure in the earned-income tax \ncredit, so they can get the benefit of the earned-income tax credit for \nlow-income working families. We provide a tax cut for small businesses \nthat are paying some of the salary of the members of the National Guard \nand Reserve who are called to duty. Again, we have families now that \nare really at a point of desperation trying to figure out how to pay \nthe mortgage, how to\n\n[[Page S1855]]\n\nkeep going, and we have so many small businesses that are being \nsupportive, and we want to recognize that and give them some support as \nwell.\n  A permanent allowance for all veterans to use qualified mortgage \nbonds to purchase their homes, again, is another way to help people be \nable to purchase homes, to be able to do what we all want, which is to \nhave a home, save through the equity of a home, and be able to live a \ngood life in America.\n  We also have created the ability for Active-Duty troops to withdraw \nmonies from retirement plans without penalty. This is very important, \nwhen people unfortunately now have dipped into savings. They may have a \nhome equity loan going on and they find themselves in strapped \nsituations and we ought to allow them to take their savings and \nretirement plans without penalty to be able to help them pay the bills.\n  We have an extension of a provision that gives retired veterans more \ntime to claim a tax refund. Under certain disability benefit payments, \nthe ability for families of reservists killed in the line of duty to be \nable to collect life insurance and other benefits provided by civilian \nemployers and the ability for families of soldiers killed in the line \nof duty to contribute 100 percent of survivor benefits to retirement \nsavings accounts or education savings accounts. This is a very \nimportant part of this amendment that pays tribute to those who have \nbeen asked to sacrifice the most, whether it be someone bravely serving \nright now in the war, someone who has come home disabled, or the family \nof someone who did not come home.\n  We are debating a budget resolution right now and talking about who \nreceives benefits and where we have to make hard choices. The folks who \nhave made the toughest choices are the folks who are serving us, \nserving our country in war halfway around the world. I have a lot of \nfolks who are in this category of getting the more than $120,000 a year \nin tax cuts this last year who have said to me: I don't need it. I earn \nover $1 million a year. I don't need this. Give this to the men and \nwomen who are serving us. Help pay for the war so that we are not \npaying for it on a credit card or make sure our veterans have the \nhealth care they need when they come home or make sure we fund a GI \nbill that Senator Webb has introduced that would provide educational \nopportunities for the men and women who have come home from this war \nthat so far has lasted 5 years.\n\n  So there are many wonderful people who love our country who are \nsaying this kind of a tax system where those who make less than \n$100,000 a year get $674, but if you make $1 million a year or more you \nget $120,000 in a tax cut, just doesn't make sense. In my opinion, it \ndoesn't represent the great values of America, our values and \npriorities, what we are all about in this country. We are not about \nhaving a system where a privileged few receive all of the benefits, \nwhile we are asking so many others to sacrifice and to be able to be \nrequired, unfortunately, on too many occasions now, to lay down their \nlives for their country.\n  So I hope the Baucus amendment is passed overwhelmingly. Then I hope \nwe say no to what I believe will be an additional amendment, which \nwould extend this tax policy. It would extend it out. With a war unpaid \nfor, with the massive debt that we have in our country, the obligations \nto our veterans and their families when they come home, we do not need \nto extend a tax policy that has given so many of our precious resources \nto a blessed few people in our country, many of whom are asking us, in \nfact, not to do that.\n  So I thank our leader on the Budget Committee for all of his \nwonderful leadership, as well as the ranking member.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, would the Senator withhold for just one \nmoment for the purpose of a unanimous consent request that the ranking \nmember and I previously worked out?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Baucus \namendment be temporarily laid aside for the purpose of the Republicans \noffering the Graham amendment, and that the Baucus amendment remains as \nthe regular order, regardless of the pendency of other amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair, and I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom South Carolina for his courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4170\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Graham], for himself, \n     Mr. McCain, Mr. Kyl, Mr. McConnell, and Mr. DeMint, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 4170.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To protect families, family farms and small businesses by \n    extending the income tax rate structure, raising the death tax \n exemption to $5 million and reducing the maximum death tax rate to no \n more than 35%; to keep education affordable by extending the college \ntuition deduction; and to protect senior citizens from higher taxes on \n        their retirement income, maintain U.S. financial market \ncompetitiveness, and promote economic growth by extending the lower tax \n                 rates on dividends and capital gains.)\n\n       On page 3, line 11, decrease the amount by $949,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 12, decrease the amount by $3,215,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 13, decrease the amount by $93,791,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 14, decrease the amount by \n     $127,024,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 15, decrease the amount by \n     $151,137,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 20, decrease the amount by $949,000,000.\n       Qn page 3, line 21, decrease the amount by $3,215,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 22, decrease the amount by $93,791,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 23, decrease the amount by \n     $127,024,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 24, decrease the amount by \n     $151,137,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 5, increase the amount by $18,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 6, increase the amount by $110,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 7, increase the amount by $2,487,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 8, increase the amount by $8,005,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 9, increase the amount by $15,207,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 14, increase the amount by $18,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 15, increase the amount by $110,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 16, increase the amount by $2,487,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 17, increase the amount by $8,005,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 18, increase the amount by $15,207,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 23, increase the amount by $967,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 24, increase the amount by $3,325,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 25, increase the amount by $96,278,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 1, increase the amount by $135,079,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 2, increase the amount by $166,344,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 8, increase the amount by $1,214,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 9, increase the amount by $4,539,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 10, increase the amount by \n     $100,817,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 11, increase the amount by \n     $235,846,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 12, increase the amount by \n     $402,190,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 16, increase the amount by $1,214,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 17, increase the amount by $4,539,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 18, increase the amount by \n     $100,817,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 19, increase the amount by \n     $235,846,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 20, increase the amount by \n     $402,190,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 16, increase the amount by $18,000,000\n       On page 26, line 17, increase the amount by $18,000,000\n       On page 26, line 20, increase the amount by $110,000,000\n       On page 26, line 21, increase the amount by $110,000,000\n       On page 26, line 24, increase the amount by $2,487,000,000\n       On page 26, line 25, increase the amount by $2,487,000,000\n       On page 27, line 3, increase the amount by $8,005,000,000\n       On page 27, line 4, increase the amount by $8,005,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 7, increase the amount by $15,207,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 8, increase the amount by $15,207,000,000.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, consistent with the unanimous consent \nrequest, I will talk for 10 minutes\n\n[[Page S1856]]\n\nabout the outline of this amendment. I, too, would like to recognize \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee and the ranking member for dealing \nwith what I think is a very fruitful and important exercise in American \ndemocracy, and that is setting the budget. We are going to try to \ncreate a budget to guide the Federal Government not just this year but \nin coming years.\n  If I had to showcase a difference between honorable men and women in \nthe Senate about our philosophies, how you think about the economy, \nshowcase differences between people who are very sincere and all love \ntheir country, it would probably be this amendment. Senator Baucus's \namendment--I will vote for that; it extends tax cuts to families, child \ntax credits. The details of the amendment will be discussed on the \nfloor. Certainly, it is needed.\n  My amendment is about those tax cuts that will be left behind if we \npass Senator Baucus's amendment and we let current law expire. This \nprobably illustrates the difference between the parties as much as any \nother event that I could offer to the American people. We live in a \nglobal economy, and the question for America is this: What kind of tax \nstructure do we need in place to make sure capital will be formed here \nand not leave? Does your Tax Code matter when it comes to creating \njobs? Does the amount you take from a business--a small business or a \nmajor corporation--matter in terms of a global economy? Does it affect \npeople's decision about where to do business? What is fair?\n  This idea of class warfare--that it is not fair to do this for one \ngroup if you are going to do something for the other group--would be a \ngreat debate to have. What I am trying to do is offer an amendment to \ncomplement Senator Baucus's, to make sure our tax structure in America \nis fair to those who work hard, who hire people, who create capital and \njobs, to those in retired status who are depending on their investments \nearlier in life to get them through.\n  Here is the question for the country: Under the current law that we \npassed several years ago, which expires in 2010, the top tax rate is 35 \npercent. The question for America is: Is a 35-percent top tax rate at \nthe Federal level fair? It seems to be a gracious plenty to me--35 \npercent out of whatever you earn going to the Federal Government as the \ntop rate. Should it be more? Should it be less? Well, 35 percent, to \nme, is more than a gracious plenty to be sending to the Federal \nGovernment because most people have to pay taxes at other levels of \ngovernment.\n  Now, in 2011, if we do nothing, the 35-percent rate goes to 39.6; the \n33-percent rate goes to 36; the 28-percent rate goes to 31; and the 25-\npercent rate goes to 28.\n  If you ask a variety of Americans--and this has been true for 10, 15, \n20 years--what is a fair amount for an American to pay to the Federal \nGovernment in terms of the income they earn, the No.1 answer is \nconsistently 25 percent--regardless of income, region, rich, poor, \nblack or white. Most Americans view 25 percent as a fair amount that \nsomebody should have to pay to the Federal Government in terms of their \nincome. We are now at 35 percent, and we are trying to hang on to that.\n  Our Democratic friends, by opposing this amendment, would allow the \ntop rate to go to 39.6. But most importantly, it would allow the 25-\npercent rate for that class of taxpayers to go to 28. Who is at the 25-\npercent rate? It starts with income levels of $31,850 for single and \n$63,700 for married couples. In 2011, they would, at that rate--if my \namendment is not passed--have to pay 28 percent.\n  That is a lot of money from the economy going to Washington, at a \ntime when we need money at home for families and businesses. Small \nbusiness owners are in the 35-percent rate in large numbers. Do we want \nto take every small business that is paying 35 percent of their income \nto the Federal Government and, 3 years from now, make it 39.6 percent? \nNumbers matter. To us, we are picking numbers. At home, it is the \nbottom line. I grew up in a small town in South Carolina, where my dad \nowned a liquor store, a restaurant, and a pool room. I can remember \nthat we got by. Neither of my parents graduated high school. The one \nthing I can remember about small business life is you have no option \nnot to get up and go to work. If you are dog sick, you still have to go \nto work because nobody will pay the bills if you don't open the door. \nWe had health insurance basically for the four people in our family. My \nmother got Hodgkin's disease, and I paid those bills up through when I \nwas in the Air Force. To the people out there making a living, the \nburdens of regulations matter.\n  I think we should come together and say something simple: 35 percent \nis enough to take from anybody. If you don't like rich people, if you \nthink there is an amount of money that is too much to make, then that \nis one way to run the Government, I guess. That is one way to create a \nsociety--put a ceiling on what people can do. As long as you earn your \nmoney honestly and fairly, the better you do, the happier I am for you. \nIf I take 35 percent of what you make, I think I have probably taken \nenough. Should I take 39.6 percent because somebody makes too much? If \nyou let the Government do that, I think you are letting the Government \nget out of line and out of control.\n  And it is just not the people who make a lot of money whom I am \nworried about; it is people who are working for every dollar they can \nget to grow their business and pay the families' bills that I worry \nabout.\n  As I said, the amendment I am trying to offer to the Senate will keep \nrates at 35, 33, 28 and 25 and not go to 39.6, 36, 31, and 28. If we \ndon't pass this amendment, there is going to be a major tax increase \ncoming to hard-working Americans out there, at a time when we live in a \nglobal economy; and if we take any more from Americans, a lot of our \nbusinesses are going to leave us. How many people are affected by my \namendment? Twenty-eight million people will experience a tax increase \nby 2011 if this amendment doesn't pass.\n  Now, we have heard that two things are certain--death and taxes. The \nonly thing I can tell you about taxes is that if you touch it, use it, \nput it in your car or eat it, in America it is taxed in some form. And \nthen you die. Well, we have an estate tax law in America, and it goes \nkind of like this. The current law is you get a $2 million exemption \nfor a couple at a 45-percent rate. If you have an estate over $2 \nmillion as a couple, the Government takes 45 percent of what is left. \nYou have paid taxes on everything you have earned right before you \ndied. Here comes the Government, after the $2 million exemption has \nbeen reached, and it takes 45 percent of what is left. That is current \nlaw. That is supposedly too good a deal. I don't think it is that great \na deal.\n\n  In 2010, here is what happens if we do nothing: Instead of a $2 \nmillion exemption for a couple, it goes back to $1 million, and you get \na 55-percent tax rate on everything else that is left. How many small \nbusinesses out there, on paper, have assets over $1 million or $2 \nmillion? How many farmers are land rich and cash poor? Is that good \npolicy? One thing I can tell you for sure, being a former prosecutor, \nif we don't do something about this, there are going to be a lot of \nmysterious deaths on New Year's Eve 2010. Look at the consequences of \ndying one day versus the other. It is political malpractice for the \nCongress to put people in this bind, where estate tax rates go from 45 \nto 55 and the exemption is cut in half, based on dying one day versus \nthe other. That is bad public policy. We need to fix it.\n  My amendment would say there would be a $5 million exemption for \ncouples in this country and, after that, a top rate of 35 percent for \nthe death tax. In other words, 35 percent of everything you worked for \nall your life, after a $5 million exemption, would be taken by the \nGovernment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. May I have 5 more minutes?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. What I am trying to do is offer an amendment that will \npreserve current law so in 3 years, in the case of the death tax, and 2 \nyears, we don't hit people with a tax increase, at a time when we don't \nneed to be raising taxes, at a time that we live in a global economy.\n  When it comes to the death tax, one in three small business owners is \nnever able to pass their business on to the next generation because, \nwhen they\n\n[[Page S1857]]\n\ndie, the assets are evaluated in such a way that people have to break \nup the business to pay the taxes or they have to sell the family farm.\n  That is not what we need to be doing in America. That is not fair. \nThe capital gains taxes are at 15 percent under current law. In 2011, \nthey go to 20 percent. There are over 9 million families and \nindividuals who will claim capital gains, and if this amendment doesn't \npass and we don't do something about this, there are going to be 9 \nmillion families hit by a tax increase out there, at a time when our \neconomy needs more money in the private sector, not in Washington.\n  As to dividends, there are a lot of people in this country--24 \nmillion families and individuals--who receive dividend income. Under \ncurrent law, it is taxed at 15 percent. In 2011, the dividends go back \nto regular income tax rates--a dramatic increase.\n  What does that mean? That means owning stock becomes less attractive. \nThere will be less people buying stock and receiving dividends from \npurchasing stock. That means people who are trying to create a company \nor expand their business will have to borrow the money from a bank, \nrather than getting investors from the market, and that will create \nmore debt on top of what is already a debt-laden country.\n  As to small business expensing, under current law, firms may expense \nup to $250,000 of qualified assets of property they place in service in \n2008. In 2011, the expensing allowance is scheduled to revert to \n$25,000. By being able to expense, from a tax point of view, the \npurchase of assets, you are able to grow your business, and it makes it \nattractive to expand your business.\n  If we don't pass my amendment, in 2011, that $250,000 allowance goes \ndown to $25,000. My amendment reflects a Tax Code that is very generous \nto the Federal Government but is still burdensome on families and \nbusinesses. But to let it get worse, at a time when we are competing in \na global economy, and try to pit one group of Americans against \nanother, at a time when we are trying to put our best foot forward as a \nnation under a stressful business climate, is ill advised.\n  If you think America is undertaxed, then vote no. If you think we \nhave taken a gracious plenty from business and families, then vote yes. \nIf we don't make these tax cuts permanent in 2013, we are going to \ndrive people offshore and create less jobs, not more; we are going to \ntax people who are struggling to make it as it is; and it will all be \nunder the idea of fairness. It is unfair to not pass my amendment.\n  I think it would be incredibly shortsighted not to pass my amendment \nand make these tax cuts permanent that would allow Americans to keep \njobs and grow jobs and pay the bills they are struggling to pay right \nnow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, there will be no more rollcall votes \ntonight. There has been tremendously good debate. We have had few, if \nany, quorum calls all day long. It has been a good and productive \ndebate. The two managers are working through the amendments. An \namendment has been laid down on both sides. We are making good \nprogress. Hopefully, tomorrow we will make even more progress. I \nappreciate the good work of the managers of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I wish to speak today as a member of \nthe Senate Budget Committee. I had hoped the budget that was presented \nbefore the committee last week was going to be fiscally responsible and \nwould help to address the mounting financial problems families face \ntoday, problems such as the rising cost of filling up a tank of gas, \nincreased expenses for health care, and declining equity in the family \nhome. Instead, this budget before us assumes Congress will allow the \nlargest irresponsible tax increase in the history of the United States \nto go into effect. At $1.2 trillion, it would be the largest tax \nincrease in history, and taxes would go up $2,300 on 43 million \nAmerican families, $2,200 more on 18 million senior citizens, and \n$4,100 more on small businesses. Because of this, I was not able to \nsupport the budget resolution in committee, and I will be forced to \nvote against it here unless some drastic changes are made.\n  This tax increase will hit family budgets hard. Let me tell my \ncolleagues what $2,300 means to most American families. The family \nbudget--and we are talking about groceries now--$2,300 is enough to buy \n8 months of groceries. Next, we have the bills for gas and electric for \nheating; $2,300 a year is enough for 43 million American families to \nbuy enough gas and electric for 1 year's heating. It is almost enough \nmoney for American families with two cars to buy gasoline at $3.20 a \ngallon for unleaded regular for almost an entire year. We should not, \nat this time, be placing more of a burden on the American people with a \nhuge tax increase. Instead, we need to pass a budget that includes \nprogrowth policies to help balance the family budget.\n  This budget proposal increases spending by $210 billion in \ndiscretionary spending--an increase of over 9 percent of what we spent \nin fiscal year 2008. Under this budget, we will see a $2 trillion \nincrease in the debt of the United States by 2013. That is more than \n$6,000 in extra debt for each and every American citizen.\n  At $3.08 trillion, this budget resolution calls for $10,165 of \nspending for every man, woman, and child in America--all 300 million of \nus. But there are only about 130 million taxpayers who file an income \ntax return. Of those 130 million, only about 14 million had an average \nincome liability of over $10,000 in 2005. Of these, about 11 million \nhad gross incomes between $100,000 and $200,000. That leaves 3.5 \nmillion taxpayers--no more than 2 percent--with an income above \n$200,000. These wealthy few are paying an extraordinary 50.1 percent of \nall Federal tax revenues. But even if you taxed away half of their \nincome, the additional revenue would not add up to enough to balance \nthe budget and pay for programs in mandatory spending this budget \nresolution assumes over the long term.\n  The idea that money can be found in a mythical source of funding \ncalled the tax gap is unlikely as well. The chairman of the Budget \nCommittee repeatedly has noted that the IRS estimate of the gross tax \ngap is close to $345 billion per year. However, the idea that anywhere \nnear this amount of money can be raised by closing the tax gap is \nsimply an illusion. It is nothing more than a figleaf meant to conceal \nthe intent of spending beyond the means of the Federal Government.\n  The truth is, we are not really serious about this, and the proof is \nthat we do not have a proposed penny more in this budget for the IRS \nthan the President does in his budget. It would be difficult to drive \nthe long-term history level of voluntary compliance from 85 percent, \nwhere it is now, to nearly 100 percent in order to tap into this \nmythical source of funding because that is what it would take to raise \n$345 billion per year. But it is hard to see how it can be done without \na vast increase in the size of the IRS.\n  We also need to pass a budget that includes the necessary funding to \nhelp us stop our addiction to foreign oil.\n  In 2005, Congress enacted a comprehensive national energy plan--the \nfirst step toward energy independence. Nevertheless, this year has been \na difficult year for Americans facing much higher energy costs. The \npolicies we enacted in 2005 needed to be backed up with Federal funding \nin the budget, but this budget resolution fails to address important \nalternative-fuel technologies and other oil replacements.\n  One of our top priorities should be on our most abundant domestic \nfossil fuel: coal. New technologies will make burning coal both cheaper \nand more efficient. We are even developing coal-to-liquid technology \nthat can create a synthetic transportation fuel from coal. American \ncoal reserves will be our best tool to overcome our reliance on Middle \nEastern oil.\n  I have three amendments I wish to propose to this budget resolution.\n  First, I wish to offer an amendment that will repeal the unfair tax \nCongress enacted in 1993. I have brought this issue before the Chamber \nbefore, so it should be familiar to many of my colleagues. In fact, the \nSenate adopted a very similar amendment by unanimous consent last year, \nand it passed by a recorded vote 2 years earlier.\n\n  When the Social Security Program was created, benefits were not \ntaxed. In\n\n[[Page S1858]]\n\n1983, Congress decided that half the benefits of some seniors should be \nsubject to taxation and in 1993 raised that amount to 85 percent of the \nSocial Security benefits. Today, more than 15 million seniors are \naffected by that taxation of benefits. In 1993, the tax was intended to \nreach only wealthy seniors by the income levels which were set at \n$34,000 for a single and $44,000 per couple. This is hardly wealthy \ntoday.\n  My amendment is fairly simple. It drops the tax back to the pre-1993 \nlevels, and it is paid for by an offset of $89 billion over 5 years by \nan adjustment in function 920. Over $300 billion in potential savings \non Government programs over the next 5 years has been identified by the \ninspectors general report and the CBO options report. And it is my hope \nthat the committees of jurisdiction will review wasteful Government \nspending to offset the repeal of this tax increase on America's \nseniors. It was unfair then when it was enacted, and we need to repeal \nit now. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The second amendment I plan to offer, together with Senator Ben \nNelson of Nebraska and Senator DeMint, will make room in the budget to \npermanently extend the tax incentives for adoption that we enacted in \n2001. This is a critical kitchen-table, family-budget issue for many \nmiddle-income families in Kentucky and across the country who are \ncontemplating the adoption of a young child or facing costs of \nadoption. By helping to ease this financial burden, we can encourage \nthe development of more stable families and provide a brighter future \nfor thousands of children.\n  This important goal prompted us to act in 2001 when we passed these \nimportant adoption incentives in the form of tax credits. In 2005 \nalone, 85,000 families, 77 percent with an adjusted gross income of \nunder $100,000, claimed $319.5 million in adoption credits.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator's time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I would like to mention the last one, and \nI will be finished. I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, last year the Joint Committee on Taxation \nscored the cost of my bill, the Adoption Tax Relief Guarantee Act, at \n$4.5 billion over 10 years.\n  The last amendment I wish to discuss will require the budget \nresolution to balance the Federal budget without Social Security taxes. \nFor too long, we have been relying on payroll taxes to pay for general \nGovernment spending. As we all know, 2017 is the year in which Social \nSecurity obligations begin to equal payroll tax contributions, but our \nproblems are likely to emerge much sooner.\n  In 2011, payroll tax contributions to the Social Security trust fund \nwill begin to decline. Each year, we are going to have a problem, and \nby the year 2044, we will be paying 72 percent of the assigned benefits \nright now on our Social Security unless we address the Social Security \nspending in our current general budget.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank, once again, the Senator from \nKentucky for his courtesy.\n  At this point, I wish to offer a unanimous-consent request that we \nhave worked on both sides that would be this: From 5:20 p.m. to 6:20 \np.m. will be the time for the Joint Economic Committee; the first 5 \nminutes of that time--is that sufficient for the Senator?\n  Mr. WEBB. That will be sufficient.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The first 5 minutes will go to Senator Webb, then come \nback to, for the next 30 minutes, Senator Brownback, then come back to \nthis side for the final 25 minutes of JEC time; then at 6:20 p.m., to \ngo to Senator Dorgan from 6:20 p.m. to 6:35 p.m.; to Senator Hatch from \n6:35 p.m. to 6:50 p.m.; to Senator Conrad or his designee from 6:50 \np.m. to 7 p.m.; to Senator Coburn or Senator Gregg's designee from 7 \np.m. to 7:15 p.m.; and to Senator Brown from 7:15 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill not object, I know we need to move everything back 10 minutes \nbecause we were supposed to start at 5:20 p.m. and we are already 10 \nminutes past that time. So if we move everything 10 minutes back--\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator makes a good point; if we can adjust all \nthose times to 10 minutes later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, that means we now go to Senator Webb for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I appreciate the chairman allowing me to \nspeak and also I appreciate the Senator from Kansas allowing me to \nspeak briefly before he does.\n  I want to express my support for the provisions in this budget that \ngo to the veterans programs. I want to deal with that in a minute.\n  First, I would like to point out to this body that this afternoon, \nADM William Fallon, who is the commander of Central Command, resigned \nhis position. We are not sure exactly how this is going to affect the \nadministration's policies or Admiral Fallon's long-term willingness to \nexpress his views on administration policies, but I want to express my \nown regret that Admiral Fallon, who has served our country more than 40 \nyears, has decided to resign his post in part, apparently, because of \nhis concerns about some of the administration's policies.\n  I know a little something about resigning. I resigned my position \nwhen I was Secretary of the Navy when I was unable to support some \ndramatic reductions in the Navy shipbuilding program. Those are not \neasy decisions to make. I would also point out that this administration \nis not an administration that has tolerated dissent from our military \nleaders or, for that matter, is not an administration that has been \nvery willing to seek advice from our military leaders, our senior \nmilitary leaders, particularly when that advice is not in strict \naccordance with its own political views.\n  It should be pointed out that Admiral Fallon, who is the commander of \nCentral Command, which is the overarching command that also includes \nIraq, is now the third CENTCOM commander in recent history to have had \nat least some form of concerns about policies in that region.\n  Before we invaded Iraq, GEN Tony Zinni, Marine Corps general, former \nCENTCOM commander, spoke out strongly against invading Iraq, as did GEN \nJoe Hoare, former CENTCOM commander. So I think we need to see a \ngreater willingness among our political process to listen to the views \nof people who have had long service and who have concerns about where \nthis country is going.\n  There are too many people who have been involved at the top levels in \nthe Pentagon who tend to believe that Iraq is something of an island, \nthat you can separate what is going on in Iraq from other issues that \nare affecting the entire region. This is a region that is in chaos, all \nthe way from Lebanon to Pakistan, as we well know. We need the advice, \nthe contributions of global thinkers.\n  Admiral Fallon was one of them, Admiral Mullen is another, people who \nbring another sort of strategic perspective into this debate. I am \nprofoundly concerned that Admiral Fallon has decided to take this \nmeasure, and I am hoping that we can hear from him in a more specific \nway in the future.\n  In fact, I would point out that I recently signed two letters on \nJanuary 17, one to Chairman Levin of the Armed Services Committee and \nanother to Senator Biden of the Foreign Relations Committee, both of \nwhich I sit on as a member, asking specifically that they invite \nAdmiral Fallon, among others, to testify in consonance with General \nPetraeus's testimony coming up this year.\n  I was saying last September that it was an error, I believe, only to \nfocus on what General Petraeus was saying in the stovepipe of Iraq \nrather than to hear these strategic thinkers talking about the region \nat large. So I hope we can do that in some greater detail in the near \nfuture.\n\n[[Page S1859]]\n\n  Again, I want to express my profound appreciation for the service \nthat Admiral Fallon has given our country.\n  With respect to the veterans provisions in this budget, we on this \nside have put more money into it. We have listened to the joint \nopinions of our major veterans groups. A big part of this is the GI \nbill, which I introduced my first day in office. We now have 49 \ncosponsors on this bill which will give those people who have been \nserving since 9/11 the same level of benefits as those who came back in \nWorld War II.\n  On the one hand, we hear so many people, particularly in this \nadministration, talking about how these who have been serving since 9/\n11 are the next ``greatest generation,'' and on the other, this \nadministration itself seems to oppose giving our veterans of this time \nperiod the same benefits we gave those who served during World War II--\na GI bill that literally transformed notions of class and privilege in \nthe United States.\n  I would remind my colleagues that for every dollar in tax \nremuneration that was paid on the World War II GI bill, we received $7 \nin tax benefits because of the way they were able to advance their \ncareers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we wish to amend the previous unanimous \nconsent agreement to provide that Senator Brownback finish his \npresentation on JEC by 6:05, from 6:05 to 6:30, that it be the JEC \nDemocratic time; from 6:30 to 6:45, Senator Hatch be recognized; from \n6:45 to 7:15, Senator Coburn be recognized; from 7:15 to 7:30, Senator \nBrown be recognized; and that there also be an opportunity for Senator \nCoburn to continue after Senator Brown, if he should desire; and that \nat the end of that time, both sides would yield back an additional 5 \nhours each off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Senator Webb and I are involved in the Joint Economic \nCommittee's time. Under the Budget rules, we get a certain amount of \ntime to talk about the impact of the budget on the overall economy. \nThat is what I intend to do.\n  I think it is also important to do this because, obviously, the \nbudget does not happen in a vacuum, and the size of the Federal budget \nand its impact on the economy is so profound that I think we need to \nspend quite a bit of time, a lot more than just an hour's time, about \nwhat impact the Federal budget has on our overall economy.\n  The things we do, it is impacting the overall economy. I appreciate \nSenators Webb's comments about the military actions. We actually have \nheld a Joint Economic Committee hearing on the impact of the war in \nIraq, in Afghanistan, on our overall economy.\n  While I certainly dispute some of what the economists came forward \nwith, I thought it was a useful thing for us to discuss. I think we \nought also to look at that as not in a vacuum, given potential large \nimpacts if the United States pulls out of Iraq and Afghanistan and \npulls back from engagement on the global war on terrorism. It can have \na huge impact on our economy, in many ways unmeasurable, and in a lot \nof ways difficult to predict.\n  But the impact is enormous. I think we have to look at this and say: \nWe need to stay in this. We need to be able to get this done. That \nstability has a clear, positive impact on the environment. And a change \ntoward a more stable environment in the Middle East and toward a \ndemocratic process in Iraq and Afghanistan over a lengthy period of \ntime has a very positive impact on the global economy and ultimately on \nthe U.S. economy. I do not think we can discount those features. While \nmembers of the Joint Economic Committee on the other side of the aisle \nprefer to look only at economic costs associated with wars, there are \nclearly benefits derived from National security, which they should not \nignore.\n  I wanted to talk about now the budget proposal in a couple of ways. I \nwould like to speak first about the impact of tax-and-spend proposals \nthat are too much of a feature in the overall budget put forward by the \nDemocratic majority in the Senate. I appreciate the work by those who \nconstructed the budget. I recognize the difficulty of crafting a \nbudget.\n  But I think there are some fundamental flaws that exist in the \nDemocrat's budget that if not addressed, or if addressed in the way \nthat the Democratic majority puts forward, are going to have \nfundamentally negative impacts near term and long term on the U.S. \neconomy and on our opportunities and our hope for the future.\n  I think as a premise that we need to look at the United States as a \nplace for a growth platform. We need to look at how we can grow the \neconomic activity, increase the freedom for our people and the \npopulation overall, provide for everybody, and in that process grow and \nprovide more opportunities for people here and for us in our future and \nfuture generations.\n  If we go the way the Democratic majority is putting forward in this \nbudget, we are going to see increased taxes, we are going to see \nincreased spending of a substantial nature. We are not going to deal \nwith the entitlement crisis we are already in, and we are not going to \nbe able to provide for opportunities in our future.\n  There are fundamental choices that people need to make and I will \narticulate these and I will go through them specifically. Our economy \nis currently experiencing a significant slowdown associated with the \nsubprime mortgage meltdown, difficulties in financial markets, and \ncertainly a slowing in our housing markets, which includes rising \nforeclosures.\n  With that backdrop, though, now would seem to be exactly the wrong \ntime to be talking about tax increases. Just on a basic level, you \nwould look at that and say: If you have a slowing economy, is that the \ntime to raise taxes? And I think most people, if you ask them, they \nwould say: No, that is the time you cut tax rates to try to stimulate \neconomic growth.\n  Yet this Democratic budget provides just the opposite, a very large \ntax increase, raising taxes by $1.2 trillion, the largest tax hike \never. That is not something you want to do when the economy is slowing. \nIt goes against economic fundamentals. But it also shows the \nfundamental impact of the Federal budget on the overall economy. This \ntax increase will be wide and deep, affecting nearly 116 million \nAmericans, millions of American families, including seniors who will \nowe thousands of dollars more to pay for more and more Government.\n  And, yes, this budget projects to make the Federal Government even \nlarger and more intrusive. Not satisfied in the Democrat's last budget \nwith a $205 billion 5-year discretionary spending increase; this 2009 \nDemocrat budget will increase spending by $210 billion over 5 years in \nthis budget. Of course, this will lead to more and more debt that will \npile up on top of more and more spending.\n  I think the second major shortcoming of the budget proposal put \nforward by the majority is the failure to confront the need for \nentitlement reform. Now this is something we have been talking about \nfor some period of time. I stand ready, and I hope a lot of my \ncolleagues do, to go at, on a joint, bipartisan basis, entitlement \nreform. We have talked about it a lot. I am going to show charts on \nthis. But the entitlement plans are going to eat up the entire budget. \nWe will go through the specifics, but it is clearly an unsustainable \nsystem that we are in right now.\n  Like in most problems, the earlier you deal with it the more options \nyou have to deal with it. And the earlier you deal with it the more \nlikely it will be that you successfully deal with it. And the earlier \nyou deal with it the less pain there will be over a period of time, \nthan if you deal with it later.\n\n  These problems with entitlement promises that are unsustainable are \nthe same. If we can come together, on a bipartisan basis now, start an \nentitlement reform, A, the country would cheer that we would do it; B, \nwe would have more options; C, it would be more successful; D, it would \nbe less painful. That is the way we need to go at it in dealing with \nour entitlement reforms.\n  But in the Democrats' fiscal year 2009 budget, we see that they are \nagain wishing to ignore this pressing problem associated with \nentitlement spending. So I wanted to take a look now at some of these \nproblems and put a few charts up in front of people I think they are \nfamiliar with, but they remind us of the magnitude and the growing \nnearness of this problem of entitlement programs.\n\n[[Page S1860]]\n\n  If you look at the red line on this first chart, you see that total \nprimary spending is projected by the CBO, Congressional Budget Office, \na nonpartisan office, to rise from its current level of 18 percent of \nGDP to more than 30 percent at the end of this chart, 2082, a long ways \nout there, but it shows you clearly where the trend line goes under the \ncurrent entitlement programs.\n  Those are not adjustments to entitlement programs, those are current \nentitlement programs. Yes, Federal spending is projected to rise to \nover 30 percent of our Nation's GDP, under our current set of \nentitlement promises.\n  The second chart shows that the longer we wait to address the \nunsustainable nature of promises in our entitlement programs, which \nthis Democratic budget totally ignores, the bigger will be the pain.\n  Now, here you can see reductions in spending that would be necessary \nto solve our entitlement crisis. For example, if we were to address our \nfiscal problems solely by cutting Federal spending starting this year, \nwe would need an across-the-board spending cut of close to 7 percent. \nIf we wait until 2020, we would have to cut spending across the board \nby 9 percent. To wait until 2040, you have to do it by 15 percent.\n  That is my point; that is, the sooner you start to work on these \nthings the less pain you have to have in the process, and the more \nlikely it is that you are going to be successful in getting this done. \nThese are dramatic spending cuts. But what if we can get started now \nand on a bipartisan basis, just going on a slight level and give people \ntime to prepare for adjustments that will surely have to be made?\n  You still get a much larger impact if you don't fix the unsustainable \nnature of our entitlement promises now, and instead wait longer. The \nlonger we ignore the unsustainable nature of entitlement promises, the \nbigger will be the pain associated with bringing the Nation back to a \nsustainable fiscal course.\n  Now, this is a commonsense proposal. You would say: Of course, then, \nI should deal with that now. We are offering to do it on a bipartisan \nbasis. The chairman of the Budget Committee from the majority claims \nthat the task force he and Senator Gregg wish to form to study the \nentitlement programs is the only way to deal with the problems. I am a \ncosponsor. I would sponsor legislation to do this. But that in no way \nmitigates the need to get started as soon as we can to reform \nentitlements now. Why wait for a task force to form? I think we need to \nget started on this now.\n  To see how severe problems associated with the entitlement program \npromises are, consider the next chart which shows CBO's projection of \nhealth care spending. Now, here is the big one that eats us up. We know \nthis. We have got fabulous things going in the health care field that \nprobably are going to drive these costs up even more than this chart \nprojects.\n  I want to see those things developed further as far as the technology \nand the ability. I was out at the National Institutes of Health this \nmorning looking at some of the things they are working on at the \nNational Institute of Mental Health, understanding the mind and how it \nworks. Fantastic.\n  I want us to continue to fund that. That is going to probably drive \nthis line up even higher. That may be the nature of where we are. We do \nnot want to stop that funding. But then you see how dramatic and \nimportant it is to address this piece of it, the health care piece of \nit now, and to begin to address it at this point in time.\n  Net Federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid now accounts for about \n4 percent of GDP. CBO projects, given current entitlement promises and \nnot these major changes I am talking about, that spending will grow to \nalmost 20 percent of GDP in the projected time period here of 2082. A \nlong time now, still the trend line is known and knowable and we should \nuse the ability to deal with it more now than putting that off until \nlater on. So spending on Medicare and Medicaid alone, according to the \nprojections on this chart, will use up the entire historic norms for \ntax collection and beyond.\n  But Medicare and Medicaid are not the only entitlement programs. The \nnext chart shows Social Security spending as a share of GDP in the past \nand spending projections for the future. While spending for Social \nSecurity benefits has been between 4 and 4.5 percent of GDP for the \npast couple of decades, it is projected to rise significantly to 6 \npercent over the length of this chart's projection, not near the growth \nof entitlement programs, but still showing a significant 50 percent \nrise. If you add the 20 percent of GDP accounted for by Federal \npromises for Medicare and Medicaid, 6 percent for Social Security \nbenefits, you see that the Federal Government has already promised over \n25 percent of our total yearly output to entitlement spending. This \nonly counts promised entitlement spending right now. As I mentioned \npreviously, our historical norm for the amount of tax collection that \nour society gives and puts into the Federal Government is about 20 \npercent. If you get above that, people really start to yell. So we are \nalready above that in the promises made in three entitlement programs. \nAnd that takes into account nothing for the military, for schools, for \nother social programs, for infrastructure, for unemployment, or for any \ndiscretionary spending.\n  The Democratic majority seems to want to focus on one route here, and \nthat is tax and spend. The Democratic majority, unfortunately, has \nchosen in their budget to ignore our Nation's looming fiscal crisis \nthat is sure to come from the unsustainable nature of entitlement \nprograms. This fiscal year 2009 budget promises to impose the largest \ntax increase in the history of this Nation on American families and \ndoes this at precisely the wrong time, when the economy is struggling. \nThis will be the largest tax hike ever, amounting to an additional \n$3,135 in taxes each year for every household, over $3,100 a year \nincrease in household taxes at exactly the time when people are getting \nconcerned about economic activity. Just when we did the stimulus, we \nraise taxes.\n  I want to take up the theme of the impact on our economy of this \nbudget. That is the role of the Joint Economic Committee, and that is \nwhy they have been given a period of time to comment on this, because \nthis has such a profound impact.\n  Now I want to talk about the impact of raising taxes at this point in \ntime on the overall economy. I have talked about entitlement programs, \nthe failure to address those, the long-term pain that is associated \nwith that, and the additional pain by putting it off on a longer basis. \nNow what about the impact of raising taxes at this point in time on our \neconomy and who is going to pay those increased taxes? The Democratic \nmajority's budget will raise taxes on at least 116 million Americans. \nIt is not just on the rich, unless there are 116 million people \ncategorized as that in the United States. It will tax the hard-earned \nincome and retirement benefits of millions of American families and \nseniors to pay for larger and larger government rather than reform. I \nthink what people want to see is, you guys are going to operate within \nthe amount that you have and reform the system. Reform what you have, \ndon't tax and spend. Let's leave taxes where they are or make them \nlower so we can grow the economy more and then reform the system within \nrather than just adding and adding and adding.\n  The majority would have you believe that they will offer amendments \nto make the middle-class parts of the tax reductions permanent. They \nare not including any teeth in that budget amendment, and we will \nalmost certainly not see legislation to accomplish that extension in \nthis Congress. It is just empty promises. Democrats complain that the \ntax relief measures of 2001 and 2003 primarily benefitted the wealthy. \nLet's go through a couple of charts to look at that claim and see who \nis paying these tax increases or paying and receiving the tax relief of \n2001 and 2003 and who would pay, if what the majority is putting \nforward is enacted, the tax increases.\n  As shown by the changes in the share of total Federal tax liability \nby income group on the chart, the percentage of all taxes paid by the \ntop income group has increased since the tax relief measures were \nenacted, and the share of taxes paid by the bottom four income groups \nhas declined. I think this tells a dramatic and different story than \nwhat we hear a lot of times in the rhetoric.\n\n[[Page S1861]]\n\nWhere you look at the various income categories, the lowest 20-percent \nincome category, next 20, next 20 up, and on up, and then we put a \nblock here showing the top 1 percent income category. My point of \nshowing this is on your bottom four income categories, the lowest 20 \npercent earners under the changes in Federal tax liabilities 2000 to \n2005, this is the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, the greatest beneficiaries \nunder those tax cuts were the lowest income categories. The biggest \nbeneficiary under those tax cuts was the bottom 20 percent. That is as \nit should be. The lowest income category should have the biggest \nimpact, the most positive impact. You are seeing that in then the next \nlowest 20 percent, the bottom 40 percent here, then the 60, and then \nthe 80 percent of lowest incomes.\n  Now you look at the top 20 percent earners, they pay an increase as a \npercentage of the Federal budget of taxes under these tax cuts in 2001 \nand 2003. And your top 1 percent is up 8.2 percent in terms of what \nthey pay as their share of Federal taxes.\n  My point in saying this is, these tax cuts have worked as they should \nhave. They have cut the overall tax rate for individuals, and \nparticularly for lower income individuals. They have stimulated the \neconomy, and they have shifted the tax burden to the higher end of the \nincome distribution. When you say tax cuts for the rich, your really \nshould be talking about tax cuts for most Americans and the percentage \nthey pay. This is as it should be. This is how it was designed. So when \npeople say we have done these tax cuts for the rich, we are not going \nto extend them, does this chart show tax cuts for the rich? I think it \nshows tax cuts primarily benefitting the lower 80 percent of wage \nearners and having a burden shifting to the top 20 percent of income \nearners. That is the design it should have. It has grown the economy \noverall. It has been the way we should go.\n\n  Yes, despite the tax relief measures that many tout as tax cuts for \nthe wealthy, the share of taxes paid by the top 10 percent of income \nearners rose more quickly than during previous periods, including \nperiods with higher top marginal tax rates. According to the most \nrecent data, the share of all Federal income taxes paid by the top 10 \npercent has reached an all-time high of 73 percent. Let me say that \nagain. According to the most recent data, the share of all Federal \nincome taxes paid by the top 10 percent has reached an all-time high of \n73 percent. You can see the trend line of what is taking place from \n1979; the top 10 percent of income earners, 1979, the percentage of \nincome taxes paid was below 50 percent. In 2000, 68 percent; now it is \nall the way up to 73 percent, as it should be.\n  Democrats talk about raising taxes on the wealthy, but fail to \nmention that not extending the tax relief measures of 2001 and 2003 \nwill result in huge tax increases for all Americans, as this chart \ndisplaying average percent increases in taxes by income levels shows. I \nwanted to show you this one. Low- and middle-income families will be \nthe hardest hit by the scheduled tax increases that will occur in 2011. \nThese families benefitted the most from a reduction in the bottom tax \nrate, from the child tax credit and marriage penalty relief contained \nin the 2001, 2003 tax relief measures. If the tax relief measures of \n2001 and 2003 are not made permanent, families with $50,000 in income \nwill see their tax bills rise by 261 percent in 2011.\n  On the other hand, families with $500,000 or more in income will \nexperience a 12- to 13-percent rise in their taxes. Is that what you \nwant for a structure of tax increases, putting the largest hikes on the \nlowest earning families and the smallest hikes on the upper earners? I \ndon't think that is the way you want to structure tax increases. I \ndon't think that is the way the American public would want to see that \nstructured. I don't think the American people would want to see any tax \nincreases. The average household will pay an additional $1,833 under \nthe Democrat's plan. Many will have their taxes rise by even more. \nSeniors, families with children will pay an additional $2,000 or more. \nMarried couples will pay an additional $3,000. Small business owners \nwill have their tax bills rise by more than $4,000.\n  Another shortcoming in this budget is the failure to adequately \naddress the growing burden that the AMT will place on many middle-\nincome families. Although the AMT was enacted initially to prevent \nmillionaires from avoiding taxes altogether, it will soon ironically \naffect a greater percentage of middle-income married couples with \nchildren than millionaires. Let me show this chart, the ones it is \ngoing to impact.\n  This says, middle-income married couples with kids will be more \nlikely than millionaires to pay the AMT in 2010. Here is your married \ncouples with kids, AGI of $75,000 to $100,000, 89 percent will be in \nthe AMT; millionaires, 39 percent will be in the AMT. The AMT needs to \ngo. I think we should go and offer an optional flat tax for the overall \nTax Code and do away with the AMT altogether. You can see its \ndisproportionate negative impact on families, not hitting its target \nand having an overall very negative impact on the economy.\n  Given the time I have left, I want to talk about a proposal we are \ngoing to put up in this budget and it is a bill on the CARFA \ncommission, the Committee on Accountability and Review of Federal \nAgencies. It is something we have talked about before and we have had \nit up as a proposal in the Congress. I have had it up as a proposal and \nI have had a number of cosponsors. On the current CARFA bill, we have \n24 cosponsors. I hope it will be a bill that my colleagues in the \nmajority will look at and support. It is built on the BRAC Commission. \nI would note that the BRAC Commission provided for a process to close \nmilitary bases. Before we had BRAC, it was impossible to close a \nmilitary base. Any time you wanted to close one, the people in that \ndistrict, that State would fight you. You would never get any of them \nclosed. We put together this BRAC process. They came up with a list of \nbases to close, and then they presented it to Congress. Congress got \none vote up or down, close all of them, keep all of them, deal, no \ndeal. Through that system, we have now saved the Federal taxpayer over \n$65 billion from that process of closing military bases and \nconsolidating them in a few areas, working toward greater efficiencies. \nIt has been very successful.\n  What we need to do now as a part of the Federal budget is take that \nto the rest of the Government so we can close Federal programs that are \nno longer working.\n  I want to show you this report card of how successful is the Federal \nGovernment. This is the Federal Government report card, and this is \ndone as a scoring by Federal agencies, where they score the \neffectiveness of various programs for hitting their intended target \nwhen they were started and for the budget they have been given. I want \nto note that if you gave a GPA to the Federal Government on \naccomplishments that it does with the money it has been given, the \noverall grade point average that the Federal Government gets is a 1.14 \nout of a 4.0 GPA. Now, that is not very good.\n\n  What happens--everybody knows this is what takes place--we get a \nprogram started, it gets funded, and it is never ended. It may be \ncompletely successful and all is accomplished, but the program \ncontinues because we do not do any sort of culling process at all. Then \nwe want to do something new, but wait a minute, we did not do away with \nthe old.\n  The BRAC process we are talking about putting on the rest of \nGovernment--this CARFA Commission--would put that process on the rest \nof Government and I think dramatically improve this GPA because now you \nstart getting rid of programs that are no longer effective, just like \nwhen we had military bases that were in places that were there because \nof maybe the Spanish American War or the early wars in this country--\ncompletely out of position, no longer necessary but sustained because \nthey had supporters in the system, even though they were not being \neffective.\n  Well, imagine if you take that system of protection and nonculling \nand apply it to the rest of Government. How many programs do we have \nthat we have created over the 200-plus-year history of the country, and \nwe have never done away with any of them? We have not even adequately \nevaluated their effectiveness. You can see why we would be able to \nimprove the government's GPA score and be able to have more money to \nput in higher priority\n\n[[Page S1862]]\n\nareas, such as the National Institutes of Health, where I would like to \ndo a war on cancer; or the things we need to do for infrastructure in \nthe country. Yet we have never been able to eliminate any spending.\n  Here is a systems approach, under my proposal, that has worked in \nanother area, that has been key, that has produced $65 billion in \nsavings, that we need to take to the rest of Government.\n  So one of the amendments I will be putting forward is asking for the \nestablishment of this CARFA Commission--Commission on Budgetary \nAccountability and Review of Federal Agencies--that will provide a \nlist--a group on an annual basis--of programs that should be eliminated \nand give Congress then one vote, up or down: agree or disagree whether \nto eliminate this whole group or to keep the whole group.\n  I think that is something we need to do overall. It ought to be \nsomething we can come together on, on both sides of the aisle. I would \nnote that in traveling across this country and talking with people, one \nof the big things the American public wants to see us do is get \ntogether and get something done on something that is significant to \nthem.\n  One of those things is that we would be much more responsible to the \nFederal taxpayers as to what we are spending their money on. If we can \nbecome more responsible on that and work across the aisle and they \ncould see Federal programs that are being eliminated because they are \nno longer effective or they are wasteful--and then they would actually \nsee that taking place--I think people would then trust us more with \ntaxpayer dollars rather than not trusting us with taxpayer dollars. If \nwe can show them that, they would see us doing it on a bipartisan \nbasis.\n  This is something for which the outcome is certainly not stacked. \nThis is something that both sides could support as a process because we \nhave in the past. We could finally see something starting to take place \nin eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse in the Federal Government. \nEverybody is opposed to waste, fraud, and abuse in this body--\neverybody. Yet it continues because the system is built to spend, it is \nnot built to save, it is not built to reduce. We have a system that is \nbuilt to save and reduce, and it is called that BRAC system in the \ncontext of military bases. Then that saved money is put into higher \npriority needs. Let's take that system out to the broader body of \ngovernment.\n  This is the short period of time given to the Joint Economic \nCommittee to talk about the impact of the overall budget on the U.S. \neconomy. The impact of this budget that the majority is putting forward \nis profound and it is negative on the overall U.S. economy. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against it because of that.\n  It fails to address any sort of entitlement reform. It increases \ntaxes at exactly the wrong time. You do not need to increase taxes, I \nthink, at any time because of the scale of taxes. But when you have a \nslowing economy, it is the absolute wrong time to raise taxes. The \nDemocrat's budget also does not deal with reform of the AMT, the \nalternative minimum tax, which it should. It raises taxes on lower \nincome individuals in this society and in our economy, not on upper \nincome individuals. Again, it does have tax increase at exactly the \nwrong time. And it does not include things such as fundamental spending \nreform through a CARFA type of process we used in the military base \nBRAC system before.\n  Because of these failures of big-ticket, overarching items, this is \nthe wrong budget at the wrong time that will have a negative impact on \nour overall economy. It will have a profoundly negative impact on our \noverall economy. It is not the right medicine of what we need to move \nforward. For us to grow this economy at this point in time, we need \nlower taxes, not higher taxes. For us to grow this economy and provide \nfor our future, we need entitlement reform now. We also need to be able \nto get at our wasteful spending in the Government. We need to adjust \nour systems to be able to do that. Those are reforms that if we did \nthem now--and did them at this point in time--we could have a much \nbrighter and sustained future. This budget does not provide for those. \nFor those reasons, I will be opposing this budget.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve any time I have on the \nRepublican side for the JEC.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto speak for up to 15 minutes within the time allocated for the Joint \nEconomic Committee on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  I wish to, first of all, start my presentation today with an \noverarching commendation of the work of the Budget Committee and, in \nparticular, Chairman Kent Conrad, who worked, as he always does, along \nwith the members of his committee from both parties who have worked \nvery hard on this budget.\n  We are going to have a significant debate this week and we are doing \nthat now and it will be fairly heated because we have broad \ndisagreements about this budget. But I do wish to commend Chairman \nConrad and his work over many months, as he does every year, in his \ncommittee.\n  I wish to focus on three areas: First of all, our fiscal situation \nthat we face now because of what has been happening in the last several \nyears with our Federal budget; secondly, to talk about our families and \nthe struggles so many families are living through right now; and then, \nfinally, to summarize very briefly some of the Democratic proposals and \nhow they compare to the President's budget.\n  But I wish to start first with our fiscal situation. And I wish to \nthank Nathan Steinwald, who is with us, who is not only helping with \ngetting the right chart up but also has done a lot of work on our staff \nto prepare us for these budget debates.\n  The first chart sets forth the deficit as it has taken hold over \ntime. It starts on the far left corner, with that green bar, which \nstarts at the year 2001, the first year of President Bush's \nadministration. That is his first year. There was $128 billion in \nsurplus in his first year. I would argue that is a surplus that was \nleft over from the prior administration.\n  But then you go into the 6 years after that, where we have data set \nforth and depicted on this chart showing the deficits since President \nBush has been in office from 2002 to 2007--$158 billion in deficit; \n$378 billion in deficit; the largest deficit, $413 billion, in 2004; it \nreduced somewhat to $318 billion in 2005. It had been reduced and went \ndown to $162 billion last year. But then here is where we begin to get \ninto trouble again. The projected deficit, as it is set forth in \nPresident Bush's budget: $410 billion is a projection for 2008; for \n2009, it is $407 billion.\n  So we go from a surplus, when he came into office, far into deficit. \nJust when you think we are crawling out of it, because of his \nproposal--if we enacted his budget--we are going to go back into almost \nrecord deficit. You can see they are almost at the record level of $413 \nbillion. So that is a big problem. That chart alone is evidence to tell \nus we should not adopt President Bush's budget.\n  So let's go to the next chart, which focuses not on deficit but on \ndebt. Unfortunately, this chart tells us even more. This is bad news. I \nwill try to get to good news as soon as I can, but I think it is \nimportant to set forth where we have been, where we are, and where we \nare going. This is the debt of the United States: $5.8 trillion--that \nis what the T means--in 2001, the first year of President Bush's \nadministration. As if it were ascending steps to an unknown height, \nstep after step after step going up, the debt number is increasing year \nafter year after year.\n  So we keep borrowing under this administration ad nauseam, borrowing \nagainst our children's future. It is not just about some far off debt \nthat this Government has put on our children--that is bad enough; that \nis reason enough to try to bring that number down--but we are paying \nfor this every year, hundreds of billions of dollars in debt service \nright now. In 2007, we had that, and in years before that--2008, 2009. \nSo we are paying for it now to the tune of hundreds of billions of \ndollars.\n  Here is where we will be in 2009: a debt number of $10.4 trillion. At \nsome\n\n[[Page S1863]]\n\npoint in that year, we will achieve a debt number of $10.4 trillion. \nThe President, even though he will technically be out of office in \nJanuary of 2009, bears responsibility, a large part, if not all the \nresponsibility, for that number: $10.4 trillion. In essence, this \nPresident has become the ``10 Trillion Dollar Man,'' the ``10 Trillion \nDollar President''--not something that anyone would want as part of \ntheir legacy.\n  It is important to note that $5.8 trillion--that was the level we \nwere at when he came into office--that number was actually starting to \ngo down in the last couple of years of the prior administration. So \ninstead of staying on that path and having a flat line--so to speak, \nholding it under control--this President, with a lot of help from the \nRepublican Congresses, by the way, sent that number through the roof.\n  As you can see, the final number--the most disturbing number, if we \nstay on the path we are on and do not adopt the policies that will lead \nus to get us on the path of fiscal responsibility--in 2013, the debt \nwill be $13.3 trillion. Again, we are going to pay for that every year.\n  We spent last year, in terms of debt service, more money than all of \nthe Medicaid Program, which is over $200 billion in and of itself, and \nall of the State Children's Health Insurance Program. And you can add \nmore to that. But consider that: We spend more on debt service than we \ndo on both of those programs that help poor children, Americans who are \nsuffering from a disability, children of working families who have \nhealth care. All of that health care, all the good things that happen \nin those programs do not equal what we are paying in debt service to \nfinance his debt.\n  So we are in a debt mess here. It is a fiscal nightmare. I will go to \nthe next chart, which shows what we owe the foreign governments.\n  A portion of that almost $10 trillion in debt, of course, is foreign \ndebt, debt to foreign countries. The top 10 foreign holders of our \nnational debt: In first place, Japan. We owe the Japanese Government \n$581 billion. We owe China $478 billion. It goes down from there; the \nUK; the ``oil exporters,'' we owe them $138 billion. It goes down from \nthere.\n  That is another piece of bad news. This is not some far off debt \nnumber. Some of them are allies; some of them are not. Some of them we \nhave some real disputes with. We owe them hundreds of billions of \ndollars.\n  I will go to the next chart where we have been hearing a lot the last \ncouple days about the tax cuts. Well, let's look at how much they have \ncost us and what they will cost us. The cost of extending the Bush tax \ncuts explodes outside the 5-year budget window. So when you are talking \nabout here that we are debating the budget for 2009--talk about 2009, \nlook at the way that number goes up starting in 2010: the 10-year cost \nof $2.9 trillion for the Bush tax cuts if we stay on this path from \n2009 to 2018. So if you want to adopt the Bush tax cut, that is what \nyou have to pay for. That is what you have to pay for in that 10-year \nwindow. To say it is unaffordable, to say it is fiscally reckless is a \ngross understatement, but I think we can see from all of the red why \nthat is the case.\n\n  So what do we do when we debate this budget? We can talk a lot about \nthe fiscal situation, but I think it is probably even more important to \ntalk about what has been happening in our country with regard to our \nfamilies.\n  It seems that in the life of a family, in terms of costs, everything \nthat a family hopes would be going down is going up. A family would \nhope, I guess, that health care costs would be leveling off or going \ndown. They have actually gone way up. We would hope the cost of a \ncollege education has flatlined or is staying at a certain level or \ngoing down. The cost of a college education is going up. Everyone knows \nthe price of gasoline is going through the roof, is going up over and \nover again, month after month. The price of oil--I don't know what it \ndid today, but we were over $105 a barrel; the subprime crisis we are \nliving through and the cost of housing, the value of the house in terms \nof that family's value, their economic value on paper but also the \nvalue to our economy. So this housing crisis, caused in large measure \nby mortgage brokers and others who were unregulated and really took \npeople over a cliff, so to speak, with regard to their housing costs, \nhas caused tremendous pressure, first of all, on individual families \nbut, of course, on our neighborhoods. Whenever we have a property \nforeclosed upon, a neighborhood disintegrates time after time. But at \nthe same time, the costs of everything in the life of that family is \ngoing up, whether it is housing or gasoline or education or health \ncare.\n  The things a family hopes would be going up are things like consumer \nconfidence. That is going down. The value of one's home, one would hope \nit would be increasing, but that has been going down. All of these up \nand down problems for families are real-life crises for so many \nfamilies across America. What they expect us to do with this budget is \neverything we can to help dig them out of the economic crisis they \nface.\n  So what should we do? Well, we can do a lot. We can, first of all, be \nfiscally responsible but also have budget policies and strategies in \nplace that focus on creating not just jobs, not just any jobs, but \ngood-paying, family-sustaining jobs. That means in particular budget \nproposals on how we fund an agency, what we cut and what we don't, what \nwe increase and what we don't, but also it means trying to set aside \nplaces in the budget where we can make investments over time. These \naren't things that will happen right away, these aren't things that can \nhappen quickly, but these are priorities.\n  For example, education--I think our budget should reflect that we \nplace a value upon and we are actually going to invest in education, \njust as a good CEO would invest in workers. First of all, this budget \nresolution invests in education strategies that create jobs and growth, \npreparing our workforce for the global economy, making college \naffordable, improving student achievement. You can see what it does \nthere: education tax cuts up to $13 billion, $5.7 billion over the \nPresident's budget in discretionary funding for the Department of \nEducation and Head Start. Thirdly, an education reserve fund for school \nconstruction and higher education authorization.\n  The second chart talks about the way we can grow our economy and \ncreate high-paying, good jobs by investing in energy. The old way of \nthinking about this was that if you had to conserve energy or be more \nefficient, that was going to cost jobs. Now we know that when we are \nnot in conflict, one of the best ways to create jobs is to invest in \ngreen-collar jobs and in green energy.\n  I will go to the last chart in terms of our infrastructure, just to \nget this in before we conclude.\n  Our infrastructure, everyone knows--we knew this before, but \ncertainly when we saw the bridge collapse in Minnesota--that we have to \ninvest in basic infrastructure. This budget resolution sets aside room \nin the budget to do just that: to invest in our infrastructure, whether \nit is highways or mass transit, whether it is airports or what we call \nready-to-go infrastructure projects. Sometimes, when a company wants to \nlocate in a community, they don't have time for a lot of debate. They \nneed to get moving very quickly. We need projects and land set aside to \ndo that.\n  I will conclude with one final chart because I know the chairman of \nthe Joint Economic Committee, Senator Schumer, is with us, and he is \nprobably coming up next, and I want to make sure he has all the time he \nneeds because he has been a great leader on these budget issues.\n  The final chart I will put up: We hear a lot about Democratic \nspending, spending, spending from the Republican side. The differential \nbetween what the President proposed--$3.04 trillion--in this 2009 \nbudget and what we are proposing is $3.8 trillion. That is a 1-percent \ndifference. So when we hear debate and arguments back and forth that \nDemocrats are spending too much--more than the President--the \ndifference is 1 percent.\n  I have a lot more to get into, but I am going to conclude with this \nthought: We have to invest in good-paying jobs, family-sustaining jobs, \nand we also have to get our fiscal house in order. Unfortunately, I \nthink the President's budget does not do that. The Democratic budget \nwill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n\n[[Page S1864]]\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, may I make an inquiry of the Chair? How \nmuch time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes. Is \nthat in order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I wish to thank my colleague from \nPennsylvania before he leaves the floor. He is a great member of the \ncommittee, a great Senator, and always has his eye on the average \nfamily. One of the reasons he has been so effective on the Joint \nEconomic Committee is he understands all the concepts, of course, but \nthen he is able to take them and relate them directly to the needs of \naverage families. I thank him for the good job he did this afternoon, \nwhich is typical of the good job he always does on the JEC and \nelsewhere. I also thank my colleague, Senator Webb, who also took some \ntime to speak on these issues.\n  Now I will conclude our Humphrey Hawkins budget debate.\n  Today, we are looking at an economy on the verge of recession. Many \neconomists would say it is already in recession. The economic hits to \nmiddle-class American families just keep on coming and coming.\n  Before I talk about our Democratic budget package, which is far \nsuperior to the President's budget, I would like to use this Humphrey \nHawkins debate time as chair of the Joint Economic Committee to talk a \nlittle bit about the economy.\n  In the last week alone, we have learned that we are experiencing \nrecord home foreclosures in the prime and subprime mortgage markets \nfrom coast to coast. Every single State has been affected by an \nincrease in foreclosures. According to an analysis by the Joint \nEconomic Committee, home prices in every major market are falling. \nFamilies have historically low equity in their homes.\n  Moody's Economy.com estimates that 8.8 million homeowners--that is 10 \npercent of all homeowners--will owe more money than their homes are \nworth. Think of that: 10 percent of all homeowners--not homes in \nforeclosure, not homes in trouble, but 10 percent of all homeowners \nwill owe more money than their homes are worth.\n  Just this past Friday, the Labor Department reported back-to-back \nmonths of losses in jobs, with serious losses this past month in \nmanufacturing, construction, and retail. Today, the Commerce Department \nreleased data showing rising trade deficits with China and oil-\nproducing nations such as Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. Americans are \npaying a record average $3.22 per gallon of gasoline today, and if that \nwasn't enough, oil is selling for over $110 a barrel. Let me repeat \nthat. Oil is selling for over $110 per barrel. That is an alltime \nrecord.\n  As we put forward a more sensible budget plan for our country this \nyear, we have to recognize that the pressure on families has been made \nworse since President Bush took over. Over the last 7 years, Americans \nhave been squeezed by skyrocketing energy, health care, and education \ncosts. Energy costs have ballooned 64 percent during Bush's tenure. A \ngallon of regular-grade gasoline has increased 60 percent in real \nterms, up from $1.62 in January 2001. To put this in perspective, the \naverage middle-class family is paying more just in higher gasoline \nprices than they received in the Bush tax cuts. Again, let me repeat \nthat. The average American family is paying more just in higher \ngasoline prices than they received in the President's tax cut. That is \nappalling.\n  There are 7.2 million more people uninsured since the President took \noffice, and average health insurance for families who do have it \nincreased nearly 40 percent since 2000. Inflation-adjusted tuition for \n4-year public colleges increased 36 percent, to $5,526 per year between \n1999 and 2005. In February of 2008, 4.9 million people were working \npart time for economic reasons but wanted to work full time, and the \nunderemployment rate is almost 9 percent--9 percent--up 1.6 percent \nsince 2000. Now there are 1.4 million fewer people with jobs since the \nPresident took office--1.4 million unemployed.\n  The bottom line is that this administration is the owner of the worst \njobs record since Herbert Hoover, and the last 2 months of losing \nnearly 90,000 jobs secures the President's unfortunate place in \nhistory, as this chart shows. Here is Herbert Hoover. Everyone did \nbetter than George Bush since Herbert Hoover.\n  The significant job losses in manufacturing and construction have \ncontinued since the housing market has been in trouble and doesn't seem \nto be getting better. The job losses in the retail sector are \nparticularly troubling because it indicates that consumer spending, \nwhich has driven this economy, has also declined measurably.\n  The President's ``hear no evil, see no evil, do no evil'' policies on \nour economy simply don't work. It is only a matter of time before \nconsecutive months of job losses, falling home prices, rising energy \nprices, and cutbacks in consumer spending lead us into a full-blown \nrecession. It is crystal clear to everyone except the people in the \nWhite House that we are inevitably heading toward a recession.\n  It isn't a surprise to many in Congress that we are on the brink of \nrecession--or are already in one--although the administration has done \nan excellent job of hiding its head in the sand, because their strategy \nhas produced burgeoning budget deficits, a serious global trade \nimbalance, and brought us to the brink of recession. That is because \ntheir only economic strategy for everything is to cut taxes--help their \nwealthy friends and no help for the rest of America.\n  The unmistakable economic downturn began early last year as the \nsubprime mortgage mess unfolded. The spillover effects into the broader \nhousing market, the credit market, and overall economy are tremendous \nand ongoing.\n  According to the JEC's conservative estimates, by 2009 at least 1.3 \nmillion foreclosures will occur as the riskiest subprime mortgages \nreset over the course of this year and next. This will lead to the \ndestruction of approximately $100 billion in housing wealth, including \nan estimated $71 billion in direct losses on foreclosed properties and \na decline in the value of neighboring properties by an additional $32 \nbillion.\n  Overall housing prices continue to fall, as seen in the almost 10 \npercent decline of the S/Case-Shiller national home price index since \nthe first quarter of 2006.\n  Last week, the Federal Reserve released data showing that American \nfamilies hold less equity in their houses than at any time since the \nFed began tracking this data in 1945. Under the Bush administration, \nthe primary source of wealth for most Americans--the equity in their \nhouses--dropped by nearly 10 percentage points, from a 57.8 percent \nequity stake when Bush took office to a current low of 47.9 percent.\n  Given that housing wealth totaled about $23 trillion in 2006, the \ndecline in household balance sheets is now between $1 and $2 trillion. \nDeclines in house prices are likely to have significant negative \neffects on consumer spending and a host of other deleterious effects on \nthe economy. But housing is the bull's-eye of this crisis. It has \nspread outward and outward and outward. Again, the administration, \nwrapped in ideological handcuffs, does nothing.\n\n  We are also borrowing to pay for this war in Iraq. The economic cost \nfor the Iraq war is truly staggering. According to professor Joe \nStiglitz, a Nobel Laureate who testified at our Joint Economic \nCommittee last month, the war could cost $3 trillion--that is with a \nT--$3 trillion. According to a report our committee did in November--we \nhave been pursuing this issue of the cost of the war--the war will cost \neach American household $37,000.\n  The Federal Government is increasingly reliant on the rest of the \nworld to buy our public debt, and with falling dollars and skyrocketing \ndebt, who knows how much longer we can count on the largesse of our \ntrading partners.\n  President Bush turned huge budget surpluses into huge deficits in a \nfew short years, as we see here. In January 2001, the CBO projected \nsurpluses would total $5.6 trillion in 2002 to 2011. In 2001, CBO's \nprojection was a surplus of $573 billion in 2007. In reality, the \ndeficit was $163 billion, a turnaround of $736 billion, and more than \n$100 billion for every year that the President has been in office. This \nremarkable, dramatic turnaround in the budget picture shows a reckless \ndisregard by this administration for living within our means and\n\n[[Page S1865]]\n\nhas, frankly, jeopardized the economic future of families across the \ncountry.\n  The President may have passed some big tax cuts for the people who \nneed it least, the very well off. But he has not been very \ncompassionate to future generations who will be paying for the \nincreased debt for generations. I compliment the Senator from North \nDakota for the amazing budget he put together. It is the best budget \ndocument I have ever seen since I have been in the Senate.\n  The Democratic budget provides some measure of sanity and order to \nour budget priorities and, hopefully, will put our country back on more \nsolid economic footing. Senator Conrad did an amazing job in crafting a \nbudget resolution that gets us started on the road to recovery from \nthese misguided policies.\n  One of the most important things about Senator Conrad's budget is \nthat by restraining spending and making the right choices on long-term \ntax cuts, it provides room for important middle tax cuts to ease the \nmiddle-class squeeze, such as the tax cuts provided in Senator Baucus's \namendment. These tax cuts are not a fix for what ails our economy in \nthe long term, but they will indeed help middle-class families make \nends meet.\n  Senator Baucus's amendment is broad-based tax relief targeted to the \nmiddle class, plain and simple. Everybody benefits, but the middle \nclass gets most of the spoils. That is the way we ought to provide tax \nrelief in this country--not providing more and more tax breaks to the \ntop one-tenth of 1 percent, whose incomes have shot up into the \nstratosphere. Tax cuts for those who need them, not for those who would \nnot notice them. That is our watchword, while the other side continues \nto believe in trickle down, but not even trickle down from the middle \nclass to the poor but from those higher regions of wealth.\n  If we look at the tax cuts that passed in 2001, we know which ones \nshould be made permanent and which ones should not. The $1,000-per-\nchild tax credit, marriage penalty relief, and the 10-percent bracket \nare all sensible tax cuts that can be made permanent with the surpluses \nprovided for in the Conrad budget.\n  The Baucus amendment does some other sensible things as well. Across \nthe country, parents are struggling to manage the crunch of work and \nfamily. According to a report issued by the Joint Economic Committee, \nfull-time childcare costs average about $7,300 per year in the United \nStates. That is almost 20 percent of the median income of families with \nyoung children. The Baucus amendment will permanently extend the tax \ncredit for childcare expenses to provide essential benefits to working \nfamilies.\n  Senator Baucus's amendment also includes provisions to offset the \nimpact of rising local property taxes. I hear about that from my \nconstituents every week. The amendment will make permanent the \nimportant military tax benefits passed both by the House and the Senate \nlast December. These benefits are particularly targeted toward service \nmen and women and their families. Given the multiple rotations many of \nthem have endured, these tax provisions are supported by all, and they \nare the least we can do.\n  I know what the other side will say: ``Democrats are for tax \nincreases.'' My friends, telling people who are making a million \ndollars a year or more that they should continue to get a tax cut is \nwhat is wrong, not saying they should begin to pay their fair share. I \nhave news for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Their old \narguments are not going to work because the middle class has seen \npromise after promise from this administration, and then they have seen \nthe vast majority of the tax cuts go to the very top of the income \nscale.\n  I will repeat it again: The average middle-class person has paid more \nof an increase in gasoline than their entire Bush tax cut, while this \nadministration twiddles its thumbs about the energy crisis and \ncontinues to tell those at the top of the economic ladder that they get \nthe vast majority of the benefits, even though they don't need it.\n  So I hope we will support the Conrad budget. It is a good, fine, and \nwell-thought-out one. I hope we will support the Baucus tax cuts, which \nare targeted at the middle class. I hope we will support a budget such \nas the one proposed on our side, which is smart and helps the middle \nclass.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given an \nadditional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from Utah \nhave?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have 15 minutes, and I have asked for an \nadditional 5.\n  Mr. COBURN. According to the agreement we had, that would put us \nuntil 7:25 when Senator Brown would be eligible to speak; is that \nright?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma would start at 6:55 \nand have until 7:25.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to express my opposition to and \ndisappointment with the fiscal year 2009 budget resolution before us \ntoday.\n  Interestingly enough, I listened to the Senator from New York talk \nabout how the rich are getting away with things. Well, the upper 1 \npercent of all taxpayers paid 39 percent of all income taxes the last \ntime I heard. The upper 5 percent paid 60 percent of the total income \ntax in this country. The upper 50 percent pay 97 percent of all the \ntotal income tax in this country. The bottom 50 percent generally pay \nalmost nothing, and a good percentage of them get money from the \nFederal Government. So what is he talking about?\n  I think it was Yogi Berra who once said, ``This is like deja vu all \nover again.'' I am sure he was not talking about the Federal budget \nwhen he uttered these oft-quoted words, but he might as well have been. \nAs I look at the budget resolution before us today, and as I listen to \nthe arguments on both sides of the aisle, it seems to me that we could \nbe talking about last year's budget resolution. The numbers are \nsomewhat larger, but the arguments are about the same.\n  Now this might not be so bad if the budget resolution were a good \none. No, you would not hear me complaining about a repeat of a budget \nthat strengthened our economy, addressed our near-term problems, and \nprepared this country for the longer-term budget challenges of the \nfuture. Unfortunately, this is not the case. In fact, quite the \nopposite is true.\n  Once we were through with that resolution last year, it didn't even \nresemble what the budget resolution was calling for. In fact, I have \nbeen here for 31 years, and not one day has the conservative point of \nview been dominant in the Senate. The liberal point of view, with \nalmost all liberal Democrats and a few liberal Republicans, has held \nsway. That is where all the spending is coming from.\n  Instead, we are, once again, talking about a budget that raises taxes \nby an unprecedented amount, which will do untold harm to our economy, \nexacerbates our near-term problems by not holding spending in check, \nand totally ignores the longer-term mandatory program challenges of the \nfuture.\n  Much has already been said on this floor about the budget resolution \nand its failings. I could add a great deal more, but instead I choose \nto focus my remarks on three premises on which this budget is based. \nThree premises that, unfortunately, are false. And every child in \nSunday school knows that false premises are like the house whose \nfoundation is built upon sand. We all know that a house built upon \nsand, or a budget built upon false premises, cannot stand.\n  The first faulty premise underlying this budget resolution is that it \nwould not raise taxes on Americans. I know that my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle have said and will continue to say that this \nbudget does not raise one cent in taxes. Technically speaking, this is \ntrue. However, while the document before us may contain no actual tax \nincrease language, it does nothing to prevent the largest tax increase \never, which is set to occur at the end of 2010 if the 2001 and 2003 tax \ncuts are allowed to expire as scheduled.\n  The American people need to ask a simple question of this budget. \nWhat is\n\n[[Page S1866]]\n\nit doing to make sure that my tax bill does not go up in 2010?\n  They will be met with deafening silence.\n  Now, those on the other side will try and explain this deficiency \naway. They will argue that allowing a tax cut to expire is not the same \nthing as raising taxes. Well, try telling that to the 116 million \nAmerican taxpayers who will face higher taxes if these tax cuts are \nallowed to expire. Try explaining this nuance to the 43 million \nAmerican families who, on average, will owe $2,300 more, and to the 18 \nmillion seniors who will pay an average of $2,200 more.\n  This is not small potatoes. Families that do not consider themselves \nrich, that struggle to make ends meet, and that are doing all they can \nto make the mortgage and save for college, are going to get hit with \nmassive tax bills. They are going to see their paychecks shrink by \nhundreds of dollars every pay period. This is real money. Money that \nfamilies could use to pay medical bills or pay tuition, and instead it \nis going to go to the Federal Government.\n  It will not be much fun trying to explain this to the owners and \nmanagers of 27 million American small businesses. Try telling them that \ntheir higher tax bill is not really a tax increase. No, not at all. It \nis merely the reversal of a temporary lower tax rate they should have \nbeen grateful to have gotten for a decade, due to the generosity of \nUncle Sam, who no longer deems it necessary to throw such favors their \nway.\n  Good luck selling that one.\n  I will tell you one thing--I do not want to tell the hundreds of \nthousands of Utah families, seniors, and small business owners that the \nextra dollars we were letting them keep for a few years are now needed \nfor more urgent things, such as higher spending in Washington.\n  So if this is not a tax increase, I do not know what is. The other \nside can call it what it wants. But if the end result is more money \ncoming to Washington, and less money staying in the paycheck, the \nfamily budget, or the small business expansion account, this is a T-A-\nX, Tax!\n  We have heard the other side talk about how they are for extending \nthe middle-class elements of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. We have even \nheard them say that the budget resolution provides for this, through \nthe adoption of an amendment offered by the Senator from Montana. $323 \nbillion for middle-class tax relief. Does any of this sound familiar? \nIt should, because the same amendment was offered, and adopted, in last \nyear's budget resolution.\n  I have a question about that tax relief. Where is it? What happened? \nLast year's Baucus amendment offered pretty much the same kind of tax \nrelief as this year's version. But, why did we need to adopt it again? \nThe answer, of course, is that nothing happened because the tax changes \nnecessary to carry out the stated intent of this amendment were never \nbrought up in the Finance Committee or on the floor of this Senate. \nThis is a shell game.\n\n  The reason why is that you have to look at the fine print on this \namendment to see what is really going on. The Baucus amendment allows \nonly for the consideration of so-called middle-class tax relief. It \ndoes not, however, provide a means to offset the lost revenue. Under \nthe Democratic pay-go rules, along with the $323 billion of tax relief \nthat the Baucus amendment purports to offer, there is an asterisk with \nfine print that says, provided that the revenue can be found to offset \nit. My goodness.\n  So this explains why we need the Baucus amendment again. The reason \nwe did not provide that middle-class tax relief is that we could not \nfind the revenue to offset it. But what about what my friend and \ncolleague, the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, says? He \npoints to the tax gap and says we can get the money there. All we have \nto do is stop some of the leakage in our tax system.\n  I agree with my colleague from North Dakota. I agree that we should \nbe able to reduce the tax gap. It is too large and it is inexcusable \nwhy $200 to $300 billion or more in taxes that are due go uncollected \neach year. But you know what? Our tax system, as leaky and clumsy and \nunfair and antiquated as it is, is the envy of much of the world as far \nas the percentage due that we collect.\n  Can we do better? Of course. Do we need to crack down on tax abuse \ndomestically and overseas? Indeed we do. Can we raise enough money by \nclosing the tax gap to offset the revenue loss of the amendment of the \nSenator from Montana? Not even close. As Senator Grassley very \neloquently demonstrated on this floor on Monday, the real potential for \nrevenue from the tax gap is very, very small in comparison to what the \nother side is claiming. If not, then where are the specific proposals \nfrom the other side to do it? Why haven't they been enacted, if it is \nso easy to get this revenue?\n  The tax increases inherent in this budget resolution will do untold \ndamage to our economy. Even if the other side can find the votes to \nincrease taxes enough to overcome the pay-go problem associated with \nsome of the middle-class tax relief proposed by the Senator from \nMontana, we would still be doing major harm to the economy.\n  We can perhaps look to the model provided for us by the chairman of \nthe Ways and Means Committee in his so-called Mother Tax bill. It is so \nnamed because my good friend Chairman Rangel said it represents the \nMother of All Tax Reforms. His ranking member, Congressman McCrery, \nmore aptly describes it as the Mother of All Tax Hikes.\n  I can tell you right now, as much as I hate to say this about my \nfriend Charlie Rangel, Congressman McCrery is right. This ``mother'' \nbill includes plenty of tax offsets. It would increase the income tax \nrates across the board to where they were in 2001, with the top rate \nexceeding 40 percent at the margin. This may sound as if it would \naffect only the wealthy, but this is another false premise. In reality, \nit would affect millions and millions of small and midsized businesses, \nthe great majority of which pay their taxes through the individual Tax \nCode.\n  How is this going to help us solve the economic problems our Nation \nis facing? This budget is nothing but a recipe for disaster.\n  The second faulty premise underlying this budget resolution is that \nthe increase in spending it authorizes will solve our long-term \neconomic problems. Yes, I think we have heard this before as well. Yes, \nit was last year in the fiscal year 2008 budget debate. That budget \nresolution called for $205 billion in increased spending over 5 years, \nand this number ballooned to $350 billion over 10 years. Apparently, \nthis amount was not high enough, so this budget ups the amount to $210 \nbillion over the next 5 years, and it will have the same ballooning \neffect over the years beyond because the spending gets built into the \nbaseline. That is the danger of a seemingly small amount of additional \nspending. It is insidious. It seems relatively small in the first year, \nand so it may be, but the way we do budgeting in Congress has a way of \nmultiplying the seemingly small increases so they are huge in a few \nyears. There is a compounding effect.\n  In his opening remarks on Monday, the distinguished chairman of the \nBudget Committee talked about the need for additional investment in \nAmerica. He spoke about priorities in education, energy, \ninfrastructure, law enforcement, weatherization, health care, uninsured \nchildren, food, drug safety, veterans, and much more.\n  I know the Senator from North Dakota is sincere, and I know he works \nhard and is very effective in presenting his side of the argument. I \nhave much admiration and affection for him. I care a great deal for \nhim. He has a very tough job, and he does it well.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is right about the needs of this \ncountry--they are unlimited, just like the needs of the typical \nAmerican family. The needs of the American people as a whole are \nunlimited. The problem in both situations is that we do not have \nunlimited resources, and neither does the family. We have to make \nchoices, and we have to set priorities. It would be nice if we could \nsimply take care of every problem in this Nation by spending the money \nthat is needed, just as it would be great if every American family had \nenough money to solve all of its problems. But that is not reality.\n  In reality, we are in serious financial trouble in this country. \nMoney trouble, if you will. When a family faces reality and knows it \nhas money trouble, that family will sit down at the kitchen table and \ndecide where to prioritize and\n\n[[Page S1867]]\n\nwhat has to go. That is exactly what we need to do at the national \nlevel.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is correct about another point, and \nthat is that the discretionary portion of our budget is getting \nsqueezed. According to Comptroller General David Walker, the portion of \ndiscretionary spending in 1966 was 67 percent of the total budget. By \n1986, this portion had dropped to 44 percent. By 2006, a couple years \nago, it was down to 38 percent.\n  This shrinking percentage of discretionary spending, however, is not \nbecause we are spending less in terms of nominal dollars. The fact is \nwe spent almost twice as much on discretionary programs in 2007 as we \ndid in 2000. However, our mandatory spending is increasing so much \nfaster. This growth in the entitlement programs, such as Medicare, \nMedicaid, and Social Security, is squeezing out our ability to grow the \namount we spend on discretionary programs.\n  But the answer is not to increase discretionary spending even by what \nthe proponents of this budget are calling a very small amount. We are \ngoing in the wrong direction, and this small amount will compound into \na large amount in a few years. And guess what. Once we spend and it \ngets built into the baseline, it is almost impossible to get it out.\n  This leads me to the third faulty premise underlying this budget \nresolution, and that is it is safe to ignore our longer term problems \nwith Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. I know if I were to \nseparately ask each Member of this body if we need to do something \nabout the growth of these programs, there is a good chance that every \nsingle Senator would agree we cannot afford to ignore them and that \nsomething has to be done to save our future. But as I looked over this \nbudget resolution, I cannot seem to find the part that addresses the \ngrowth of these programs, and yet the Government Accountability Office \ntells us that between now and 2032, spending on Medicare and Medicaid \nalone will grow about 230 percent. At the same time, our GDP will grow \nabout 70 percent if we are lucky.\n  Let me share some truly frightening numbers with you. The Government \nAccountability Office recently computed the fiscal exposures we face as \na nation from our unfunded obligations under Social Security and \nMedicare. In 2007 dollars, our total unfunded liability for future \nSocial Security benefits, assuming the law does not change, is $6.8 \ntrillion--that is trillion dollars. This is a number of galactic \nproportions, so big that it is hard to comprehend. But I have to tell \nyou, it pales in comparison to the amount of our unfunded liability \nassociated with Medicare, which is more than $34 trillion--that is \ntrillion dollars, $34 trillion. When this is combined with all other \nmajor fiscal exposures, the GAO estimates that our total unfunded \nliability is almost $53 trillion. That is with a T. This amount is \nnearly as high as the total household net worth of Americans, which is \n$59 trillion.\n\n  In other words, we are nearly bankrupt as a nation. Within a few \nyears, we will absolutely be bankrupt if something is not done. It is \nclear that this path is not sustainable. We all know it. Our children \nknow it, and our grandchildren are going to find it out the hard way. \nThey are going to blame us if we do not act to turn things around. It \nis as if we are all in a ship floating down a river. The waters are \nquite calm now, but the map shows that a very high and dangerous \nwaterfall is ahead of us. We know if we do not turn the ship around, \ndisaster awaits. But it is not an easy thing to do. We know we cannot \nturn it around in 1 year. It will take a lot of work and sacrifice. It \nwill take pain.\n  It is easy to say we should wait, that this is an election year and a \nnew captain and maybe a new crew will be taking over after the \nelection. But I say to my colleagues, we cannot afford to wait. In the \nmidst of the calm water, we can hear the roar of the waterfall. We are \ncoming to it very quickly, and if we wait too long, catastrophe will \nresult. The budget before us does nothing about the cataclysm just down \nthe river. It is a fatal flaw.\n  I started by mentioning that the rich do pay a lot of taxes right \nnow. Actually, the rich are paying more after the tax cuts than they \nwere paying before. The fact is, the upper 1 percent of the rich--the \nlast time I saw the figures, and it is even worse now--are paying about \n39 percent of all income taxes--the upper 1 percent of all taxpayers. \nAnd the top 5 percent pay about 60 percent of all taxes. And the upper \n50 percent pay almost 97 percent of all income taxes. Think about that. \nThe bottom 50 percent pay little or none and many of them get largess \nfrom the Federal Government. So this idea that the rich need to pay \nmore is a phony argument. It is time people got called on that \nargument. It is phony, it doesn't make sense, and we have to get with \nit around here. We cannot keep bringing up these phony budgets such as \nthis with all the budgetary gimmicks this one has in it.\n  I don't blame the distinguished Senator from North Dakota. He has a \nside that is fractionated. They want to spend more--that is how they \nkeep themselves in power--and he has to find gimmicks and some way of \njustifying additional spending, and this budget is filled with \nadditional spending, additional taxes, and a lot of budget gimmicks \nthat should not be in it.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this budget resolution. Let's get \nstarted on one that recognizes the dangers ahead and begins to turn \nthis ship around before we hit that cataclysmic waterfall.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak before Senator Coburn, my colleague from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the budget resolution \nbefore us this evening. Governing is about choosing. This budget makes \nthe right choices and at the same time maintains fiscal discipline.\n  Over the past year, I have held some 85 roundtables of 20 or 25 \npeople each in communities across the State. I have held them in some \n55 of Ohio's counties, listening to workers and business leaders, \nlistening to teachers and sheriffs, listening to people running social \nservice agencies and people served by those social service agencies. In \nevery town I visited, Ohioans have asked to work together with the \nFederal Government, not for a handout, not necessarily for assistance, \nbut to work together with the Federal Government in attacking the \nproblems of our small towns, our rural areas, our inner-ring suburbs, \nand our big cities.\n  I have heard from employers who have good jobs that go begging \nbecause we have not trained or retrained people in the skills they \nneed. I have heard from county commissioners, worried that their \ncrumbling bridges may fall and that their water and sewer \ninfrastructures are not sound. I have heard from doctors who think we \ncan do a much better job of providing access to health care through \ntheir offices and their examining rooms rather than through the \nemergency room, and not just for the 47 million Americans without \nhealth insurance, including 9 million children, but for the millions of \npeople in this country with inadequate health insurance.\n  Last month we saw the priorities of the Bush administration when he \nsent his budget to Congress. The Bush budget proposed to cut funding \nfor job training and technical education. Today I met with people from \nWayne County and Butler County, from Geauga County and Cuyahoga County, \nand all over my State, to talk to people who are teachers and \nadministrators, and superintendents and students, who depend on \nvocational training, technical education, and who provide training for \nso many in our State.\n  The Bush budget proposed to cut the community development block \ngrants by more than 20 percent. As big cities and small towns face the \nimpending problems that are in the midst now of these problems with \nforeclosures, the Bush budget proposed to cut health care for seniors \nand for children, and these are the choices of the Bush administration. \nThey are the choices of an administration that has gone in the wrong \ndirection year after year after\n\n[[Page S1868]]\n\nyear. They are the choices we must reject.\n  Our budget, by contrast, will increase Federal efforts to educate and \ntrain our citizens, young and old. Our budget will increase funding for \neconomic development and for rebuilding our Nation's infrastructure. \nOur budget will improve the health care of families and of children. \nOur budget will help to create good-paying jobs here in America.\n  This administration either doesn't care or doesn't understand what it \nis doing to the middle class and what is happening to the middle class. \nUp until last summer--in front of the Presiding Officer in the Banking \nCommittee--the Secretary of the Treasury and others in the \nadministration assured everyone the economy was doing fine and the \nhousing crisis was contained. Senator Menendez and so many others here \nspoke up for Federal involvement in trying to help the many people in \nNew Jersey and Ohio and across the country who were threatened with \nthis foreclosure problem in their homes and in their neighborhoods. But \nwhen the problems were mostly on Ohio's main streets, the main streets \nof Zanesville and Steubenville, the main streets of Toledo and Dayton \nand Lima and Marion, the administration was indifferent. They said the \nproblem would go away. But when the problems migrated from main street \nMansfield and main street Springfield to Wall Street, suddenly the \nproblems became important to the administration.\n  But even then the response of the Bush budget to economic troubles \nand to the problems of foreclosure across our country speaks volumes. \nIt proposes to cut taxes for the wealthiest people in the country, \noffset by cuts in Medicare. They want to pay for their tax cuts for the \nrichest people in the country, but they do it by making cuts in \nMedicare. They propose to reduce benefits under the Social Security \nsystem while pushing a privatization program that generates big fees \nfor Wall Street at the expense of seniors and disabled people in our \ncountry.\n  While families are struggling to afford the cost of sending their \nchildren to college, it proposes to cut Federal support for student \nloans. One of the greatest accomplishments of this new Democratic \nmajority, right off the bat, is what we were able to do to increase \nPell grants and what we have been able to do to bring down interest \nrates for student loans, and what the Governor of my State, Governor \nStrickland, has done by freezing college loans.\n  The Bush administration, it seems, as I said, either doesn't know, \ndoesn't understand, or doesn't care about these middle-class kids who \nare struggling to go to college.\n  My wife was the first in her family to go to college. She got loans, \nshe got grants, and she graduated with a debt of only a couple thousand \ndollars. That was almost 30 years ago. Today, it is very different, \nbecause the Federal Government has simply shrugged its shoulders and \nsaid, that is the problem of these middle-class students.\n  I am proud that our budget charts a much different course. Most \nimportantly, we invest in America. We invest in its people and in its \ncommunities. And most importantly, we invest in America's future.\n  The President likes to tout the length of the economic recovery, but \nhe seldom mentions its breadth or its depth, and for good reason. \nDuring the last 7 years, median weekly earnings have actually fallen, \nafter adjusting for inflation. Most Ohioans make less today than they \nmade when George Bush took office, in real dollars. Job creation has \nbeen the worst since the Hoover administration. And if you look at \nprivate sector jobs or manufacturing jobs, the picture is even worse. \nAs bad as job creation and job growth has been, as I said, it has been \neven worse in the private sector and even worse yet in the \nmanufacturing sector.\n  If there is a recovery, as the President likes to trumpet, heaven \nhelp us in a recession. Middle-class families are being squeezed by \ntoxic mortgages and by gas prices that have doubled in the past few \nyears. The President didn't know that gas prices had exceeded $3 and \nwere approaching, in some places, $4 a gallon. Middle-class families \nare being squeezed by increases in the cost of food, education, and the \ncost of health care.\n\n  Our budget will extend tax relief to these families. The Democratic \nbudget will prevent the alternative minimum tax from reaching millions \nof middle-class families. Senator Baucus's amendment, which I am \ncosponsoring, will provide further relief by extending the tax credit, \nthe child credit, the dependent care credit, and other provisions, \nincluding several important provisions to our veterans and to our \nactive duty military personnel.\n  At the same time, unlike the President's budget of the last 5 years, \nwe maintain a path to a balanced budget. The Senator from New Jersey \nand I, and others, participated in the 1990s in passing a balanced \nbudget under President Clinton. We moved toward a balanced budget, \nunlike what President Bush has unraveled in the last 6 years. This is \nan important difference between our budget and the President's.\n  Once upon a time, our Republican colleagues were concerned about \nbalancing the budget. That was then. Now, this administration has piled \nup trillions of dollars of debt that our children and grandchildren \nwill be forced to repay--a sorry legacy indeed. The public debt stood \nat $6 trillion--actually less than $6 trillion--when President Bush \ntook the oath of office in 2001. By the end of this fiscal year, the \ndebt will have grown to $10 trillion. That is a 4,000 billion dollar \ngrowth, from under $6 trillion to more than $10 trillion. Even at a \ntime of low interest rates, we will spend $260 billion next year to pay \ninterest due on that debt.\n  Many of my Republican colleagues have changed their tune because they \ndo not seem so interested in balanced budgets anymore. They will say \nthe cost isn't that great when measured against the size of the \neconomy. But they ignore the opportunity cost. Think of that $260 \nbillion and what we could have done with that money. Think of how it \ncould be used to expand opportunity for better health care, for \neducation, for roads, for bridges, for research, for infrastructure. \nInstead, we write checks to bondholders, many of them big contributors \nto my Republican colleagues, whose addresses are more and more often \nfound, in some cases, in China and in the OPEC states and in the \noffshore banking centers.\n  The hundreds of billions in Federal debt financed by foreigners is \nswamped by the even larger size of the trade deficit, which has roughly \ndoubled under the Bush administration, to more than $700 billion last \nyear. Every day in this country, every single day of the year, we buy \nalmost $2 billion in goods, importing more into this country than we \nexport--almost $2 billion every single day. That translates into lost \njobs, it translates into stagnating wages, it translates into \ncommunities that are, in many cases, devastated. Places particularly \nhard hit are smaller towns and industrial centers that have been hard \nhit by plant closings.\n  Our manufacturing sector has in too many cases been hollowed out. \nCompanies that have been in business for centuries, surviving \nchallenges from the Great War to the Great Depression, have been unable \nto weather this administration. The response: The Bush budget \neliminates funding for one of the Government's most effective programs \nto help small business, the Manufacturing Extension Program, which \nassists American manufacturers to adapt to changing technology.\n  We can do better, and the Democratic budget does do better. Over the \nweeks ahead, in working with our colleagues in the House, we will write \na budget that pays attention to the voices of the middle class and \nresponds to the needs of the middle class. We will write a budget that \nincreases funding for education and for health care, one that gears tax \npolicy to the needs of struggling families and small businesses, and \none that builds a foundation rather than undercutting that foundation \nfor our future and doesn't take a mortgage out on it.\n  As an Eagle Scout many years ago, I was taught you should leave a \ncampground better than you found it. I think that is not a bad \ndescription for our role as Senators too. Let us make the choices that \nwill leave the country's fiscal situation better than it is today. \nLet's help the middle class, let's help working families and end the \nred ink. Let's invest in our future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S1869]]\n\n  Mr. BROWN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nletter and listing be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   March 11, 2008.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: S. 2739, the Consolidated Natural \n     Resources Act of 2008, which I introduced yesterday, is a \n     collection of 62 separate legislative measures under the \n     jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources. The purpose of the bill is to facilitate \n     consideration in the Senate of the large and growing number \n     of measures relating to protection of natural resources and \n     preservation of our historic heritage that have been passed \n     by the House of Representatives and approved by the Committee \n     on Energy and Natural Resources. Forty-three of the measures \n     in S. 2739 consist of the text of separate bills passed by \n     the House of Representatives, twelve are drawn from separate \n     titles, subtitles, or sections of two other House-passed \n     bills, and two are House-passed concurrent resolutions. Only \n     one provision, section 482, contains new matter that has not \n     passed the House of Representatives.\n       While S. 2739 incorporates a number of provisions of S. \n     2483, the National Forests, Parks, Public Land, and \n     Reclamation Projects Authorization Act of 2007, which I \n     introduced 3 months ago, on December 14, 2007, there are a \n     number of differences between the bills that are dictated by \n     the amount of time that has elapsed since last December and \n     by action that has since taken place in the House of \n     Representatives. Two of the sections included in S. 2483 last \n     December were subsequently enacted into law as part of the \n     Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, Public Law 110-161, \n     and, accordingly, have been left out of S. 2739. Eight new \n     provisions, drawn from eight separate House bills or \n     resolutions, have been added. Two of the effective dates in \n     title VIII of S. 2483 have been extended in S. 2739 in light \n     of the passage of time since S. 2483 was introduced. In \n     addition, minor modifications were made in a few other \n     provisions.\n       Although S. 2739 has not been referred to the Committee on \n     Energy and Natural Resources, all of the House bills that \n     make up S. 2739 or their Senate companions have either been \n     reported or ordered reported by the Committee.\n       Rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate provides \n     that, before proceeding to the consideration of a bill, the \n     chairman of the committee of jurisdiction must certify that \n     each congressionally designated spending item in the bill and \n     the name of the Senator requesting it has been identified and \n     posted on a publicly accessible website. The term \n     ``congressionally designated spending item'' is broadly \n     defined, in pertinent part, to include `` a provision . . . \n     included primarily at the request of a Senator . . . \n     authorizing . . . a specific amount of discretionary budget \n     authority . . . for . . . expenditure with or to an entity, \n     or targeted to a specific State, locality or Congressional \n     district, other than through a statutory or administrative \n     formula-driven or competitive award process.''\n       Fifteen of the House-passed measures incorporated into S. \n     2739 contain provisions authorizing the appropriation of \n     specific amounts targeted to specific entities or localities. \n     These authorizations are included in S. 2739 because they are \n     part of the text of the House-passed bills. No Senator \n     submitted a request to me to include them.\n       In the interest of furthering the transparency and \n     accountability of the legislative process, however, I have \n     posted a list of the specific authorizations in S. 2739 on \n     the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources' website. The \n     list includes the name of the principal sponsor of the Senate \n     companion measure that corresponds to the House-passed bill. \n     A copy of the list is attached for your convenience.\n       I previously asked the principal sponsor of the Senate \n     companion measure of each House bill contained in S. 2483 to \n     certify that neither the Senator nor the Senator's immediate \n     family has a pecuniary interest in the item, and have posted \n     the certifications I have received on the Committee's \n     website. All certifications received in relation to S. 2483 \n     remain on the Committee's website, where they are available \n     for public inspection in accordance with paragraph 6 of Rule \n     XLIV. I have not received any requests for new \n     congressionally directed spending items to be included in S. \n     2739.\n       Thus, in accordance with Rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of \n     the Senate, I hereby certify that each congressionally \n     directed spending item in S. 2739 has been identified through \n     a list and that the list was posted on the Committee's \n     publicly accessible website at approximately 3:00 p.m. on \n     March 11, 2008.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Jeff Bingaman,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED \nSPENDING ITEM CERTIFICATION PURSUANT TO RULE XLIV OF THE STANDING RULES \n                             OF THE SENATE\n\n\n        S. 2739--THE CONSOLIDATED NATURAL RESOURCES ACT OF 2008\n\n       Provisions in S. 2739 authorizing appropriations in a \n     specific amount for expenditure with or to an entity or \n     targeted to a specific State, locality, or congressional \n     district, other than through a statutory or administrative \n     formula-driven or competitive award process:\n\n \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                           Principal sponsor of\n              Section                     Program or entity                State                Senate bill\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n314(c).............................

Mr. President, I was pleased to hear about the recent \narrest of Viktor Bout, one of the most notorious arms dealers in the \nworld. Last week, Mr. Bout, was arrested in Thailand by a U.S. sting \noperation in collaboration with Thai authorities which apprehended him \nas he was allegedly trying to sell weapons to the FARC the main \nColombian rebel group and an organization that has also been placed on \nthe U.S. terrorist list.\n  If Bout is charged and convicted in Thailand, he faces 10 years in \nprison, while if the U.S. is able to extradite him he will face 15 \nyears. I certainly recognize the need to ensure a free and fair trial \nfor Mr. Bout that is his right but I am nonetheless pleased that after \nnumerous attempts he has finally been arrested. For years, Bout has \nbeen able to evade law enforcement officers around the world, despite \ninvestigations by the U.N., the media, and even intelligence sources \nthat indicate his complicity in arms smuggling and his role in fueling \nsome of the world's most brutal wars in some cases by providing weapons \nto both sides of the conflict.\n\n[[Page S1870]]\n\nDespite an outstanding 2002 Interpol warrant, until last week he was \nable to successfully dodge arrest.\n  Mr. President, Viktor Bout benefited from the unrestrained capitalism \nand weak institutions that emerged in the aftermath of the fall of the \nBerlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union. He used that \ntumultuous period for his own personal gain, as he built an aircraft \nfleet, purchased cheaply from the stockpiles of discarded Cold War \nweapons, and sought out clients around the globe to help perpetuate his \ndiabolical money-making schemes. He exploited the dearth of arms \ncontrol initiatives in fledging countries and recognized that the lack \nof an international framework would serve his interests well.\n  According to Douglas Farah, one of the authors of the recently \npublished ``Merchant of Death,'' ``[it] is highly unlikely [Bout] could \nhave flown aircraft out of Russia and acquired huge amounts of weapons \nfrom Soviet arsenals without the direct protection of Russian \nintelligence, and, given his background, the [Russian military \nintelligence] seems the most likely candidate.'' Indeed, it is likely \nthat such assistance was needed to create such a vast empire.\n  Mr. President, this empire had many and varied clients. In fact, \nduring the early years of the Iraq war, Bout's aircrafts were used to \nsupport U.S. Government contractor and subcontractor work. I inquired \nabout the use of these aircrafts at a 2004 Iraq hearing in the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee and learned shortly thereafter that both \nthe State and Defense Departments had done business with Bout. Not long \nafter my inquiry, this business relationship was purportedly terminated \nand Bout's assets were frozen by the Treasury Department. But despite \nthis corrective action, Bout's work remained uninhibited and, according \nto some credible reports, he continued to associate with other entities \nof the U.S. Government.\n  Bout was clearly a savvy and dependable broker, but he used these \ntalents to do business with some of the most unsavory characters in the \nworld. The U.N. investigative team which pursued Bout found that he was \npouring small arms and ammunition into Afghanistan, Angola, Rwanda, \nSierra Leone, and the Democratic Republic of Congo for years--enabling \nmillions of innocent people to be slaughtered and supporting carnage at \nunprecedented levels.\n  Bout was able to circumvent both national and international arms \ncontrols by exploiting holes in the system. Despite the arrest \nwarrants, asset freezes, and international embargoes, he was able to \noperate with impunity because of the lack of concerted international \ncooperation within the arms control and law enforcement arenas. Last \nweek's arrest is a testament to the importance of that global \ncooperation and a reminder that as our world continues to globalize we \nmust work together in order to hold individuals like Bout accountable \nfor their actions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/11/senate-section/article/S1870-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     UPCOMING ELECTIONS IN ZIMBABWE\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, since independence in 1980, politics in \nZimbabwe had been dominated by one party and indeed one man President \nand head of the ruling ZANU-PF, Robert Mugabe. In February 2000, \nZimbabwe's citizens delivered a blow to President Mugabe when they \nrejected his party's proposed new constitution, and then in June's \nlegislative elections, even without access to the state-run media and \nwithout significant financing, opposition candidates managed to win 58 \nof 150 parliamentary seats, up from just 3.\n  In 2000, I joined many in Zimbabwe and the international community in \nhoping that this victory would mark the end of the ruling party's \nstranglehold on the state and herald the opening of democratic space \nand opportunities in a country that has seen repression for too long. \nInstead, Mr. Mugabe and his party responded to these defeats by \ntightening their grip on power. In 2000, international headlines warned \nof ``Zimbabwe's unprecedented economic and social crisis'' with \nunemployment at 50 percent and almost 60 percent inflation, and the \n2000 elections were marred by the harassment of opposition candidates \nand supporters in which at least 25 were killed.\n  These numbers pale in comparison with the devastating economic and \npolitical situations in Zimbabwe today. According to official figures, \nannual inflation now tops 100,000 percent with 80 percent employment \ndespite the fact that at least one quarter of the population has fled \nthe country. Meanwhile, the harassment and intimidation of the \nindependent media, opposition politicians, civil society leaders, and \nhuman rights advocates has become more widespread and systematic.\n  Exactly 1 year ago today, when opposition party activists and members \nof civil society attempted to hold a peaceful prayer meeting in \nresponse to President Mugabe's announcement that he would seek \nreelection, they were brutally assaulted by ZANU-PF police officers, \nsecurity forces, and youth militia. More than 50 were arrested, at \nleast 1 killed, and many badly beaten.\n  On this somber anniversary, I appeal to political leaders here in the \nUnited States, in Africa, and around the world to send a strong signal \nto President Mugabe and his supporters that we want to see Zimbabwe \nrecover from its current crisis and we will be watching as the \nunprecedented simultaneous presidential and legislative general \nelections are held on March 29. The violent repression, and even \ncoercive harassment, we saw in March 2007 is unacceptable and will have \nnegative consequences both internally and externally.\n  For years, I have been frustrated and saddened by the hastening \ndecline of this country. The courageous, patriotic citizens of Zimbabwe \nwho resist the state's repression, even at enormous personal cost, must \nknow that the world supports them, and the country's corrupt and \ntyrannical rulers must be told that their time is up.\n  Although it will not happen this month, I hope that someday soon the \npeople of Zimbabwe will be given a chance to freely express their will \nin a genuine democratic process that is free from manipulation, \nintimidation, and coercion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/11/senate-section/article/S1870-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1870-S1871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE TRUE COSTS OF THE IRAQ WAR\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the economists Linda Bilmes and Joseph \nStiglitz recently produced an illuminating analysis of the real costs \nof the war in Iraq, which was published last Sunday in The Washington \nPost.\n  As the war grinds on toward its fifth year, and as the war continues \nto warp our Nation's priorities at home and abroad, this is an analysis \nthat every American deserves to see. I also commend it to the attention \nof the Members of the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 9, 2008]\n\n          The Iraq War Will Cost Us $3 Trillion, and Much More\n\n              (By Linda J. Bilmes and Joseph E. Stiglitz)\n\n       There is no such thing as a free lunch, and there is no \n     such thing as a free war. The Iraq adventure has seriously \n     weakened the U.S. economy, whose woes now go far beyond loose \n     mortgage lending. You can't spend $3 trillion--yes, $3 \n     trillion--on a failed war abroad and not feel the pain at \n     home.\n       Some people will scoff at that number, but we've done the \n     math. Senior Bush administration aides certainly pooh-poohed \n     worrisome estimates in the run-up to the war. Former White \n     House economic adviser Lawrence Lindsey reckoned that the \n     conflict would cost $100 billion to $200 billion; Defense \n     Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld later called his estimate \n     ``baloney.'' Administration officials insisted that the costs \n     would be more like $50 billion to $60 billion. In April 2003, \n     Andrew S. Natsios, the thoughtful head of the U.S. Agency for \n     International Development, said on ``Nightline'' that \n     reconstructing Iraq would cost the American taxpayer just \n     $1.7 billion. Ted Koppel, in disbelief, pressed Natsios on \n     the question, but Natsios stuck to his guns. Others in the \n     administration, such as Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. \n     Wolfowitz, hoped that U.S. partners would chip in, as they \n     had in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, or that Iraq's oil would \n     pay for the damages.\n       The end result of all this wishful thinking? As we approach \n     the fifth anniversary of the invasion, Iraq is not only the \n     second longest war in U.S. history (after Vietnam), it is \n     also the second most costly--surpassed only by World War II.\n       Why doesn't the public understand the staggering scale of \n     our expenditures? In part because the administration talks \n     only about the upfront costs, which are mostly handled\n\n[[Page S1871]]\n\n     by emergency appropriations. (Iraq funding is apparently \n     still an emergency five years after the war began.) These \n     costs, by our calculations, are now running at $12 billion a \n     month--$16 billion if you include Afghanistan. By the time \n     you add in the costs hidden in the defense budget, the money \n     we'll have to spend to help future veterans, and money to \n     refurbish a military whose equipment and materiel have been \n     greatly depleted, the total tab to the federal government \n     will almost surely exceed $1.5 trillion.\n       But the costs to our society and economy are far greater. \n     When a young soldier is killed in Iraq or Afghanistan, his or \n     her family will receive a U.S. government check for just \n     $500,000 (combining life insurance with a ``death \n     gratuity'')--far less than the typical amount paid by \n     insurance companies for the death of a young person in a car \n     accident. The stark ``budgetary cost'' of $500,000 is clearly \n     only a fraction of the total cost society pays for the loss \n     of life--and no one can ever really compensate the families. \n     Moreover, disability pay seldom provides adequate \n     compensation for wounded troops or their families. Indeed, in \n     one out of five cases of seriously injured soldiers, someone \n     in their family has to give up a job to take care of them.\n       But beyond this is the cost to the already sputtering U.S. \n     economy. All told, the bill for the Iraq war is likely to top \n     $3 trillion. And that's a conservative estimate.\n       President Bush tried to sell the American people on the \n     idea that we could have a war with little or no economic \n     sacrifice. Even after the United States went to war, Bush and \n     Congress cut taxes, especially on the rich--even though the \n     United States already had a massive deficit. So the war had \n     to be funded by more borrowing. By the end of the Bush \n     administration, the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, \n     plus the cumulative interest on the increased borrowing used \n     to fund them, will have added about $1 trillion to the \n     national debt.\n       The long-term burden of paying for the conflicts will \n     curtail the country's ability to tackle other urgent \n     problems, no matter who wins the presidency in November. Our \n     vast and growing indebtedness inevitably makes it harder to \n     afford new health-care plans, make large-scale repairs to \n     crumbling roads and bridges, or build better-equipped \n     schools. Already, the escalating cost of the wars has crowded \n     out spending on virtually all other discretionary federal \n     programs, including the National Institutes of Health, the \n     Food and Drug Administration, the Environmental Protection \n     Agency, and federal aid to states and cities, all of which \n     have been scaled back significantly since the invasion of \n     Iraq.\n       To make matters worse, the U.S. economy is facing a \n     recession. But our ability to implement a truly effective \n     economic-stimulus package is crimped by expenditures of close \n     to $200 billion on the two wars this year alone and by a \n     skyrocketing national debt.\n       The United States is a rich and strong country, but even \n     rich and strong countries squander trillions of dollars at \n     their peril. Think what a difference $3 trillion could make \n     for so many of the United States'--or the world's--problems. \n     We could have had a Marshall Plan to help desperately poor \n     countries, winning the hearts and maybe the minds of Muslim \n     nations now gripped by anti-Americanism. In a world with \n     millions of illiterate children, we could have achieved \n     literacy for all--for less than the price of a month's combat \n     in Iraq. We worry about China's growing influence in Africa, \n     but the upfront cost of a month of fighting in Iraq would pay \n     for more than doubling our annual current aid spending on \n     Africa.\n       Closer to home, we could have funded countless schools to \n     give children locked in the underclass a shot at decent \n     lives. Or we could have tackled the massive problem of Social \n     Security, which Bush began his second term hoping to address; \n     for far, far less than the cost of the war, we could have \n     ensured the solvency of Social Security for the next half a \n     century or more.\n       Economists used to think that wars were good for the \n     economy, a notion born out of memories of how the massive \n     spending of World War II helped bring the United States and \n     the world out of the Great Depression. But we now know far \n     better ways to stimulate an economy--ways that quickly \n     improve citizens' well-being and lay the foundations for \n     future growth. But money spent paying Nepalese workers in \n     Iraq (or even Iraqi ones) doesn't stimulate the U.S. economy \n     the way that money spent at home would--and it certainly \n     doesn't provide the basis for long-term growth the way \n     investments in research, education or infrastructure would.\n       Another worry: This war has been particularly hard on the \n     economy because it led to a spike in oil prices. Before the \n     2003 invasion, oil cost less than $25 a barrel, and futures \n     markets expected it to remain around there. (Yes, China and \n     India were growing by leaps and bounds, but cheap supplies \n     from the Middle East were expected to meet their demands.) \n     The war changed that equation, and oil prices recently topped \n     $100 per barrel.\n       While Washington has been spending well beyond its means, \n     others have been saving--including the oil-rich countries \n     that, like the oil companies, have been among the few winners \n     of this war. No wonder, then, that China, Singapore and many \n     Persian Gulf emirates have become lenders of last resort for \n     troubled Wall Street banks, plowing in billions of dollars to \n     shore up Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and other firms that burned \n     their fingers on subprime mortgages. How long will it be \n     before the huge sovereign wealth funds controlled by these \n     countries begin buying up large shares of other U.S. assets?\n       The Bush team, then, is not merely handing over the war to \n     the next administration; it is also bequeathing deep economic \n     problems that have been seriously exacerbated by reckless war \n     financing. We face an economic downturn that's likely to be \n     the worst in more than a quarter-century.\n       Until recently, many marveled at the way the United States \n     could spend hundreds of billions of dollars on oil and blow \n     through hundreds of billions more in Iraq with what seemed to \n     be strikingly little short-run impact on the economy. But \n     there's no great mystery here. The economy's weaknesses were \n     concealed by the Federal Reserve, which pumped in liquidity, \n     and by regulators that looked away as loans were handed out \n     well beyond borrowers' ability to repay them. Meanwhile, \n     banks and credit-rating agencies pretended that financial \n     alchemy could convert bad mortgages into AAA assets, and the \n     Fed looked the other way as the U.S. household-savings rate \n     plummeted to zero.\n       It's a bleak picture. The total loss from this economic \n     downturn--measured by the disparity between the economy's \n     actual output and its potential output--is likely to be the \n     greatest since the Great Depression. That total, itself well \n     in excess of $1 trillion, is not included in our estimated $3 \n     trillion cost of the war.\n       Others will have to work out the geopolitics, but the \n     economics here are clear. Ending the war, or at least moving \n     rapidly to wind it down, would yield major economic \n     dividends.\n       As we head toward November, opinion polls say that voters' \n     main worry is now the economy, not the war. But there's no \n     way to disentangle the two. The United States will be paying \n     the price of Iraq for decades to come. The price tag will be \n     all the greater because we tried to ignore the laws of \n     economics--and the cost will grow the longer we remain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/11/senate-section/article/S1871-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1871-S1872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DEATHS OF WOMEN IN GUATEMALA\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the tragic deaths \nof women and girls in Guatemala and to note the passage of a resolution \nI introduced that is aimed at enhancing efforts by the Governments of \nGuatemala and the United States to address this serious issue. The \nresolution, S. Res. 178, which passed the Senate last night, is \ncosponsored by Senators Boxer, Casey, Dodd, Durbin, Feingold, \nFeinstein, Lautenberg, Leahy, Lincoln, Menendez, Sanders, Smith, and \nSnowe.\n  Mr. President, since 2001 more than 2,000 women and girls have been \nmurdered in Guatemala. Although the overall murder rate in the country \nis extremely troubling, the murder rate with regard to women has \nincreased at an alarming rate it almost doubled from 2001 to 2006. \nWhile these killings may be due to a variety of factors, what clearly \nunifies these cases is the fact that very few of the perpetrators have \nbeen brought to justice. It is my understanding that, as of 2006, there \nwere only 20 convictions for these killings.\n  The general lack of respect for the rule of law, inadequate legal \nprotections for women, ongoing violence in the country, corruption, \ninsufficient resources, substandard investigations, and the lack of \nindependent and effective judicial and prosecutorial systems, all \ncontribute to the inability of the Government of Guatemala to hold \nthose responsible for these killings accountable for their crimes. The \nresult is a sense of impunity for crimes against women in the country.\n  The Government of Guatemala has taken some steps to address these \nkillings. Guatemala has created special police and prosecutorial units \nto investigate these murders and repealed the so-called ``Rape Law'' \nwhich had absolved perpetrators of criminal responsibility for rape \nupon the perpetrator's marriage with the victim. The Government also \nentered into an agreement with the United Nations to establish the \nInternational Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, CICIG, which \nhas a mandate to investigate and prosecute illegal security groups \noperating with impunity. And Guatemala established the National \nInstitute for Forensic Sciences to improve investigatory and evidence \ngathering efforts.\n  The resolution the Senate passed last night is aimed at raising \nawareness of this issue and encouraging the Governments of Guatemala \nand the United States to work together to stop these killings. Among \nother things, the resolution: condemns these murders and expresses the \nsympathy of the Senate to the families of women and girls murdered in \nGuatemala; encourages the Government of Guatemala to act\n\n[[Page S1872]]\n\nwith due diligence in investigating and prosecuting those responsible \nfor these crimes; urges the Government of Guatemala to strengthen \ndomestic violence laws and to provide adequate \nresources necessary to improve the integrity of the prosecutorial and \njudicial systems; urges the President and the Secretary of State to \nincorporate this issue into the bilateral agenda between the \nGovernments of Guatemala and the United States; and encourages the \nSecretary of State to provide assistance in training and equipping \nspecial police units to investigate these crimes, implementing judicial \nreforms and rule of law programs, establishing a missing persons \nsystem, creating an effective witness protection program, and \nsupporting efforts to enhance forensic capabilities.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is very important to give this issue the \nattention it deserves. Last year, the House of Representatives passed a \nsimilar measure, which was introduced by Congresswoman Solis. With \npassage of this resolution, I am very pleased that the Senate has \nspoken regarding the need to stop these senseless killings.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/11/senate-section/article/S1872-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       JOINT RESOLUTION DISAPPROVING THE FCC MEDIA OWNERSHIP RULE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, on March 5, 2008, I introduced a joint \nresolution of disapproval stating that the December 18, 2007, vote by \nthe Federal Communications Commission to loosen the ban on cross-\nownership of newspapers and broadcast stations shall have no force or \neffect. I am joined by Senators Snowe, Kerry, Collins, Dodd, Stevens, \nObama, Harkin, Clinton, Cantwell, Biden, Reed, Feinstein, Sanders, \nTester, Leahy, Feingold, and Boxer. We seek with this resolution of \ndisapproval to reverse the Federal Communications Commission's, FCC, \nfast march to ease media ownership rules.\n  The FCC has taken a series of destructive actions in the past two \ndecades that I believe have undermined the public interest. On December \n18, 2007, they took yet another step in the wrong direction. They gave \na further green light to media concentration.\n  The FCC voted to allow cross-ownership of newspapers and broadcast \nstations in the top 20 markets, with loopholes for mergers outside of \nthe top 20 markets. The newspapers would be allowed to buy stations \nranked above fifth and above.\n  The rule change was framed as a modest compromise. But make no \nmistake, this is a big deal. As much as 44 percent of the population \nlives in the top 20 markets of the United States. When nearly half of \nthe people in this country are told that in their cities and towns the \nmedia will get the thumbs up to consolidate, they will not be happy. \nAnd with the loopholes in the rule, the FCC spurs a new wave of media \nconsolidation in both large and small media markets.\n  The last time the FCC tried to do this, the U.S. Senate voted to \nblock it. On September 16, 2003, the Senate voted 55 to 40 to support a \n``resolution of disapproval'' of the FCC's previous decision to further \nconsolidate media. We warned Chairman Martin that if he rushed this \nvote we would have to use the resolution of disapproval again.\n  On December 4th the Commerce Committee reported out the bipartisan \n``Media Ownership Act of 2007,'' S. 2332 with 25 co-sponsors, requiring \nthe FCC to give more time for public comment and study the issues of \nlocalism and diversity. The Chairman overlooked this bill.\n  On the day before the vote, 27 Senators sent them a letter in \nopposition to such a rushed vote on the rules. He went ahead anyway.\n  The FCC rushed towards a December 18th vote with a complete disregard \nfor the process, let alone the substance of their ruling.\n  They rushed to finish the localism and ownership hearings with as \nlittle as 5 business days of notice before the last hearings.\n  The Chairman put out the proposed rule changes on November 13th in a \nNew York Times op-ed--after the comment period had closed.\n  He then didn't give the public nearly enough opportunity to comment \non the actual rule changes that were voted on. He gave the public just \n28 days to comment on the proposed rules. While he likes to speak of \ngiving 120 days and six hearings around the country, this was prior to \nthe announcement of what rules would actually change. And he ignored \nthe public testimony anyway.\n  This was hardly an open and deliberative process. It is a massive \nrush and a big mistake.\n  This rule will undercut localism and diversity of ownership around \nthe country. Studies show that removing the ban on newspaper/broadcast \ncross-ownership results in a net loss in the amount of local news \nproduced in the market as a whole. In addition, while the FCC suggests \nthat cross-ownership is necessary to save failing newspapers, the \npublicly traded newspapers earn annual rates of return between 16 and \n18 percent.\n  This Resolution of Disapproval will ensure this rule change has no \neffect. This is again a bipartisan effort to stop the FCC from \ndestroying the local interests that we have always felt must be a part \nof broadcasting.\n  It is time to ensure that we first protect localism and diversity, \nwhich the FCC appears to have long forgotten. Only then can we really \nreview the rules of media ownership in a thorough process to see if it \nis actually in the public interest to reverse any of those rules, or if \ngreater public interest protections are necessary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/11/senate-section/article/S1872-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       HONORING JERRY BUTKIEWICZ\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Jerry \nButkiewicz, a labor leader in San Diego who recently retired as \nsecretary-treasurer of the San Diego Imperial Counties Labor Council. \nHe has devoted the past 30 years to improving the quality of life for \nall people.\n  In 1975, Jerry Butkiewicz joined the American Postal Workers Union, \nAPWU, in Phoenix, AZ. He became shop steward and within a few years \nrose to president of the local. Five years later, attracted by the \nbeautiful weather in California, Jerry Butkiewicz and his family moved \nto Oceanside in San Diego where he continued to work for the U.S. \nPostal Service. Shortly after his arrival, he was elected president of \nthe APWU in Oceanside. In 1981, the San Diego Imperial Counties Labor \nCouncil selected him as their liaison between organized labor and the \nUnited Way of San Diego County.\n  Elected secretary-treasurer in 1996, Jerry Butkiewicz led the Labor \nCouncil with compassion, practicality, and a tireless work ethic until \nJanuary 2008. Over his 12 years as secretary-treasurer, he worked to \ngrow and strengthen the labor movement in San Diego.

Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nrecognize the 50th anniversary of Las Trampas, a nonprofit organization \ndedicated to supporting adults with developmental disabilities located \nin Contra Costa County.\n  Founded in 1958 in Lafayette, CA, Las Trampas has grown to include \nfour State-licensed group residential homes throughout Contra Costa \nCounty. Through the work of its staff, volunteers, and board of \ndirectors, Las Trampas actively assists adults with developmental \ndisabilities to discover their capabilities so that they may live their \nlives as independently as possible.\n  Las Trampas is committed to helping each of its clients succeed in \nall aspects of daily living. It offers programs\n\n[[Page S1873]]\n\nthat emphasize a life-long educational process, including self-advocacy \nskills, risk evaluation, emotion management, and clear communication \nskills. Two programs of note include the Adult Vocational Program and \nthe Adult Development Program. The Adult Vocational Program provides \nemployment services and skills development, and has helped many Las \nTrampas clients gain employment with local businesses. The Adult \nDevelopment Program caters to small groups and highlights educational \ndevelopment in the areas of daily living tasks, communications, social \ninteraction, and employment. Most importantly, Las Trampas works with \nevery person to help them practice each of these skills in real life \nsituations.\n  The support services and programs provided by Las Trampas offer those \nwith developmental disabilities the opportunity to turn the dream of \nfull inclusion in the community into a reality. I commend the Las \nTrampas staff and volunteers for their dedicated work in assisting \nadults with developmental disabilities lead fuller lives in their home, \nat work, and in the community.\n  I congratulate Las Trampas for its dedicated work on this special \noccasion, and I send my best wishes for many future successes over the \nnext 50 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/11/senate-section/article/S1873-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE YWCA OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to recognize \nthe 100th anniversary of the YWCA of San Diego County. On Tuesday, \nMarch 11, 2008, YWCA of San Diego County and community members will \ngather to celebrate this momentous occasion.\n  The YWCA is the largest and oldest multicultural women's organization \nin the world. The YWCA was formed in 1855 in London by Emma Robarts and \nMrs. Arthur Kinnaird. The YWCA later expanded to the United States in \n1858 in New York and Boston. Today it serves as the largest \norganization dedicated to empowering women and provide an important \nvoice for women at local, state, and international levels. YWCA of San \nDiego County is one of 300 local associations in the United States.\n  YWCA of San Diego County was formally incorporated in 1908. For the \npast 100 years, YWCA has been a champion in the community on behalf of \nwomen and families who escape homelessness and domestic violence. The \nmission of YWCA ``is to increase safety, promote healing, foster \nempowerment, and give hope to women and families through innovative \nprograms'' and services.\n  The dedication of the YWCA to its mission is displayed through the \nprograms and services that the YWCA provides. These programs and \nservices include residential programs like transitional housing and \nemergency shelter, legal support, career assistance, counseling, and a \ntelephone hotline. All of these programs are designed to support the \nneeds of women and families coping with domestic violence and \nhomelessness.\n  Through a variety of programs such as Becky's House emergency shelter \nthe YWCA of San Diego County is able to offer confidential, \ntransitional housing for victims of domestic violence and their \nchildren. Various services like, legal assistance and counseling is \nprovided to the residents of the emergency shelter. After the residents \ncomplete a 30 day stay at the shelter they are given the opportunity to \ncomplete an 18-month residential program at Becky's House. This program \nprovides legal assistance, educational and career counseling, case \nmanagement, and educational and play activities for the children of the \nwomen in the program.\n  More than 70 percent of the 2,000 individuals the YWCA of San Diego \nCounty serve each year are able to obtain employment and permanent \nhousing, so that the individual can sustain a secure, independent way \nof life.\n  YWCA of San Diego County has set a wonderful example of philanthropy, \ncivic service, and altruism for the community at large. Organizations \nsuch as the YWCA should be recognized for the critical role they play \nin strengthening women and families in California and the United States \nof America. I salute the men and women of YWCA for their continuous \ncommitment to the betterment of women and families in crisis and \nefforts to enrich the broader San Diego community.\n  I congratulate the YWCA of San Diego County on the celebration of its \n100th anniversary. I wish them continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/11/senate-section/article/S1873-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RECOGNIZING CHAFFEY COLLEGE ON ITS 125TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing Chaffey College as it celebrates its 125th anniversary. \nThroughout the past 125 years, the students, faculty, staff, and \ncommunity have worked diligently to make Chaffey College a hallmark \ninstitution of higher learning in southern California.\n  In March 1883, brothers and engineers George and William Chaffey \ndonated land and established an endowment for a private college to \nprovide quality education to the citrus growing communities between the \ncities of Los Angeles and San Bernardino. The Chaffey brothers \nenvisioned access to higher education throughout southern California \nfor a burgeoning population, which would soon be realized by the \ndynamic growth of the college. The private school was initially founded \nas the Chaffey College of Agriculture as part of the University of \nSouthern California. A short time later the college had an enrollment \nof 100 students and began to receive joint funding through the local \nschool district, allowing a period of dramatic growth to begin.\n  Since that time, Chaffey College has continued in its legacy of \nexpansion, and it has taken great strides to provide increased \nopportunities for higher education throughout the region. It has \ndeveloped satellite campus facilities in Ontario, Fontana and Chino. \nThe education center in Chino is the only community college facility in \nCalifornia that is dedicated solely to information technology. And in \nMay 2007, Chaffey College was able to dedicate six new buildings, \nincluding four science and technology buildings, the Don Berz \nExcellence Building, and the Kane Center for Student Services and \nAdministration. Today, Chaffey College offers a wide variety of both \nacademic and vocational education courses to over 18,000 students, \nhelping an entire region of students throughout multiple communities \nfind a competitive edge in the global marketplace.\n  As Chaffey College celebrates 125 years of growth and development in \nserving the communities of southern California, I am pleased to ask my \ncolleagues to recognize its accomplishments. The success of our Nation \nand of future generations of Americans will be ensured by the \ncontinuing dedication and commitment of educational institutions such \nas Chaffey College.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/11/senate-section/article/S1873-3", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1873-S1874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. PATRICIA SANDERS\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, on the occasion of her retirement \nfrom the Department of Defense, I wish to recognize Dr. Patricia \nSanders for her nearly 35 years of dedicated service to the security of \nour country. In her most recent assignment, she served as Executive \nDirector at the Missile Defense Agency, where she advised the Director \non issues related to the management and operations of one of the most \ndynamic organizations within the Department of Defense. Dr. Sanders has \nmade an enormous contribution to the successful development and \nfielding of a defense to protect a nation, American troops deployed \nabroad, and our allies and friends from attack by ballistic missiles.\n  Dr. Sanders graduated as a National Science Foundation Fellow from \nWayne State University in 1972 with a doctorate in mathematics, where \nshe also was educated in economics, organizational management, and \nother disciplines. She went on to hold several university faculty \npositions. It is to our great benefit, though, that Dr. Sanders decided \nto pursue a career in government.\n  Her service within the Department of Defense as a member of the test \nand evaluation community has been extensive. Prior positions in the \nOffice of the Secretary of Defense included serving as the Director of \nLand Forces in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for \nProgram Analysis and Evaluation and as Staff Specialist for the \nDirector of Operational Test and Evaluation. Dr. Sanders served as \nDeputy\n\n[[Page S1874]]\n\nDirector for Analysis with the U.S. Space Command, Science Adviser to \nthe Command, Control, Communications and Countermeasures Joint Test \nForce, and Chief of Modeling and Simulation and Technical Advisor to \nthe Electronics Systems Division at the Air Force Operational Test and \nEvaluation Center.\n  Dr. Sanders has extensive experience as a member of the Department's \nsenior executive service. Before coming to the Missile Defense Agency, \nshe was the Director for Test, Systems Engineering and Evaluation in \nthe Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and \nTechnology, responsible for ensuring the integration of all engineering \ndisciplines into the system acquisition process, providing technical \nrisk assessments and oversight of developmental test and evaluation for \nmany of the weapon systems used by our Armed Forces today.\n  Dr. Sanders held numerous positions within the Missile Defense Agency \nand its predecessor organization, the Ballistic Missile Defense \nOrganization. She came to the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization in \n1999 to be the Deputy for Test, Simulation and Evaluation. In this \nposition, she was also the senior technical advisor to the Director. \nShe served in this capacity until the Secretary of Defense gave the \nmissile defense program a new direction.\n  In early 2002, the start of one of the most dynamic periods in the \nAgency's history, and shortly after the Missile Defense Agency was \nestablished, Dr. Sanders was appointed the Deputy Director for \nBallistic Missile Defense System Integration. She played a critical \nrole in managing the development and fielding of an integrated missile \ndefense system. Dr. Sanders played an instrumental role in developing \nthe concept for the Ballistic Missile Defense System and advising \nDepartment leaders on the authorities and responsibilities required to \ndevelop and field an effective missile defense system.\n  As Executive Director, a role she assumed in 2005, Dr. Sanders \nadvised the Director on issues related to Agency management and \noperations. She also took on numerous tasks delegated by the Director \nsuch as directing the development of strategic communications campaign \nplans. Perhaps the most striking example of this came in the U.S. \nGovernment's European Site Initiative, where her vision for and \nguidance to this endeavor contributed to the development of a broad \nconsensus among national leaders, combatant commanders, and the \ninternational communities on the growing need to establish a long-range \nmissile defense capability in Europe. Dr. Sanders also helped to \nrealize important cooperative agreements with Japan and Israel, which \ntoday are helping contribute to a truly worldwide ballistic missile \ndefense capability.\n  During North Korea's provocative missile launches in July 2006, Dr. \nSanders coordinated the Agency's actions during this crisis and \nestablished a dedicated crisis action team of highly trained staff to \nprovide situation awareness to the President, combatant commanders, and \nthe entire missile defense developer community. She educated senior \nmilitary and civilian decisionmakers on the capabilities afforded by \nthe deployed elements of the system so that the Nation's plans to deal \nwith the crisis were based on accurate and timely information.\n  As the Agency's senior leader dealing with operational and management \nfunctions, Dr. Sanders impacted the Agency's operations on a daily \nbasis. She served as a senior interlocutor with all external defense \nagencies, the Services, and Members of Congress. The Agency's senior \ncivilian, she was also the final arbiter of all issues related to \npersonnel administration and development, directing and managing a \ndiverse staff spanning seventeen time zones. In just the last 2 years, \nthe Agency underwent a conversion to the new National Security \nPersonnel System and made plans to execute a Base Realignment to \nHuntsville, AL, by 2011. To help the Agency weather this challenging \nperiod, Dr. Sanders instituted several major efforts in strategic human \ncapital planning. She restructured the Agency's strategic mission \nplanning and communications activity, directing a much-needed overhaul \nof long-range congressional and public affairs strategies. She also \ncreated and chaired a Base Realignment and Closure Panel to develop \nstrategies for the transition to Huntsville and established working \nrelationships with local officials in northern Alabama and with the \nTennessee Valley Association. As a direct result of her leadership, the \nAgency has received more volunteers for relocation than anticipated.\n  For many years now Dr. Sanders has been a fellow of the American \nInstitute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and, at one point, served as \nchair of AIAA's Flight Test Technical Committee. She is a past \npresident of the International Test and Evaluation Association and has \nserved on the board of directors for the Military Operations Research \nSociety. She also has devoted significant time to mentoring future \nDefense Department civilian leaders. Throughout her career, Dr Sanders \nhas been a champion of diversity and has been dedicated to recruitment \nand retention of young professionals in the Federal Government. She has \nbeen a dedicated mentor to women in the engineering field and has been \na role model and pathfinder for women in defense. In addition, while at \nMDA, Dr. Sanders instituted a mentoring program for defense acquisition \nprofessionals, established an active career intern program and a \nPresidential management fellowship program.\n  Dr. Patricia Sanders has consistently exemplified the finest \nattributes of a senior executive dedicated to public service. Her \ncontributions, leadership, and service are well known throughout the \nDepartment. I am honored and proud to enter this tribute to Dr. \nPatricia Sanders into the official record. On behalf of all my \ncolleagues, and with deep gratitude in my heart, I wish her the best as \nshe embarks on the next journey in her life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/11/senate-section/article/S1874-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/11/senate-section/article/S1874-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/11/senate-section/article/S1874-3", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1874-S1875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS DECLARED \n             ON MARCH 15, 1995, WITH RESPECT TO IRAN--PM 41\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  The crisis between the United States and Iran constituted by the \nactions and policies of the Government of Iran that led to the \ndeclaration of a national emergency on March 15, 1995, has not been \nresolved. The actions and policies of the Government of Iran are \ncontrary to the interests of the United States in the region and pose a \ncontinuing unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, \nforeign policy, and economy of the United States. Iran remains the \nworld's most active state sponsor of terrorism, and continues to \nprovide lethal support to Lebanese Hizballah, HAMAS, Palestinian \nIslamic Jihad and numerous other terrorist organizations in the region, \nas well as to the Taliban in Afghanistan and various Iraqi militant \ngroups. For these reasons, I have determined that it is necessary to \ncontinue the national emergency declared with respect to Iran and \nmaintain in force comprehensive sanctions against Iran to respond to \nthis threat.\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice\n\n[[Page S1875]]\n\nto the Federal Register for publication, stating that the Iran \nemergency declared on March 15, 1995, is to continue in effect beyond \nMarch 15, 2008.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor disability savings accounts, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Disability \nSavings Act of 2008. This important legislation is designed to help \nindividuals with disabilities live full and productive lives for all \ntheir years.\n  As we all know, disability is a part of human experience. The U.S. \nCensus Bureau reports nearly 20 percent of Americans have some level of \ndisability while 12.5 percent reported a severe disability. We should \ndo what we can to make it possible for these Americans to live \nindependently, exert control and choice over their lives, and fully \nparticipate in their communities. One of the key ways we can accomplish \nthis goal is to help individuals with disabilities and their families \nsave money for disability related expenses, especially those expected \nover the course of full life.\n  Over the years, Congress has provided incentives to American families \nto save for various long term goals: college education, home ownership, \nand retirement. These incentives have given families the tools to help \ntheir children, well after they have left the home.\n  But for families who have a child with a disability, particularly a \ncognitive disability, these goals may not match their needs. Many of \nthese children will depend on Medicaid, Social Security Disability \nInsurance, and Supplemental Security Income. They cannot risk losing \nthese benefits. And they may never get to the point where they can \nconsider college or home ownership.\n  These individuals will frequently incur significant additional costs \nrelated to services and supports necessary to maintain health and \nindependence. Parents also have to worry about what will happen to \ntheir children after they are gone.\n  The World Institute on Disability reports that over 1/3 of adults \nwith disabilities live in households with income of $15,000 or less. \nAccording to the 2005 American Community Survey, median earnings for \nindividuals with disabilities were a little more than half of the \nmedian income of those without disabilities.\n  It is common for families to provide for individuals with significant \ndisabilities who cannot support themselves. These families often do \nthis at great cost to themselves both financially and emotionally. They \ndo it out of love, and they do not ask to be relieved of their burdens. \nBut they are hoping that we can provide the tools to help them ensure \ntheir loved ones can lead full lives for many years.\n  That is why I am introducing the Disability Savings Act of 2008. This \nbill\n\n[[Page S1879]]\n\nwill encourage individuals with disabilities and their families to save \nmoney for their unique disability-related needs in Disability Savings \nAccounts. These accounts will provide a tax-advantaged mechanism for \nindividuals with disabilities to save money.\n  The interest on these accounts, with a balance of up to $250,000, \nwill be tax free. Expenditures from the accounts for specific qualified \nservices such as education, medical services, employment training and \nsupport, and transportation, will not be subject to income tax. The \naccounts will be easier to manage, and use than other existing savings \nmechanisms for individuals with disabilities. To be sure these accounts \nare available to low and moderate income earners, there will be a \nrefundable matching tax credit of up to $1000 for contributions. \nAccount holders can even roll funds from college savings plans and \nspecial needs trusts for the same beneficiary into the Disability \nSavings Account without penalty. These accounts will supplement, not \nsupplant, benefits provided by other, sources such as Medicaid, private \ninsurance, and Supplemental Security Income, SSI, and the assets held \nwithin them will not be counted against eligibility for those programs.\n  In order to be eligible to have a Disability Savings Account, \nbeneficiaries must be determined to be blind or disabled by the Social \nSecurity Administration or the Disability Determination Service of a \nstate, and be under the age of 65. The accounts can be held and managed \nthrough a financial institution by the beneficiary, their spouse or \nfamily member, or a legal guardian.\n  I hope that my colleagues will see the benefit of this approach and \njoin me in this effort. I urge them to cosponsor this legislation and \nwork with me to give individuals with disabilities and their families \nthe tools they need to live healthy independent lives.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na letter of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2741\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Disability Savings Act of \n     2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Disability is a natural part of the human experience. \n     Individuals with disabilities have the right to live \n     independently, to exert control and choice over their own \n     lives, and to fully participate in and contribute to their \n     communities through full integration and inclusion in the \n     economic, political, social, cultural, and educational \n     mainstream of American society.\n       (2) Americans with disabilities are more likely to live in \n     poverty than those without disabilities. According to the \n     World Institute on Disability, over one-third of adults with \n     disabilities live in households with income of $15,000 or \n     less compared to only 12 percent of those without \n     disabilities. According to the 2005 American Community \n     Survey, median annual earnings for individuals without a \n     disability were $25,000 compared with $12,800 for those with \n     a severe disability.\n       (3) Families often provide the primary financial assistance \n     necessary for individuals with significant disabilities who \n     cannot support themselves. Families supporting members with \n     disabilities often experience substantial negative effects on \n     the vocational and economic health of the family.\n       (4) Individuals with disabilities often incur significant \n     additional costs related to services and supports necessary \n     to maintain the health and independence needed to fully \n     participate in society.\n       (5) Throughout the years policymakers have provided \n     incentives to Americans to save money for purposes such as \n     home ownership, education and retirement. Many of these \n     benefits do not meet the savings needs of individuals with \n     disabilities and their families.\n       (6) Encouraging individuals with disabilities and their \n     families to save funds will allow them to achieve greater \n     control, choice, participation in community, security, and \n     independence in their lives.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To encourage and assist individuals and families in \n     saving private funds for the purpose of supporting \n     individuals with disabilities to maintain health, \n     independence, and quality of life.\n       (2) To provide secure funding for disability-related \n     expenses on behalf of designated beneficiaries with \n     disabilities that will supplement, but not supplant, benefits \n     provided through private insurance, the Medicaid program \n     under title XIX of the Social Security Act, the supplemental \n     security income program under title XVI of such Act, the \n     beneficiary's employment, and other sources.\n\n     SEC. 4. DISABILITY SAVINGS ACCOUNTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subchapter F of chapter 1 of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to exempt organizations) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following new part:\n\n                 ``PART IX--DISABILITY SAVINGS ENTITIES\n\n``Sec. 530A.

Chris Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: Easter Seals has long been concerned \n     that individuals with disabilities and their families have \n     too few options to save for the future. Currently, \n     individuals must have exceptionally low incomes in order to \n     access essential public services and supports. In those \n     situations in which an individual's family wants to save for \n     the future, a complicated web of state rules that guide \n     special needs trust must be followed, and in nearly every \n     circumstance, families cannot navigate the system without the \n     assistance of an attorney.\n       For these reasons, Easter Seals is pleased to support the \n     Disability Savings Act of 2008. This legislation clearly \n     identifies the essential need to establish new protocols that \n     enable families with limited incomes to effectively save \n     financial resources to meet the future needs of their family \n     member with a disability.

Res. 479\n\n       Whereas the number of human immunodeficiency virus and \n     acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (hereafter ``HIV/AIDS'') \n     cases among American Indian and Alaska Native communities has \n     been increasing at an alarming rate and poses a significant \n     threat to the public health of Native communities;\n       Whereas American Indians and Alaska Natives have the 3rd \n     highest rate of HIV/AIDS infection in the United States, \n     after Blacks and Hispanics;\n       Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report published in 2005, \n     the rate per 100,000 persons of HIV/AIDS diagnosis for \n     American Indians and Alaska Natives was 10.4;\n       Whereas American Indians and Alaska Natives experience the \n     highest disease and mortality rates in the United States \n     compared to other racial and ethnic groups, due to \n     socioeconomic factors that include consistently high rates of \n     poverty, inadequate education, and a lack of access to \n     quality health services;\n       Whereas certain risk factors exist among Indian and Alaska \n     Native populations that elevate the threat of the HIV/AIDS \n     epidemic, including high rates of sexually transmitted \n     diseases and substance abuse;\n       Whereas, according to the 2005 Centers for Disease Control \n     and Prevention Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance \n     Report, American Indians and Alaska Natives have the 2nd \n     highest infection rates of gonorrhea and chlamydia in the \n     United States and the 3rd highest infection rate of syphilis;\n       Whereas, according to the 2005 National Survey on Drug Use \n     and Health, American Indians and Alaska Natives had a 12.8 \n     percent higher rate of illicit drug use than any other races \n     or ethnicities;\n       Whereas, during the years 1997-2004, of persons who had \n     received a diagnosis of HIV/AIDS, American Indians and Alaska \n     Natives had survived a shorter time than had Asians and \n     Pacific Islanders, Whites, or Hispanics;\n       Whereas, after 9 years, 67 percent of American Indians and \n     Alaska Natives who had been diagnosed with HIV/AIDS were \n     alive, compared to 66 percent of Blacks, 74 percent of \n     Hispanics, 75 percent of Whites, and 81 percent of Asians and \n     Pacific Islanders;\n       Whereas, from 2001 through 2004, the estimated number of \n     HIV/AIDS cases increased among Whites, Asians and Pacific \n     Islanders, and American Indians and Alaska Natives, and \n     decreased among Blacks and Hispanics; and\n       Whereas, from 2000 through 2004, the estimated number of \n     deaths among persons with AIDS decreased among Whites, \n     Blacks, and Asians and Pacific Islanders, but increased among \n     American Indians and Alaska Natives: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the seriousness of the spread and threat of \n     the human immunodeficiency virus and acquired \n     immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) epidemic in American \n     Indian and Alaska Native communities;\n       (2) encourages Federal, State, and tribal governments as \n     well as Indian organizations and health care providers to \n     coordinate efforts in HIV/AIDS testing and in the promotion \n     of prevention activities to further efforts in the reduction \n     of HIV/AIDS infection rates among American Indians and Alaska \n     Natives; and\n       (3) designates March 20, 2008, as ``Second Annual National \n     Native HIV/AIDS Awareness Day''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/11/senate-section/article/S1882-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1882-S1883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4153.

Res. 178, as amended, \nwith its preamble, as amended, as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 178\n\n       Whereas since 2001, more than 2,000 women and girls have \n     been murdered in Guatemala;\n       Whereas most of the victims are women ranging in age from \n     18 to 30, with many of the cases involving abduction, sexual \n     violence, or brutal mutilation;\n       Whereas while the overall murder rate in Guatemala has \n     increased substantially, the rate at which women have been \n     murdered in Guatemala has increased at an alarming rate, \n     almost doubling from 2001 to 2006;\n       Whereas according to data from Guatemala's Public \n     Prosecutors Office, few arrests and fewer convictions have \n     occurred, and prosecutors, forensics experts, and other state \n     justice officials have not brought the perpetrators to \n     justice;\n       Whereas from 2001 to 2006, there were only 20 convictions \n     for the murders of women and girls;\n       Whereas the Human Rights Ombudsman of the Government of \n     Guatemala has reported that in 1 year alone police officers \n     were implicated on 10 separate occasions in the murder of \n     women in Guatemala, and recommended that such officers and \n     other officials be held accountable for their acts;\n       Whereas an effective, transparent, and impartial judicial \n     system is key to the administration of justice, and the \n     failure to ensure proper investigations and prosecutions \n     hampers the ability to solve crimes and punish perpetrators;\n       Whereas inadequate financial, human, and technical \n     resources, as well as a lack of forensic and technical \n     expertise, have impeded the arrest and prosecution of \n     suspects;\n       Whereas the Special Prosecutor for Crimes Against Women of \n     the Government of Guatemala has reported that her office has \n     reviewed approximately 800 incidents of domestic violence per \n     month, with some of those cases ending in murder, and that \n     deaths could have been prevented if the legal system of \n     Guatemala provided for prison sentences in cases of domestic \n     violence;\n       Whereas the murders of women and girls in Guatemala have \n     brought pain to the families and friends of the victims as \n     they struggle to cope with the loss of their loved ones and \n     the fact that the perpetrators of these heinous acts remain \n     unknown to the proper authorities;\n       Whereas many countries in Latin America face significant \n     challenges in combating violence against women, and \n     international cooperation is essential in addressing this \n     serious issue;\n       Whereas the United States Agency for International \n     Development (USAID) has provided assistance to the Government \n     of Guatemala to implement judicial reform and rule of law \n     programs, and in fiscal year 2006, Congress provided \n     $1,500,000 for programs to combat impunity, corruption, and \n     crimes of violence, of which $500,000 is to be allocated to \n     strengthen the special prosecutorial units charged with \n     investigating the murders of women in Guatemala;\n       Whereas the Government of Guatemala has undertaken efforts \n     to prevent violence against women, as evidenced by its \n     ratification of the United Nations Convention Against Torture \n     and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or \n     Punishment, done at New York December 10, 1984, the United \n     Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of \n     Discrimination Against Women, done at New York December 18, \n     1979, the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, \n     Punishment, and Eradication of Violence Against Women, done \n     at Belem do Para, Brazil June 9, 1994, and other \n     international human rights treaties, and the enactment of \n     laws and the creation of state institutions to promote and \n     protect the rights of women;\n       Whereas the Government of Guatemala has created special \n     police and prosecutorial units to address the brutal murders \n     of women in Guatemala;\n       Whereas in June 2006, the Government of Guatemala \n     successfully abolished the ``Rape Law'' which had absolved \n     perpetrators of criminal responsibility for rape and certain \n     other crimes of violence upon the perpetrator's marriage with \n     the victim;\n       Whereas legislators from various parties in Guatemala have \n     joined lawmakers from Mexico and Spain to form the \n     ``Interparliamentary Network against `Femicide' '';\n       Whereas the Government of Guatemala and the United Nations \n     recently entered into an agreement to establish the \n     International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala \n     (CICIG), which has a mandate to investigate and promote the \n     prosecution of illegal security groups and clandestine \n     security organizations that function with impunity and are \n     suspected of attacking human rights defenders, justice \n     officials, and other civil society actors; and\n       Whereas continuing impunity for crimes against women is a \n     threat to the rule of law, democracy, and stability in \n     Guatemala: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses its sincerest condolences and deepest \n     sympathy to the families of women and girls murdered in \n     Guatemala, and recognizes their courageous struggle in \n     seeking justice for the victims;\n       (2) expresses the solidarity of the people of the United \n     States with the people of Guatemala in the face of these \n     tragic and senseless acts;\n       (3) condemns the ongoing murders of women and girls in \n     Guatemala, and encourages the Government of Guatemala to act \n     with due diligence in order to promptly investigate these \n     killings, prosecute those responsible, and continue to work \n     toward eliminating violence against women;\n       (4) urges the Government of Guatemala to strengthen laws \n     with respect to domestic violence and sexual harassment, to \n     improve the integrity of the prosecutorial and judicial \n     systems, and to provide the resources and commitment \n     necessary to adequately enforce justice for crimes against \n     women;\n       (5) urges the President and the Secretary of State to \n     continue to incorporate the investigative and preventative \n     efforts of the Government of Guatemala regarding the murder \n     of women and girls into the bilateral agenda between the \n     Governments of Guatemala and the United States;\n       (6) encourages the Secretary of State to continue to \n     support efforts by the Government of Guatemala to train and \n     equip the special police and prosecutorial units of the \n     Government of Guatemala to conduct thorough and proper \n     investigations of crimes of violence against women, and to \n     implement judicial reform and rule of law programs;\n       (7) encourages the Secretary of State and the Attorney \n     General to provide assistance in establishing a comprehensive \n     missing persons system and an effective state protection \n     program for witnesses, victims' relatives, and human rights \n     defenders;\n       (8) urges the Government of Guatemala to hold accountable \n     those law enforcement and judicial officials whose failure to \n     investigate and prosecute the murders adequately, whether \n     through negligence, omission, or abuse, has led to impunity \n     for these crimes;\n       (9) encourages the Secretary of State to support efforts to \n     identify perpetrators and unknown victims through forensic \n     analysis, including assisting the Government of Guatemala in \n     adequately funding the National\n\n[[Page S1891]]\n\n     Institute for Forensic Science (INACIF) and training lab \n     personnel in investigatory and evidence gathering protocols;\n       (10) urges the Secretary of State--\n       (A) to express support for the efforts of the victims' \n     families and loved ones to seek justice for the victims,\n       (B) to express concern relating to any harassment of these \n     families and the human rights defenders with whom they work, \n     and\n       (C) to express concern with respect to impediments in the \n     ability of the families to receive prompt and accurate \n     information in their cases;\n       (11) encourages the Secretary of State to continue to \n     include in the Department of State's annual Country Reports \n     on Human Rights Practices instances of failure to investigate \n     and prosecute crimes, threats against human rights activists, \n     and the use of torture with respect to cases involving the \n     murder and abduction of women and girls in Guatemala;\n       (12) recommends that the United States Ambassador to \n     Guatemala continue to meet with the families of the victims, \n     women's rights organizations, and the officials of the \n     Government of Guatemala who are responsible for investigating \n     these crimes; and\n       (13) recommends that the Secretary of State develop a \n     comprehensive plan to address and combat the growing problem \n     of violence against women in Latin America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/11/senate-section/article/S1891-1", "month": "03",

CITIZENSHIP ASSISTANCE ACT\n\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of S. 2516 and the Senate proceed \nto its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2516) to assist members of the Armed Forces in \n     obtaining United States citizenship, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Mikulski's commitment \nto helping those dedicated men and women who are not yet U.S. citizens \nbut who have served all Americans as members of the Armed Forces. \nEasing the path to citizenship by removing duplicative procedures for \nthese dedicated men and women is the right thing to do, and I am glad \nto support Senator Mikulski's efforts.\n  However, I also wish to note my concern with inclusion of language in \nthe bill, at the administration's behest, that appears to anticipate a \nfuture expansion of the collection of biometric information from \nindividuals who seek to become naturalized citizens or who seek other \nimmigration benefits. In light of the purpose of Senator Mikulski's \nbill, which is to streamline the naturalization procedures for legal \npermanent residents serving in the military, it would make little sense \nto place additional obstacles in the path of those who have made the \nultimate commitment to the United States.\n  I also register this concern to make clear that the language in this \nbill with respect to biometric information should in no way be \nmisconstrued as authority for the administration to unilaterally expand \nthe type of biometric information beyond what is currently required to \nobtain immigration benefits from the U.S. government. Federal \nimmigration law is the province of the Congress, and Congress retains \nthe sole power to determine the extent of rulemaking authority afforded \nto Federal immigration agencies. The involvement of Congress in these \ndecisions is crucial to ensure that the procedures by which we admit or \ndeny individuals entry to the United States take into account the \ninterests of privacy, and are faithful to the welcoming traditions by \nwhich our nation has prospered. Only Congress can provide the \ndeliberative, democratic process necessary to ensure that any future \nrequirements are consistent with American values.\n  We all recognize the need for robust security at our borders. But \nover the last 7 years, the reputation of the United States as a \nwelcoming nation has been diminished as a result of often misguided \npolicies that take a reactionary, blunt, and hostile approach to \nimmigration. The administration has met its failure to enact meaningful \nimmigration reform with layer upon layer of security initiatives that \nin some cases do little more than foreclose the promise of our great \nNation for so many who seek opportunity, advancement, or refuge. \nAmerica's security now and in the future demands more than border walls \nand punitive, enforcement-only immigration policies. Our future \nsecurity, as well as our future prosperity, depends upon the balance \nthat has been absent for so long.\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent that the Mikulski substitute \namendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be \nread a third time and passed; the motions to reconsider be laid on the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate and any statements be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4177) was agreed to as follows:\n\n                (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Kendell Frederick \n     Citizenship Assistance Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINGERPRINTS AND OTHER BIOMETRIC INFORMATION FOR \n                   MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, including section 552a of title 5, United States Code \n     (commonly referred to as the ``Privacy Act of 1974''), the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security shall use the fingerprints \n     provided by an individual at the time the individual enlisted \n     in the United States Armed Forces, or at the time the \n     individual filed an application for adjustment of status, to \n     satisfy any requirement for background and security checks in \n     connection with an application for naturalization if--\n       (1) the individual may be naturalized pursuant to section \n     328 or 329 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1439, 1440);\n       (2) the individual was fingerprinted and provided other \n     biometric information in accordance with the requirements of \n     the Department of Defense at the time the individual enlisted \n     in the United States Armed Forces;\n       (3) the individual--\n       (A) submitted an application for naturalization not later \n     than 24 months after the date on which the individual \n     enlisted in the United States Armed Forces; or\n       (B) provided the required biometric information to the \n     Department of Homeland Security through a United States \n     Citizenship and Immigration Services Application Support \n     Center at the time of the individual's application for \n     adjustment of status if filed not later than 24 months after \n     the date on which the individual enlisted in the United \n     States Armed Forces; and\n       (4) the Secretary of Homeland Security determines that the \n     biometric information provided, including fingerprints, is \n     sufficient to conduct the required background and security \n     checks needed for the applicant's naturalization application.\n       (b) More Timely and Effective Adjudication.--Nothing in \n     this section precludes an individual described in subsection \n     (a) from submitting a new set of biometric information, \n     including fingerprints, to the Secretary of Homeland Security \n     with an application for naturalization. If the Secretary \n     determines that submitting a new set of biometric \n     information, including fingerprints, would result in more \n     timely and effective adjudication of the individual's \n     naturalization application, the Secretary shall--\n       (1) inform the individual of such determination; and\n       (2) provide the individual with a description of how to \n     submit such biometric information, including fingerprints.\n       (c) Cooperation.--The Secretary of Homeland Security, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of Defense, shall determine \n     the format of biometric information, including fingerprints, \n     acceptable for usage under subsection (a). The Secretary of \n     Defense, or any other official having custody of the \n     biometric information, including fingerprints, referred to in \n     subsection (a), shall--\n       (1) make such prints available, without charge, to the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security for the purpose described in \n     subsection (a); and\n       (2) otherwise cooperate with the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security to facilitate the processing of applications for \n     naturalization under subsection (a).\n       (d) Electronic Transmission.--Not later than one year after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security shall, in coordination with the Secretary \n     of Defense and the Director of the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation, implement procedures that will ensure the \n     rapid electronic transmission of biometric information, \n     including fingerprints, from existing repositories of such \n     information needed for military personnel applying for \n     naturalization as described in subsection (a) and that will \n     safeguard privacy and civil liberties.\n       (e) Centralization and Expedited Processing.--\n       (1) Centralization.--The Secretary of Homeland Security \n     shall centralize the data processing of all applications for \n     naturalization filed by members of the United States Armed \n     Forces on active duty serving abroad.\n       (2) Expedited processing.--The Secretary of Homeland \n     Security, the Director of the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation, and the Director of National Intelligence \n     shall take appropriate actions to ensure that applications \n     for naturalization by members of the United States Armed \n     Forces described in paragraph\n\n[[Page S1892]]\n\n     (1), and associated background checks, receive expedited \n     processing and are adjudicated within 180 days of the receipt \n     of responses to all background checks.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1593) to reauthorize the grant program for \n     reentry of offenders into the community in the Omnibus Crime \n     Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, to improve reentry \n     planning and implementation, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was pleased to join Senators Specter, \nBiden, and Brownback last year as an original cosponsor of S. 1060, the \nRecidivism Reduction and Second Chance Act, and to help to shepherd \nthat legislation through the Senate Judiciary Committee. I am pleased \nthat now our hard work will finally enable us to take up and pass the \nHouse version of the legislation, which represents significant work and \ncompromise on the part of the bill's Senate sponsors as well as those \nin the House, in order to move this important bill one step closer to \nbecoming law.\n  Over the past several years that we have been working on this bill, I \nand others have had to make many painful compromises in order to ensure \nthat this important bill could receive the support it needs to pass and \nbecome law. In spite of these sacrifices, the Second Chance Act is a \ngood first step toward a new direction in criminal justice that focuses \non making America safer by helping prisoners turn their lives around \nand become contributing members of society.\n  In recent years, this Congress and the States have passed a myriad of \nnew criminal laws creating more and longer sentences for more and more \ncrimes. As a result, this country sends more and more people to prison \nevery year. There are currently more than 2 million people in jail or \nprison, and there are more than 13 million people who spend some time \nin jail or prison each year. Most of these people will at some point \nreturn to our communities. What kind of experience inmates have in \nprison, how we prepare them to rejoin society, and how we integrate \nthem into the broader community when they get out are issues that \nprofoundly affect the communities in which we live.\n  As a former prosecutor, I believe strongly in securing tough and \nappropriate prison sentences for people who break our laws. But it is \nalso important that we do everything we can to ensure that when these \npeople get out of prison, they enter our communities as productive \nmembers of society, so we can start to reverse the dangerous cycles of \nrecidivism and violence. I hope that the Second Chance Act will help us \nbegin to break that cycle.\n  The Second Chance Act would fund collaborations between State and \nlocal corrections agencies, nonprofits, educational institutions, \nservice providers, and families to ensure that offenders released into \nsociety have the resources and support they need to become contributing \nmembers of the community. The bill would require that the programs \nsupported by these grants demonstrate measurable positive results, \nincluding a reduction in recidivism. We should be supporting good \nprograms and demanding results for our federal tax dollars.\n  The bill would also set up a task force to determine ways to improve \nthe effectiveness and efficiency of federal programs related to \nprisoner reentry and would authorize additional programs that would \nencourage employment of released prisoners, improve\n\n[[Page S1894]]\n\nsubstance abuse treatment programs for prisoners, and assist the \nchildren of prisoners.\n  I thank Senator Biden, Senator Specter, and Senator Brownback for \nconsistently working with me to make a good bill even better. They \naccepted my suggestion to fix a provision that would have made it \ndifficult for States without large urban areas to obtain grants. They \nalso agreed with me that it made sense for victim services agencies to \nhave a role in administering grants, for victims' needs to be \nspecifically addressed by grants authorized by the bill, and for \nsafeguards to be added to provisions aiming to integrate families of \noffenders in order to ensure that children are protected.\n  They also worked with me to include in the Senate's legislation an \nimportant study of the collateral consequences of criminal convictions \nfederally and in the States, which would encourage appropriate policy \nto help successfully reintegrate released offenders into society. I am \ndisappointed that partisan and unprincipled objections prevented this \nstudy, which is very important but in no way provocative, from being a \npart of the final bill. I am glad to report, though, that this \nimportant study was passed into law in December as part of the Court \nSecurity Improvement Act of 2007. I am similarly glad that we are \nmoving now to pass the best version of the Second Chance Act that we \ncan.\n  I thank the Vermont Department of Corrections and the Vermont Center \nfor Crime Victim Services for helping me to identify important \nimprovements and to make this bill better for the people of Vermont and \nthe people of America. The Vermont Department of Corrections and many \nothers in Vermont strongly support the Second Chance Act, which gives \nme confidence that this legislation we pass today represents an \nimportant step in making our country safer.\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third time \nand passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no \nintervening action or debate, and any statements be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 1593) was ordered to be read a third time, was read \nthe third time, and passed.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, Today, I rise to congratulate my \ncolleagues on the passage of the Second Chance Act, a bill that we have \nbeen working on for over 4 years. I am pleased to join with Senators \nBiden and Specter and Chairman Leahy in supporting the passage of this \nbill. I, like my colleagues, have worked long and hard on this \nbipartisan legislation that is supported by over 200 bicameral and \nbipartisan organizations.\n  I truly believe that with this bill, we have an incredible \nopportunity to reshape the way in which our Nation fights crime, \naddresses poverty, and provides for safer communities. Indeed, we have \nall seen the statistic. Over 650,000 individuals will be released from \nour Federal and State prisons, and 9 million are released from jails. \nApproximately two out of every three individuals released from prison \nor jail commit more crimes and will be rearrested within 3 years of \nrelease, placing increasing financial burdens on our States and \ndecreasing public safety.\n  This is unacceptable and must be addressed. Recidivism is costly, in \nboth personal and financial terms. Consider: the American taxpayers \nspent approximately $9 billion per year on corrections in 1982, and in \n2002--nearly two decades later--taxpayers spent $60 billion.\n  In addition to the astronomical costs of recidivism, the Nation's \nprison population is projected to continue to grow over the next 5 \nyears by an additional 13 percent. According to ``Public Safety, Public \nSpending: Forecasting America's Prison Population 2007--2017'', State \nand Federal prison populations are expected to add approximately \n192,000 persons at a cost of $27.5 billion between 2007 and 2011.\n  If that is not astonishing enough, State spending on corrections has \nrisen faster over 20 years than spending on nearly any other State \nbudget item--increasing from $9 billion to $41 billion a year. The \naverage annual operating cost per State inmate in 2001 was $22,650, or \n$62.05 per day. Among facilities operated by the Federal Bureau of \nPrisons, it was $22,632 per inmate, or $62.01 per day. These figures do \nnot include the cost of arrest and prosecution, nor do they take into \naccount the cost to victims.\n  Despite that fact that taxpayers went from spending $9 billion per \nyear on corrections in 1982 to $60 billion two decades later, the \nfailure rate of our prison system has not improved over the last 30 \nyears.\n  However, my concerns with our correctional system do not stop here. \nNot only do we need to ensure that our communities are safer, that the \nmoney spent on corrections result in drastically lower recidivism \nrates, but we must also look at the cost to the children of \nincarcerated individuals. A recent study found that children of \nprisoners are five times as likely to be incarcerated later in life as \na child who has not had a parent incarcerated. Fifty-five percent of \nprisoners have children under the age of 18 and, tragically,  more than \n7 million children can claim a parent in prison, in jail, under parole, \nor under probation supervision.\n\n  Additionally, some incarcerated parents owe more than $20,000 in \nchild support debt upon their release. Parents play a vital role in the \nlives of their children--and the role of incarcerated parents is no \ndifferent. The children of individuals in our prison system often \ndepend upon their incarcerated parent, at least in part, for financial \nsupport, and look to that parent for guidance in many aspects of their \nlives. Failing to address this very important facet of the family \nstructure within the prison population could be contributing to the \ndeterioration of families.\n  We must stop subsidizing programs that do not work and that lead, in \nturn, to negative behavior less safety, more crime, and more money \nwasted.\n  The Second Chance Act of 2007, co-authored by Senator Biden, Ranking \nMember Specter, Chairman Leahy, and myself, as well as our counterparts \nin the House of Representatives, is a bill that will address this issue \nby providing grant money to States through the Department of Justice \nand the Department of Labor to encourage the creation of innovative \nprograms geared toward improving public safety, decreasing the \nfinancial burden on States and successfully reintegrating exoffenders \ninto society.\n  Additionally, this bill authorizes two grant programs designed to aid \nnonprofit organizations--faith-based and community based \norganizations--that provide programs to those incarcerated. As you may \nknow, faith-based programs are very successful in reintegrating \noffenders into society. A 2002 study found that faith-based prison \nprograms result in a significantly lower rate of re-arrest than \nvocation-based programs--16 percent versus 36 percent.\n  A 2003 study on Prison Fellowship Ministries' Texas InnerChange \nFreedom Initiative, IFI, program found that IFI graduates were 50 \npercent less likely to be re-arrested. The 2-year postrelease re-arrest \nrate among IFI postrelease graduates in Texas was 17 percent compared \nwith 35 percent of the matched comparison group. And finally, the study \nfound that IFI graduates were 60 percent less likely to be \nreincarcerated and the 2-year postrelease reincarceration rate was 8 \npercent of IFI graduates--8 percent--versus 20.3 percent with the \nmatched comparison group from a nonfaith-based program.\n  The bill also focuses on systematic changes within the criminal \njustice system by encouraging more coordination between Government \nagencies, encourages States, and local governments to reevaluate their \ncurrent statutes in order to streamline their budgets and provide for \nmore effective transition programs for inmates, which include: \neducation, job training, life and family skills, programs for children \nof incarcerated parents, as well as substance abuse treatment.\n  Further, I want my colleagues to know that there are real \naccountability measures within this bill. If grantees do not show \nsignificant progress in reducing the recidivism rates for program \nparticipants they will not be eligible to receive further funding under \nthis act.\n\n  States have already shown that recidivism rates can be dramatically \ncut with innovative programs, and I am\n\n[[Page S1895]]\n\nproud that my State, Kansas, is a leader in this regard. In Kansas, the \nShawnee County Re-Entry Program engages corrections officials and \ncommunity partners to develop comprehensive reentry plans for people in \nprison who have been assessed as high-risk for reoffending upon \nrelease. In the 12 months prior to release, program participants work \nclosely with case managers to develop their reentry plans. Case \nmanagers continue to provide support as needed following release.\n  The Shawnee community is closely involved in the program as well, \nserving on accountability panels and as volunteer community connectors. \nThe program also developed a data collection system to enable facility \nand parole case managers to enter information more easily. The system \nallows facility staff and case workers to share data with other data \nsystems within other State agencies, and faith and community-based \nproviders. A Web-based data system would also help build the capacity \nof community and faith-based organizations to track data similar to \nState data collections methods. In this way, State agencies can more \neasily compare data and outcomes with information collected by faith \nand community groups. This is just one example of innovation in \naddressing the concerns facing our criminal justice system.\n  Indeed this bill is much needed and will serve as a catalyst for \nsystemic change. This bill could not have happened without the hard \nwork and determination of over 200 organizations, such as Prison \nFellowship Ministries, Open Society, the Council of State Governments, \nand the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, as well as many State and \nlocal government correction officials and law enforcement officials--a \ntruly bipartisan/bicameral coalition of partners committed to changing \nthe criminal justice system.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, Senators Biden and Specter, and \nChairman Leahy. Together we were able to implement vital legislation \ngeared to improve public safety, give aid to States, and to truly give \nthose incarcerated a second chance not only to fully integrate into \nsociety in a positive way but to provide them with a hope for a \npositive future not only for themselves but for their families as well.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I yield the floor to my colleague from \nOklahoma, Senator Coburn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/11/senate-section/article/S1895-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1895-S1909]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET FOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR \n                            2009--Continued\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I am going to spend a little while tonight \ntalking about the budget. I have listened to the budget debate all day, \njust like I did yesterday. I came in yesterday and listened to the \ndebate. I have heard about tax increases and I have heard about \nspending and I have heard the things going back and forth. But what I \ndid not hear was anything that had to do with this: This is the oath of \na Senator. There are some interesting things. Let me read it first:\n\n       I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the \n     Constitution of the United States against all enemies, \n     foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and \n     allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, \n     without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and \n     that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the \n     office on which I am about to enter: So help me God.\n\n  The interesting thing about that oath is nowhere in that oath does it \nmention your State. There was, by design, never any intended part by \nour Founders that we would place parochialism ahead of our duty to this \ncountry. Yet where do we find ourselves today? With $9 trillion, almost \n$10 trillion, at the end of this fiscal year, in direct debt.\n  We have heard all sorts of numbers quoted today. The actual number \nfor the obligated unpaid-for liabilities that our next generations will \nface is actually $79 trillion. It is interesting where that comes from \nbecause that comes from the retirement benefits for our service \npersonnel, the retirement benefits for Federal employees, including \npeople who work in this Chamber, Medicare payments, Medicaid payments, \nall the various trust funds we have set up through the years, such as \nthe Inland Waterway Trust Fund, the trust funds associated with other \ndistinct obligations in terms of infrastructure in this country. We are \nstealing all that money every year that is supposed to go to it. As a \nmatter of fact, the budget deficit this year will be, in real \naccounting standards--not Enron accounting standards--$607 billion, of \nwhich about $160 billion of that is going to come from Social Security \nand about another $30 billion to $35 billion from all these other trust \nfunds.\n  So when you hear a number that comes from Washington, I want us to be \nvery suspect because we are much like the CEO at Enron, Ken Lay. We are \nnot going to send you the real number. It is not because we do not \nintend to be honest; it is because we have sold out to parochialism.\n  Now, I want us to think about that for a minute. Later on, I am going \nto show some examples. I am going to go through $350 billion-plus worth \nof waste that occurs annually in this country. But how is it that we \nhave $350 billion--by the way, it is not going to be disputable. There \nis going to be an absolute reference to either a GAO study, a CBO \nscore, a congressional hearing or published reports that are out there. \nSo it is not going to be Tom Coburn's estimate. It is going to be a \nfactual basis of what is occurring in our country.\n  But how is it we got to the point where Members of Congress--both of \nthe House and of the Senate--have all of a sudden forgotten what their \noath is; that, in fact, their primary means is: How do I send more \nmoney home to my State? How is it that we have gotten to where we have \n$79 trillion in unfunded liabilities? We have $10 trillion in true \ndebt, at the end of this fiscal year. We are going to have a $600 \nbillion deficit--real deficit--this year, which we are going to \nobligate our children to pay for.\n  I would put forth: We forgot our oath. We forgot what it is about. \nOur State is not mentioned. When I am parochial for my State, there is \nno way I can live up to the oath I took when I came into this body. \nThere is no way, if I am parochial for Oklahoma or Ohio, I can possibly \nmake a decision that is in the long-term best interest of the country, \nwhen I am thinking about the best interest of my State in the short \nterm.\n  So, consequently, what came about from that? Well, here is what we \nsaw in terms of earmarks, the growth of earmarks and the growth of \nGovernment spending. Isn't it interesting, we have heard all the debate \ntoday about tax increases, but nobody, except Senator Brownback, talked \nabout cutting spending. Here we have the earmarks in 2006. In 2007, \nthere were another 11,800 earmarks. So it went to 12,000 earmarks. But \nthe spending continues to rise. There is a correlation between earmarks \nand spending, and it is this: Earmarks are the gateway drug for \noverspending.\n  Let me explain how it works. If I want something for Oklahoma and I \nsubmit a request and the appropriators are kind enough to honor that \nrequest and I do not vote for the bill, regardless of whether I agree \nwith the bill, the next time another appropriations bill comes up and I \nhave a request, I will not get it. So all of a sudden my earmark blinds \nme on a parochial basis for what is best for Oklahoma, but I do not do \nwhat is best for the country. So you see this trend going up, and it \ncontinues to go up. If you had one for debt, you would see that. If you \nhad one for unfunded liabilities, you would see the same thing.\n  Now, what did our Founders have to say:\n\n       Congress had not unlimited powers to provide for the \n     general welfare, but were restrained to those specifically \n     enumerated.\n\n  This is Thomas Jefferson, the founder of the Democratic Party. This \nis what he said:\n\n       As it was never meant they should provide for that welfare \n     but by the exercise of the enumerated powers.\n\n  Earmarks are not enumerated powers. The only power they are is how we \nfind ways to get ourselves reelected. That is the power they are. Here \nis the founder of the modern Democratic Party who now chastises us with \nhis words about what earmarks are.\n  Yet what do we do? We are going to have a vote. We are going to have \na vote on this budget on a moratorium on earmarks. I am very thankful \nto Senator DeMint for bringing that up.\n\n[[Page S1896]]\n\n  The argument about earmarks is over everywhere except in Washington. \nIf you look at all the polling data throughout the country, in every \nState, it does not matter if you are Democrat or Republican or \nIndependent, it is over. They have already decided the issue. Eighty-\nfive percent of the people in this country say we should not be doing \nit. It does not have anything to do with age. It does not have anything \nto do with party. Do you know what it has to do with? Those people who \nare getting them and are well heeled and well connected to politicians, \nthey are the ones who do not want the earmark party to be over. That \nought to send a warning signal to the rest of Americans that there is \nsomething wrong with this process.\n\n  Here is what is wrong with the process:\n\n       [T]he principle of spending money to be paid by posterity, \n     under the name of funding, is but swindling futurity on a \n     large scale.\n\n  This is the same bright man who was very involved in the genesis of \nour country, talking to us from history about what is important on \nearmarks.\n  In 1996, there were less than 900 earmarks. How did we go--in 10 \nshort years--from 3,000 to 15,000? What changed? The argument is: We \nhave an obligation not to let the bureaucrats spend the money. Does \nthat mean all the time before this, when they were much lower, we were \nnot doing a good job? Or could it be that all of a sudden the political \ntool of earmarks became the soup du jour that politicians use to get \nthemselves reelected and collect campaign money by accomplishing those \nthings?\n  So I wish to spend a little time tonight talking about the \nunsustainable course we are on. International markets now doubt our \nability to pay off our debt. Our AAA credit rating is in jeopardy. The \ndollar is declining. Medicare has hit a trigger for the first time in \nits history that signals we are dipping into general revenues at a rate \nthat is unsustainable. By the way, Medicare was never intended to be \npaid for with funds from general revenue. Do we have a moral obligation \nas Members of Congress to do what every other family does in tough \ntimes and tighten our belts?\n  So what I am going to try to do tonight is lay out $388 billion worth \nof things the Congress could do tomorrow that would save us $388 \nbillion.\n  Now, somebody may dispute the fact that if we totally changed the Tax \nCode to either a flat tax or a sales tax we might not have a tax gap--\nthe amount that is owed that is not paid--of $350 billion or $370 \nbillion. We may only have one of $270 billion. I will admit that. So \nyou can take an arrow at that. But the rest of it you cannot take an \narrow at. All the rest of it is indisputable.\n  As a matter of fact, we had testimony before the Budget Committee and \nbefore the Finance Committee by the IRS that said if, in fact, you \nfunded them properly, they could get between $30 billion and $40 \nbillion of the tax gap back over a period of 5 years. We know for every \n$1 we give them in terms of enforcement, they get $3 to $4 back.\n  The problem in our country is overspending and wasteful spending. It \nis not undertaxation. It is a moral question whether we will ask the \nAmerican people for more money when, in fact, we are terrible slobs \nwith the way we control and manage the money they have today, where we \nare wasteful.\n  The American people would expect us to get rid of fraud, waste, and \nabuse before we raise their taxes. Calling for higher taxes is akin to \nsaying you want a performance bonus for us. That is what it is saying. \nIt is absurd to claim the Government is operating at peak efficiency \nand spending cannot be cut anywhere. But yet we do not see it. It is \nnot just the Democratic budgets. It is the Republican budgets. I will \ngive credit to President Bush. At least he has a park program and at \nleast they have brought forward recommendations of getting rid of \nprograms that absolutely are not functioning, absolutely do not come \nanywhere close to meeting the goals. Because they have special \ninterests, they are protected by individual Senators. Blocking new \nspending is not about obstructionism. The real obstruction is wasteful \nspending and not going after the wasteful spending at a time when we \nare asking Americans, who are tightening their belts, to give more \nmoney to the Government. That is the real obstruction.\n  Looking for new ways to spend money is not our job. Our job is to \nconduct oversight and eliminate programs that are not working. We are \nnot doing our oversight. As a matter of fact, the CRS did a study on \noversight. If we put this sign right up here and we look at oversight \nhearings, what you will see is: As the earmarks have gone up, oversight \nhas gone down. Do you know why? Because the only thing the \nAppropriations staff has time to do is to barely get the bill out and \nthen manage all the earmarks. So where is the oversight to see what is \nworking and what is not? It isn't there.\n  The other assumption with this budget is that we have a blank check--\nand with Republican budgets, not just the majority's budgets--to spend \nmoney however we desire, however we choose. Well, that does not appear \nin the Constitution. We have totally thrown it away when it comes to \nspending. We have totally thrown it away under the concept of either \nthe interstate commerce clause or the general welfare clause. We have \ndecided that those do not mean anything, even though the significant \nFounders of our country believed they did.\n  So let's go back to the oath. Does the oath mean anything? I will \n``defend the Constitution'' is what it says. Oh, that means I will \ntwist it to make sure I can do parochial things that make me look good \nat home. Is that what it means? Can I fully represent and do what is \nbest for our country when I am worried about doing what is best for my \nState and me? Which one is the more moral position?\n\n  James Madison, the father of our Constitution, was very clear on this \npoint. He said:\n\n        With respect to the two words ``general welfare,'' I have \n     always regarded them as qualified by the detail of powers \n     enumerated in the Constitution that are connected with it. To \n     take them in a literal and unlimited sense would be a \n     metamorphosis of the Constitution into a character which \n     there is a host of proofs was not contemplated by its \n     creators.\n\n  In other words, when you are starting to fudge the deal, that is not \nwhat we intended, guys. When you are starting to play games with the \nConstitution, that is not what we intended. And he spoke it in \nanticipation so that he would be on record. And we would know what his \nrecord was about, what they intended about general welfare. The \narguments we hear in defense of earmarks would be ridiculed by our \nFounders after they got over their nausea.\n  President Reagan criticized the 1987 highway bill because it had 152 \nearmarks. As a matter of fact, the one before that he vetoed and sent \nback, and it had even fewer than that. So this isn't an old phenomenon; \nthis is a modern phenomenon. This is something modern that we need to \nchange.\n  It is interesting that so many in this body seem more interested in \nadhering to the constitutional scholarship of Jack Abramoff rather than \nJames Madison, much to our detriment. Why do you think we have between \nan 11 and 22 percent confidence rating from the American people about \nwhether we are doing their business in the best interests of the \ncountry, rather than our business?\n  Another argument I hear often is that we know better than faceless \nbureaucrats. Yet if we don't like what an agency is doing, we don't \nhave anyone to blame but ourselves. We have the power of the purse and \nthe power of oversight. The problem is we only use the power of the \npurse to spend, not to restrict. The last time a rescission bill--and \nfor those who don't know what that is, it is a bill that decreases \nrather than increases spending--went through Congress was 1995.\n  Overcoming our addiction to earmarks will help us confront the \nmassive waste that is in the Federal budget. We have to do a top-down \nreview of everything in this country if, in fact, we want to hold to \nthe things that are really important, the things that are really worth \nour sacrifice, which is the next two generations.\n  Now, it is really interesting that the Government Accounting Office \nsays that every family today is responsible for an unfunded liability \nof almost a half million dollars. If we think about what that means in \nterms of carrying that interest, paying your regular taxes and then \ncarrying that--the other thing is if you divide the unfunded liability \nby the 200 million kids\n\n[[Page S1897]]\n\nwho are going to come on between now and the next 75 years, what we are \ntalking about is $400,000 per child; $400,000 per individual child who \nis born starting today and moving forward that we are going to add. \nThink about carrying the interest. Think about what will happen to \nthem.\n  Now, let me put up a chart, and we will go through this for a minute. \nThis has $383 billion--actually a more recent chart shows $385 \nbillion--in annual expenditures that are wasted. I would like to spend \na minute on that, but let me describe what it is. It is $3,000 for \nevery American household in this country down the drain. It is a full \n4-year scholarship for two-thirds of all of the college students in \nthis country. It is enough money to buy a new home for 2 million \nAmericans, based on the average price of a home. It is enough money to \nget the 2 million Americans who are facing foreclosure out of \nforeclosure and pay for their entire mortgage. That is what we are \nwasting in one year. It is enough money to pay for the health care of \neverybody in this country who is either underinsured or uninsured. All \n47 million who are uninsured and the 35 million who are underinsured, \nwe can pay for them, just by getting rid of this waste.\n  It is more than the gross domestic product of 85 percent of every \ncountry on Earth. How much we are wasting through fraud and abuse and \nwaste is greater than 85 percent of the gross domestic product of every \ncountry on this Earth. It is more than the gross domestic product of 40 \nStates in our Union. It is enough to meet the one campaign's annual \ngoals to end extreme poverty over the next 10 years, over 10 times not \nenough. More importantly, it is enough to build 1,500 bridges to \nnowhere over every river in the world, times 10. That is how much money \nit is.\n  So what are the crises that we face? It is important that we put \nourselves in the shoes of the typical American family in this time of \ntightening. What do they do? They reassess. They look for waste. Their \ndebt is fixed. They try not to get additional debt. They try to spend \nless money. They try to conserve. They try to turn the thermostat down. \nThey try to only drive when they have to drive. They try to buy cheaper \nfoods. They don't buy the things they would like to buy. They buy and \nspend money only on bare necessities, if they can.\n  Well, a $607 billion deficit this year, a $10 trillion debt, and a \n$79 trillion unfunded liability ought to cause us to do the same thing, \nexcept we have only heard 1 percent in 2 days of debate talk about \neliminating wasteful spending, and that was Senator Sam Brownback from \nKansas.\n  In the short term, we will get through this economic slowdown. \nHopefully, energy prices will become more affordable for us. But \neverybody knows in this body, whether we want to admit it or not, we \nare approaching the day of reckoning that we would not get through. As \nDavid Walker, who is the Comptroller General of the United States, a \nnonpartisan position, said: We are on an unsustainable course. It is \nabsolutely unsustainable. The question is whether our kids are worth us \nmaking the hard choices.\n  Economists on the left and the right from groups ranging from the \nBrookings Institute to the Heritage Foundation recognize the course we \nare on. We hear all the time that the only problems are the mandatory \nprograms: Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid. I am going to show \ntonight that it is not the only problem. It is a lot of the problem, \nthere is no question about it. It is not just the demographics of it \nand the growth. There are a lot of management problems that we fail to \naddress.\n  Each family's share, which I spoke about a minute ago, of the \nunfunded liabilities is over $450,000 right now. By 2040--and this is \nnot my number, this is the Government Accounting Office--total Federal \nspending will have to be cut by 60 percent or we will have to double \nFederal income tax rates.\n  Now, we heard Senator Hatch talk about how 50 percent of the country \nnow pays 97 percent of the taxes. What happens when we double our tax \nrates, or another question is, what happens when we don't have any \nGovernment programs except Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security? \nNo military, no Department of Education, no NASA, no NIH, no CDC. All \nof those are gone in a very few short years. More importantly, in 2012, \nmy generation starts heavily hitting Medicare and Social Security, the \nfirst baby boomers. What happens if we don't address that?\n  We would be wise to remember the words of Will Durant:\n\n       A great civilization is not conquered from without until it \n     has destroyed itself from within.\n\n  For the typical family sitting around the dinner table right now \nacross America, the answer is obvious. It is time for some belt \ntightening. It is time for us to do the hard work of eliminating the \nduplication of wasteful programs. From their perspective, if they have \nto tighten their belt, we should too. It is not our money, it is \ntheirs. Yet in this body we don't believe we have to live by the same \nset of rules. We have demonstrated that by our behavior. We like to \npretend that we don't live in the world of credit ratings and scores. \nWe ignore economic realities and look for ways to spend money on things \nthat aren't necessary--they may be nice but aren't necessary--with \nlittle regard to how our decisions are going to affect our ability to \npay for things we must pay for.\n  By arguing that Americans aren't taxed enough, Members of Congress \nare claiming that Government spending can't be cut any more in the \nbudget because the Government is running so efficiently it deserves a \nraise. I don't think there is hardly anybody out in America's \nmidsection, northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest, south central, \nwho believes that. That is a fairy tale that is believed here, except \nwe don't confront it.\n  Every year we have given Congress a performance bonus that has been \nadamantly unearned. Americans find this absurd. That is one of the \nreasons our approval rating is so low.\n  A question we should ask probably is, if our Nation's survival were \nat stake right now, would we be acting any differently? Would we have \nthis budget, or the Republican budget, from 2006? Would those have been \nthe budgets? No, they wouldn't have been. We would have been thinking \nlong term. We would have been making the hard decisions. We would have \nsaid: Our country is worth us irritating some special interest group \nover some item that is no longer efficient or no longer effective. We \nwouldn't be worried about weighing the future of our children and our \ngrandchildren against the special interests and monied of this country. \nWe wouldn't worry about it.\n  Well, the fact is, the future is on the line, and if we don't act in \nthe next couple of years, we are going to fall into Will Durant's trap, \nas we will have rotted inside our own excesses of politics, as we \nquietly didn't do the things that we could have done to fix the \nproblems that are in front of this country.\n  It is called maintenance. It is like when you don't mow your grass or \nyou don't pick up the trash in front of your yard. What happens is the \nvalue goes down, the pride goes down. Well, that is what has happened \nto us because myself and the vast majority of Americans believe \noverspending is a greater moral challenge than undertaxation.\n  I want to spend some time now going through what I call 2008, a waste \nodyssey. This waste odyssey is--I am going to be describing a few areas \nof Government, and I am going to go through them fairly fast so we can \nsee it, and it will be on my Web site in the next week or so. But I am \ngoing to outline at least $385 billion, of which I will guarantee $355 \nbillion of it cannot be legitimately challenged that is not waste; $355 \nbillion annually that is wasted or defrauded from the taxpayers of this \ncountry, and we are doing nothing about it. This budget doesn't do \nanything about it; our appropriations oversight committees don't do \nanything about it. The committees don't make the amendments to do \nsomething about it. We do nothing about it. So we come back to that \nall-important oath. Mr. President, $385 billion listed, $383 billion on \nthis one chart, $385 billion of which $355 billion nobody will be able \nto dispute.\n  (Mr. BROWN assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. COBURN. Here is what we know. Medicare fraud, out and out pure \nMedicare fraud. It is somewhere between $70 billion and $90 billion. I \npicked the middle, which is $80 billion. We have\n\n[[Page S1898]]\n\ntestimony and studies and lots of data on that that will show us that \nat least $80 billion worth of Medicare money is being ripped off every \nyear.\n  Let me give some examples. I will go through some. Here is one \ncompany that billed Medicare $170 million for HIV drugs. Do you know \nhow much in HIV drugs they did? Less than a million. But they billed \n$170 million. There was $142 million for nonexistent delivery of \nsupplies and parts and medical equipment--$142 million.\n  How about taking Medicare numbers from seniors and billing Medicare \nfor prosthetic arms on people who already have two arms? That came to \n$1.4 billion last year. Think about that--$1.4 billion was billed to \nMedicare for prosthetic arms for people who don't need prosthetic arms.\n  How about 80 percent of the drugs billed across the entire United \nStates for HIV under Medicare went to the State of Florida, which has \nless than 10 percent of the HIV patients who are eligible for Medicare. \nHow is that possible? How about one wheelchair that got billed to \nMedicare? It was never sent, but they billed $5 million to Medicare \nthrough multiple billings. It is easy to add up to $80 billion.\n  I could go on. How about fake Medicare providers for the elderly, \nwhen they steal their number and send multiple bills to multiple \nlocations throughout the country for the same Medicare patient. That is \n$10 billion in improper payments. The actual improper payments were $37 \nbillion the year before last, and $27 billion last year and of that, \n$10 billion of it is unrecoverable. We paid too much or we paid the \nwrong person. That is $10 billion out the door, which is $250 per man, \nwoman, and child in this country in improper payments on Medicare.\n  Medicaid is another one. There was $30 billion worth of fraud. It is \nhigher than that; that is only the Federal Government's portion of it. \nIt is easily documented, but we cannot document it because Medicaid \ndoesn't file improper payments like the law says they are supposed to. \nWhy? It is because we have not had the guts to put any teeth into \nforcing HHS to have improper payments. Last year, finally we got 6 \nmonths of improper payments on only direct payments to doctors. They \nfound $13 billion worth of improper payments. We have a report that \nsays there is probably $15 billion worth of fraud in Medicaid in New \nYork City alone, of which the Federal Government's share would be about \n$8 billion to $9 billion.\n  How about the fact that we paid, in 10 States, over $30 million for \npayments for Medicaid services to people who are dead? Yes, we paid \nthat. We have a great system that is working well. How about the fact \nthat 65 percent of all Medicaid rehabilitative services are fraudulent? \nSo of the rehab bills that are filed with Medicaid through CMS, 65 \npercent are fraudulent.\n  Why do we continue to let that happen? Where is the oversight? Ninety \npercent of New York Medicaid school-based service claims were \nillegitimate. Case management. CMS reports that in one State, 72.4 \npercent of the claims weren't valid in terms of Medicaid case \nmanagement.\n  Then we have the infamous drug scandals with the drug companies that \nhave been overbilling to the tune of a billion dollars.\n  How about Social Security disability fraud? We have that listed at \n$2.5 billion. What we know is the following: There is at least $6.5 \nbillion in improper payments in Social Security disability. So we have \npaid them a much smaller percentage than we have on any other improper \npayment program throughout the Federal Government and said we will take \na small percentage of that, less than 40 percent, which is normally 80 \npercent, and we will list it at $2.5 billion. It is coming out of \nSocial Security every year--totally wrong--and that $2.5 billion could \nstay in the SSI program to fund people who were truly disabled. Yet we \nlet $2.5 billion sneak out. Why? That is us. We have not done the \noversight.\n  If you add up all of the rest of the improper payments in the Federal \nGovernment, you come to $55 billion. That is what is reported. But that \ndoesn't include the 18 agencies of the Federal Government that don't \neven report improper payments, even though it is the law, which \naccounts for another $179 billion worth of spending. And if they are \nanywhere close to the rest of it, there is 5 to 10 percent of improper \npayments. So there is anywhere from $3 billion to $7 billion more in \nimproper payments.\n  DOD performance awards. Here is what we have done. Over the last 3 \nyears, the DOD paid out $8 billion on average a year to contractors for \nperformance bonuses that didn't meet the performance requirements of \ntheir contract. Think about that--$8 billion a year. That is almost \ntwice the total budget of my home State that we are paying for \nperformance bonuses for contractors that don't meet the requirements of \nthe contract, but we pay them anyway. Why do we allow that? Why do we \nallow that to happen?\n\n  How about DOD maintenance of unneeded properties? We have testimony \nand a report that shows they have 22,000 pieces of property they don't \nwant. They are spending about $3 billion maintaining properties they \ndon't want. But we put roadblocks in the way so they cannot get rid of \nthem. Is that Americans' fault or is that something we should have \naddressed? We didn't do it. Consequently, we are going to throw out $3 \nbillion more this year to maintain properties we should have sold 5 to \n10 years ago.\n  We also know that within the Federal Government, outside of the DOD, \nwe have another $18 billion worth of properties we cannot get rid of \nbecause we cannot go through the hundreds of hoops we have to be able \nto get rid of them. That is a one-time savings. That is not even on \nhere. That is a one-time savings we would achieve if we had a real \nproperty reform that forced the bureaucracy to do what was best when it \ncame to real property.\n  Going back to the performance bonuses, when GAO looked at it, they \nfound no connection between the payment of performance bonuses at the \nPentagon and performance--not just on this $8 billion they said was \npaid erroneously, but on the rest of it. I think we have an Armed \nServices Committee in the Senate. We certainly have a DOD \nAppropriations Committee in the Senate. You would think this might be \none thing we wanted to do oversight on. Yet no oversight hearing has \nhappened. Why is that? Why haven't we looked at how we are wasting this \nmoney?\n  How about no-bid contracts. This is my favorite. We have seen the \nproblems between Boeing and Northrup-Grumman on a new tanker, a $35 \nbillion new contract--except we know we have needed a new tanker for 12 \nyears. We have had planning on that for 12 years. We are letting a \ncost-plus contract go through because we don't know what we want. Do we \nnot think whoever won that contract ought to have to take some risk, \ndevelopment risk? Do we think the American taxpayer ought to pay that? \nWe know we lose at least $5 billion a year across the Government in no-\nbid contracts. That is probably minor. That is a small estimate within \nthe Pentagon. We have not even looked at all the other no-bid contracts \nthroughout FEMA, which we know was tremendously wasteful during \nKatrina. We know that at least $3 billion of the money we spent during \nKatrina, from hearings we had on homeland security, was wasted. When \nthe average price we pay to pick up debris from Katrina to the guy \nactually picking it up is $6 a yard, and we are paying the Corps of \nEngineers $32 a yard, there is a problem. The taxpayers are getting \nswindled by 500 percent. Yet we did that to the tune of billions of \ndollars after Katrina, with no management or oversight.\n  What we know is in homeland security--and especially from Congressmen \nWaxman and Davis in the House--32 Homeland Security Department \ncontracts, worth a total of $34 billion in no-bid contracts, have \nexperienced significant overcharges, wasteful spending, and \nmismanagement. Between 2003 and 2005, the no-bid contracts in the \nDepartment of Homeland Security increased by 739 percent. There is no \nmanagement. We are allowing that to happen. When we argue that we \ncannot let the bureaucrats control it, when we say we have to do \nearmarks, but we don't do oversight, we are letting the bureaucrats \ncontrol it. If there is $300 billion worth of waste, fraud, and abuse \nhere, and our earmarks account for $18 billion, what price are we \npaying by not managing the Federal Government\n\n[[Page S1899]]\n\nand having oversight? We are not doing it.\n  Emergency spending, another one we won't be critical of ourselves. We \nput emergency spending in on the floor and add from $20 billion to $40 \nbillion and call it an emergency, and none of it meets the definition \nof an emergency. We do that so we can go outside of the spending \nparameters that we have limited ourselves to either through pay-go or \nthe budget. But it looks good at home--or does it? It looks good at \nhome until we start talking about the waste, talking about the fraud, \ntalking about the mismanagement, talking about the denial of our oath \nwe took when we came here to uphold the Constitution. When we allow \nbureaucracies to waste money, when we don't have oversight of those \nbureaucracies, then in fact we have abandoned our oath.\n  It is interesting, in emergencies, up until recently, when we had \nemergency spending, we paid for it. In my home State of Oklahoma we had \nthe Oklahoma City bombing, a tremendous tragedy. It was the first major \ninternal terrorist act we had. All of the money that went toward \nrestoration of that was paid for. We didn't borrow it from our \ngrandchildren. Let me go back again. When we don't pay for things with \nemergency spending, we charge it to them. When we have a true \nemergency, which we might say we didn't plan for, that is one thing, \nbut when we know what we are putting into the bill is not an emergency, \nwe are saying they don't matter, we don't care. We care more about \nlooking good and getting some constituent satisfied than thinking about \nthe future of these kids.\n  How about other areas? How about crop insurance? Do you realize that \nfor every dollar we pay out in crop insurance, we spend over $3 in \nadministrative fees and underwriting to insurance companies? How is \nthat a good deal? Regardless of where you are on the farm bill, why \nwould we do that? That is at a rate of five times what the rest of the \ninsurance industry earns.\n  Who has the sweet deal here? Who has the sweet deal? It is not these \nkids. They don't have a sweet deal, when we are paying three times more \nthan we should to administer a crop insurance program and not requiring \nfarmers to participate. That is the minimum we can save--$4 billion a \nyear--by saying you can earn the same amount of money as everybody else \nin the casualty insurance business, and no more. No more sweet deals \nfor crop insurance firms. But do we do it? No. I voted wrong on one of \nthe amendments for it. It may have been the amendment of the person \nsitting in the chair. But we didn't do it.\n  One of my favorites is the United Nations. We sent $5.3 billion last \nyear to the U.N. and we cannot get the State Department to tell us what \nour total was in 2007. That was 2006. By law, they are supposed to \nprovide that, but they don't comply. The Foreign Relations Committee \nwon't make them comply, and the Appropriations Committee won't do it, \nbecause we don't want to know how much we send. But the American people \nwant to know. But the Secretary of State does not want to give it to \nus. Our committees will not force them to do it. What do we know about \nthat, of the leaked documents that came out looking at how money is \nspent? What we know is on procurement and peacekeeping that at least 40 \npercent of the money that is spent is wasted. Think about that. At \nleast 40 percent is influenced through people of influence and does not \never get to what it is supposed to be doing. It never gets into the \npeacekeeping field. Only 60 percent of the procurement money actually \never gets to where we want peacekeeping, and yet we don't do anything \nabout it.\n\n  We have asked for transparency at the United Nations. This body voted \n99 to 1 to condition last year's money on that transparency. It went to \nconference, and all of a sudden for some reason that was dropped. I \nwonder why that happened? We thought the United Nations owed us an \nexplanation to tell us where they spent our $5.3 billion but, in our \nwisdom, we did not accede to that because it might have upset the U.N. \nConsequently, about $1 billion a year of what we send to the United \nNations is pure waste--pure waste. It goes to fraud. It goes to buy off \npeople. It goes to not accomplishing the goals.\n  If we look at what we are trying to do in Darfur and the new U.N. \nprogram over there in terms of sending an interdiction force, what we \nknow is 40 percent of the money has been wasted. It has been scavenged. \nIt has been taken away. It is not going to make a difference in \nsomebody's life.\n  It is interesting, the U.N. peacekeeping budget this year will grow \nfrom $5 billion to $7 billion, a 40-percent growth in 1 year. And of \nthe top five contributors to the U.N. budget, which is us, the United \nKingdom, France, Japan, and Germany, all of our budgets are going to \ngrow around 6 or 7 percent. But because we do not have any \ntransparency, we do not have any management at the United Nations, we \nhave a spoil system and we do not have the courage in our body to hold \nthem accountable, we are going to throw $1 billion to $2 billion of our \nkids' money away.\n  Oh, I know, we shouldn't rock the boat at the United Nations. They \nare the people who care about freedom in the world. It is hard to see. \nIf they care about freedom, transparency would be one of the No. 1 \nthings they would assure themselves.\n  How about another $10-billion worth of savings? We have $64 billion \nworth of IT contracts going on right now; $27 billion of those are on \nthe high-risk list. In other words, we routinely lose about 20 percent \nof our investments in ITs. They don't ever accomplish their goals. We \nspend the money, and we never get anything for it. Where is the \nmanagement for that program? Where is the accountability for that? It \nis similar to the tanker program: Give me a cost-plus program, I don't \nknow what I want now, but I know I want something, and I will tell you \nas we go what I want. And so the bills start adding up. So out of the \n$64 billion we spent last year, $27 billion of it is questionable we \nare ever getting anything out of it.\n  Take a conservative estimate of that, which is less than what we know \nhistorically the IT oversight from GAO has told us, and we are going to \nlose $10 billion on programs that were not asked for right, were not \nmanaged properly or we just flat did not get what we asked for and \nparted our ways and threw these kids' money away.\n  Then there is another $17.5 billion we can save from the National \nFlood Insurance Program. It was created in 1968 by Congress to prevent \nthe need for future emergency spending for large floods. It was \ndesigned to be self-supporting, to pay back any debts with proceeds \nfrom ratepayers. But what happened was, on the way to the store, the \npoliticians got in between them. So now we have a vast majority of \nproperties that have been grandfathered in that historically have made \nclaims. They were built before the NFIP construction standards, and \nthey receive premium subsidies. In the wake of Katrina, we have a one-\ntime savings of $17.5 billion that we could have had we had that \nprogram. But where are we? We now have Gulf Coast States lobbying us \nthat we should increase that program, except the kids I showed the \npicture of are responsible for that.\n  The other item, and I challenge all my colleagues to start talking \nwith Federal workers about where they can save money. If you ask them, \nevery one of them says, yes, we can save money. As a matter of fact, we \ncan save a lot of money, but nobody is asking. As a matter of fact, the \nsystem is, if we haven't spent the money by the 10th month, we are told \nto spend it, we are told to spend the money because we might not get \nenough money next year, and if we don't spend it, then it looks like we \ndon't need it and, therefore, our budgets will be declined. In fact, \nout of the $1.36 trillion we are going to spend this year, we could \nsave 5 percent easily, 5 percent efficiency. If we can save it, if the \nFederal employees, the thousands with whom I have talked, are right, \nwhy aren't we saving?\n  Let's go down through a few more, and then I will finish.\n  We know if we simplify the Tax Code, either change it to a flat tax \nor straight tax or a value-added tax--whichever one you want, it \ndoesn't matter--what we know is if we did that, we could get \nsignificant savings. Let me tell you how.\n  One is we know compliance will be better. But we also know we have a \n$10 billion budget for employees at the IRS that if, in fact, we could \ncreate a simpler, fairer, straighter system--you\n\n[[Page S1900]]\n\npick which kind, I don't care, value-added tax, whatever it is--that we \nwould not need nearly that many employees and we would not spend $160 \nbillion a year paying our taxes, which is what we pay other people \noutside the IRS.\n  We also know the IRS, for every dollar they spend investing in \ncompliance, gets between $3 and $4 back. So somewhere between $50 \nbillion and $100 billion out of the $370 billion that we don't get now, \nwe can save. But we tend to want to use it for a political debate.\n  How about eliminating outdated and wasteful programs. Let me go \nthrough some of them. That is $18 billion. Science fiction weapons, \n$431 million, got nothing for it over the last 10 years, nothing for \nit, and we spent $431 million and got nothing.\n  The Coast Guard lengthened eight patrol boats through an earmark. It \ncost $100 million. They are all worthless now. We have to buy eight \npatrol boats. Somebody had a good idea.\n  How about excessive fuel costs? At minimum, $35 million a year, and \nwhat we know now looks like in Iraq another $12 million worth of fraud \noccurring in the fuel depots inside Baghdad. Another $40 million, $50 \nmillion on fuel.\n\n  How about improper travel payments at the Defense Department, $4 \nmillion a year? Security clearances--it costs us half a billion dollars \na year to do security clearances because we are doing it in the Dark \nAges when, in fact, for almost every other thing around this country we \nhave developed modern systems, computer-aided IT to develop how fast \nand how often we can clear security items. Yet we spend half a billion, \nand it takes a year to get somebody cleared. We could cut that in half.\n  We had a wonderful earmark for polyester t-shirts for our marines. \nThe only problem is, if their MRAP or humvee has a fire, it sticks to \ntheir skin. But we still spend $3 million on them.\n  How about a ferry to nowhere, 84 million bucks? We rejected the \ndevelopmental boat proposed from a defense contractor in 2002, and the \nU.S. Navy was required to accept the project and the bid and deploy it \nto the seas for field engagement, even though it never proved \neconomically worthwhile.\n  How about a James Bond boat, $4.5 million, three of them?\n  A high-altitude airship. The President knows something about this. \nThe Missile Defense Agency did not request funding for this program. As \na matter of fact, they said they canceled the program called the high-\naltitude airship because of capability limitations. Yet we continue to \nspend at least $1 million a year every year on that program because \nsomebody wants it. Some constituent, some moneyed interest, somebody \nwho might employ 20 or 30 people wants it. Somebody wants it, so we \nhave to look good.\n  How about the American Embassy in Iraq, $592 million? We know a good \n20 percent of it is pure waste. We have seen the fraud. We have seen \nthe reports. We know what is going on there. Have we cut back the \namount of money? Have we limited the amount of money on it? No. We \noffered an amendment and couldn't get it done.\n  How about USAID in Afghanistan, $5.68 billion spent for schools. In \nthe first snow, the roofs collapsed on them. Did we do anything about \nit? No, we hired the contractor to do more stuff on a cost-plus basis.\n  How about hospital clinics that were supposedly built, except after \nwe paid for them, the Afghanistan Government told us they didn't build \nthem. How do we let that happen? That is us. That isn't the \nbureaucracy; that is us. We are letting it happen. We are allowing it.\n  We spend $20 billion on Federal AIDS programs and what we know is \nlots of it gets wasted. We know there is widespread deficiencies within \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the HIV prevention \nprogram. Those are not my words; that is the HHS inspector general.\n  Two million dollars was embezzled at the San Juan AIDS Institute. NIH \nis spending $120 million right now on a vaccine program. The starter of \nthat program and the major scientists who started it said it will not \nwork, and they are not contributing, but we continue to spend $120 \nmillion on a program everybody in science knows is not going to work, \nbut we are doing it.\n  By the way, we spent $300,000 or $400,000 on HIV Vaccine Awareness \nDay, and we don't even have a vaccine. It is important we spend it, but \nwe cannot get rid of it because somebody objects.\n  AIDS housing, millions of dollars wasted.\n  Here is my favorite. How about $1 million paid to dead farmers? A \nbillion, I am sorry, a billion dollars paid to dead farmers for their \ncrops. They are dead. We are continuing to pay them, up to 15 years \nsome of them. It is the only program you can continue to collect after \nyou are dead, and yet we have an Agriculture Department that allows \nthat to happen.\n  How about this--this is great--the National Park Service centennial \ncelebration. We are going to spend $100 million in a time when our \ndeficit is $607 billion, our debt $10 trillion, and our unfunded \nliabilities are $7 trillion, and we are going to spend $100 million to \ncelebrate our national parks? That doesn't pass the smell test. Nobody \nis sitting around their dinner table tonight saying if we are ever in \nthe kind of shape we are in, we ought to be doing that.\n  How about $100 million for the conventions that we did under \nemergency funding? We spent $100 million, everybody's money, for each \ncity so we could have the conventions in Denver and Minneapolis.\n  The other interesting thing about the national parks is it doesn't \nturn 100 until 2016, 8 years from now, but we are going to spend the \nmoney.\n  How about a $30 billion subsidy to Amtrak? Amtrak started with a \nsubsidy and was supposed to get better. We continue to not hold them \naccountable. How about a $244 million subsidy for food on Amtrak? Maybe \nwe want to continue to have Amtrak. Maybe it is worth it to us to have \na $1.5 billion subsidy every year on Amtrak. I would agree with that. \nMaybe that is the right priority. But should we be subsidizing a \nquarter of a million dollars a year for people's food on Amtrak? But we \nare.\n  Other items--essential air service to small communities that are \nwithin driving distance of another community, we are going to spend \n$110 million this year. How about the fact that we are going to pay \nFederal employees $250 million to ride the transit? Nobody else in this \ncountry gets paid to ride the transit. Nobody else gets their transit \nbills paid. But Federal employees, we are going to take a quarter of a \nbillion dollars every year, and we are going to say to some of the best \npaid, best benefited workers in the country that we are going to give \nyou a quarter of a billion dollars in subsidy so you will ride the \ntransit. Well, economics will tell them to ride the transit. The \nAmerican taxpayer shouldn't do that.\n\n  Well, I am wearing thin, I know, my colleagues, and so I will stop \nand enter into the Record the remaining 50 pages of examples I have of \nstupidity for which we are responsible. The real important thing to \nkeep in mind, if you have been listening to this, is that we are on an \nunsustainable course, that, in fact, a child born today is going to \ninherit something different from what we did. We inherited opportunity. \nThey are going to inherit debt. We inherited a leadership and a \nheritage that says you sacrifice for the next generation. They are \ngoing to inherit a legacy that says you kick the next generation in the \nteeth.\n  Everything I have outlined today is something we could have \ncontrolled, we as Members of the Senate, but we are so busy doing \nearmarks that we don't do any oversight. Now, what I just outlined to \nthis body is what my staff has discovered in 3 years. Think what would \nhappen if all of us were aggressively oversighting every agency of the \nFederal Government. Think how efficient it would be. Think how much \nwaste wouldn't be there. Think about what a great deal we would be \ndoing for these kids.\n  America expects us to tighten our belt. They expect us to do what \nthey are having to do right now. They are tired of our wasteful \nspending, they are tired of our earmarks, and they are tired of our \nbridges to nowhere. We better listen. There is a rumble, and if we \ndon't listen, it is our own fault that we will continue to decline in \nesteem in front of the American people. We will have well earned it.\n  So the next time somebody says they want to raise your taxes, ask \nthem how\n\n[[Page S1901]]\n\nmuch of that they got rid of before they do it. We don't have a \nshortage of money. We have a shortage of courage. We have a shortage of \ncharacter. We have a shortage of intensity to solve the real problems \nthat are facing this country. And until we tackle this, we should not \nsay one thing to anybody in this country about increased taxes. It is \nmorally reprehensible, it violates our oath, and most of all, it does \ngreat damage to our country.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the examples that I referred to be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n     Homeland Security Funds for Fish Fries and Spaghetti Dinners\n       Indiana homeland security officials warned one county in \n     2006 to stop using electronic emergency message boards to \n     advertise fish fries, spaghetti dinners and other events. \n     Homeland Security, which bought the 11 signs for $300,000, \n     said the county could risk losing Federal money. The Newport \n     Chemical Depot, which is considered a potential terrorist \n     target, is located in the same county in western Indiana. In \n     the case of an evacuation, the signs could flash routes for \n     drivers to take. The message boards also could be used during \n     floods or other natural disasters. Using them for ads \n     violates federal rules and could dull the public's \n     attentiveness to the boards, said the executive director of \n     the Indiana Department of Homeland Security.\n     Department of Homeland Security Grants\n       There isn't a training program out there that DHS doesn't \n     like to fund. Overlap and duplication abounds within FEMA's \n     office of Grants and Training and the multiple grant programs \n     it manages that fund counter-terrorism training for State and \n     local first responders. One of these programs, the \n     Demonstration, Training, Grant Program, has received $63.6 \n     million from 2004 to 2007 and has awarded 29 grants ranging \n     from $750,000 to $6.5 million. However, despite this \n     considerable investment by the American taxpayers, as of \n     2007, none of the training programs developed using \n     Demonstration Training Grant funding have been deployed for \n     use. In addition, some of the programs appear to duplicate \n     other training programs provided both within DHS and with \n     counter-terrorism training programs provided through other \n     Federal agencies. Even the Administration saw that continuing \n     to fund this program was a waste of money. The President did \n     not request funding for the Demonstration Training Program in \n     fiscal years 2007 and 2008 yet Congress chose to continue \n     funding the program, giving it $30 million in 2007 and $28 \n     million in 2008.\n     DHS--Customs and Border Protection Request a Shopping Trip\n       The Department of Homeland Security recently requested that \n     a training conference be located within walking distance of a \n     major shopping center. According to a solicitation notice \n     from the Department of Homeland Security Customs and Border \n     Protection (CBP), the federal agency ``desires a hotel \n     located within walking distance of (or short courtesy van \n     trip) a major shopping mall which includes multiple \n     significant department stores and/or the Tanger Outlet mall \n     (near exit 213), for the convenience of the participants/\n     guests'' of an upcoming training conference. The notice also \n     states that ``Contractor shall provide/or assist with local \n     transportation to/from local eateries and shopping, within \n     the surrounding areas of Contractor's establishment, to \n     include major mall and/or Tanger Outlet Mall.''\n     Interoperable Communications Grant Programs\n       There are currently two identical grant programs in the \n     federal government that fund interoperable communications, \n     with one housed at the Federal Emergency Management Agency \n     within DHS, and the other at the Department of Commerce. The \n     Interoperable, Communications Grant Program operated by FEMA \n     was created in 2007 and authorized to spend 3.3 billion, \n     while the Public Safety Interoperable Communications Grant \n     Program at Commerce was created in 2005 and authorized to \n     distribute $1 billion. Both programs are identical in every \n     possible way except for their authorized funding levels and \n     the Departments in which they are located. To further \n     highlight the duplication, it should be noted that the \n     Department of Commerce contracted with FEMA to administer its \n     program, meaning both identical programs are being \n     administered by the same agency. Various public safety \n     organizations commented that having two identical programs \n     simply created confusion and wasted resources. A Coburn \n     amendment was filed last year to combine both programs by \n     eliminating the Commerce program and adding it's funding to \n     the FEMA program, but the amendment was voted down by the \n     full Senate.\n\n                                Katrina\n\n     Katrina Waste\n       FEMA's Individuals and Households Program (IHP), provides \n     direct assistance (temporary housing units) and financial \n     assistance (grant funding for temporary housing and other \n     disaster-related needs) to eligible individuals affected by \n     disasters. A September 2006 Government Accountability Report \n     found that management of the IHP program in response to \n     Hurricanes Katrina and Rita resulted in as much as $1.4 \n     billion in improper and potentially fraudulent payments due \n     to invalid registration data. In addition, duplicate payments \n     were made and FEMA lacked accountability for the debit cards \n     (each with a $2,000 spending amount) that were given to \n     disaster victims. Examples of abuse included the purchase of \n     a $200 bottle of Dom Perignon champagne at a San Antonio \n     Hooters restaurant, payment for divorces, a sex changes \n     operation, luxury handbags, a Caribbean vacation, \n     professional football tickets, and adult entertainment. And \n     because of FEMA's notoriously bad financial controls and \n     reporting after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, these are likely \n     only a fraction of the total cost of mismanaging this \n     program.\n\n                             Miscellaneous\n\n     Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission\n       The Commission was authorized in FY 2002 to create \n     education programs, public forums and arts projects to \n     provide an opportunity to re-examine what it means to be \n     American in the 21st century finding unity in our diversity. \n     ``The Bicentennial commemoration of his [Lincoln's] life and \n     legacy will be a bright beacon to completing our nation's \n     `unfinished work.''` The Bicentennial celebration will \n     culminate in a Washington DC ``Bicentennial Birthday Gala'' \n     with a ``world class concert and entertainment special'' in \n     DC with ``nineteenth century popular and patriotic music'' \n     being performed by ``outstanding military bands.'' The \n     Birthday Gala will be followed by a Lincoln Memorial \n     Rededication with a ``memorable public program.'' \n     Additionally, a Joint Meeting of Congress will take place in \n     the U.S. Capitol's Statuary Hall. After a keynote address by \n     a political leader or ``senior Lincoln historian'', guests \n     will proceed to lunch at the library. So far, all the \n     planning and arranging of these and other national activities \n     has cost the American taxpayer $2.95 million.\n     Inspector General Investigation of an Employment Training \n         Grant\n       The inspector general for the Department of Labor issued a \n     scathing report in February 28 highlighting more than $11 \n     million in improper expenditures by the Consortium for Worker \n     Education (CWE). The grant for CWE was issued to provide \n     employment services to participants and employers impacted by \n     the events of September 11, 2001. According to the inspector \n     general, ``CWE reported it registered 24,195 enrolled \n     participants, but only documented 20,513 registered \n     participants of which 366 were ineligible and 115 were \n     missing support documentation.'' Labor department \n     investigators also found that ``Federal requirements were not \n     followed when charging costs to the grant'' and that four out \n     of five of the program's reported outcome measures could not \n     even be audited. The inspector general also noted that it may \n     be forced to recover $13 million from the grant if CWE does \n     not adequately justify its expenditures and accounting \n     methods.\n     NOAA's Totally Bogus Taxpayer Funded Birthday Bash\n       In June 2007, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration (NOAA) announced that it planned to spend \n     scarce taxpayer resources on a ``200 year anniversary \n     celebration.'' The announcement was especially odd given that \n     NOAA was only 37 years old at the time. According to the \n     department's website, ``[T]hroughout the year, NOAA will be \n     hosting an array of events around the country to celebrate \n     the agency's 200-year history.'' Events listed included a \n     Washington, D.C. gala, a reception for .members of Congress, \n     a festival and concert at Hawaii's Waikiki beach park, \n     outreach at the Iowa State Fair, and other activities. Oddly \n     enough, the department's website also stated that ``during \n     2000, NOAA celebrated its 30th anniversary as a federal \n     agency[.]'' A series of costly celebrations were also held \n     that year in honor of the ``anniversary.'' According to NOAA, \n     the total cost of the bogus 200th birthday bash was nearly \n     $1.6 million.\n     Low-Income Legal Aid Wasted on Chauffeurs, Lavish Meals and \n         Foreign Trips\n       A 2006 investigation of the Legal Services Corporation by \n     the Associated Press found that the agency's executives \n     wasted taxpayer money on chocolate desserts, $400 chauffeured \n     rides to locations within cab distance from their offices, \n     and luxury office space in ``Washington's tony Georgetown \n     district.'' Although the Legal Services Corporation, which \n     was created to provide legal assistance to low-income \n     Americans, turns away half its applicants for lack of \n     resources, it still found plenty of ways to spend money on \n     lavish items. In one instance, the agency's board members \n     even gave themselves meal allowances that doubled the amounts \n     given to other staff. Other extravagant expenditures found by \n     the Associated Press include a $59 three-entree buffet, an \n     $18 breakfast featuring scrambled eggs with chives, a $28 \n     deli buffet, and $14 ``Death by Chocolate'' desserts. Total \n     cost?\n     EPA Grant for a Caribbean Shopping Trip\n       In 2007, the inspector general for the Environmental \n     Protection Agency (EPA) found that the agency spent $356,012 \n     to send Philadelphia high school students on a shopping trip \n     to the U.S. Virgin Islands. According to the trip agendas, \n     the U.S. students were to take a kayak tour, attend a \n     lecture, and visit a camp in the Virgin Islands. The agency \n     spent $261,590 to pay for students in the Virgin Islands to \n     travel to Philadelphia. The inspector general wrote in its \n     report on the\n\n[[Page S1902]]\n\n     grant that ``[t]he U.S. students also visited Coral World \n     Ocean Park and resort locations, while both groups took \n     shopping trips.'' Although the grant was supposed to promote \n     environmental stewardship, a majority of money for the grant \n     (52 percent) was spent on travel, and less than half the time \n     of the trips was spent on environmental-related activities. \n     The grant was also used to purchase 128 computers that met \n     only general education needs that were not even part of EPA's \n     mission.\n     Smithsonian Director\n       According to an investigation by the Washington Post, the \n     director of the Smithsonian Museum of the American Indian \n     spent $250,000 in taxpayer money on ``first-class \n     transportation and plush lodging in hotels all around the \n     world, including more than a dozen trips to Paris.'' A \n     separate investigation found that another top Smithsonian \n     official accumulated nearly $90,000 in unauthorized expenses \n     between 2000 and 2005. His expenses included ``charges for \n     jet travel, his wife's trip to Cambodia, hotel rooms, luxury \n     car service, catered staff meals and expensive gifts.'' The \n     Smithsonian inspector general found that a few months after \n     this Smithsonian head took office, he stopped filing the \n     required monthly documentation ``for administrative ease.''\n     Government Printing Office, Daily Printing of the \n         Congressional Record\n       The Government Printing Office prints approximately 5,600 \n     copies of the Congressional Record for each day Congress is \n     in session. This cost the American taxpayer over $6.5 million \n     annually. Of the 5,600 copies printed daily, over 1,400 are \n     distributed to House offices, Committees and post offices, \n     over 1,500 are distributed to Senate offices and Committees, \n     and the remaining copies are distributed to various sources, \n     including federal agencies and federal depository libraries \n     all at the taxpayers' expense. The daily Congressional Record \n     is available online and previous Congressional Records are \n     available online dating back to 1989. Instead of accepting \n     that we live in an increasingly paperless world and stopping \n     the wasteful printing of the Congressional Record, we would \n     rather just continue big spending as usual by throwing \n     millions of dollars and tons of paper in the waste basket.\n     ECHO Center\n       $97,000 was appropriated in the 2008 Omnibus for the ECHO \n     Center in Burlington, VT, for education regarding the Lake \n     Champlain Quadracentennial. According to its Website, the \n     ECHO Center, also known as the Ecology, Culture, History, and \n     Opportunity at the Leahy Center, is a lake aquarium, science \n     center, and community resource. Its purpose is to ``educate \n     and delight people about the Ecology, Culture, History, and \n     Opportunities for stewardship of the Lake Champlain Basin.'' \n     To complete the ECHO center, a $14.5 million ten-year \n     fundraising campaign was necessary. According to its Website, \n     more than half of the funds for this campaign came from the \n     federal government. The Lake Champlain Basin Science Center--\n     the non-profit organization that runs ECHO--listed a total of \n     more than $12 million in assets at the close of the 2005 \n     fiscal year and has received more than $4.4 million in \n     federal grants since 2000--including more than $600,000 last \n     year. It is expected that the quadracentennial will bring in \n     revenues of up to $133 million. In light of these estimates \n     why is further federal investment outside of the competitive \n     bidding process for an educational exhibit regarding this \n     special event necessary? The fact that numerous other \n     educational and heritage-related initiatives already exist, \n     or are being pursued on the state and local level makes this \n     request for additional federal funds unnecessary and \n     duplicative. Given that the ECHO center has already spent \n     over $7 million in federal taxpayer funds on national \n     priorities such as becoming the first LEED-certified building \n     in Vermont, and offering a water-play space for kids to build \n     dams and float boats, and that its net assets total more than \n     $12 million, the federal taxpayer may be forgiven for \n     thinking this is a poor investment of federal funds.\n     DOT--Museum of Glass\n       In FY 2006, Congress gave $500,000 to the Museum of Glass \n     in Tacoma, Washington. The mission of the museum is to \n     provide a dynamic learning environment to appreciate the \n     medium of glass through creative experiences, collections and \n     exhibitions. The museum showcases works by internationally \n     known artists who illuminate trends in contemporary art, \n     highlighting glass within a full range of media. The Museum \n     of Glass has featured exhibits in Mining Glass, which \n     showcases the work of eight internationally distinguished \n     contemporary artists working with glass, as well as Czech \n     Glass from the 1945-1980 period. The museum also features \n     live glassmaking in the Hot Shop Amphitheater and dining in \n     the Gallucci's Glass Cafe.\n     Beach Nourishment for Imperial Beach and other Beaches\n       An earmark included in the Water Resources Development Act \n     of 2007 authorized $8.5 million for current beach nourishment \n     for Imperial Beach in Southern California and federal funding \n     for periodic beach nourishment every ten years for a period \n     of 50 years for an estimated cost of $20,550,000 in \n     federal funds. Such ``nourishment,'' however, is not \n     essential and does not merit siphoning funds away from \n     higher priority Corps projects, such as protecting the \n     thousands living in the Sacramento valley who are still at \n     risk of catastrophic flooding. The White House Statement \n     of Administration Policy urged eliminating funding for \n     beach nourishment in WRDA and President Clinton also \n     sought to discourage federal beach nourishment projects. \n     Adding sand to beaches, at best, provides a temporary fix \n     to local erosion concerns that could potentially lead to \n     property damage and encourages risky development and \n     construction along shorelines at federal taxpayer expense. \n     The $1.2 billion wasted through beach restoration federal \n     appropriations from 1995-2005 could have been spent on \n     other federal priorities or gone to pay off our growing \n     national debt.\n     Wake Ferry, WA\n       $1.54 million was appropriated in the 2008 Omnibus for the \n     Kitsap Transit, Rich-Passage Wake Impact Study. ``[This] \n     study . . . is working to finalize the design plans and \n     specifications for a high speed passenger ferry service \n     between Bremerton and Seattle. The funding will be used to \n     study the response of the sands and gravels on the beaches \n     along the route through Rich Passage, biological monitoring \n     and analysis, financial feasibility analysis and public \n     outreach including a website and newsletter. The funds will \n     also include the use of an existing foil assisted catamaran \n     to simulate actual operating conditions of a designed boat so \n     that potential impacts, if any, can be assessed and \n     appropriate measures can be taken to protect the shoreline.'' \n     In total $7.79 million has been appropriated for this study \n     along with $4 million for earmarks for a ``low-wake, \n     passenger-only ferry.'' Both of these projects have been \n     almost entirely federally-funded during a time when the \n     Kitsap Transit Authority moved into a new 45,000 sq. ft \n     office and retail complex that offers stunning water and \n     mountain views. Not to worry, though, they can be assured \n     that their taxpayer dollars have created the ``lowest-wake \n     boat in the world'' when it hits the water. While \n     environmentally-friendly high-speed ferries may be convenient \n     and provide greater economic opportunities for certain \n     communities, they are not national priorities and should not \n     be funded by federal taxpayer dollars until more pressing \n     national infrastructure concerns are addressed.\n     Bangor Waterfront, ME\n       $262,500 was earmarked in the 2008 Omnibus for development \n     of the Bangor Waterfront Park on the Penobscot River for the \n     city of Bangor, ME. Federal funding for developing this \n     waterfront exceeds $4.5 million through various earmarks, \n     grants, and contracts. ``The park will be the centerpiece of \n     Bangor's waterfront destination for local and regional \n     populations and out-of-state tourists alike. It will provide \n     several venues for outdoor performances including the \n     American Folk Festival. The park will complete long-term \n     efforts to acquire, clear, remediate, and redevelop Bangor's \n     historic waterfront.'' Playgrounds, a fitness area for \n     adults, a trail system, and a picnic area are things that the \n     community is expecting to see on the waterfront. These \n     regional desires, however, should not be prioritized over \n     national infrastructure needs like deficient federal bridges.\n     Chesapeake Buoy\n       $446,500 was appropriated in the 2008 omnibus for an \n     interpretive buoy system along the Captain John Smith \n     Chesapeake National Historic Trail. The purpose of the buoys \n     is to ``promote awareness of the Bay's condition, and to \n     support the stewardship efforts of educators, trail users, \n     government, and civic organizations dedicated to the \n     preservation of the Bay and its natural environment.'' This \n     buoy system will ``mark'' the newly created John Smith \n     National Water Trail on the Chesapeake Bay. The ``water \n     trail'' is the first entirely water-based National \n     Historic Trail. The recipient of this earmark is the \n     Conservation Fund of Arlington, Virginia; and other \n     partners of this project include the National Geographic \n     Society, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Sultana, Verizon, \n     and others. The Conservation Fund is listed as having net \n     assets totaling more than $275 million and has received \n     over $23 million in federal funds since 2000, according to \n     FedSpending.org. The Chesapeake Bay Foundation, which has \n     encouraged the creation of this NPS trail, boasts just \n     under $70 million in net assets and had a revenue surplus \n     of $7 million in 2005 alone. The National Geographic \n     Society reported an income of $531,595,929 with over \n     $45,000,000 in profits and total assets of $1,127,705,462 \n     in 2005. Promoting tourism in the Chesapeake Bay and \n     increasing understanding of the historic voyages of \n     Captain Smith are well intentioned goals but are clearly \n     not urgent, federal priorities. Likewise interactive buoys \n     may be innovative ways to educate tourists and visitors \n     about the Bay and Captain Smith's voyages, but they are \n     inessential extravagances. Fortunately, the organizations \n     that are heading up this effort, including the recipient \n     of the earmark, have sufficient financial assets to ensure \n     the continuation of this project.\n     Earmarks for relatives\n       According to a recent investigation by USA Today, in 2006 \n     ``lobbying groups employed 30 family members to influence \n     spending bills that their relatives with ties to the House \n     and Senate appropriations committees oversaw or helped \n     write.'' 2006 appropriations bills contained $750 million for \n     projects championed by these lobbyists. Of\n\n[[Page S1903]]\n\n     the 53 relatives or former top aides to lawmakers on the \n     powerful appropriations committees working at lobbying firms \n     last year, 30 lobbied the legislator or the legislator's top \n     aide for appropriations that the Member oversaw. Of those 30, \n     22 succeeded in their quest to insert specific earmarks in \n     appropriations bills. That incredible rate of success--almost \n     75 percent--explains why lobbyists with personal ties to \n     Members have been in high demand. Projects procured with the \n     help of such lobbyists have included $1.5 million for an \n     underground facility in a cavern that would be used to \n     protect financial information, $2 million for an earmark not \n     requested by the Department of Defense for a company that \n     produces armor products that gave nearly $11,000 to the \n     sponsor of the earmark, $1.28 million to widen a road near an \n     upscale shopping center the earmark's sponsor helped to \n     develop, and the creation of a fish marketing board that has \n     received tens of millions in federal earmarks and whose \n     initial chairman was related to the earmark sponsor. Ethics \n     rules that do not prohibit this clear conflict of interest \n     that borders on the corrupt enable such wasteful and \n     inappropriate spending to occur at the cost of the American \n     taxpayer.\n     ITBC\n       The InterTribal Bison Cooperative's (ITBC) bison \n     restoration program has received $8.2 million in federal \n     earmarks since 2000. ITBC seeks to ``restor[e] buffalo to \n     Indian Country, to preserve [the Indian] historical, \n     cultural, traditional and spiritual relationship for future \n     generations.'' ITBC members also claim that ITBC enables \n     Native Americans to eat more buffalo meet, which is healthier \n     than other forms of meat. President Bush has repeatedly \n     attempted to eliminate this program because it is not central \n     to the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) core missions or \n     responsibilities. BIA has concerns with the management of the \n     program, as of the roughly $4 million in funding appropriated \n     in 2006, less than $1 million was directed to individual \n     tribal projects. Specifically, out of the almost $4 million \n     funded by taxpayers, only $859,180 was distributed to 15 \n     tribes for bison projects. A total of $3,127,782 was left for \n     ITBC administration and technical assistance; meaning that \n     for every one dollar allocated to the ITBC, 27 cents went to \n     bison projects. Furthermore, despite an increase in \n     funding of $1,786,962 in for fiscal year 2006, only an \n     additional $30 was allocated to bison projects (previously \n     spread among 21 tribes). These funds would be better spent \n     on providing necessary Indian health services. More than \n     $8 million has been wasted on this program.\n     HUD--International Peace Garden\n       The Fiscal Year 2008 appropriations bill for the Department \n     of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) included a provision \n     directing $450,000 to renovate facilities at the \n     International Peace Garden in Dunseith, ND. The International \n     Peace Garden is a 2,339 acre botanical garden on the U.S. and \n     Canadian borders of North Dakota and Manitoba, created in \n     1932 as a symbol of friendship between the two nations. \n     According to the garden's website, ``Reflecting pools and \n     dazzling colorful floral displays of over 150,000 flowers \n     splash across the grounds of the Formal Garden's terraced \n     walkways.'' While the International Peace Garden center may \n     stand a symbol of the friendship between the United States \n     and Canada, renovation is not essential, especially when it \n     is estimated there are 700,000 homeless persons living in the \n     U.S. According to HUD's website: ``HUD's mission is to \n     increase homeownership, support community development and \n     increase access to affordable housing free from \n     discrimination.'' Nearly half a million dollars for facility \n     renovations to the International Peace Garden does not appear \n     to advance this mission.\n     Cleveland-based Head Start provider accused of pocketing $7.5 \n         million for poor children it did not serve\n       Head Start is a national program that promotes school \n     readiness by enhancing the social and cognitive development \n     of children through the provision of educational, health, \n     nutritional, social and other services to enrolled children \n     and families. A recent state audit accused a Cleveland-based \n     Head Start provider of pocketing $7.5 million for poor \n     children it did not serve. The audit, says the Ministerial \n     Day Care Association was paid for 5,162 children in 1998 \n     through 2000, but could only document serving 3,415 \n     youngsters. It's the second major finding against the \n     Ministerial Day Care Association, which was accused in a 2002 \n     state audit of wrongly collecting $3.8 million in taxpayer \n     dollars. The State no longer funds the agency, but the group \n     still collects Federal Head Start money as well as funding \n     from the Council for Economic Opportunity in Cleveland, Ohio.\n     Duplication--Early Education\n       In 2000, the Government Accountability Office published a \n     report titled, ``Early Education and Care: Overlap Indicates \n     Need to Assess Crosscutting Programs.'' The report identified \n     duplicative programs providing education or care for children \n     under the age of 5. The GAO report found 69 early education \n     programs administered by 9 different agencies. GAO revisited \n     this report in 2005, and found that the landscape of federal \n     programs remained largely the same as in 2000. Five years \n     after the original GAO report warned that a large number of \n     programs creates the potential for inefficient service and \n     difficulty accessing services, GAO found 69 early education \n     programs exist, the same number as in 2000, but the programs \n     are now administered by 10 different agencies. During the 5 \n     years between GAO reports, 16 programs were removed from the \n     list, and 16 were added back.\n     HHS--Four Federal Agencies Sponsor Conference at Walt Disney \n         World\n       A three-day, expense-paid trip to Walt Disney World Resorts \n     sound like a dream vacation--but it's not. It's research, \n     according to four federal agencies who sponsored a conference \n     in Orlando, Florida. The 2007 Academy Health Research Meeting \n     was held at the Walt Disney World Swan and Dolphin resort \n     in Orlando, Florida. The posh resort boasts ``an \n     environment of elegance and opulence'' featuring ``the \n     beauty and tranquility of waterways and tropical \n     landscaping.'' Federal sponsors included the Agency for \n     Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the Centers for \n     Medicare and Medicaid Services, the National Center for \n     Health Statistics, and the Health Services Research and \n     Development Service of the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n     USDA--Goose Poop Cleanup\n       For 3 consecutive years (Fiscal Years 2004 through 2006) \n     Congress has appropriated money for the ``Goose Control \n     Program.'' The Goose Control Program uses humane methods to \n     stop Canadian geese from ruining parks and fields in New \n     York. Canadian geese in Long Island, NY pose a year- round \n     problem, destroying golf courses, parks and fields at \n     important public facilities. The Goose Control Program \n     partners with ``GeesePeace,'' an organization using \n     environmentally-safe and non-lethal methods to reduce the \n     number of geese and redirect them away from public places.\n     USDA--Imiloa Astronomy Center in Hawaii\n       Last year, Congress gave NASA $1.5 million to fund the \n     Imiloa Astronomy Center. The Imiloa Astronomy Center is \n     located on a nine-acre campus above the University of Hawaii-\n     Hilo, and according to the website, features interactive \n     exhibits, planetarium shows, group tours, a store and a cafe \n     for visitors to explore the connections between Hawaiian \n     cultural traditions and the science of astronomy. The center \n     was formerly called the ``Mauna Kea Astronomy Education \n     Center'' and has received more than $30 million in federal \n     funding since FY 1999.\n     USDA--Subterranean Termite Research\n       The Department of Agriculture gives funding to scientists \n     to develop and implement alternative methods to control and \n     prevent termite damage to homes and other structures. The \n     scientists devise and test control methods that are \n     consistent with public health and environmental safety in \n     warm weather states. Supporters argue that with increasing \n     environmental concerns, especially ozone depletion due to \n     fumigation control methods, as well as concerns for public \n     health and safety, there is a continuing need to develop safe \n     methods to control this devastating pest.\n     The National Science Foundation\n       The National Science Foundation is an independent federal \n     agency created by Congress in 1950 to promote the progress of \n     science. With an annual budget of about $6.06 billion, NSF is \n     the major source of federal backing in many fields such as \n     mathematics, computer science and the social sciences. The \n     NSF website features the ``Discoveries'' made possible with \n     NSF funding and support, including:\n       Helpful Robot Alters Family Life: Robotic vacuums are \n     warming their way into homes and even taking on a personality \n     for some families.\n       The Smell of Money: Research suggests an absence of \n     metallic chemicals in the strong metallic odors that result \n     from people handling coins and other metals.\n       Company Name Influences Stock Performance: Easy to \n     pronounce names perform better in stock markets.\n       Monkey Business: The discovery of capuchin monkeys in the \n     wild using stones as nutcrackers may tell us something about \n     the monkeys' ingenuity, and more about ourselves.\n       The Implications of Making Care-Giving Robots Lifelike: \n     Robots designed to help the elderly may be given the ability \n     to interact in human-like ways but what are the implications \n     of doing this?\n     Advanced Technology Program\n       The Advanced Technology Program (ATP) was created in 1988 \n     to increase our country's global competitiveness by investing \n     in businesses and ideas that could not attract private \n     investment. Instead of promoting successful business \n     initiatives, however, the program quickly became a vehicle \n     for wasteful corporate welfare. For example, such struggling \n     small businesses as GE, IBM, and Motorola have received \n     hundreds of millions of dollars from this federal program. A \n     Government Accountability Office study of the program even \n     found it ``unlikely that ATP can avoid funding research \n     already being pursued by the private sector[.]'' And \n     according to the Program Assessment Rating Tool developed by \n     the Office of Management and Budget, ATP does not address a \n     specific need and is not even designed to make a unique \n     contribution. Between 1990 and 2004, the program spent over \n     $2 billion on various investments of dubious value. Last \n     year, instead of addressing the core problems within the \n     federal program, Congress just chose to tinker around its \n     edges and give it a new name.\n     HHS--Head Start\n       The Head Start program was established in 1965 to promote \n     the school readiness of low-\n\n[[Page S1904]]\n\n     income children. In 2005, GAO issued a report that raised \n     concerns about the effectiveness of the Department of Health \n     and Human Services (HHS) Administration for Children and \n     Families' (ACF) oversight of about 1,600 local organizations \n     that receive nearly $7 billion in Head Start grants. The \n     report found that among other program risks, ACF made limited \n     use of financial reports and audits to ensure that all \n     grantees effectively resolved financial management problems. \n     ACF had also made little use of its authority to terminate \n     grantees that did not meet program requirements and fund new \n     grantees to replace them. A GAO report released just last \n     month found that ACF has not undertaken a comprehensive \n     assessment of risks to the federal Head Start program, \n     despite the 2005 recommendation. The report stated, ``In \n     light of federal budget limitations and increasing \n     expectations for program accountability, ACF's ability to \n     demonstrate effective stewardship over billions of dollars in \n     Head Start grants has never been more critical.''\n     Working for America Institute\n       The Department of Labor's Working for America Institute \n     (WFA) was originally funded through the Workforce Investment \n     Act in 1998 which revised job training laws and set up \n     systems of local and state ``Workforce Investment Boards.'' \n     WFA and other organizations were funded across the country to \n     help the new Boards develop their capacity to implement WIA. \n     The Department of Labor phased out the capacity building \n     programs in 2003 after they determined that the Boards had \n     enough capacity and experience with WIA implementation and \n     that funding should instead go to actual service delivery for \n     job training programs. DOL also found that the assistance \n     provided by WFA was duplicative and less effective than \n     similar programs already funded through DOL's Employment and \n     Training Administration which has the primary mission of \n     administering federal job training programs. Despite the \n     duplication and ineffectiveness, WFA received $3.5 million \n     in Congressional funding from 2004-2007.\n     Small Business Child Care Grants\n       This brand new program directs the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services to establish grants to assist states in \n     providing funds to encourage the establishment and operation \n     of employer-operated child-care programs. The program is \n     unnecessary and duplicative. HHS already administers the \n     Child Care and Development Fund which consists of two block \n     grants totaling more than $5 billion annually available to \n     States for providing child care to low income workers. \n     Additionally, states can transfer funds from their TANF block \n     grants for child care assistance. In FY06 States transferred \n     more than $1.8 billion from TANF for child care and could \n     have transferred even more since States left $2.15 billion \n     unspent in their TANF accounts. Another HHS program available \n     to states for various purposes including child care \n     assistance is the Social Services Block Grant. Child care \n     assistance routinely ranks in the top 5 uses for the grant \n     with states spending about $1.7 billion annually on child \n     care assistance. Despite the billions of HHS grant dollars \n     already available and utilized by States for child care \n     assistance, the Small Business Child Care Grant program was \n     funded by Congress at $5 million in 2007.\n     Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial Commission\n       The Commission was authorized in FY2000 to create an \n     enduring Eisenhower National Memorial in the nation's \n     capital. The Commission selected a site for the Memorial and \n     won Congressional approval in 2006. The memorial site is near \n     the Department of Education which was originally created by \n     Ike within the ``Department of Health, Education and \n     Welfare'' which later split into HHS and Department of \n     Education. The Commission's next step is to select a design \n     for the memorial. Since 2000, Congress has allocated $6.35 \n     million to the still unfinished project.\n       Community Development Block Grants. The Community \n     Development Block Grant, or CDBG, program is a $3.87 billion \n     program housed at the Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development. CDBG transfers federal funds to certain local \n     governments for broad uses such as housing, so-called \n     ``economic development'' activities, social services, and \n     infrastructure. CDBG has insufficient accountability, \n     ambiguous goals, untargeted funding and no standardized \n     outcome indicators. The CDBG formulas used to disperse the \n     funding have not been updated since the late 1970's. As a \n     result, many wealthy communities receive 3-4 times more CDBG \n     funds per capita than many poor communities. As one example \n     of unfair targeting, in 2005, Temple, TX had an average \n     $20,000 per capita income and received $15 per capita in CDBG \n     funds. Meanwhile, wealthy Oak Park, IL averaged $36,000 per \n     capita income and received $39 per capita from the program. \n     Portions of CDBG are used by Appropriators to carve out \n     earmarks for things like aquariums, speed skating rinks, ski \n     chalets, whitewater rapid training centers, boat houses and \n     parking garages. Since 2005, the total cost of these earmarks \n     ranged from $180 to $350 million. During the past 3 years, \n     the Inspector General has audited a miniscule number of CDBG \n     grantees and yet found more than $100 million in waste, fraud \n     and abuse of CDBG funds. If the Inspector General had the \n     resources to comprehensively audit the program, the total \n     waste and abuse of funds could be many times greater.\n       TV Converter Box Coupon Program. The Department of Commerce \n     TV Converter Box Coupon Program was established in 2005 to \n     help people pay for the equipment they would need to keep \n     their televisions working once all broadcast signals convert \n     to a digital format next year. Starting in January  of this \n     year, every household in America became eligible to \n     request up to two $40 coupons from the Dept. of Commerce \n     to pay for converter boxes for their televisions. \n     Columnist George Will, outraged by Congress' willingness \n     to turn television into an entitlement, dubbed the \n     provision that created this program the ``No Couch Potato \n     Left Behind Act.'' Ironically, the $3 billion that was \n     authorized for this program came out of the ``Deficit \n     Reduction Act,'' though it will do nothing but add to the \n     deficit. Even though the administration is only requesting \n     $130 million for FY2009, this program is wasteful in any \n     amount because it uses taxpayer money to pay for private \n     television use at a time of deficit spending.\n       Official Time for Unions. Federal employees are allowed \n     under current law to do union work while on the clock for \n     their federal government job--this is known as ``official \n     time.'' Between 2002-2004 federal employees consumed 13.6 \n     million hours of official time to do union work, which is \n     equivalent to more than 6,500 full-time work years over that \n     time. Incidentally, there are numerous reports of federal \n     employees who do no work for their employing agencies at all, \n     but are paid entirely to work on behalf of their union. The \n     estimated cost of paying federal employees to do union work \n     over just those three years is about $300-$400 million. This \n     means that taxpayers who might not support the political aims \n     of federal unions are being forced to subsidize their \n     operations on a massive scale. While the Administration \n     started collecting government-wide statistics for official \n     time in 2004, official time has remained stubbornly in place \n     and is badly in need of being addressed by the Congress. \n     Ideally, federal employees would be limited in their ability \n     to do union work no more than 10% of the time, though even \n     that seems far higher than is reasonable.\n     Additional Examples of Fraud Waste and Abuse of Taxpayer \n         Dollars 2008\n       National Science Foundation grant money misspent to \n     purchase Waverunner, Wide-screen TV, season tickets to \n     football games, a $1,900 frozen-drink-machine, and \n     holographic lighted palm trees. Federal agents recently \n     searched the home of a former Georgia Tech employee who is \n     accused of ringing up more than $316,000 in personal charges \n     on her state-issued credit card, using grant money from the \n     National Science Foundation, federal documents charge. The \n     former administrative coordinator bought more than 3,800 \n     items, including a Waverunner personal watercraft, a wide-\n     screen television, and items ranging from season tickets to \n     Auburn University football games in Alabama to a $1,900 \n     frozen drink machine and holographic lighted palm trees. She \n     also bought an electric double wall oven, dishwasher and high \n     priced Henckel knives for her kitchen. She charged air \n     conditioning units for her RV and had hundreds of packages \n     shipped to her Marietta home, charging thousands of dollars \n     at Web sites such as Amazon.com and Nordstrom. The staggering \n     number of purchases went unnoticed until August 2007, when a \n     tipster contacted the Georgia Tech Department of Internal \n     Auditing, according to the search warrant.''\n       Local and national taxayers suffer due to poor oversight \n     over D.C. Health Safety network $129 million annual program. \n     The District of Columbia launched the D.C. Healthcare \n     Alliance in 2001. The program, which faced a $40 million \n     deficit last year, provides free care to D.C. residents who \n     earn too little to afford private insurance but too much to \n     qualify for Medicaid benefits, and has a budget this year of \n     $129 million. Lax oversight over the program has opened the \n     door to costly fraud, critics of the program have said. A new \n     audit details the complete failure of the D.C. government to \n     prevent outsiders from ripping off a health care program \n     financed by city taxpayers that is designed to provide a \n     safety net for the city's poorest. One audit finding \n     showed that eleven District addresses, not including \n     homeless shelters, accounted for 271 Alliance members, and \n     another 216 addresses accounted for 1,866 members. The \n     auditor also found that 16,720 of 63,167 Alliance data \n     records contained no Social Security number, which may be \n     explained by a large number of illegal immigrants in the \n     program. The alliance costs the District $212.21 per \n     member per month, meaning local and federal taxpayers are \n     out 1 million a year for every 400 people who scam it. In \n     2008, $3.9 million come from federal tax dollars.\n       Ohio Association of Chiefs of Police unit told to halt \n     spending association misspent tens of thousands of Homeland \n     Security grant dollars on services such as lawn care, window \n     washing and pest control. Taxpayers have a right to expect \n     that the millions of dollars from their pockets spent to \n     bolster state's homeland security efforts will have concrete \n     results. Instead, one state agency misspent more than \n     $182,000 in 2005. According to a recent Inspector General \n     report, ``A state agency has ordered the Ohio Association of \n     Chiefs of Police to stop spending homeland security money \n     while a federal auditor reviews allegations of misspending.'' \n     A state audit found the chiefs association has misspent tens \n     of thousands of federal dollars on such services as lawn \n     care, window washing and pest control, and has continued to \n     fail to document hundreds of other costs. The chiefs \n     association was awarded $7 million a year in 2004, 2005 and \n     2006, tripling a\n\n[[Page S1905]]\n\n     budget that had been used to train officers and develop \n     crime-fighting programs. The state Emergency Management \n     Agency found incomplete records and irregularities for each \n     of the three years the unit was awarded funds.\n     2007\n       Centers for Disease Control (CDC) can't find $22 million in \n     equipment. More than $22 million worth of scientific \n     equipment and other items is missing from the CDC, raising \n     ``troubling issues'' about the Atlanta-based agency's ability \n     to manage its property, according to members of a \n     congressional oversight committee. There were 5,547 items of \n     property, worth more than $22 million, unaccounted for at CDC \n     as of February 22, 2007.\n     CDC funded Hollywood to help write TV Shows with millions \n         from taxpayexs.\n       CDC has spent $2.01 million--and plans to spend up to \n     $250,000 in FY08--to fund a Hollywood liaison to help TV \n     shows like ``General Hospital,'' ``The Young & The \n     Restless,'' and ``24'' with their fictitious storylines. CDC \n     used $51,500 in CDC terrorism funds for the Hollywood liaison \n     program. Based on CDC data, the agency spent approximately \n     $6,000 per TV episode consultation. CDC's media affairs \n     office could field questions from the entertainment industry \n     and free up millions in CDC funds for health and biosecurity \n     needs.\n       NIH paying $1.3 million monthly for unused lab as \n     vibrations still an issue at new Baltimore facility. The \n     federal government has begun paying millions of dollars in \n     rent for a new medical laboratory facility in Southeast \n     Baltimore, but federal scientists, who were supposed to \n     relocate there a year ago, are still months away from moving \n     in. The National Institutes of Health expects it will take \n     three more months to determine whether vibration problems \n     with the building have been fixed and whether all scientists \n     who were supposed to transfer there will be able to. The Sun \n     reported last year that the agency and many researchers \n     feared the vibrations would skew results of sensitive \n     microscopes and other lab equipment. The $250 million \n     building, called the Biomedical Research Center, is on the \n     Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center campus. The building \n     has been promoted as a state-of-the-art facility for \n     research programs on aging and drug abuse, and is a \n     cornerstone for redevelopment in the Southeast Baltimore \n     neighborhood. Last month, NIH began paying more than $1.3 \n     million a month in rent and upkeep.\n     Feds Spending Thousands of Taxpayer Dollars on Social \n         Networking Sites.\n       Most federal agencies maintain websites publicizing their \n     mission, work and outreach. Some press reports estimate the \n     number of federal websites to be in the range of 20,000. \n     Apparently the proliferation of websites promoting U.S. \n     government federal agencies and their work is not enough. \n     Some agencies, such as the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) \n     at the Department of Health and Human Services, the National \n     Aeronautic and Space Administration (NASA) and the National \n     Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) at the \n     Department of Commerce are looking towards social networking \n     sites as a new publicity front. NOAA has spent 25,000 for \n     publicity on Care2 networking site to promote 2008 as the \n     ``International Year of the Reef'' and hosts ``virtual \n     island'' on the Second Life site.\n     Over $100 million in fraud is found in the Federal Employee \n         Health Program.\n       The Inspector General for the Office of Personnel \n     Management (OPM), the federal agency that administers health \n     benefits for government employees, found that the health \n     benefits program was defrauded of $106 million by \n     participating providers. According to the OIG report, the \n     fraudulent spending came as the result of medical companies \n     overcharging the government or arranging kickback schemes to \n     promote the use of their products. OPM recovered $97 million \n     from a large settlement with one such company, and the \n     largest case resulted in a $155 million settlement from Medco \n     Health Solutions, which provides mail order prescriptions and \n     related benefits to federal employees. The company settled a \n     complaint that it paid kickbacks to health plans to gain \n     their business, took money from drug manufacturers to favor \n     their drugs and destroyed prescriptions to avoid penalties \n     for delays in filling them.\n       NASA's 4-Star parties cost taxpayers millions as agency \n     pays $4 million a year for resort parties to honor some \n     employees and lots of NASA contractors. On the same day NASA \n     got an emergency $1 billion in extra appropriations from the \n     Senate, and former astronaut and Senator Ben Nelson (D-NE) \n     said, ``Right now we're at a critical point because NASA has \n     been starved of funds,'' NASA put out a bid request for a \n     four-star hotel for its December awards ceremony that will \n     cost taxpayers between $400,0001 and $500,000. A NASA \n     spokesman sat down with CBS News and didn't think the event \n     was frivolous or extravagant. In fact, instead of asking \n     taxpayers if the resort parties should be a priority, he told \n     CBS, ``I think what I would do is ask the people who we have \n     honored to give me an idea if they think this thing was \n     reasonable, if they felt they were honored properly.'' NASA \n     holds such a party every time there's a shuttle launch, for \n     what CBS estimates is about $4 million a year. This \n     December's event will be the third of 2007. Amazingly, when \n     asked by CBS News if NASA was told to cut their party money \n     in half, its spokesman said, ``If we were told that we had to \n     reduce it I think we would reduce the number of honorees \n     rather than trying to go to a poor place or a place that \n     doesn't have good service.''\n       Snacks Take Big Bite Out of DOJ Budget.--``double-dipping'' \n     for meal reimbursement by DOJ employees increases cost to \n     taxpayers. An internal Justice audit showed the department \n     spent nearly $7 million to plan, host, or send employees to \n     10 conferences over the last two years. This included paying \n     $4 per meatball at one lavish dinner and spreading an average \n     of $25 worth of snacks around to each participant at a movie- \n     themed party. The report, which looked at the 10 priciest \n     Justice Department conferences between October 2004 and \n     September 2006, was ordered by the Senate Appropriations \n     Committee. It also found that three-quarters of the employees \n     who attended the conferences demanded daily reimbursement for \n     the cost of meals while traveling--effectively double-dipping \n     into government funds. The audit did not compare Justice's \n     conference costs to those at other government agencies.\n       Pentagon paid $998,798 to ship two 19-cent washers as \n     little oversight lead to blatant abuse of system. A small \n     South Carolina parts supplier collected about $20.5 million \n     over, six years from the Pentagon for fraudulent shipping \n     costs, including $998,798 for sending two 19-cent washers to \n     an Army base in Texas, U.S. officials said. The company also \n     billed and was paid $455,009 to ship three machine screws \n     costing $1.31 each to Marines in Habbaniyah, Iraq, and \n     $293,451 to ship an 89-cent split washer to Patrick Air Force \n     Base in Cape Canaveral, Florida, Pentagon records show.\n       Untold Millions, Spent on Repetitive ``Bullying'' Programs \n     in Multiple Federal Agencies? One program, HRSA's ``Stop \n     Bullying Now'' was estimated to cost $6.5 million in 2 years. \n     In 2004, the Health Resources and Service's Administration \n     (HRSA) through the Health and Human Services Administration \n     (HHS) launched the program Stop Bullying Now. The extensive \n     website includes a ``stop bullying now jingle,'' 12 games \n     (``Bully-wood Squares,'' connect the dots to reveal the \n     bully, (etc), 12 ``animated webisodes'' featuring characters \n     that ``just might remind you of people you know.'' (see \n     illustration) along with a promise to ``post a new one every \n     couple of weeks,'' along with advice and letters from HRSA's \n     bullying ``experts,'' Senorita Ortega and Mr. Bittner. CNN \n     reported in 2003 that HRSA's bullying program would cost $3.4 \n     million. However, in a response to a July 2006 congressional \n     request, HRSA reported that $6.2 million had been spent since \n     the establishment of the program, almost double the amount of \n     the original estimation. The program was not enumerated in \n     HRSA's 2007 or 2008 budget justifications submitted by the \n     agency to Congress.\n       Comic Capers at NIH. Congress doubled funding for the \n     National Institutes of Health (NIH) over the past decade. \n     While we haven't discovered a cure for cancer yet, the agency \n     does provide you the opportunity to create and print your \n     very own Garfield comic strips.\n       $61.7 million in federal AIDS funds went unspent that could \n     have been used to treat patients on AIDS drug waiting lists. \n     An HHS OIG report reveals that bureaucratic inaction at the \n     Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), not a \n     lack of federal resources, has contributed to the patient \n     waiting lists for AIDS drugs. ``HRSA did not use the offset \n     authority provided by the CARE Act and HHS grants policy to \n     manage States' unobligated balances. . . . By doing so, HRSA \n     would have had available a larger amount of current-year \n     funding to address program needs. For example, the offsetting \n     option might have been useful in grant year 2002, when 10 \n     States had unobligated Title II balances totaling $61.7 \n     million and 8 States had no balances or small balances and a \n     documented need for additional resources. HRSA stated that it \n     had opted against using the offset authority provided by the \n     CARE Act.\n       Over $45 million in Title I Ryan White CARE Act funds \n     unspent over 5 year period while AIDS patients wait for drug \n     assistance. The Health and Human Services Inspector General \n     issued a review of unspent Ryan White CARE Act Title I funds \n     (AIDS care grants provided to 51 metropolitan areas in the \n     U.S.) and found that 46 eligible areas carried over more than \n     $45 million in unspent federal funds from two to five years \n     beyond the original budget period between 1999 and 2003. \n     During this period, there were hundreds of patients on \n     waiting lists for AIDS Drug Assistance Programs throughout \n     the country. A number of patients on these waiting lists died \n     in South Carolina, Kentucky and West Virginia.\n       The Washington Post reported that NIH was paying an \n     employee $100,000 a year to do nothing.

Before those checks are issued, though, the \n     Internal Revenue Service will send a letter out to each \n     household that will get a rebate check to inform them that \n     the check is on the way. Unfortunately, the cost of sending \n     these pre-rebate letters will be $42 million once the costs \n     are tallied for postage and printing. The letter will not \n     contain the actual rebate, but will merely explain that the \n     stimulus package was passed and what a citizen should do with \n     the check once they receive it. It is not clear why this \n     information could not be provided with the actual check at \n     its time of arrival, leading some to think that the letter \n     serves no higher purpose than to give Congress and the \n     President a pat on the back. Surely, there could be a better \n     use for the $42 million--like giving it back to taxpayers.\n       Senate Restaurants. The Senate Restaurants, which is \n     overseen by the Architect of the Capitol, operates the Senate \n     cafeterias, catering services, snack shops, vending machine \n     and the Senate Members Dining Room. A recently GAO audit \n     found that the American taxpayers have covered the Senate \n     restaurants' $2.36 million operating losses during the last \n     two combined fiscal years. The operating loss rose from $1.02 \n     million in 2006 to $1.34 million in 2007. After taking in \n     just over $10 million of revenues in 2007, being $1.34 \n     million in the red translates into a 13.4% operating loss for \n     the Senate Restaurants. No business could operate in the \n     private sector with these kinds of losses but this is the \n     kind of waste that we are seeing all throughout the federal \n     government. Prompted, the recent GAO audit, the Senate \n     Committee on Rules and Administration is now seeking an \n     outside vendor to take over operations of the Senate \n     Restaurants.\n       Unneeded Federal Buildings. The federal government \n     currently owns 21,000 buildings that it says it no longer \n     needs, which are all together worth $18 billion. At the \n     Department of Energy alone, the unneeded property is \n     equivalent to three times the amount of square footage in the \n     Pentagon--the largest building in the world. Unfortunately, \n     the rules and regulations in place make it nearly impossible \n     for federal agencies to sell these buildings in a timely \n     manner on the open market. According to the rules, before an \n     agency sells a property it is required to conduct extensive \n     reviews to determine if the property could be used to meet \n     some public benefit, such as a homeless shelter, school, \n     airport runway or path for telephone wires. If a \n     determination is made that the property could be used in this \n     way, after a process that can take years, it is then \n     available to be given away at no cost to an applicant. In the \n     years that these rules have been in place, 30,000 properties \n     have been required to undergo these reviews, but only a \n     fraction of a percent of have ever been given away. \n     Unfortunately, because all properties are required to undergo \n     this process there is a tremendous bottle-necking effect, \n     preventing agencies from selling unneeded properties. This \n     hurts agencies in two ways: first, it means that agencies are \n     deprived of the money that they could earn by selling the \n     property, and second, it means that agencies are required to \n     pay for upkeep of buildings they don't need. Instead of \n     allowing these properties to be sold on behalf of taxpayers, \n     Congress has chosen to keep the rules in place and wasted the \n     opportunity to make $18 billion.\n       2010 Decennial Census. The 2010 Decennial Census will use a \n     six-question survey to count every person in the country, as \n     required by the Constitution for apportioning the House of \n     Representatives. The Census Bureau has recently estimated \n     that the overall cost of the census would be $11.8 billion, \n     which is nearly double what was spent to conduct operations \n     in 2000. More recently, though, we have found out that the \n     Bureau has so grossly mismanaged a $600 million contract for \n     handheld computers that cost overruns as high as $2 billion \n     are possible. Most of this cost would be the result of \n     needing to abandon the handheld computers in favor of \n     conducting the census entirely by paper. Due to the recent \n     revelations, the Government Accountability Office has placed \n     the 2010 Census on its High Risk List, which is reserved only \n     for the most problematic programs in the federal government.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me begin by commending my friend from \nOklahoma, who I think makes some very important points. There is no \nquestion that there is an enormous amount of waste and fraud and abuse \nin this Government. There is no question, in my mind, that Congress has \nnot been vigilant enough in rooting out that waste and fraud to the \ntune of billions and billions of dollars.\n  I would simply say that while it is absolutely appropriate to condemn \nthe Congress, it is also important to note that we have an \nadministration in this city, in Washington, DC, and the function of an \nadministration is to administer. That means that when there is waste \nand fraud, you have an administration that should also be on top of \nthat situation. And I think of the many failings of the Bush \nadministration, which, in my view, will go down in history as one of \nthe worst in our country's history--clearly their overall incompetence \nwill be one of those areas people will focus on.\n  The second point I would make--and I see my friend from Oklahoma has \nleft--is that he is absolutely right that a $9.2 trillion national debt \nis unsustainable. But one of the areas I don't believe he mentioned in \nterms of driving up that national debt is the war in Iraq.\n  Now, we can have a great debate about the wisdom of that war. I voted \nagainst it when I was in the House. I think we should bring our troops \nhome as soon as possible. But right now, we are not on the war, we are \non the budget. And the question regarding the budget is, For all those \npeople who support the war, why don't you pay for the war now rather \nthan forcing our kids and grandchildren to pay to the tune of $150 \nbillion a year? And some say the cost of this war eventually will run \ninto the trillions of dollars. So all of those people who talk about \nfiscal irresponsibility refuse not to pay for the war.\n  I was reading a book about Dwight David Eisenhower, and in the book \nit points out that during the Korean war, Truman imposed a surtax on \npeople's personal income tax and an excess-profits tax in order to pay \nfor the war. I don't see the advocates of the war in Iraq coming \nforward and saying: We don't want to leave that burden of $150 billion \na year to our kids and grandchildren, so we are going to come up and \npay for it now. I didn't hear my friend from Oklahoma raise that issue.\n  I hear other people coming to the floor and they say: Well, we have \nthis tremendous national debt, and they have pictures of the kids, and \nyet they propose to completely eliminate the estate tax, which over the \ncourse of 20 years will cause us a loss of $1 trillion. How is that \ngoing to be paid for? Oh, I guess we don't have to pay for it. I guess \nwe can just pass that on to the kids. So I think that some of our \nfriends who talk about fiscal responsibility might, in fact, want to \npay for this war today, not pass it on to future generations. And when \nthey are talking about giving huge tax breaks to the wealthiest people \nin this country, let them understand that is all they are doing, is \ndriving up the national debt so that our kids and grandchildren will be \nforced to pay for that.\n  We are in the midst of a debate about the budget, and as you know a \nbudget is a lot more than just numbers; it reflects the values and the \npriorities of our Nation. And when we look at what is going on in this \ncountry, as important as a $9.2 trillion national debt is, it is not \nthe only issue of importance. What is also important is to understand \ntoday what is going on in terms of the needs and the lives of middle-\nclass and working people.\n  One of the realities we do not talk about very much today is that \npoverty in America is increasing. In fact, since President Bush has \nbeen in office, almost 5 million more Americans have joined the ranks \nof the poor. That is part of the Bush economy. We now have almost 36.5 \nmillion Americans who are living in poverty. Many of these people are \nworking, and they are working 40 or 50 hours a week, but they are \nmaking 8 bucks an hour, they are making 7 bucks an hour, and they are \njust not making enough money in order to lift themselves out of \npoverty. In fact, the United States of America today has the highest \nrate of poverty of any major nation on Earth, and that is an issue \nwhich we should address here in the Senate.\n  When we are talking about Americans living in poverty, we are not, of \ncourse, just talking about adults. Tragically, we are also talking \nabout children. I know our President and many others talk about family \nvalues. Well, this is not a family value. Under President Bush's \nadministration, since he has been in office, 1.2 million more children \nare now living in poverty, and we have almost 13 million kids in this \ncountry who live in poverty. That is not a family value. That is a \nnational disgrace. As a matter of fact, the United States has the \ndubious distinction of having the highest childhood poverty rate in the \nindustrialized world.\n\n[[Page S1907]]\n\n  I hear some of my friends coming to the floor to compare this or that \naspect of American society or our tax policy with Europe and other \ncountries. Well, I think it is important that we look at this chart--\nhow we treat our children.\n  What this chart shows is that Finland, Norway, and Sweden all have \nchildhood poverty rates of less than 5 percent. Switzerland, Belgium, \nAustria, France, Denmark, and Germany all have childhood poverty rates \nof less than 10 percent. The Netherlands has a childhood poverty rate \nof slightly more than 10 percent. But in the United States of America, \nthe childhood poverty rate is 21.9 percent, or more than double that of \nFrance, Germany, Austria, or the Netherlands.\n  Now, why is that an important fact? It is important, obviously, that \nthe children are vulnerable; that as adults, we are responsible for the \nchildren and we are failing those children. But it is also important to \nnote that we have, as a nation, more people behind bars, incarcerated, \nthan any other nation on Earth, including China. And if anyone thinks \nthere is not a direct correlation between high poverty rates for kids \nand kids who mentally drop out of society, get involved in self-\ndestructive activity at young ages, and then end up in jail, you would \nbe kidding yourself. And the issue here is whether we address this \ncrisis of 21 percent of our kids living in poverty, whether we provide \nfor those kids or, 15 or 18 or 20 years later, whether we lock them up \nat $50,000 a pop.\n  There have been recent discussions about the economy, whether we are \nin a recession or entering a recession. But the truth is, despite \nPresident Bush's assertions, this economy has been a disaster for \nmiddle-income and working families from day one. Since President Bush \ntook office in 2001, median household income for working-aged Americans \nhas declined by almost $2,500. That is what we call the collapse of the \nmiddle class. Over 8\\1/2\\ million Americans have lost their health \ninsurance. That is what we call the disintegration of the health care \nsystem in America. Three million workers have lost their pensions. And \nthe idea of a defined pension program is increasingly becoming ancient \nhistory. More and more workers are wondering what is going to happen to \nthem when they retire, and the idea that there will really be a defined \npension program for them when they retire, that is not something most \nworkers, especially younger workers, believe.\n  The annual trade deficit since President Bush has been in office has \nmore than doubled, and over 3 million good-paying manufacturing jobs \nhave been lost. The price of gas at the pump and home heating oil has \nmore than doubled, while ExxonMobil made $40 billion in profits last \nyear--more than any company in the history of the world. That is $3.20 \nfor a gallon of gas, which working people in Vermont can't afford. \nWorkers in Vermont often travel long-distance to and from work. And $40 \nbillion in profit for ExxonMobil. Home foreclosures, of course, are now \nthe highest on record. Meanwhile, while the middle class is shrinking \nand poverty is increasing, the wealthiest people in this country have \nnot had it so good since the 1920s.\n  My friend from Oklahoma mentioned that there are issues we just don't \ntalk about, and he has a point. But one of the issues we don't talk \nabout in this body--for pretty obvious reasons, to my mind, because who \npays for the campaigns around here--is the growing disparity, the \noutrageous disparity of income and wealth in this country.\n  What this chart shows is that the wealthiest 1 percent of the \npopulation now owns 34 percent of the Nation's wealth, while the bottom \n90 percent owns only 29 percent of our wealth. That is here.\n  So what you see is the richest 1 percent owns more wealth than the \nbottom 90 percent. Is that what America is supposed to be about? Is \nthat the kind of society we want? There is a lot of discussion that \ntakes place on the floor of the Senate, in the House, about the \neconomy. But at the end of the day, when you look at the economy, what \nis important, most important, is not economic growth, not GDP, what \nreally is most important is what is happening to the average person.\n  You can have all of the growth you want, and you can see ordinary \nworking people experiencing a decline in their real wages. You can see \na lot of wealth being created, but it does not mean a whole lot to \nordinary people if most of that income and wealth is going to the \npeople on top.\n  The bottom line is that in the economy there are winners and losers. \nIt is very clear that in the economy today, the middle class is losing. \nLower income people are being decimated while the upper income people \nhave never had it so good.\n  I know my friends in the Senate on both sides of the aisle--I speak \nas an Independent--hesitate to talk about that issue. But it is \nimperative that we do talk about it. Let me go to another chart.\n  This chart talks about the economy in terms of how different groups \nare doing. This chart shows that the wealthiest 1 percent saw its total \nincome rise by $180,000 in 2005 or more than what the average middle-\nclass family makes in 3 years. This is the rise in income, not what \nthey make; this is just their increase.\n  So the wealthiest 1 percent are doing phenomenally well. That is on \naverage. That is a pretty good year, on average, seeing an increase of \n$180,000 in the year 2005. This is according to the Congressional \nBudget Office.\n  Meanwhile, the average middle-class family received a $400 increase. \nThat is that small little box down here, an increase in annual income \nin 2005.\n  CBO also found that the total share of aftertax income going to the \ntop 1 percent hit the highest level on record, while the middle-class \nand working families received the smallest share of aftertax incomes on \nrecord.\n  So when people understand in their gut that what is happening is the \nmiddle class is shrinking and the rich are getting richer, well, that \nis what it is about. That is the fact. That is precisely what is \nhappening in America.\n  In addition, according to Forbes magazine, the collective net worth \nof the wealthiest 400 Americans--400 Americans, that is not a lot of \npeople--increased by $290 billion last year, increased by $290 billion \nto a total of $1.5 trillion. Not only have the wealthiest 400 families, \nthe richest 400, seen an increase in their wealth, their combined \nincome has more than doubled from 2002 to 2005.\n  At the same time, the average income tax paid by the wealthiest 400 \nAmericans has fallen from 30 percent to 18 percent. That is not Bernie \nSanders, that is according to the Wall Street Journal. The reason the \naverage income tax for the wealthiest people who are making \nastronomical sums of money, why that has been cut in half, is mainly \ndue to Bush's tax cuts, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n  The middle class is shrinking, poverty is increasing, and the \nwealthiest people have not had it so good since the 1920s. That is an \noverview of the state of our economy.\n  Now, why do I raise these issues? I raise these issues because if we \ntruly do not understand what is going on around our country in the \nlives of ordinary people, people who cannot afford to fill up their gas \ntank, cannot afford a college education for their kids, cannot afford \nchildcare, cannot afford to take care of their parents, if we do not \nunderstand that reality, it is pretty hard for this body to make good \npublic policy.\n  The question then is, what do we do? What do we do? Well, President \nBush gave us his answer in his budget. What President Bush, in his \nbudget, said is, at a time when the richest people in America are \nbecoming richer, what should we do? Well, let's give them even more tax \nbreaks. That makes a lot of sense to the richest people in America and \nGeorge W. Bush.\n  And what did he say to the poorest people in America? Well, poverty \nis increasing. There is a level of desperation going on in this country \nthat we have not seen in many years. So at a time when poverty is \nincreasing, what do we do? Well, according to George W. Bush, you cut \nback on the aid and programs that help low-income and middle-income \npeople. That is precisely what Bush's budget was about; one of the more \nabsurd documents that I have ever seen in my life.\n  Fortunately, that budget has been placed where it belongs; that is, \nin the garbage can. We are now debating a much different budget, a \nbudget that is far better, the budget that we have before us. I am \nproud to be a member of\n\n[[Page S1908]]\n\nthe Budget Committee, working with Chairman Conrad, on a far better \nbudget than the President's budget.\n  But, in my view, we can make improvements on it. We can do better \nthan the budget we are now debating. To that regard, I will be \nintroducing an amendment, and I want to thank the Presiding Officer for \nbeing one of the cosponsors of that amendment.\n  Let me very briefly talk about that. It seems to me, as we look at \nsome of the trends that we should be addressing in this budget, at \nleast three come to mind. No. 1 is the middle class is declining, No. 2 \nis our children are suffering, and No. 3 is that we have, among other \nthings, a major infra-structural crisis in this country.\n  It is my view that we need a budget which will address some of those \nissues. I am very proud I will soon be introducing an amendment which \nis being cosponsored by Senators Clinton, Durbin, Kennedy, Harkin, \nSchumer, Mikulski, and Brown.\n  This amendment is a pretty simple one. It puts the needs of our \nchildren, it puts the needs of our working families and people with \ndisabilities and senior citizens ahead of the wealthy few.\n  At a time when our Presidential candidates in both parties are \ntalking about change, change, and change, at a time when the American \npeople overwhelming understand that it is imperative that we move this \ncountry in a different direction, this amendment can begin the process \nof change right here in the Senate, and, in fact, change our national \npriorities.\n  The choice the Senate will have in terms of this amendment is a \npretty simple one: Do we continue to give tax breaks to the very \nwealthiest people in this country, people who have never had it so \ngood, or do we invest in our children, our working families, and those \npeople who are in need?\n\n  What this would do is restore the top income tax bracket to 39.6 \npercent for households earning more than $1 million per year. Those are \nthe only people who would be affected. And we would use that revenue to \nbegin to address some of the most urgent, unmet needs of our children. \nWe would address the issue of job creation; we would address the issue \nof deficit reduction.\n  Now, 99.7 percent of Americans would not be impacted by this tax \nchange, only the top three-tenths of 1 percent would see their income \ntax rates go back to where they were during the Clinton administration \nwhen few would deny that the economy was far stronger than it currently \nis.\n  According to the Joint Tax Committee, restoring the top income tax \nbrackets for people making more than $1 million to what it was in 2000 \nwould increase revenue by about $32.5 billion over the next 3 years, \nincluding $10.8 billion in 2009 alone.\n  So here is the choice. We can continue over a 3-year period to give \n$32.5 billion in tax breaks to the top three-tenths of 1 percent, \npeople who economically are doing phenomenally well today, or we can \ninvest it in the people in our country and use some of that for deficit \nreduction.\n  What could we do with $32.5 billion? Well, let me tell you. We could, \nas our amendment does, expend $10 billion for the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act; that is, special education.\n  Over 30 years ago, the Federal Government made a promise that it \nwould fund 40 percent of the cost of special education. Unfortunately, \ntoday we only spend about 17 percent of the cost of special ed. I know \nin Vermont--I do not know about Ohio, but I can tell you that in \nVermont, in school district after school district, property taxes are \ngoing up. And one of the reasons is the very high cost of special ed. \nYou are seeing more and more kids coming into the system who have \nspecial ed needs.\n  Educating those kids is very expensive. The Federal Government has \nnot kept its promise in adequately funding special ed. So it is the \nlocal property tax payers who have to pick up the cost. By putting $10 \nbillion more into special ed, not only can we help people stabilize \ntheir property taxes, but we can pay more attention to the kids with \nspecial ed needs. And both of those goals, to my mind, are goals that \nwe should strive for.\n  This amendment would also increase Head Start funding by $5 billion \nover the next 3 years. After adjusting for inflation, Head Start has \nbeen cut by over 11 percent compared to fiscal year 2002. Meanwhile, \nless than half of all eligible children are enrolled in Head Start, and \nonly about 3 percent of eligible children are enrolled in Early Head \nStart. This amendment would begin to correct this situation.\n  What Head Start is about is what its title indicates. What we have \nknown for a very long time is the most important intellectual and \nemotional years of a human being's life are their earliest years. If \nkids are not exposed to books and they are not exposed to ideas and \nthey are not learning how to socialize and they do not have good \nemotional development, those kids are going to go off in a bad \ndirection. And what Head Start was about, and what Head Start has been \nsuccessful about, is giving kids the opportunity so that when they get \ninto kindergarten and first grade, those kids will then be in a \nposition in which they can learn effectively and can socialize well \nwith their peers.\n  Head Start works. The problem right now is that it is inadequately \nfunded, and millions of families simply cannot get into this very good \nprogram.\n  In addition to funding special education and Head Start, my amendment \nwould also provide a $4 billion increase for the childcare development \nblock grant. One of the issues that we very rarely discuss in the \nSenate but that every working family with young children knows is a \nmajor crisis in America is the lack of availability of childcare, \naffordable, quality childcare.\n  How many millions of kids are now being minded by untrained people \nand being stuck in front of a television set for 8 hours a day? And \nwhat an unfortunate circumstance that is for our little kids, \nespecially at a time when most women work and are entitled to good \nquality childcare. This amendment would provide funding to help do \nthat.\n  This amendment would also provide a $3.5 billion increase to the Food \nStamp Program. Hunger in America--I know you know, Mr. President, \nbecause you and I are working on an issue to address this--is \nincreasing. Food pantries are running out of food. That should not be \ntaking place in this country. So what we do is add $3.5 billion more to \nthe Food Stamp Program.\n  In my State of Vermont, it gets pretty cold. That is true in many \nother States. Meanwhile, the price of home heating oil is soaring. You \nhave many people who are having a difficult time paying their heating \nbills. This amendment would increase the very successful Low-Income \nHome Energy Assistance Program, often called LIHEAP, by $4 billion.\n  The bottom line is nobody in America should go cold in the winter.\n  Furthermore, this amendment would provide $3 billion for school \nconstruction. There are kids who are going to schools that are \noutmoded. They are decrepit. They are not energy efficient. We can \ncreate a lot of good jobs. We can improve the quality of education by \nbuilding modern schools and upgrading the schools that currently exist. \nWe put $3 billion into that.\n  Finally, at a time of record-breaking deficits, this amendment would \nreduce the deficit by $3 billion.\n  I am happy to inform my colleagues that this amendment has been \nendorsed by over 50 groups, including the AFL-CIO, AFSCME, the National \nEducation Association, Children's Defense Fund, the American Federation \nof Teachers, Easter Seals, the YWCA, the National Head Start \nAssociation, the SEIU, and the National Organization for Women.\n  Let me quote from a letter I received from all of these groups:\n\n       The economic downturn is creating crisis for parents who \n     work hard but struggle to afford nutritious meals as food \n     prices escalate; to pay for energy for their homes and fuel \n     for their cars; to pay for child care so that they can work; \n     and to assure that their young children receive the building \n     blocks of a solid education to prepare them for the future. \n     Programs that assist in meeting these needs have been cut \n     significantly in recent years, while tax breaks for \n     millionaires have soared. Your amendment addresses these \n     needs. . . .We are urging the Senate to adopt your fiscally \n     responsible amendment to address the pressing needs of \n     working families while restoring greater progressivity to the \n     tax system.\n\n  The choice is clear. We can provide $32.5 billion in tax breaks to \nmillionaires and billionaires who don't need it or we can begin to meet \nthe unmet needs of our children. That is what this\n\n[[Page S1909]]\n\namendment is about. I look forward to the support of my colleagues, not \njust in passing this amendment but in beginning the process of moving \nthis great country in a very different direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/11/senate-section/article/S1909-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1909]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
