Mr. President, this morning, there will be 60 minutes for \nmorning business, with the Republicans controlling the first half, and \nthe Democrats controlling the second half.\n  Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of \nthe FDA legislation. Last night, due to the hard work of Senator Enzi \nand the staffs of Senators Kennedy and Enzi, they were able to come to \nan agreement to complete action on this legislation today. I compliment \nthe hard work of the many individuals who worked to accomplish this, \nespecially Senator Brown who, in the absence of the chairman, was here \nthroughout the day to assist in moving the process along. In addition, \nI would like to single out Senator Enzi, who has worked so hard on this \nlegislation in the committee and, of course, with it being on the \nfloor. He has worked very well with Senator Kennedy in the entire \nprocess of getting this legislation through the committee to the floor \nand now toward completion.\n  Through the hard work of these I have mentioned, we have only three \namendments that are in order to the bill, and we have 60 minutes of \ndebate time. Votes on the remaining amendments and passage of the bill \nwill occur around 11:30 this morning.\n  Following final action on the FDA bill, the Senate will consider, for \nup to 3 hours, the nomination of Debra Ann Livingston to be a circuit \ncourt judge. Upon the use or yielding back of that time, then a vote on \nconfirmation will occur.\n  Once the judge has been confirmed, I have every belief that the \nSenate will begin and complete the process of going to conference on \nthe budget resolution. I have spoken to Senator Conrad earlier this \nmorning. He and Senator Judd Gregg get along extremely well, and they \nwill work out the time on the number of motions to instruct and how \nmany motions to instruct the minority will require. So Members should \nbe prepared to work into the evening on this most important item.\n  Finally, the cloture vote on the motion to proceed to the water \nresources legislation will not occur before tomorrow morning. Today \nwill be a busy day, with votes occurring throughout the day, so Members \nshould plan accordingly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/09/senate-section/article/S5755-7", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5755-S5756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I am pleased to report to my colleagues on a \ntrip, an Intelligence Committee trip, that I led to Iraq this past \nweekend, with Senators Snowe and Chambliss and Congressman Issa. We \nfound some very amazing things. We visited Tikrit, Baghdad, Ramadi, \nBalad. We talked to the commanding officers, sat down and talked with \nour troops, our soldiers, marines, and airmen.\n  In Ramadi--which only a month or so ago had been a denied area, an \narea so hostile that heavily armed U.S. units could not even \nsuccessfully go in. It was extremely dangerous. On Sunday, as a result \nof changes that have happened in Ramadi in the last several weeks, the \nfour of us Members of Congress, with the general in charge of the area, \nGeneral Gaskin, and a driver, and two marines with M-16s, went down to \ndowntown Baghdad. We had no phalanx of troops around us, no helicopters \nflying overhead. We got out and walked in downtown Baghdad at \n``Firecracker Corner,'' so named, as one might guess, because of the \ntremendous number of rounds that perpetually were going off in that \narea.\n  It was quiet at the time. We went from there into the former Anbar \ncollege, which has become the security force headquarters for the area. \nThat building is manned by Iraqi police units, Iraqi army units, and \nU.S. marines. They were living together, conducting missions together, \nand apparently they have been extremely successful because Ramadi has \nchanged significantly.\n  In the last 3 months, attacks in Ramadi have decreased by some 74 \npercent. I have a chart in the Chamber. You probably cannot see it too \nwell. But the first part shows weekly attacks going from a high of 127, \nin February, down to 24 in the week of April 20 to 26.\n  Indirect fire attacks went from 129 per week down to about 10. \nImprovised explosive device attacks--this is per month--went from over \n320 last July, down to, in March, 67 per month; and in April to 28 per \nmonth.\n  Now, what is going on here? Well, it is quite simply that the surge \nand clear-and-hold counterinsurgency strategy is beginning to work. The \nmistake we made previously is we would go in and take out al-Qaida and \nleave. Well, al-Qaida would come right back. And anybody who had \ncooperated with the coalition forces would be subjected to death or \nother severe penalties.\n  Now, with significant new numbers of Iraqi police and army, backed up \nby the U.S. military, we are able to go in and clear and hold. That is \nwhy the marines, the Iraqi police, and army are stationed in downtown \nBaghdad. This is becoming--it is not yet a denied zone for al-Qaida.\n  Now, one of the most important and amazing things that has happened \nis the tribal sheiks, the Sunnis in that area--if you have been \nfollowing the Al Anbar progress, the Sunni sheiks run that country. \nThey have concluded--having dealt with al-Qaida, and having had their \nfamily members killed, businesses disrupted--they have decided that the \ncoalition forces--American, Australian, British--in cooperation with \nthe Iraqi Army and police are far better hopes for security.\n  By our making a commitment to go in there, they have made a \ncommitment as well. Now they are volunteering large numbers of men to \nserve in the Iraqi police and the Iraqi Army.\n  In just a couple weeks, 1,200 Iraqi young men signed up for the army. \nThere are now over 10,000 Iraqi policemen. They are being trained, and \nthey are taking over the area.\n  As you look at the entire scope of Ramadi, there are 23 tribal areas. \nLast year, in one or two of the tribal areas, the sheiks were working \nwith us. Now all 23 have joined with us to fight al-Qaida. There are no \nuncooperative tribes left. They are joining the military and the police \nforce to help keep the area clear.\n  In downtown Ramadi, the U.S. military has gone in and been able to \nrepair and help reopen the largest, most important mosque in Ramadi, \nthe mosque that is central for the Sunnis in Al Anbar. It had been \nclosed since the start of the war. Now, this past Friday, hundreds of \nIraqis were able to attend services. The U.S. military has supplied and \nset up mosque speakers in Ramadi to broadcast security messages in \naddition to messages from the local Imams.\n  This is just one example we saw. In Baghdad, we learned the clear-\nand-hold strategy is working. Areas which had been highly dangerous, \nwith a high number of attacks daily, now, because of the presence of \nthe joint security forces--Iraqi, U.S., and coalition forces--have seen \nthe incidents decline by more than two-thirds.\n  What does this mean? Well, it means al-Qaida is being significantly \ndegraded. Significant numbers of al-Qaida have been killed and \ndetained, and others have been forced out of Baghdad and Al Anbar. Our \ncoalition forces, with the help of the Iraqi military, are, I \nunderstand, doing a very good job tracking them down and eliminating \nthem.\n  Now, this is not conclusive. This is only the first results of the \nsurge and the effective counterinsurgency strategy. It was recommended \nby the Baker-Hamilton commission last year, and it is being implemented \nby General Petraeus, who is an expert on counterinsurgency.\n  I would say that Marine General Gaskin, who is running Al Anbar, is \ndoing a magnificent job. I was impressed with what we heard from \nGeneral Odierno and General McCrystal and others who are working to \nmake sure they complete their job.\n  We also met with the most influential leader of the Shia in Iraq, \nAyatollah Abdul Aziz al-Hakim. He is the influential leader of the \nSupreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq. We talked with him \nabout the need for the Iraqis to find political solutions and to bring \ntogether a unity government of Sunnis, Kurds, and Shias to ensure the \nsafety and stability of their country so they would have an opportunity \nto go back to normal lives and prosper. We have given them that \nopportunity, and they need to take that opportunity. We need to do a \nbetter job of telling people the difference, and our military is doing \nthat. But at the same time, when we met with our troops, they kept \nasking us why we aren't getting the money. They know they are doing the \njob, and they asked us a question which is rather difficult to answer: \nYou sent us over here to do a military mission. We are accomplishing \nthat mission. Why are we not getting the money we need? Where are the \nMine Resistant Ambush Protection vehicles that can reduce injuries and \ndeaths so significantly? There was no answer, other than it has been \ndelayed.\n\n  Let me conclude by saying we are making great progress, and we cannot \nafford to tell our troops we are not going to support them by sending \nin a bifurcated budget, funding a month at a time, a month at a time, \nbecause they have a several months' long game plan. When they hear \npeople say that the war is lost, they say: We are risking our lives \nevery day, because the war is not lost. What are people in Congress \nthinking? We cannot tell the Iraqis and our troops that we are going to \ncut out of here in a couple of months because we will lose the \ncooperation of the tribal sheiks and the others who are helping us \nagainst al-Qaida if they think we are about ready to leave and leave \nthem at the mercy of al-Qaida, which will come back in if we leave \nprior to establishing strength in the Iraqi security forces that will \nenable them to prevent al-Qaida from taking over their country.\n  Make no mistake about it, that is the goal of al-Qaida. Our \nintelligence community unanimously says it. Ayman al-Zawahiri has said \nit, Osama bin Laden has said it. If we don't believe them, at least we \nought to believe our intelligence community.\n\n[[Page S5757]]\n\n  We must pass this supplemental for the full rest of the year without \ntimelines and provide the troops the support and the weapons systems \nthey need.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Mr. President, yesterday I came to the floor with the \nSenator from Arizona and the senior Senator from Texas to talk about \nrising gas prices. The sticker shock at the pump is something all \nAmericans are noticing. We can talk in esoteric sorts of ways about \nnational energy policy, but when people drive up and have to fill up \ntheir tank to be able to drive their kids to school or be able to drive \nto work, that is when they begin to understand the consequences of \nCongress's failure to act in a number of respects.\n  Last year about this time, our friends on the other side of the aisle \nheld a press conference over on Massachusetts Avenue and were decrying \nthe lack of action on the part of the then majority of Congress to \nbring down gasoline prices, but since that time, the average retail \nprice of gasoline has gone up by 13 cents. I saw in today's day book \nfor the Associated Press that the new majority, the Democratic majority \nis now going to have another press conference over at the same gas \nstation talking about high gas prices.\n  I would suggest the responsibilities of being in the majority are to \nact, not just to hold press conferences. I think our friends haven't \nquite recognized the fact that they are in charge now. They have a \nresponsibility to act instead of using the same old shop-worn tactics \nof holding a press conference and launching new investigations.\n  In fact, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice \nhave held extensive investigations already and basically concluded the \nproblem is we don't have adequate supply, and we don't have adequate \nrefinery capacity to keep up with the demand. As I noted yesterday, \nCongress can pass a lot of laws. We could even repeal some laws, but we \ncan't repeal the laws of supply and demand. We know that in a booming \nworld economy, where there is competition in India and China, countries \nwith more than a billion people each, as the economies of other \ncountries become more developed, they are going to demand more and more \nof the same limited supply of oil, and that is why we have seen the \nprice of oil and gasoline go up. Rather than hold press conferences, my \nhope is our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, the new majority \nwho is in charge, would work with us to pass legislation which would \nactually have an impact and bring down gasoline prices, bring down oil \nprices, and enhance our national security at the same time.\n  It is no secret to any of us that most--or not most but a lot of the \noil that we import comes from troubled regions of the world. It comes \nfrom Hugo Chavez and Venezuela, it comes from the Middle East, and I \ndon't need to say more about that and how much that supply is \nthreatened at times by the bellicose actions of countries such as Iran, \na rising, they hope, nuclear power. I hope they do not acquire nuclear \ncapacity because they are a State sponsor of international terrorism. \nBut my point is we need to develop more of our domestic resources. We \nneed to look for alternative forms of energy that are clean. We need to \ncontinue our scientific research into things such as clean coal-burning \ntechnology. We have about 300 years' supply of coal in this country, \nand we all know that coal can burn dirty, but the fact is that by using \nthe technological advantages that we have in this country, we can \nconduct the kind of research that will allow us to use this coal in a \nway that does not pollute and does not endanger the environment. The \nfact is we simply can't turn a blind eye to any source of energy and \nremain competitive in the world economy. But the fact is also that we \nare simply not going to solve these problems by holding press \nconferences, as our colleagues are going to do, apparently, this \nafternoon, I think at 2:30 or 3:30. I can't remember when. They did \nthat last year when they were in the minority. They have not quite yet, \nI guess, accepted the fact that on November 7 they won the election and \nthey are now responsible. It means more than holding press conferences; \nit means action.\n\n  I tell my colleagues the Republicans are willing, ready, and able to \nwork with them to try to solve the energy crisis, the gasoline price \ncrisis in this country. It is not going to be easy, but for sure, none \nof us can do it in a partisan way. The only way we are going to be able \nto do it is by working together in the best interests of the American \npeople. I think the American people are more than a little tired of \nsome of the hollow rhetoric when people talk about problems, but when \nyou are in a position to actually do something about it, that nothing \ngets done.\n  As our leader on this side of the aisle, Senator McConnell, has \nnoted, divided Government actually provides an opportunity for us to \ntake on some of these big problems, some of these big challenges that \nare harder to tackle when there is a single party in charge, but it \ntakes a spirit of cooperation. It takes a desire to actually work \ntogether to try to solve these problems the best we can. The energy \nproblem is just one of them. I would say the spiraling debt being \naccumulated by growth and entitlement programs is another one of them.\n  I am very disappointed that this new budget that is going to come to \nthe floor later this week does nothing about passing the buck on \nentitlement spending. As a matter of fact, it imposes additional debt \nand burden on our children and grandchildren when we have the \nresponsibility to pay our own bills, not use Social Security to pay for \nthe general debt, which we are doing now, and other bookkeeping tactics \nthat if we were in the private sector would probably mean that somebody \nwould end up in jail. But the Federal Government plays those sorts of \nbudget gimmicks, and they need to end.\n  So let me end by saying that this is an opportunity for us to work \ntogether but not if we are going to have press conferences and do \nnothing, talk tough but fail to use the tools that are available to us \nin Congress as representatives of our respective States to work \ntogether in a bipartisan way to try to solve them. I think that is what \nthe American people want. That is why I came to the Senate. I wanted to \ndo something. I wanted to actually make a difference. I think all of us \nfeel roughly the same way, but somehow we have fallen into these bad \nhabits of partisanship and avoiding the solutions that are readily at \nhand.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I wish to join my friend from Texas in \ntalking about the interest in energy. I don't think there is anything, \nfrankly, when we look at it, that impacts our future and our jobs and \nour families anymore than energy and its availability. Think about it \nfor a moment, what we actually use, each of us, every day. We drove \nhere in our cars: energy; the lights up here: energy; air-conditioning \nor heat: energy; then, of course, in the whole economy. So I wanted to \ntalk about some of it in the context of high gas prices and, of course, \nAmericans are experiencing that right now.\n  I am on the Energy Committee, and we have passed good energy policy \nin the last couple years. We have already begun to see some of the \nbenefits of that passage, there is no question about that, but there is \nmuch more that can be done. Unfortunately, we have gone along a good \ndeal of the time this year and haven't done much about it, so we need \nto accomplish some things. The high price of gas, of course, touches \nall of us, but it is particularly important in a State such as mine, \nwhere people have to travel so far for school or work or other \nobligations.\n  Yesterday, the Energy Committee, of which I am a member, scheduled a \nhearing on short-term energy outlook for oil and gas. This hearing will \nbe held next week, but that is not enough. Having hearings is not \nenough, as having press conferences is not enough. We need to move \nforward.\n\n[[Page S5758]]\n\n  What is the answer to high gas prices? Of course, the simple \neconomics of it is supply: Supply and demand. One option is to drive \nless, of course, and we can do some of this. We can have more efficient \ncars and those kinds of things. But we must drive to work. We must \ndrive. We have to have energy. So there are some things we can do. But \nthe other issue, and the one we can deal with, is increasing supply. My \nfriend from Texas makes a good point. We get so wrapped up in bills and \namendments sometimes, but we have to ask ourselves: What can we add? \nWhat can we regulate? What needs to be repealed? We cannot repeal the \nlaw of supply and demand. That is where the impact is on the price. \nThat economic fact must inform this debate. We certainly can consume \nour energy in more efficient ways, and we should do that. I support \nthose efforts. I am glad to be a cosponsor of a bill, S. 992, that does \nthat. But we also have to pass alternative fuels, and I am for that. \nBut I think we have to be honest on alternative fuels as to what kind \nof an impact that is going to have in a relatively short time. I am all \nfor these kinds of things, whether it is wind or Sun or whatever, but \nit is years down the road before it will be able to do the kinds of \nvolume that is necessary for energy.\n  So I think my real point is that in the meantime, as we look for \nalternatives, as we look for various things, there are things we can do \nnow, and that is what we need to do to deal with our needs in the \ninterim while these other things are being decided.\n  So I am hopeful the majority will bring legislation to the floor that \nallows us to provide Americans with secure, affordable, and responsible \nsources of energy. I am convinced that unless we move forward, the \nmajority is not moving in this direction, and I think we must.\n  Last week, we marked up a biofuels bill in the Energy Committee. The \nbill focused on ethanol from corn and feed stuffs, and that is a good \nthing.\n  However, these fuels raise the cost of corn. They raise the cost of \nlivestock feed and, subsequently, meat and other groceries. They cannot \nbe transported in our existing system. You cannot put ethanol into \npipelines and move it. The advanced technologies are not commercialized \nanywhere yet in the world.\n  Along with Senator Bunning, I offered an amendment to add coal-to-\nliquids, and coal-to-liquids don't suffer from the same shortcomings as \nethanol. It will have no impact on the affordability of food. It can be \ndelivered through existing pipelines.\n  Coal is available as one of our most abundant resources, as a matter \nof fact. It is the most plentiful supply of fossil fuels we have in \nthis country. Coal has the potential to be converted to liquids and \nfluids and to electricity on the spot. These are the things which need \nto be done.\n  We spent most of 2 hours talking about this amendment, and it \nreceived a great deal of support. However, when it came down to it, it \nwas a party-line vote of 12 to 11, and it was defeated. So I will bring \nit to the floor when the Energy bill comes.\n  I think we need to look at the short-term impact. Here is one--\nconversion of coal to liquids--that can work. We are doing some of it \nnow to a small degree. In Wyoming, we are developing a refinery that \nwill take coal and turn it into diesel fuel. Interestingly enough, we \nhad support from a number of agencies or organizations that you would \nnot necessarily imagine in that, including the AFL-CIO building \nconstruction trades, AFL-CIO Industrial Union Council, Air \nTransportation Association. All these people know how important it is \nto have energy and to have it available. There is a list of about 15 \ngroups of this kind that are supportive. They are not oil supporters \nnecessarily; they are businesspeople who know that to meet our needs, \nwe have to have energy.\n  Let me read from the letter they wrote:\n\n       In this century, America cannot be secure unless its energy \n     supplies are secure. Fostering greater reliance on domestic \n     energy is a national security imperative. The Nation's \n     abundant and affordable coal reserves, matched with the \n     proven technology, can put America on the path to energy \n     independence by dramatically reducing our growing dependence \n     on imported oil and reducing our burgeoning trade deficit. \n     Domestic production of coal-to-liquids fuels will see \n     billions of dollars invested in new investments made in the \n     United States and create thousands of new jobs.\n\n  That is not the end of the letter, but that is the message from \ngroups that are not directly involved in energy but know the impacts of \nthe shortage of energy. I could not agree more with the role these \nfolks see in the future.\n  Senator Bunning and I have been asked to refrain from offering our \namendment, but we did not wait. We believe strongly in the purpose of \nthe Energy Committee to develop the best possible approach we can in \ndealing with the energy problem and dealing with it not only in the \nlong-term but in the shorter term until we reach the longer term goals \nthat may be there. So we didn't achieve our goal there. That is why we \nwant to move forward with this and see if we can't get coal-to-liquids \nin our energy policy and get some incentives to move forward. I want to \nwork in a bipartisan way to address the current concerns our Members \nhave. I hope we have the opportunity to revisit this issue.\n  Americans are suffering from high fuel prices. We should do \neverything we can to remedy that situation. We have to do more than \njust talk about it; we need to make a move to take our largest fossil \nfuel resource and make it available for domestic production.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL.

Madam President, I come to the floor this morning with \na lot of enthusiasm for the progress we are making in various \ncommittees toward an energy policy we can discuss on the Senate floor \nwhich will eventually lead us to greater energy independence. I am very \nexcited about this prospect; especially since I participated in the \n2005 energy legislation, which was passed with great bipartisan \nsupport. We worked together to enact this groundbreaking energy bill in \n2005, which greatly benefitted my State by giving tax credits to \nalternative energy technologies--wind and solar--and aided in the \nfurther development and broadened use of biodiesel and including the \nconstruction of a 100 million-gallon biodiesel facility in Washington \nState.\n  There were many great things about the 2005 Energy bill but the fact \nthat stood out to me the most was that it was a bipartisan effort. I do \nwish that there had been a much more aggressive effort on energy \nindependence then, but I think today we are on the cusp of achieving \nthis important goal.\n  Senator Reid has been very specific since the beginning of this \nlegislative year that he wants energy independence to be a key \npriority. In fact, there are six different committees that are working \non energy legislation today: the Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry \nCommittee, the Finance Committee, the Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation Committee, the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nthe Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee. All of these committees are \nworking hard on legislation, and more importantly, they are working on \nlegislation in a bipartisan fashion. In fact, two of these committees \nhave reported out significant energy legislation, working across the \naisle ensure that we are getting the best ideas onto the Senate floor \nand continuing to discuss those ideas on which we have not yet been \nable to reach consensus.\n  Yesterday was undoubtedly a historic day because it marked the first \ntime in 20 years, that we have been able to, in a very bipartisan way, \nput a CAFE bill on the Senate floor--which I hope we will be discussing \nsoon--that actually increases the fuel efficiency standards of \nautomobiles and hopefully lowers our consumption of foreign oil. If we \ncan move from the current miles-per-\n\n[[Page S5759]]\n\ngallon standard of 25 miles today to 35 miles in a 10-year period, this \nwould unquestionably be a great accomplishment.\n  Attached to this legislation is also very important consumer \nprotection legislation that provides the Federal Trade Commission the \ntools it needs to protect consumers against price gouging. With our \ncurrent statutes, the FTC has the ability to investigate certain cases \non the basis of antitrust laws, which are based on whether we think oil \ncompanies are colluding to set prices. What we really have to question \nis whether the companies may be conducting activities that actually \ntake supply offline and thereby decrease the supply, leading to \nshortages at the pump. Therefore we need to give the FTC the authority \nit needs through this legislation and make sure consumers are \nprotected.\n  This legislation, as part of a package, was passed unanimously out of \nthe Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee yesterday. It was \nthe result of a bipartisan effort, led by the work of the chairman, \nSenator Inouye, and the ranking member, Senator Stevens. Unfortunately \ncertain provision did not make it into the final version of this bill, \nhowever I firmly believe that it is a historic and important piece of \nbipartisan legislation that will come to the Senate floor for all of us \nto discuss.\n  Just recently, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee passed \nanother very positive landmark legislation which relates to setting a \nhigher mandate on biofuels. In the last Energy bill we were able to \npass, we stipulated that we should have a goal of producing 7\\1/2\\ \nbillion gallons of biofuel a year by 2012. Both the President and the \nCongress are trying to achieve a higher goal. In this legislation, that \nsets the goal that by 2022, we would actually have a mandate of having \n36 billion gallons of alternative fuel produced in this country. I \nfirmly believe that this is a realistic goal and an achievable mandate \nfor us, and that it will aid in starting mass-production of alternative \nfuels in this country.\n  In addition, that legislation had money for what we call a biofuels \ninfrastructure--how we do actually get this product out to the consumer \nand to the corridors of transportation so the public does not have to \nworry about where they can fill up their cars. Thanks in part to this \nlegislation we will have the infrastructure to do that.\n  In the Commerce Committee, we also produced legislation focusing on \nflex-fuel cars so that, by 2015, 80 percent of the cars being driven on \nour roads will be flex-fueled. These are vehicles that could either use \ngasoline or an alternative fuel.\n  We have also passed legislation now for studying plug-in hybrids and \nmaking sure the plug-in hybrid research continues to move ahead.\n  In the Energy bill, we also included language about carbon \nsequestration, making sure we move ahead so carbon sequestration \nbecomes a reality. Again, this is an important issue and it is a very \nimportant bill to my colleagues in various parts of the country in \nwhich we have an ample supply of coal. I commend Senators Domenici and \nBingaman for working so closely together. That legislation also was \npassed in a bipartisan effort. It is a great compliment to those two \ndistinguished Senators who worked so closely on the last Energy bill to \nyet produce another Energy bill.\n  We are in a position to make a very positive impact on what I think \nis one of the biggest challenges we face, getting off our \noverdependence on foreign oil and providing sources of cleaner energy. \nWe are well poised to take up that debate here on the Senate floor with \nthis landmark bipartisan legislation out of two different committees.\n  We will have a lot of work to do across the aisle. We still have \ngreat opportunities to see legislation out of those other four \ncommittees I mentioned that will contribute to this energy package. But \nwe should embrace the opportunity the President laid out in his State \nof the Union Address when he said that he wanted to make sure we had a \nhigher fuel efficiency standard and that we also set a higher renewable \nfuel standard, and that is exactly what we are doing now.\n  I personally think we should also set a renewable standard for the \namount of electricity we use from our electricity grid to further \nreduce our dependence on fossil fuel. These are topics that will be \ndebated. I am sure later in the year we will have an important debate \nabout climate change. But for now we are making great progress. I hope \nmy colleagues will focus on the fact that this energy bill gives us \nanother opportunity to work together here on the Senate floor and put \nreal energy solutions before the American public.\n  Right now, with gas prices reaching $4, Americans want to know we are \ngoing to have an aggressive policy, not only giving them consumer \nprotections but better planning for the future so our economy can \nbenefit from alternative sources of fuel.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/09/senate-section/article/S5759-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5759]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 1082, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1082) to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act to reauthorize and amend the prescription drug \n     user fee provisions, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Brown (for Grassley) amendment No. 1039, to clarify the \n     authority of the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology with \n     respect to postmarket drug safety pursuant to recommendations \n     by the Institute of Medicine.\n       Brown (for Grassley) amendment No. 998, to provide for the \n     application of stronger civil penalties for violations of \n     approved risk evaluation and mitigation strategies.\n       Brown (for Durbin/Bingaman) amendment No. 1034, to reduce \n     financial conflict of interest in FDA Advisory Panels.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I yield myself 6 minutes of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, we will see later this morning the \nsuccessful conclusion of this legislation. We have some important \nmatters to consider, which we will do in a very short period of time. \nBut as we are coming into the closing time for this amendment, I think \nit is appropriate that we review very quickly what this legislation \ndoes and what it does not do.\n  I am a strong believer in this legislation, which has strong \nbipartisan support. I am enormously grateful to Senator Enzi and \nMembers on our side of the aisle as well as those on the other side for \nall of their help and assistance in getting us to the point where we \nare ready to take final action on something that makes a major \ndifference to families in America. We ensure the safety of our \nprescription drug system and also are making very important progress in \nthe safety of our food supply.\n  This is, in an important way, breakthrough legislation. I will review \nquickly what this does and then come back to the amendments that are \nbefore the Senate and how we think the Senate should dispose of them; \nwhy this legislation is urgent, why it is extremely important, and why \nthe American people deserve the best.\n  Very quickly, again, there is strong emphasis on safer food and safer \nmedicines for families in this country. We spelled out at the earlier \npart of our presentations the effective systems we have supported to \nmake sure we are going to have the safest prescription drug program in \nthe world, using different kinds of modern technologies and also modern \nsurveillance systems for monitoring postmarketing safety. This will \nensure in the future we are going to have the safest prescription drug \nprogram in the world. We will have safer medicines.\n  We will also have safer food for families and pets. I think all \nAmericans have been alarmed, as they should have\n\n[[Page S5760]]\n\nbeen, by what has been reported in the news in the last few weeks. Many \nfamilies have lost their pets because the agency lacked the authorities \nprovided in this bill.\n\n  We will have earlier warnings on drug safety problems using extremely \nelaborate systems of postmarketing surveillance. These systems will use \nboth public and private centers to collect information that the FDA \nwill use to find early warnings of possible harm. In these cases, the \nagency will be able to take expeditious action. That has never been \ndone before.\n  We are going to have better medicines for children. We are enormously \nappreciative of the excellent work that has been done by Senator Dodd \nand Senator Clinton. This was done in a bipartisan way with Senator \nDeWine, who is not here. We all realize that children are not little \npeople; children are children, and therefore their bodies react \ndifferently to various kinds of prescription drugs. This legislation \nprovides mechanisms to get information on safe and effective use of \nmedications in children as well as to promote studies of drugs in \npediatric populations. In the past few years, we have made enormous \nprogress and we believe this legislation will help to an even greater \nextent.\n  We are going to have more transparency and stronger science at the \nFDA because of the wonderful work done by Senator Mikulski. She and \nothers worked to assure that we have greater awareness by the public of \nwhat is happening at the agency.\n  There is greater focus and attention on making sure the agency is \ngoing to have the best in terms of the new sciences. We are in the life \nscience century at the present time. This has been impressed on the \ncountry with the extraordinary convention on biosciences that took \nplace in Boston in the last few days. There I listened and read about \nthe potential the life sciences have, not only in terms of energy and \nagriculture but also in terms of medicines. The United States is \nabsolutely poised to continue to be the world leader in these fields, \nwith all of its implications of healthier families here and around the \nworld.\n  We need to make sure we are going to have the best kind of science at \nthe FDA. We do that in the way we have given greater authority over the \ndevelopment of the science function at FDA. We also provided a rather \nunique foundation that will be able to use public and private funding. \nThis foundation will seek out the best and the newest modalities to \nhelp speed the review of various prescription drugs. That is going to \nbe enormously important because time means cost. If we are able to \nresolve these issues more quickly the costs will be more understandable \nand reasonable to consumers and we will get them faster.\n  Briefly to comment on some of the amendments, we have taken a \nposition in our proposal that both the safety and efficacy of \nparticular prescription drugs is a function that ought to be considered \nin tandem. I know there are those who think we ought to separate those \nfunctions. We can imagine a circumstance, for example, where the side \nreaction of a particular drug is that individuals lose all of their \nhair and they become nauseated. Clearly I am describing the impact of \nmethotrexate. That can happen to an individual on many anticancer \ndrugs. You wouldn't prescribe that for athlete's foot because the side \neffects are so dramatic, but you would approve that for another kind of \nregime to try to treat cancer.\n  We also have items on civil penalties for the first time. There is a \nquestion of what those civil penalties should be. I want them to be \nhigher, but I am mindful as well that this is the first time we are \ngoing to have those civil penalties. We are going to be working on \nthose matters with the House. I basically think they should be a little \nhigher, but I listened to my colleague on this issue and we are going \nto try to make sure we get something that is going to be fair and can \ndo the job.\n  I am also mindful of the concern we have in terms of the potential of \nconflicts of interest. I will reserve my time to be able to deal with \nthis issue.\n  This is a very important issue. We want to make sure, on the one \nhand, as we have these breakthroughs in science, that we are going to \nhave the best experts participating in these review groups. We also \nhave to be sensitive to the issues of conflicts of interests. I know \nthe Senator from Illinois has a proposal on this.\n  I will reserve the rest of my time to be able to discuss that later.\n\n\n                      elements to assure safe use\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President I rise to engage in a colloquy with \nthe Senator from Wyoming and ranking member of the Senate Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Senator Enzi.\n  First, I would like to thank the chairman and the ranking member of \nthe HELP Committee for their efforts to address the issue of access to \nhealth care in frontier areas. Much of Alaska is a frontier area and it \nis not an easy task to access health care in general, let alone find a \nspecialist to obtain needed medications.\n  Toward that end, I am pleased that the bill before us today \nrecognizes the problem of access and provides a willing provider in a \nfrontier area with the ability to receive the training and \ncertification necessary to prescribe a drug that has potential serious \nrisks. For clarification purposes, I would like to ask the Senator from \nWyoming if it is the intent of Congress that section 202 of S. 1082, \nthe FDA Revitalization Act, allows all physician and nonphysician \nhealth care providers in frontier areas to be able to receive \n``training or certification'' so that the provider can prescribe or \ndispense a particular drug without the need for an additional degree or \nmedical specialty?\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes. This is the intent.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. And under the provisions of section 202, would the \nwilling health care provider be able to receive this training or \ncertification through remote learning methods so that a provider would \nnot need to travel vast distances in order to get the requisite \ntraining?\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes. The language in the bill recognizes that travel in \nfrontier areas, particularly in remote places such as Alaska, can be \ntime-consuming and expensive, so it specifically notes that the \ntraining or certification should be available in a widely available \ntraining or certification method, such as an online course or through \nthe mail. This is intended to reduce the amount of travel and expense a \nwilling provider in a frontier area must undertake in order to be able \nto prescribe or dispense needed medicines to their\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Senator. And since the provider would not \nbe required to obtain an additional degree or medical specialty, and \nthe training or certification would hopefully be through an online \ncourse or through the mail, is there any indication of how long such \ntraining would take for the provider to be deemed sufficiently trained \nto prescribe a specific drug?\n  Mr. ENZI. While I cannot give the Senator a guaranteed time frame, I \nwould point out that the training and certification is specifically for \nthe drug the provider is seeking to prescribe or dispense--not for a \nrange of drugs. Thus, the time frame should not be a lengthy one, \nparticularly if the training can be conducted online.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Now, I understand that many physicians around the \ncountry are invited to attend conferences or training seminars in order \nto be certified to prescribe certain drugs. Given the low volume of the \nhigh risk drugs we are talking about that are likely to be dispensed in \nfrontier areas, how can we ensure that a willing provider will be able \nto access this training? What is the incentive for a drug manufacturer \nor the FDA to include frontier area among the areas where training and \ncertification would be available?\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator for that question. The language in the \nbill specifically says that the training or certification shall be \navailable to any willing provider from a frontier area. Shall be \navailable--not may be available, but shall. It is the intent of \nCongress in this section to direct the FDA to guarantee that a willing \nprovider will have access to the training and certification needed to \nprescribe a particular drug. And again, the language that encourages \nthe availability of an online course or course through the mail is one \nway to provide for that training or certification at minimal cost.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Senator for that clarification. I bring \nthis colloquy to the Senate floor today because I want to ensure that \nevery\n\n[[Page S5761]]\n\nAmerican has access to prescription drugs regardless of whether they \nlive in a large urban city like New York, or a frontier community like \nBethel, AK. I believe that with the modifications that have been made \nto this bill, we will be able to achieve that.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I am pleased to support S. 1082, the \nFood and Drug Administration Revitalization Act of 2007. This much-\nneeded legislation improves our country's prescription drug and medical \ndevice safety, and responds to problems that Congress is long overdue \nin addressing. This legislation strengthens the Food and Drug \nAdministration, a body that has been continually underfunded and \nweakened by political and corporate interests. While I would like to \nsee an even stronger bill passed, this legislation drastically improves \nour current policies that regulate the FDA.\n  My constituents in Wisconsin largely trust that their food, \nmedications, and medical devices are safe. I generally trust that they \nare as well. We all depend on the FDA to ensure that our lives are not \njeopardized by faulty products or contaminated food. However, recently \na steady stream of dangerous drugs, food, and devices have made their \nway into Americans' homes. Vioxx, antidepressant drugs for children, \nsalmonella poisoning in food, pet food contaminations--these are just a \nfew of the most publicized instances that have harmed and even killed \npeople in our country.\n  Numerous investigations have been conducted in order to better \nunderstand why these events have occurred. The conclusions to these \nstudies have found that we need a better FDA. We need to provide the \nagency with the legal authority necessary to ensure our safety, and we \nneed to provide the FDA with the necessary funding to do its job. It is \nclear that the agency's authority has been watered down over the years \nas a result of corporate influence, and our citizens have suffered the \nconsequences. This bill takes important steps to put safety over profit \nmargins, and it has been long awaited.\n  I commend the immense bipartisan effort that has been put into \ncrafting this legislation. This is not an easy topic to tackle. It is a \ncomplex topic rife with political infighting, but today we have \nlegislation that both parties and even many companies are fine with. \nGranted, the bill may be too far-reaching for some, and for others like \nme, it doesn't necessarily go far enough, but this is something that \nwill pass that is a vast improvement from current law.\n  I was glad to support Senator Durbin's amendment to improve the FDA's \noversight and ability to respond to contaminated pet food. Like the \nbill as a whole, I think we need to do more to ensure that the \ningredients used in both pet and human food are free from \ncontamination, but this amendment was an important step in the right \ndirection. The amendment strengthens the standards for pet food \nprocessing and ingredients and at the same time improves the FDA's \nability to react to a problem through better detection, an adulterated \nfood registry, and improved communication with the public. I hope this \nwill be a platform for improving Federal oversight of the human food \nsupply, which has been shown many times over the last year to be at \nrisk.\n  In my home State of Wisconsin, the outbreak of E.coli last summer, \nlater linked to bagged spinach, killed an elderly woman and sickened at \nleast fifty others. The spinach was traced back to four fields on four \nranches in California. The FDA itself admits that ``There has been a \nlong history of E. coli O157:H7 outbreaks involving leafy greens from \nthe central California region'', and yet mostly depends on the industry \nto self-regulate. In fact, on the FDA Web site about this particular \noutbreak, it says, ``[the] FDA and the State of California expect the \nindustry to develop a comprehensive plan which is designed to minimize \nthe risk of another outbreak.'' I am concerned that all too often the \nFDA is allowing the food industry to dictate the rules and whether to \nimplement food safety protections. This bill is a step in the right \ndirection, but more steps are likely needed and I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on these.\n  Along these lines, I was glad to offer an amendment and have it \naccepted in the bill that would require the FDA to resume annual \nreports on the level of pesticide residues in domestic and imported \nfood and agricultural products. Moreover, my amendment requires the FDA \nto make the report more useful for Congress and the public. \nSpecifically the amendment requires the FDA to work with other agencies \nto include similar data collected by other government agencies, conduct \nmore advanced statistical analysis, report on efforts to prevent \nsmuggling through mislabeling one product as another, and target future \ntesting on products or countries, in the case of exports, that show \nrelatively more prohibited pesticides. The recent headlines about \ncontaminated Chinese wheat gluten clearly show a need to get a better \nhandle on food safety. So it clearly wasn't the time for the FDA to end \nreporting on pesticide residues and this amendment follows the larger \ntheme of the bill in improving our food safety oversight.\n  While this pesticide residue amendment is important to improve \nconsumers' confidence in the food they eat, it also can be important \nfor U.S. farmers. For example, Wisconsin's ginseng growers have \nsuffered a double insult over the past few years--facing unfair \ncompetition from imported ginseng that was treated with chemicals \nillegal in the U.S. and then often having that ginseng misbranded as \nthe superior quality Wisconsin ginseng. My amendment and the improved \npesticide residue data and ability to focus on certain products should \nhelp FDA identify and seize unsafe products such as contaminated \nginseng imports.\n  On another note, I am disappointed that the bill does not actually \nallow importing lower cost prescription drugs. While the Dorgan-Snowe \namendment was accepted in the bill, it was modified and effectively \nnullified by the Cochran amendment, which I strongly opposed\n  A competitive marketplace for prescription drugs will help in \ncontaining the skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs. Over the past \n4 years, I have worked in a bipartisan fashion to allow the safe \nimportation of prescription drugs from abroad. I am a proud cosponsor \nof the Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act, which the \nprovisions in the Dorgan-Snowe amendment were based on. This \nlegislation would have allowed the importation of FDA-approved drugs \nfrom countries with FDA-comparable regulations, such as Canada. This \nlegislation will finally allow the importation of safe and affordable \nprescriptions drugs to the United States.\n  As I travel around Wisconsin listening to people's concerns, the high \ncost of health care continues to be at the top of the list, and this \nincludes prescription drugs. The strong bipartisan support for \nreimportation makes clear that Americans of all political backgrounds \nwant the Federal Government to support consumers, rather than the \ninterests of drug companies, and make safe and affordable prescription \ndrugs available to those who need them. The failure to include strong \nreimportation legislation in this bill is unfortunate, but we are \ngetting closer to enacting reimportation with each vote. I fully expect \nthis to pass in the near future, and I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting efforts to legalize reimportation. As I stated earlier, I \nwill support the final FDA Revitalization Act, but I am disappointed \nthat strong reimportation language is not included.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I appreciate the attention to drug \nsafety on the part of Senators Kennedy and Enzi. The drug safety \nproblems our nation experienced surrounding Vioxx and the SSRIs \ndemanded that we take a serious look at the FDA.\n  I appreciate the hundreds and hundreds of staff hours that have gone \ninto working on this legislation both before and after the HELP \nCommittee markup.\n  When the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee marked up \nthis legislation, I strongly opposed it. I appreciate the willingness \nof Senators Kennedy and Enzi to listen to my concerns and take action \nto address them. Many of the changes I requested are included in the \nfinal product that we vote on today.\n  This bill has come a very long ways since its consideration in the \nHELP Committee. Instead of requiring a risk evaluation and mitigation \nstrategy, REMS, for every drug, a REMS may\n\n[[Page S5762]]\n\nonly be requested when there is a scientific reason for one. In giving \nnew regulatory authority to the FDA, we must be extremely cautious that \nwe do not hurt access to new and innovative prescription drugs.\n  I appreciate that the concept, introduced by Senators Gregg, Burr, \nand myself, to establish a surveillance system for adverse prescription \ndrug events has been included in this legislation. This will now allow \ncooperation with academic institutions that have the expertise to \nevaluate the signals from that surveillance system and ensure that both \npatients and doctors have the information they need to make decisions \nabout the risks and benefits of medical drugs.\n  As a practicing physician, I know that it is impossible to ever \ncompletely eliminate drug risks. The right approach is to provide \naccurate risk information and preserve the doctor-patient relationship. \nI appreciate the progress made in the bill towards this end.\n  I appreciate the willingness of Senators Kennedy and Enzi to work \nwith me on preserving the doctor-patient relationship. The FDA's job is \nto approve drugs as safe and effective--not to dictate which doctors \ncan prescribe which drugs to which patients. Medicine is not just a \nscience; it is also an art.\n  This legislation will ensure that patients have access to potentially \nlifesaving drugs that might not otherwise be approved because of known \nadverse events caused by the drug. This legislation establishes that \nthe agency will not limit or restrict distribution or use unless a drug \nhas been shown to actually cause an adverse event.\n  I also appreciate the efforts of my colleague Senator Roberts in \npreserving the right to commercial free speech, as intended by the \nConstitution, in direct-to-consumer, DTC, advertising. While I am not a \nbig fan of DTC, I am a big fan of the Constitution. I am pleased that a \ncompromise was reached to remove the ban on DTC from this bill and \ninstead ensure that drug companies are held accountable if their \nadvertisements are false or misleading.\n  I appreciate the willingness of Senators Kennedy and Enzi to accept \nan amendment that will provide a date certain for a safety evaluation \nof the drug RU-486.\n  The two user fee agreements for prescription drugs and medical \ndevices, PDUFA and MDUFMA, have been negotiated between industry \nrepresentatives and the FDA. The industry indicates what it will pay \nfor faster drug approvals and the FDA commits to achievable performance \ngoals.\n  I appreciate the work of FDA Commissioner Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach \nin crafting fair and reasonable proposals for both prescription drug \nand medical device companies. It is critical that we focus on public \nhealth and safety, and also hold the FDA accountable for improved \nagency performance goals. Maintaining timely and efficient patient \naccess to lifesaving and life-enhancing medical drugs and devices is a \nwin for the industry, doctors, and patients. I look forward to seeing \nhow the new performance goals in both the PDUFA and MDUFMA agreements \nwill both help keep the pipeline of innovation moving forward and \nimprove communication and understanding between agency staff and \nmanufacturers.\n  I can vote in favor of this legislation today because of the enormous \nprogress made. However, there are some workability issues with both the \nBest Pharmaceuticals for Children Act and the Pediatric Research \nImprovement Act. These issues need to be resolved so that the FDA has \nthe authority to do its job quickly and effectively.\n  The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, BPCA, has generated more \nclinical information for the pediatric population than any other \nlegislative or regulatory effort to date. I am concerned about this \nreauthorization of the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act because \nchips away at incentives that have been getting real results for kids.\n  I am also concerned that part of the bill, pediatric medical devices, \nwould authorize $30 million in demonstration grants for improving the \navailability of pediatric devices. While this has a worthy goal, more \naccountability is needed for this program to ensure that such grants \nare used for helping save the lives of children. Additionally, the \nbill's sponsors failed to do their homework in examining existing \nFederal programs. The fact is, the National Institutes of Health \nalready has a program for this purpose. In order to preserve a heritage \nfor our grandchildren, Congress needs to do the hard work of taking an \ninventory of existing programs before we authorize new ones.\n  Again, I appreciate the enormous amount of work that has gone into \nimproving this legislation. It is critical that in addressing drug \nsafety that we do not harm access to new and lifesaving medical \ntechnologies.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I rise to support passage of the committee \nsubstitute to S. 1082, the Food and Drug Administration Revitalization \nAct, FDARA. This legislation contains tremendous advances for children \nand their families through the reauthorization of the Best \nPharmaceuticals for Children Act, BPCA, and the Pediatric Medical \nDevice Safety and Improvement Act, which I authored, as well as the \nreauthorization of the Pediatric Research Equity Act, PREA, which was \nintroduced by my colleague, Senator Clinton.\n  I congratulate Chairman Kennedy and Ranking Member Enzi for their \nefforts in putting this complex bill together and thank them both for \nworking with me to ensure these vital programs for children can thrive \nwell into the future.\n  We have had good debate on this legislation. I want to thank my \nfriend from Colorado, Senator Allard, for the floor debate we had on \nBPCA. I want to assure him and those that voted for his amendment that \nthis bill is about increasing pediatric clinical trials and improving \nour knowledge about products being used in children where previously we \nhave had no information. BPCA is and has always been about striking an \nappropriate balance between the cost to consumers and benefits to \nchildren.\n  Ten years ago when Senator Mike DeWine and I undertook this effort, \nonly 11 drugs on the market that were being used in children had \nactually been tested and studied for their use. Prior to the enactment \nof BPCA 10 years ago, pediatricians were essentially flying blind \nbecause they lacked information regarding the safety and effectiveness \nof drugs they were prescribing for children. But it was children who \nsuffered the most from taking drugs where so little was known about \ntheir effects.\n  What we have learned over the past 10 years of experience is that \nchildren have been exposed to ineffective drugs, ineffective dosing, \noverdosing, or side effects from drugs that were previously unknown. In \n10 years, nearly 800 studies involving more than 45,000 children in \nclinical trials have been completed. Useful new pediatric information \nis now part of product labeling for more than 119 drugs. In sum, there \nhas been a twentyfold increase in the number of drugs studied in \ninfants, children, and adolescents as a result of BPCA since its \nenactment.\n  Children with a wide range of diseases such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, \nallergies, asthma, neurological and psychiatric disorders, and obesity \ncan now lead healthier, more productive lives as a result of new \ninformation about the safety and efficacy of drugs they use to treat \nand manage their diseases where previously there was none.\n  This successful program for children will expire on September 30 \nunless we act to reauthorize it.\n  The reauthorization of BPCA contained within S. 1082, makes several \nimportant improvements to this program which I have spent many months \ndeveloping. It is my belief that these improvements will help ensure \nthat this program continues to thrive well into the future. I strongly \nsupport the 5-year authorization of this program so that we can closely \nmonitor how the program is working and make improvements as they are \nneeded in the future.\n  S. 1082 will increase the amount and quality of pediatric information \nby streamlining BPCA and PREA at the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, \nand ensuring that labeling changes as a result of BPCA are communicated \nto physicians. S. 1082 will improve transparency and accountability by \nmaking market exclusivity determinations and written requests for \npediatric studies public within 30 days of exclusivity being awarded. \nIt also will improve the accuracy and speed of labeling changes\n\n[[Page S5763]]\n\nby requiring such changes to be made within the FDA's timeline and \nensuring that labeling reflects the results of the BPCA study that was \nconducted.\n  S. 1082 will ensure that BPCA continues to yield more and better drug \nstudies in children, while addressing the minority of cases where the \nincentive of 6 months additional market exclusivity has far exceeded \nthe ``carrot'' it was intended to provide to drug sponsors. It improves \nmarket certainty by not allowing pediatric exclusivity to be granted \nwithin nine months of the end of the drug's patent and increases data \nabout the use and applicability of BPCA through reports conducted by \nthe Institute of Medicine, IOM, and the Government Accountability \nOffice to review the program and assess the impact of the changes made \nwithin the legislation.\n  BPCA has shown us that it is unsafe to simply treat children as \nsmaller versions of adults. Children face a similar inequity with \nrespect to medical devices. Far too few medical devices are \nspecifically designed for children's small and growing bodies. Experts \nsay that the development of children's medical devices lags 5 to 10 \nyears behind that of adults. That is largely due to the limited size of \nthe market for pediatric devices.\n  When a medical device suitable for a child is needed to save that \nchild's life but it does not exist, doctors are often forced to ``jury-\nrig'' adult versions of the device or, in some cases, perform a riskier \nsurgery on the child. Ventilator masks, for instance, are far too large \nto fit over a baby's mouth. Often, the only alternative is to run an \ninvasive tube down the baby's throat.\n  Because of what we witnessed over the past ten years with the market \nincentives provided under BPCA, I introduced an initiative called the \nPediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act to create similar \nincentives for device manufacturers. This legislation also streamlines \nthe approval process for cutting-edge technology and establishes grants \nfor matchmaking between inventors and manufacturers and the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Balancing incentives with safety, the legislation closely mirrors \nrecommendations made by the IOM in its 2005 report on pediatric medical \ndevice safety to improve the serious flaws in the current postmarket \nsafety surveillance of these devices. Specifically, the IOM called for \nand the legislation allows the FDA to require postmarket studies as a \ncondition of clearance or approval for certain categories of devices \nand it gives the FDA the ability to require studies longer than 3 years \nwith respect to a device that is to have significant use in pediatric \npopulations if such studies would be necessary to address longer term \npediatric questions, such as the impact on growth and development.\n  Some in the medical device industry continue to offer proposals to \nchip away at the authorities in the legislation intended to ensure the \nFDA can request manufacturers to conduct postmarket safety \nsurveillances and ensure devices used in children are safe. I am \ndisheartened by anyone who would attempt to deprive children and \nphysicians of information that pertains to device safety and I will \nstrongly oppose attempts to weaken the postmarket safety standards \ncontained within the legislation as the bill heads to conference.\n  The faster we can get new, safe pediatric devices to market, the \nfewer parents have to stake their children's lives on improvisation and \nguesswork.\n  I have previously mentioned the broad-ranging support for these \nimportant initiatives for children but it is worth restating that the \nlevel of support from pediatricians, patient advocacy organizations, \ndrug and device companies, and many others indicates that this \nimportant legislation will greatly benefit children and their families.\n  I want to thank the tremendous work of the staff on this bill. They \nhave devoted countless hours and many weekends to working on this \nlegislation. Specifically, I want to thank David Bowen and David Dorsey \nwith Senator Kennedy and Shana Christrup, Keith Flanagan and Amy \nMuhlberg with Senator Enzi who worked so closely with my office on the \npediatrics initiatives in title IV of this legislation. I also want to \nthank Kate Leone with Senator Harry Reid whose terrific leadership \nhelped guide this legislation to passage.\n  I also want to acknowledge the leadership of the American Academy of \nPediatrics and the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation whose \nstaff, Mark Del Monte, Jeanne Ireland and Elaine Vining, have provided \ntremendous technical assistance on the pediatrics initiatives in S. \n1082.\n  Before I close I want to address the other provision in this \nlegislation which reauthorizes vital user fee programs at the FDA for \ndrugs and devices and addresses the important issue of drug safety at \nthe FDA, an agency that regulates 25 percent of the products consumed \nby Americans. In recent years, we have witnessed a public crisis of \nconfidence in the FDA's ability to ensure that the drugs taken by \nmillions of Americans are safe and effective once they are on the \nmarket. My colleagues and I on the Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions, HELP, Committee heard testimony about the internal crisis \nwithin the scientific community at the FDA about inappropriate \ninfluences on decisionmaking.\n  I was deeply troubled by the recent Union of Concerned Scientists \nstudy showing that of nearly 1,000 FDA scientists questioned, 420 \nreported that they knew of cases in which the Department of Health and \nHuman Services or FDA political appointees have inappropriately \ninjected themselves into FDA determinations or actions. The same study \nalso found that 378 FDA scientists disagreed or strongly disagreed that \nthe FDA is acting effectively to protect public health. With Vioxx, \nantidepressants in children, and now Ketek, the FDA has repeatedly been \naccused of suppressing internal safety concerns and ignoring repeated \nwarnings of safety concerns from the FDA's own scientists.\n  We need to restore the public trust in this vital agency, rid it of \nundue influences that benefit a political, rather than a public health, \nagenda, and, above all, we need to adequately fund the FDA through the \nappropriations process so that the agency is less reliant on user fees \ncollected from private industry. Congress must act swiftly to give the \nFDA more resources. That, I believe, is how we maintain the FDA as the \nworld's gold standard in drug and device safety.\n  Senator Grassley and I authored one of the first drug safety and \nclinical trials bills in the Senate in the wake of the Vioxx scandal \nthat would have given FDA's office of postmarket drug surveillance the \nindependence, stature and funding to take action when a safety problem \narises. We reintroduced the bill this congress with several colleagues \non the HELP Committee including Senators Mikulski and Bingaman and I \nthank them for their support. While I do not agree with some of my \ncolleagues who have argued that this authority would create a bigger \nbureaucracy at the FDA, our experience showed us that the support to \nmove such a proposal simply wasn't there.\n  However, I believe that my colleagues and I were able to make \nsignificant improvements to S. 1082 with respect to drug safety. I \nbelieve those improvements will strengthen science at the FDA, improve \ntransparency of decisionmaking so that dissenting views can be heard, \nand improve safety of drugs once they are on the market.\n  The drug safety and clinical trials components of S. 1082 are by no \nmeans perfect. In fact, I have serious concerns about what I view as \ninadequate enforcement authority in the bill and am particularly \nconcerned about whether the bill will prevent companies from \nwithholding information about clinical trials which were negative or \nwere trials that companies abandoned because initial results were \nnegative. As demonstrated by Ketek, I am also concerned about whether \nthis bill does enough to capture clinical trials conducted overseas. I \nhope we can improve on these provisions when this bill goes to \nconference with the House.\n  Today the Senate voted on an important issue dealing with conflicts \nof interest on FDA advisory committees. As demonstrated by the FDA \nadvisory committee considering Vioxx, it is clear that the FDA's policy \nwith respect to financial conflicts of interest wasn't working. The FDA \nhas made modifications to its policy and the underlying legislation \nmakes several additional improvements. I believe the\n\n[[Page S5764]]\n\namendment offered by Senators Durbin and Bingaman would have made great \nimprovements to the recruitment of qualified advisory committee \nmembers. The amendment would have required the FDA to conduct \naggressive outreach to professional medical and scientific societies to \nhelp with recruitment for advisory committees, especially ones with the \ngreatest number of vacancies. Those are important policy goals and ones \nthat I fully support.\n  However, I voted against the amendment because I was concerned about \nthe impact a hard and fast limit of one waiver per committee meeting \nwould have on timely access to drugs and new drug information. \nSpecifically, the Pediatric Advisory Committee, a standing FDA advisory \ncommittee which relies on experts with specific expertise in pediatric \nissues, is an important component of the Best Pharmaceuticals for \nChildren Act program. I was concerned that setting an arbitrary limit \non the number of waivers per committee meeting would further complicate \nan already small pool of qualified individuals in fields such as \npediatrics.\n  I am disappointed that an agreement on the amendment was not reached \nbetween the bill managers and sponsors of the amendment so that the \nSenate bill could contain the important provisions dealing with \nrecruitment and outreach. It is my hope that we can find a way to \naddress these issues in the conference with the House.\n  Taken as a whole, the underlying legislation is vital to our nation's \nchildren as well as consumers needing timely access to safe and \neffective drugs. Therefore, it is essential that the House act quickly \nso that we can send a conference report to the President in the coming \nmonths. I urge the House to pass all of the major provisions contained \nin S. 1082. I support this legislation and look forward to continuing \nto work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and in both \nChambers so that we can send this legislation to the President for his \nsignature.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I would like to take some time to talk \nabout some issues that I haven't spent a great deal of time describing \nto the Senate about S. 1082, the Food and Drug Administration \nRevitalization Act.\n  First, I thank Senator Roberts and Senator Harkin for working with \nSenator Enzi and me and with many members of the committee on the \nimportant issue of direct-to-consumer, or DTC, advertising.\n  We have worked together to accomplish our common goal--a \nconstitutionally sound, effective, workable way to see that DTC ads \nprovide accurate information to patients about the drugs they are \ntaking.\n  Some have advocated a ban on such advertising altogether, but Senator \nEnzi and I rejected that approach since it failed to meet the \nconstitutional test. Instead, we included a more measured provision in \nour legislation that allows FDA to impose a moratorium in extraordinary \ncircumstances where needed to protect public health.\n  During our committee's consideration of this issue, Senator Roberts \nbrought up his concerns that even this limited provision fell afoul of \nrecent Supreme Court decisions on free speech. Senator Harkin raised \nhis strong interest in seeing that these DTC ads include strong, \neffective safety information that is clearly and prominently presented \nto consumers in a way that does not gloss over important information. \nSenator Enzi and I committed to work with Senator Roberts to see that \nany provision on DTC met the constitutional threshold, and we agreed to \nwork with Senator Harkin to make certain that it provided strong safety \ninformation to consumers. The result of our discussions is an amendment \nthat our two colleagues offered. It is a true bipartisan compromise, \nworked out by two Senators committed to making real progress on an \nimportant issue, and I am pleased to support the amendment.\n  Instead of the moratorium included in our original bill, the Roberts-\nHarkin amendment puts in place strong safety disclosures for DTC ads, \ncoupled with effective enforcement. Under current law, safety \ndisclosures can be an afterthought--a rushed disclaimer read by an \nannouncer at the conclusion of a TV ad while distracting images help \ngloss over the important information provided. Our proposal requires \nsafety announcements to be presented in a manner that is clear and \nconspicuous without distracting imagery.\n  We also give FDA the authority to require safety disclosures in DTC \nads if the risk profile of the drug requires them. Senator Roberts had \na concern that this authority not be used indiscriminately, so we have \nmade clear that the required disclosure must pertain to a specific \nidentified risk.\n  We have made important improvements in FDA's ability to enforce the \nrequirement to provide clear and accurate information to consumers.\n  For advertisements, as in so many other areas, FDA's enforcement \ntools are now limited. Although FDA does have the capacity under \ncurrent law to remove a drug from the market for misleading ads, that \nauthority is not often used and rightly so, since it punishes patients \nfor the transgressions of the manufacturers. Since removing a drug from \nthe market is an empty threat, FDA is often left with little option but \nto make polite requests to companies to change their ads. Under the \nRoberts-Harkin amendment, FDA will have the ability to levy fines of up \nto $150,000 for false or misleading ads.\n  It is unacceptable for patients to be put at risk by inaccurate ads. \nThe Roberts-Harkin amendment makes certain that FDA will have the \nability to see that this does not occur, in a way that is clearly \nconsistent with the Constitution.\n  The amendment is a victory for bipartisan common sense on a difficult \nissue.\n  I would also like to address the affect of title II of this bill. \nGenerally speaking, title II grants the FDA new authority to conduct \npostapproval safety surveillance activity in order to improve drug \nsafety.\n  In enacting title II, we do not intend to alter existing State law \nduties imposed on the holder of an approved drug application to obtain \nand disclose information regarding drug safety hazards either before or \nafter the drug receives FDA approval or labeling. Nor are we expressing \na belief that the regulatory scheme embodied in the bill is \ncomprehensive enough to preempt the field or every aspect of State law. \nFDA's approved label has always been understood to be the minimum \nrequirement necessary for approval. In providing the FDA with new tools \nand enhanced authority to determine drug safety, we do not intend to \nconvert this minimum requirement into a maximum.\n  As the Institute of Medicine and others have found, the FDA's past \nperformance has been inadequate. While we fully expect substantial \nimprovement as a result of the enactment of this bill, we cannot and do \nnot expect the FDA or this new process to identify every drug-specific \nsafety concern before a drug manufacturer becomes aware or should have \nbecome aware of such concerns. Nor are the bill's requirements that \nholders disclose certain safety information to the Government intended \nto substitute for the disclosure requirements that may be required \nunder State law.\n  I would also like to focus on another aspect of our legislation, the \nReagan-Udall Foundation.\n  During the discussions that led to consideration of this bill, we \nheard time and again that there was a major need for better research \ntools to aid FDA in evaluating the safety of drugs and help researchers \nmove through the long process of developing drugs more effectively. \nEvery day that a new medicine is needlessly delayed is another day that \na patient does not receive a treatment that could well mean the \ndifference between health and continued illness. If new research tools \nand better ways to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of drugs could \nbe developed, patients will benefit from quicker drug development. If \ncurrent procedures can be made more effective, then the cost of \ndeveloping new drugs will drop.\n  One area where scientists can make real progress is developing new \ncell lines and new genetic techniques for testing drugs that reduce the \nneed for costly forms of testing.\n  The Reagan-Udall Foundation sets up a way to develop these new \ntools--not so they can help just one researcher or one company, but so \nthey can help the entire research enterprise. New ways to test drugs \nfor effectiveness and safety\n\n[[Page S5765]]\n\nwill bring new advances to patients quicker and more smoothly. Through \nthe Reagan-Udall Foundation, they will be available to the FDA and to \nthe entire research enterprise. This new foundation is not many pages \nin a long bill, but it is an important component to help get needed \nmedicines to patients as quickly as safety will allow.\n  I also wish to mention another critical aspect of our legislation--\nits registry of clinical trials.\n  This provision serves two essential purposes. First, it allows \npatients who want to enroll in those trials an accessible and central \nInternet site to find out which trials are being conducted and whether \nthey might be eligible.\n  This provision builds on an existing provision of law to create a \nclinical trials site, but report after report has shown that the \nrequirement to list trials has not been complied with. Our legislation \nputs more force in the requirement to list trials so that patients will \nbenefit.\n  Listing trials is important for patient access--but reporting results \nis critical for safety. Our legislation requires that the results of \ntrials be reported. No longer will companies be able to hide the \noutcome of a trial that did not turn out the way they hoped.\n  Examples of this kind of abuse are shocking. The manufacturer of the \nantidepressant drug Paxil conducted five clinical trials of the drug in \nadolescents and children, yet published only one study whose mixed \nresults it deemed positive. The company sat on two major studies for up \nto 4 years, although the results of one were divulged by a \nwhistleblower and all of the studies were submitted to the FDA when the \ncompany sought approval for new uses of Paxil. At that time it became \napparent that Paxil was no more effective than a placebo in treating \nadolescent depression.\n  Under the bill, these kinds of abuses will not be permitted, since \nclinical trials will have to be reported--no matter what the result.\n  Senator Enzi, Senator Dodd and many others in the committee worked \nhard to get this provision right. We require immediate listing of all \npublicly available data and require a negotiated rulemaking, backed by \nthe full authority of statute to develop the precise requirements for \nother results information to be included.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues for considering these comments as \nthey relate to S. 1082, and I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, as we debate the important issue of drug \nsafety, I want to address the safety of one drug in particular: RU-486 \nor mifepristone. This drug was approved in 2000 under a special \npathway, subpart H drug approval that is reserved for drugs that treat \nsevere or life-threatening illnesses. Subpart H approvals generally \nrequire a special ``restricted distribution'' approval process. \nUnfortunately some drugs, RU-486 for example, approved under subpart H \nhave caused serious adverse health events in women.\n  Every drug approved under Subpart H is listed on the Food and Drug \nAdministration's Web site. The vast majority of drugs listed combat HIV \nor specific types of cancer. One governs the use of thalidomide in \ntreating leprosy. These drugs are supposed to relate to the treatment \nof life-threatening illnesses.\n  One example of a subpart H approval makes a mockery of the regulatory \nprocess by an expedited approval of two extremely risky drugs for \nabortions. Pregnancy is not an illness and certainly not one that is \nlife-threatening in the first 7 weeks, unless it is a tubal or ectopic \npregnancy in which case RU-486 abortions are absolutely \ncontraindicated.\n  RU-486 was inappropriately approved in 2000. RU-486 was approved \nusing special ``subpart H'' regulations to address problems for \n``certain new drug products that have been studied for their safety and \neffectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses . . .'' \nand under restricted distribution conditions due to serious hazards \npresented by the drug; for example, severe hemorrhage and ectopic \npregnancies. This was an inappropriate approval of RU-486 as pregnancy \nis not normally a life-threatening condition. Today many health care \nproviders do not follow the limited distribution requirements of RU-\n486's approval.\n  RU-486 has put women's lives at risk. To date there have been six \nNorth American deaths related to the use of the RU-486 abortion \nregimen: five Americans and one Canadian have died from septic shock \nstemming from infection by the anaerobic bacteria Clostridium \nsordellii. Five other international deaths have been related to RU-486.\n  RU-486 causes serious safety issues. More than 1,000 adverse event \nreports--232 hospitalizations, 116 blood transfusions, and 88 cases of \ninfection--have been submitted regarding RU-486 and are significant \nbecause they confirm that large numbers of mifepristone patients \nrequire surgical intervention for infection, hemorrhage, complications \nfrom ectopic pregnancy, and incomplete abortions. While lives have been \nlost from the use of RU-486, not a single case has been documented \nwhere RU-486 has been used to save a woman's life.\n  RU-486 is not always effective and when it is not the consequences \nare dire. I recently learned of a woman who was given RU-486 after she \nhad a seizure. Her physicians assumed that the seizure was life-\nthreatening to the baby she was carrying and gave her RU-486 for a \ntherapeutic abortion.\n  RU-486 was not effective in her case and the woman carried the baby \nto term. When the baby was born at a low birth weight, it also suffered \nfrom failure to thrive. That baby has had three subsequent brain \nsurgeries due to hydrocephalus. The baby also suffers from idiopathic \nlymphocytocholitis--an inflammatory disease of the colon, which is \nextremely rare in children. It is clear that RU-486 not only is unsafe \nin women, but it is also not completely effective. And when it is not \neffective, the results are devastating.\n  I appreciate the desire to effect safer drugs through this bill. \nSenator Kennedy and Senator Enzi have done a great deal of work in \ndesigning the REMS scheme for certain drugs to ensure that they can be \nsafely and effectively used.\n  Under the risk evaluation and mitigation system, REMS, provisions of \nthis drug safety bill, a drug that has previously been approved under \nsubpart H is deemed to have a REMS. Every REMS is subject to a periodic \nreview. Therefore, RU-486 is deemed to have a REMS and is subject to \nperiodic review.\n  I am pleased that the amendment offered by Senator DeMint was \naccepted by the full Senate. Senator DeMint's amendment sets a ``date \ncertain'' REMS assessment for RU-486 to properly evaluate its drug \nsafety risks in women. Women in this country deserve to know the safety \nrisks associated with RU-486.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1034\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I have an amendment pending and \nscheduled for a vote this morning on the conflict of interest \nprovision. I believe I have 5 minutes to speak to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does have 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the chairman and ranking member if this a \nconvenient time to raise the issue?\n  Thank you very much.\n  Yesterday I proposed this amendment with Senator Bingaman. The Food \nand Drug Administration Advisory Committees make important decisions, \nlife-and-death decisions. They decide whether the drugs and medical \ndevices which are going to be used in America are safe and effective. \nIn other words, if a person in America has a prescription from a doctor \nand takes this drug, is it going to be good for their health, or bad?\n  This is a critical situation. If they make the wrong decision, if the \nadvisory committee turns a dangerous drug loose on the market, it can \nhave terrible consequences, so these committees literally have life-\nand-death decisions in their hands on approving drugs, on deciding what \nthe warning labels say, deciding what you have to say in advertising. \nThere might be a danger in these drugs. These advisory committees are \nthe juries of scientific experts who have to make these calls. That is \none of the most important decisions of our Government.\n  They are not just life-and-death decisions, they are decisions \ninvolving millions and millions of dollars. Drug companies spend a \nfortune over a long period of time trying to bring a drug to\n\n[[Page S5766]]\n\nmarket. They would hope this will be a drug very popular and profitable \nfor them and their shareholders. That is a natural inclination of a \nbusiness. So the advisory committee not only decides the safety and \nefficacy of the product, it makes a decision which has a direct impact \nworth millions of dollars to the drug companies involved.\n  Do you know what we found out? We found out over the last 10 years \nmany people sitting on these advisory committees, those who are \nactually sitting on the so-called juries and deciding the fate of these \ndrugs, have a conflict of interest. Some of them were already \nreceiving, from the companies that make the drugs, tens of thousands of \ndollars in consulting fees and speaking fees. It turns out they are on \nthe payroll, some of them, of the very companies on which they are \nbeing asked to stand in judgment. That is a conflict of interest which \npeople cannot accept and I cannot accept.\n  The Food and Drug Administration argues that there are so few experts \nthat we have to sometimes turn to those who have a conflict of \ninterest; there is no place else to go. So occasionally we have to put \na waiver in and allow someone to sit on an advisory committee panel who \nfrankly has a financial interest in the company they are making a \ndecision about.\n  That worries me. Because if you are going to have truly objective \njurisdictions, that are right for the consumers of America, that \napprove drugs or disapprove them on the merits, not because of some \ninclination or prejudice which you might bring to the table, you don't \nneed these conflicts of interest.\n  So basically what Senator Bingaman and I have said is: Let's \nstrengthen the conflict-of-interest provisions on advisory committees. \nLet's make certain that there is confidence in the process. We know \nwhat happened with Vioxx. There were 10 people sitting on the advisory \ncommittee who had a financial conflict of interest. Had they been \nremoved from the deliberation, the panel would not have recommended \nthey go back on the market, endangering the health of thousands of \nAmericans.\n  How can you ever justify that kind of conflict of interest? Our \nlanguage tightens it. What we are trying to do is to make sure the Food \nand Drug Administration, with this amendment, limits the number of \nwaivers to one per each advisory committee meeting, allows advisory \ncommittees to receive information from guest experts who have a \nfinancial conflict but prevents those experts from participating in the \ndeliberations.\n  They can come in and express their point of view and then leave the \nroom before the deliberation and the vote take place. And also \nstrengthen the provisions to increase the outreach for new experts. The \nFood and Drug Administration has to do a better job of cultivating this \nnew cadre of trustworthy experts who can serve on these advisory \ncommittees.\n  We have 125 medical schools in this country, 90 schools of pharmacy, \n40 schools of public health. If the FDA is more aggressive in filling \nthe slots on the advisory committees, we can remove this shadow of \ndoubt which is over this process.\n  Now, some will argue: Well, the FDA has come forward with draft \nguidance to improve this. This is draft guidance. They are suggestions. \nThis is law. This tells them they will have to follow the law to avoid \nthese conflicts of interest. This is not an idea that Senator Bingaman \nand I bring to the table without support.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Madam President, to have printed in the \nRecord with my remarks letters from the Consumers Union, the Union of \nConcerned Scientists, and a broader letter from 11 different \norganization that support this amendment, that would reduce and \neliminate the conflicts of interest when it comes to approving new \ndrugs and medical devices. What is at stake is the integrity of the \nFood and Drug Administration, the integrity of the process, and making \ncertain we can say, with a straight face to American consumers, the \nproducts that are coming to the market, the life-and-death decisions \nthat are being made that bring them to the market are being made by \npeople who do not have a financial conflict of interest with these \ndevices. I urge my colleagues to support the Durbin-Bingaman amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent these letters be printed in the Record after \nmy remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              Consumers Union,\n\n                                                      May 8, 2007.\n       Dear Senator, Consumers Union, the nonprofit, independent \n     publisher of Consumer Reports, urges you to support the \n     Durbin-Bingaman amendment to S. 1082, the Food and Drug \n     Administration Revitalization Act. This amendment will help \n     ensure that FDA advisory committees responsible for assessing \n     a drug's safety are not inappropriately influenced by \n     scientists or others with financial ties to the affected drug \n     company.\n       A recent national survey by Consumer Reports National \n     Research Center found that Americans are extremely concerned \n     about the pharmaceutical industry's influence on the drug \n     safety process, as well as financial conflicts on FDA \n     advisory boards.\n       Sixty percent of those surveyed disapproved of allowing \n     doctors and scientists with a conflicting financial interest \n     to participate on advisory boards. And 84 percent of \n     consumers agree that drug companies have too much influence \n     over the government officials who regulate them.\n       This amendment would make it more difficult for the FDA to \n     issue financial conflicts of interest waivers to the \n     scientific experts who serve on its advisory committees. The \n     Durbin-Bingaman amendment would: limit the number of waivers \n     to one per advisory committee meeting; establish a specific \n     process to allow experts with a financial conflict to present \n     information to an advisory committee, while not permitting \n     them to deliberate or vote with the committee; and enhance \n     the FDA's outreach activities for identifying non-conflicted \n     experts to participate in advisory committees.\n       The integrity of the FDA advisory process is vital to \n     ensuring that decisions by federal policymakers benefit the \n     public, and not the agendas of any special interest.\n       Please support the Durbin-Bingaman amendment to S. 1082. If \n     you have any questions, please contact Bill Vaughan.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Vaughan,\n     Senior Policy Analyst.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      May 8, 2007.\n       Dear Senator: The Union of Concerned Scientists strongly \n     urges you to support the Durbin-Bingaman amendment to the FDA \n     Revitalization Act, S. 1082. This amendment will help ensure \n     that the Food and Drug Agency's assessment of the safety and \n     efficacy of drugs is not inappropriately influenced by \n     scientists with ties to the drug companies affected by an FDA \n     approval decision.\n       This amendment would make it more difficult for the FDA to \n     issue financial conflicts of interest waivers to the \n     scientific experts who serve on its 30-plus advisory \n     committees.\n       Conflicts of interest can have serious consequences for \n     drug safety. For example, ten of the 32 scientists on the \n     February 2005 advisory committee that considered the safety \n     of Cox-2 inhibitors, including Vioxx, had ties to the drug \n     companies that made the products. The scientists voted to \n     permit the companies to continue marketing the drugs, even \n     though Vioxx had already been withdrawn from the market and \n     had been implicated in tens of thousands of deaths.\n       The Durbin-Bingaman amendment would: limit the number of \n     waivers to one per advisory committee meeting; establish a \n     specific process to allow experts with a financial conflict \n     to present information to an advisory committee, while not \n     permitting them to deliberate or vote with the committee; and \n     enhance the FDA's outreach activities for identifying non-\n     conflicted experts to participate in advisory committees.\n       The integrity of science is vital to ensuring that \n     decisions by federal policymakers benefit the public, and not \n     the agendas of any special interest. We at the Union of \n     Concerned Scientists are working to ensure that federal \n     scientists, and those who advise federal agencies, are free \n     to do their work without interference. This amendment will be \n     a constructive step in addressing the pervasive problem of \n     political interference in government science.\n       For all these reasons, we believe that the Durbin-Bingaman \n     amendment merits your support. Please call our Washington \n     Representative Celia Wexler if you'd like more information on \n     either S. 1082 or the amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          Dr. Francesca Grifo,\n\n                           Director, Scientific Integrity Program,\n     Union of Concerned Scientists.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   April 30, 2007.\n     Senator Jeff Bingaman,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: We, the undersigned organizations, \n     give our wholehearted support to the amendment to S. 1082 \n     that you plan to offer next week that would limit the number \n     of conflict of interest waivers allowed on Food and Drug \n     Administration advisory committees. This amendment would end \n     the vast majority of conflicts of interest while insuring \n     that the FDA has access to the best advice that this nation \n     has to offer.\n       The amendment would: require the FDA to engage in greater \n     efforts to find experts without conflicts of interest to \n     serve on its\n\n[[Page S5767]]\n\n     advisory committees; limit the number of waivers that can be \n     granted to one per committee per year; and authorize the FDA \n     to hire experts who have conflicts of interest to make \n     presentations and answer questions at an advisory committee \n     meeting if the FDA believes their expertise is crucial. \n     However, these experts will not be allowed to vote or \n     otherwise participate in the discussions leading up to \n     committee vote.\n       The FDA advisory committee process has been severely \n     compromised in recent years. According to the agency's most \n     recent report, one in four experts advising the FDA received \n     waivers because they have financial ties to companies with a \n     stake in the outcome of advisory committee meetings. At the \n     February 2005 meeting which voted to allow continued \n     marketing of Vioxx and Bextra, nearly a third of the advisers \n     had ties to Cox-2 manufacturers and had their votes not been \n     counted, the vote would have been reversed.\n       The status quo is undermining the public's faith in the \n     ability of the FDA to protect it from unsafe or ineffective \n     drugs. We believe passing this amendment will help rebuild \n     the public's confidence in the integrity of the scientific \n     process at the FDA. Please circulate this letter among your \n     colleagues and encourage them to vote yes on the Bingaman \n     amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n         Center for Medical Consumers, Center for Science in the \n           Public Interest, Consumers Union, Government \n           Accountability Project, National Research Center for \n           Women & Families, National Women's Health Network, \n           Reproductive Health Technologies Project, Title II \n           Community AIDS National Network, Union of Concerned \n           Scientists, U.S. PIRG, Woody Matters.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I wish to thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, for the statement he made a little bit \nearlier but mostly for the 2\\1/2\\ years' worth of effort he and I have \nput into this bill. It has been a very cooperative process between he \nand I and between the Members on both sides of the aisle on the \ncommittee.\n  There have been a lot of points raised about food and drug safety, \nparticularly drug safety. It has been a cooperative process, as I \nmentioned. We have had a lot of questions. We have had some \ndisagreements. But what that has resulted in is going back and getting \nmore information and finding a way that we can come up with a solution \nthat will provide more assurance to Americans that their drugs will be \nsafe.\n  I also wish to thank the people at the Food and Drug Administration \nfor their participation in this lengthy process and providing answers. \nIt has been a long road for this bill. I do strongly urge my colleagues \nto vote ``yes'' on final passage and endorse the most comprehensive \ndrug safety overhaul in more than a decade.\n  Completion of this bill marks yet another significant step in the \nprocess, but there is more work to be done. The House needs to pass \ntheir version of the legislation, and then the two bodies need to work \nout differences in the conference committee. My hope and expectation is \nthat the House will act in a reasonable manner and soon because this is \nwidely considered to be must-pass legislation.\n  This key FDA package includes four reauthorizations that must be done \nthis year, along with the essential new authorities for the FDA to be \nable to react in a timely way to safety problems that arise after a \ndrug has been brought to the market.\n  I would like to take a couple minutes to recap for my colleagues the \npath this legislation has taken thus far. The Senate Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions conducted a top-to-bottom review \nof the FDA's drug safety and approval processes over 2 years ago. We \ndid that at the same time the Finance Committee was doing a review of \nthe FDA's safety approval processes.\n  We used this information plus information from other Senators to do \nthis bill. The bill is a culmination of that review and our continued \nevaluation and analysis of the FDA. The changes made in the drug safety \ncomponents of this legislation are critical to restoring peace of mind \nto Americans who want to be assured the drugs they purchase to treat \nillnesses and chronic medical conditions can be relied upon and \ntrusted.\n  Given the limitations we identified during our review of the FDA, I \nfelt strongly it was necessary to correct those problems and ensure \nthat the FDA has the right tools in the toolbox to address drug safety \nafter the drug is on the market. That is why this bill creates the Risk \nEvaluation and Mitigation Strategy or REMS. The REMS give the FDA the \nfull toolbox of options for dealing with potential safety problems, \neven if they are discovered after the drug is first marketed.\n  Our goal is to get the drugs to the market quicker and to discover \nproblems faster and get them corrected. With this new toolbox, the FDA \nhas the ability to identify side effects after the drug is marketed \nthrough active surveillance. FDA has the authority to request a \nseparate study or clinical trial to learn more about a particular \npotential safety problem.\n  FDA can also obtain timely label changes for the first time under \nthis Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy System. Through the REMS \nprocess, the bill also makes several key improvements to how patients \nget their information through advertising and labeling.\n  I wish to thank my colleague, Senator Roberts, for his tireless \nefforts to provide an appropriate balance for direct-to-consumer \nadvertising. It was not an easy task to reconcile some very different \nopinions. I am so pleased we were able to reach a resolution on this \nissue that we can all support.\n  I also thank my colleagues, Senator Harkin and Senator Kennedy, for \ntheir hard work on this issue. Senator Roberts had planned to vote for \nS. 1082 but cannot be here today because he is in Kansas showing the \nPresident the damage from the tornadoes. I wish him all the best in \nhelping his State recover from that tragedy.\n  The FDA currently has very little authority to require labeling \nchanges after a drug is brought to market. We have included provisions \nthat ensure discussions between FDA and a drug manufacturer regarding \nthe labeling changes come to a close quickly and effectively, rather \nthan relying on FDA's nuclear option, which is pulling the drug \ncompletely off the market.\n  This legislation gives FDA the tools needed to get drugs to the \nmarket quickly and efficiently and to respond to potential problems the \nsame way, especially when lives are on the line and people need new \ndrugs and therapies.\n  FDA currently has no mechanism from active, routine surveillance of \npotential safety problems. It cannot easily detect safety problems \nafter a drug has been put on the market. This legislation fixes that \nchallenge and ensures that FDA has the right tools to address drug \nsafety after the drug is on the market.\n  The legislation allows for routine, active safe monitoring using \nlarge linked databases, what I call health IT for drug safety. I wish \nto thank Senator Gregg for being the champion of this provision and \nensuring that we crafted this provision properly.\n  Not every drug will need a REMS. However, every drug will need a very \nactive FDA, an FDA with all the necessary tools to identify and quickly \nmanage additional risks.\n  Title IV of the bill before us contains a number of critical \nprovisions to improve children's health. Up to 75 percent of drugs used \nby kids have not been tested in kids. Without information from \npediatric studies, kids are often overdosed, underdosed or receive \nineffective treatment. They may suffer needlessly or even die. The Best \nPharmaceuticals for Children Act makes drugs safer for kids by creating \nincentives to perform pediatric drug studies. The incentives have \nproduced astonishing results. In the 7 years before BPCA incentives, a \ntotal of 11 pediatric studies were performed; 7 years, 11 studies.\n  In the 10 years since incentives were authorized, at least 132 \nstudies have been completed and more are underway. As a grandfather, I \nam very happy that the law is in place. If my grandson Trey is sick, I \nwant the drugs he needs to have been tested for kids. All of us want \nthat for our children and grandchildren.\n  The bill also reauthorizes a companion study, the Pediatric Research \nImprovement Act, which enables FDA to require a pediatric study if it \nis not done under the incentive program or through the National \nInstitutes of Health. These two laws work together as a carrot and a \nstick. I strongly support their reauthorization and continuing to keep \nthem together.\n\n[[Page S5768]]\n\n  Now, so far I have only talked about drugs for kids. The bill will \nalso make medical devices safer for kids. Devices designed for adults \nmight not fit in kids. A scaled-down device might fit at first, but a \nchild can grow out of it, so doctors have to jury-rig adult devices, \nimprovise or use more invasive treatments. In addition, the market for \nkids' devices is small, and the development costs are very high, so few \nkids' devices get made.\n  The bill before us creates new incentives to grow the market for \nkid's medical devices. I am hopeful these new incentives will be as \nhelpful as the kids' drug incentive. I would like to thank Senator \nAlexander, Senator Allard, Senator Bond, Senator Dodd, Senator Clinton, \nand others for their leadership on behalf of kids.\n  A number of other FDA issues were also addressed during debate of \nthis legislation. The legislation was improved when the Senate adopted \na food safety amendment by a vote of 94 to 0. This amendment adds \nadditional food safety provisions to better protect our pet food supply \nand track when food is adulterated. My colleagues and I also reached \nconsensus that the issue of follow-on biologics will be addressed in \nthe Help Committee early this summer.\n  As my colleagues know, I have some concerns with the Dorgan amendment \non drug importation that was adopted last week. I supported the Cochran \nsafety amendment that was also adopted. I did not support the Dorgan \napproach to foreign drug importation because I do not believe it \nadequately ensures the safety of the prescription drug supply.\n  I was pleased to work with my colleague, Senator Dorgan, to add some \nvery significant anticounterfeiting language to the bill in the \nmanagers' amendment. But a lot of work still remains. I support the \nprocess moving forward, and I will continue to work with my colleagues \nand Senator Dorgan and Senator Snowe to improve this language during \nthe conference process.\n  Finally, I would like to thank Senator Hatch for his work on the \nantibiotics and other Hatch-Waxman issues and the follow-on biologics. \nSenator Hatch was responsible for the first FDA Revitalization Act in \n1990, before I was even elected a Member of the Senate. I would like to \nthank him for helping me to bring that full circle and for the \nmentoring he has done as a former chairman of the committee.\n  I will have a lot more thank-yous to deliver after the votes, but \nright now we have a bit of business left to conduct.\n  I yield the floor and retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The managers have 14 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 4 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I commend my colleague from Illinois \nand my colleague from New Mexico for their amendment on the conflicts \nof interest and for working with us to address these issues in \nappropriations bills during the past year.\n  Their amendment includes many thoughtful proposals I support: \nincluding the right to call for the FDA to improve its outreach to \nexperts who have no conflicts of interest and their right to call for \ngreater transparency in the process of waivers.\n  But where I disagree with my friend from Illinois and New Mexico is \nthat there should be an inflexible cap on the number of waivers for \nconflicts of interests an advisory committee can grant, no matter what \nthe expertise of the scientists involved.\n  The amendment would impose a one-size-fits all, one waiver per \nconflict, per committee, relegating any additional members with \nconflicts to a secondary guest status on the committee.\n  The FDA has recently issued a policy not to grant a waiver for a \nfinancial interest that exceeds $50,000 and will allow those who \nreceive a waiver for a lesser conflict to serve only as members who can \nparticipate in committee discussions but not vote.\n  The hallmark of this proposal is the flexibility it gives to ensure \nthe committees will have the adequate expertise. If one or more experts \nwith financial conflicts in excess of $50,000 have expertise that is \nessential to a committee, the Commissioner can grant the needed \nwaivers. This is expected to be rare, but it can happen if needed.\n  Under the Durbin amendment, by contrast, the FDA can grant only one \nwaiver per meeting. There is no flexibility on this point.\n  The FDA is already experiencing difficulty in filling vacancies on \nadvisory committees. The Durbin amendment, no matter how well-\nintentioned, would worsen the problems, making it harder to fill \ncritical vacancies and slowing the process of reviewing new medicines.\n  Let's look at the problem FDA is facing now. The Antiviral Drugs \nAdvisory Committee needs six experts with specialized knowledge in the \nfields of clinical pharmacology, internal medicine, infectious \ndiseases, microbiology, virology, immunology, pediatrics, and other \nspecialties. These experts are needed to review the safety and \neffectiveness of new medicines for pandemic flu, HIV/AIDS, and other \nserious infections. The Anesthesiology and Respiratory Therapy Devices \nPanel has nine vacancies. The Ophthalmology Panel is in need of nine \nexperts. The Advisory Committee on Peripheral and Central Nervous \nSystem Drugs needs six members--on and on down the list, the story is \nthe same, critical vacancies, missed opportunities, and missed \nexpertise. I am not for conflicts of interest. I am against them. But \nthey are a fact of life.\n  We need policies that reflect the current reality of research in the \nlife sciences. We have increased transparency in this legislation so \nthere will be wide understanding of exactly how decisions are made. \nThis is the most important. In the time of life sciences, we are \ntalking about cross-fertilization of different ideas. Visit the \nInstitute of Medicine. They are talking about the life sciences and \nwork that is taking place. Flip a molecule and it could be relevant to \nalternative fuels. Flip it again and it can be relevant to agriculture. \nFlip it again and it can be relevant to the health sciences. We need \nall of these disciplines working together. To take one particular \nrequirement and exclude the possibility of getting the best in terms of \nfuture scientists, we need integrity in the FDA, integrity in \ndecisionmaking, integrity when they grant waivers. The public ought to \nhave the right to know. We have a balance in here. Hopefully, we will \nretain it.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1039\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I yield myself 5 minutes out of the 10 \nallotted to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am going to speak about amendment No. 1039. I ask \nunanimous consent that Senators Mikulski, Brown, Snowe, and Bingaman be \nadded as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. This amendment is important because S. 1082 does not \nsufficiently address the underlying problems I have found existing at \nthe Food and Drug Administration during my tenure as chairman of the \nSenate Finance Committee looking into the problems of the Food and Drug \nAdministration, with the goal in mind that the Federal Government \nshould only be paying for drugs that are safe. That problem is the lack \nof equality between the Office of New Drugs, which reviews drug \napplications and decides whether to approve a drug for marketing, and \nthe Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology, the office which monitors \nand assesses the safety of drugs postmarketing.\n  Many times I quote the Institute of Medicine as justification for my \namendment. They recognize this problem. The Institute of Medicine \nrecognizes joint authority between these two offices for postapproval \nregulatory action related to safety. Even the Consumers Union supports \nthis amendment.\n  Having equality between preapproval and postapproval offices at the \nFDA is fundamental to real reform. Concentrating on the entire life \ncycle of drugs\n\n[[Page S5769]]\n\nis critical. After all, the vast majority of a drug's life cycle is \nspent postapproval. In essence, the bill before us promotes the status \nquo when it comes to the specific role played by the Office of \nSurveillance. That means the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology \nwill remain nothing more than a mere consultant to the Office of New \nDrugs. This is not acceptable.\n  Amendment 1039 gives the Office of Surveillance sign-off authority. \nThey are experts in postmarketing safety. Even the Institute of \nMedicine recognized that through their recommendations. Let me be \nclear: This is not the amendment Senator Dodd and I originally \nproposed. I still believe an independent postmarketing safety center \nwould be best to solve the problem. But under the process, that is not \ngoing to happen. Through this amendment, at least joint postmarketing \ndecisionmaking between the Office of Surveillance and the Office of New \nDrugs will allow the office with the postmarketing safety expertise to \nhave a say in what drug safety action will be taken by the FDA.\n  The problem is not only the FDA having enough tools--this bill gives \nadditional tools--it is about FDA managers disregarding concerns raised \nby its own scientists in the Office of Surveillance and not taking \nprompt action. This amendment makes common sense when you weigh the \nevidence I presented over the last 3 years about these problems at the \nFDA.\n  Opponents of this amendment say it is unnecessary because the bill \nincludes a dispute resolution process with strict deadlines. But that \nprocess is for disputes between the FDA and the drug company, not \ninternal disagreements between FDA offices.\n  Getting down to brass tacks, when the office that looks at \npostmarketing surveillance is under the thumb of the Office of New \nDrugs, and the Office of New Drugs says: This drug is safe, they aren't \ngoing to want to get egg on their faces by listening to the advice of \nthe Office of Postmarketing Surveillance. If that had been the case, \nDr. Graham, in the case of Vioxx, and Dr. Mosholder, in the case of \nantidepressant drugs, when kids were committing suicide, would have \nbeen listened to, but they weren't until they came as whistleblowers to \nthe Congress.\n  We have to have it so that we have enough independent decisionmaking \nwithin the FDA to make sure these drugs are safe.\n  This amendment provides an approach with checks and balances between \nthe office that approves a drug for marketing and the office that \nwatches a drug once it is on the market.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I need.\n  I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by my colleague from \nIowa, Senator Grassley, No. 1039, regarding the joint signing authority \nunder the Office of New Drugs and the Office of Surveillance and \nEpidemiology. This amendment would add an unnecessary layer of \nbureaucracy into an agency that we have designed to be nimble and \nresponsive in their process to deal with emerging drug safety issues.\n  Before the bill is passed, the option after market is to suggest \nchanges or pull the drug off the market, kind of a nuclear option. The \nunderlying bill has surveillance and techniques to notice problems \nquicker. That is why we will be able to get drugs on to the market \nfaster. The underlying bill does have a dispute resolution process with \nfirm and tight deadlines. There is both one with companies and with \nstaff disputes. It requires by its very nature close collaboration \nbetween the two offices. This amendment only serves to separate what \nshould be a together process and delay what should be a rapid process.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. The tools we have put \nin the toolbox will do what the Senator from Iowa wants to have done, \nwhich is quick response when there is a problem. I hope we don't add \nthis extra layer of bureaucracy. We looked at this problem through a \nnumber of hearings and a number of concerns by members on the committee \nfrom both sides and came up with this third way for being able to do it \nthat had not been polarized and that had some agreement. I hope people \nwill stick with what is in the bill.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 998\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I consume \non amendment No. 998. I ask unanimous consent that Senators Dodd, \nSnowe, and Bingaman be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. This amendment provides for the application of stronger \ncivil monetary penalties for violations of approved risk evaluation and \nmitigation strategies. Currently, the bill before us contains \npenalties, but those penalties won't mean much to large global \ncorporations. In fact, the penalties amount to the cost of doing \nbusiness. This amendment is intended, then, to give the Food and Drug \nAdministration, the watchdog, some bite along with its bark.\n  There is opposition to having strong civil monetary penalties, but \nthat does not make sense to this Senator. Even the Consumers Union \nsupports this amendment. The reality is, drug companies provide \nlifesaving pharmaceuticals throughout the world. The pharmaceutical \ncompanies make miracles happen. Before a drug is approved, a drug \ncompany has an incentive to provide evidence of a drug's effectiveness \nto the Food and Drug Administration. Without it, they can't sell drugs \nin this country. However, once a drug is already being sold in the \nmarketplace, drug companies have almost no incentive to look for and \nevaluate safety issues. The bottom line is, sometimes market forces \nguide businesses in a way that may be contrary to the public interest.\n  We have seen this happen many times. For the Food and Drug \nAdministration's new authorities to be meaningful in this legislation, \nthere must be stronger civil monetary penalties in the underlying bill; \nhence, my amendment. Fines are nothing more than the cost of doing \nbusiness, and we can't change behavior. More importantly, we can't even \ndeter bad behavior. If a company does what it is supposed to do, a drug \ncompany doesn't need to fear any penalties. It is that simple.\n  I ask Members of the Senate to support this amendment because it adds \nreal teeth to the FDA's bite.\n  I thank Senators Kennedy and Enzi for the tremendous efforts they \nwent to in bringing this bill to the Senate floor. Again, I want to \nmake this bill even better. They have already included several ideas \nSenator Dodd and I have shared with them.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I need.\n  I thank the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, for his participation in \nthis bill. It has been tremendous. I mentioned the hearings he held, as \nwe were holding hearings, as there were some crises with food and \ndrugs. The valuable information he shared with us, as well as \namendments, as he has correctly stated, are already a part of the bill.\n  With respect to amendment No. 998, I also have to oppose this \namendment regarding the level of civil monetary penalties that can be \nassessed for violations of the drug safety plan.\n  I appreciate Senator Kennedy's earlier comments. The level of civil \npenalties in the underlying bill was carefully crafted to reflect \nexisting FDA policies for other regulated products. This is the first \ntime we have had civil penalties in this portion covering the area of \nfood and drugs. It was no small feat to get a consensus position so \nthat we could have civil penalties in the bill, and I think that is \nnecessary.\n  There is a precedent for the levels that we have selected, the \ncurrent levels. Medical devices has the same levels. I reiterate that \nhas never before been available to the FDA as a tool on drug safety \nissues, but we are providing it as a tool. Furthermore, I believe the \nvery threat of a civil penalty is sufficient to deter bad behavior. \nThis is the name-and-shame principle. The fine may be affordable to the \ncompany, but the loss of reputation is not.\n\n[[Page S5770]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment as well. This is not \nthe end of the process. I suspect the House will have something to say \non it, as I have mentioned to the Senator from Iowa before. There will \nbe additional negotiations, I am certain, on civil penalties. I hope we \nwill stick with the civil penalties that have a basis in the medical \ndevices as some basis from which to negotiate and would hope that the \nSenate position will be the one that is in the bill. I ask people to \noppose the amendment.\n\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  I support the comments Senator Enzi has made about the fines. We are \ngoing to have to look at this in conference, and it is clear the House \nis going to raise the fines, it seems to me, as Senator Enzi pointed \nout. So we will have a chance to look at it in conference. I think that \nis probably the best way to do it.\n  Let me point out two other items--something I think most Americans \nhave been concerned about in recent times. It was reported today that \nChina has detained managers from two companies linked to contaminated \nfoods. As a first step, we need to determine the extent of the \ncontamination and see how far into the food supply this internal \nadulteration has gone.\n  Yesterday's report from the FDA that contaminated wheat flour from \nChina was fed to fish raised for human consumption is another example \nof the need for a comprehensive examination of our food safety system. \nWe also found out yesterday that what we thought was contaminated \nhighly processed wheat gluten was actually unprocessed wheat flour \nspiked with melamine to make it appear to be higher quality.\n  A month ago, the FDA warned that certain types of pet food were \nsuspected of being contaminated. Then, there were more kinds of pet \nfood. Then it was hogs being fed the contaminated food, but those had \nbeen caught before human consumption. Then we found out that tens of \nmillions of chickens eaten by people had been fed the tainted food. \nYesterday, we were informed that fish raised for human consumption had \nbeen fed contaminated food.\n  The incremental expansion of this crisis raises serious concerns \nabout the FDA's ability to rapidly identify the source of food-related \nproblems and bring to bear the effective tools. We know the issue of \nfood safety is divided into different kinds of committees, but it has \nto be of concern to American families.\n  We have included strong new protections to allow FDA to better ensure \nthe safety of human and pet foods, but this is a first step. Senator \nEnzi and Senator Durbin have joined with me and others and we are \ncommitted to taking a comprehensive look at the safety of our food \nsupply and we are committed to taking the actions, with our colleagues, \nneeded to ensure that the foods our families and pets eat are as safe \nas possible.\n  As part of the managers' package adopted last night, we included \nimportant new provisions to allow the FDA to oversee the safety of \nfarm-raised fish. We owe this--this is a story in the paper today--to \nSenators Lincoln and Pryor and Sessions on this important proposal.\n  This morning's newspaper talks about doctors reaping millions for the \nuse of anemia drugs. People are going to wonder what we are doing in \nthis bill, if anything, on this issue. Well, this is not what the FDA \ndoes exactly. It is safety and efficacy. But there are different \nagencies in what they call health research and quality. AHRQ has \nresponsibility for this. We will be in touch with them to examine this \nissue and provide better guidance and recommendations to doctors and \npatients.\n  The FDA does not practice medicine. But this kind of action has to be \nof concern because it reflects itself in increased costs to the \nAmerican consumer, and it does raise health issues as well.\n  So this is illustrative of the range of different areas of concerns \nthe American families have. We believe we have made very important and \nsubstantial progress in trying to address those questions.\n  Mr. President, at this time I will withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1034\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I have to make some comments in regard to \nthe other amendment we will be voting on this morning, which I also \nhope people will oppose, and that is amendment No. 1034, offered by my \ncolleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin.\n  The FDA relies on 30 advisory committees to provide independent \nexpert advice, which lends credibility to the product review process \nand informs consumers of trends and product development. Given the \ncomplex issues that are considered by the FDA, outside help is needed \nand beneficial, and it is advisory. The decisions are not made by the \ncommittees. They advise. But any scientist who is expert enough to \nmerit interest by the FDA has almost certainly merited interest by \nother entities, such as granting agencies and companies involved in the \nfield.\n  This amendment would seriously limit the FDA's ability to access the \nbest experts in the field to assist the Agency with its decisionmaking \nprocess. It would restrict FDA to granting only one waiver per \ncommittee meeting.\n  How would the FDA decide who gets that one waiver? Who is more \nworthy, the toxicologist, the drug safety expert, the specialist in \nwomen's health? These are not easy answers.\n  The FDA, in March, released a guidance document outlining strict new \nlimits on evaluating advisory personnel committee members for service. \nThe comment period on this guidance has not even closed. It is \npremature to void that guidance before we even know whether and how it \nwill work.\n  Let's take a step back and think about what might happen if we do not \nallow people who have worked with or for industry to be involved in an \nadvisory committee meeting.\n  Louis Pasteur was a brilliant microbiologist who revolutionized human \nfood and health safety. Every time you buy milk in the grocery store, \nyou are benefiting from his contributions to society. But under the \nDurbin amendment, Pasteur would probably not have been able to serve on \nany advisory committee. You see, Pasteur's research was funded by the \nwine industry.\n  Now, do you want to prevent the FDA from benefiting from the advice \nof the best and the brightest they have to offer? We do want to move so \nthere are not conflicts of interest. I think the guidelines that are \nout there, if finalized, will do that. The amendment almost gets into a \nposition of not conflicts of interest but biases--much harder to \ndetermine. If we are going to do that, we will never be able to have \nanybody on any of the committees, particularly with the expertise we \nneed.\n  So I ask we oppose that amendment as well.\n  I yield time to the Republican leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Wyoming.\n  I wish to take a moment to congratulate Senator Enzi on this \nwonderful, bipartisan effort he has been engaged in with our friend \nfrom Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy. They have worked tirelessly for \nthe past 3 weeks, through markup and floor consideration.\n  I also wish to commend Senator Gregg, who worked very hard with \nSenator Enzi to reach a bipartisan compromise on this important \nmeasure.\n  I particularly wish to note Senator Roberts was instrumental in \nworking out the problems with direct-to-consumer advertising \nprovisions. I know he would have liked to have been here today to \nsupport this bill, but he is out in Kansas with the President touring \nhurricane damage in his State.\n  Also, I wish to commend Senator Cochran. We appreciate his efforts to \nensure that any proposal to bring drugs in from other countries must be \ncertified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services as safe for the \nAmerican people.\n\n[[Page S5771]]\n\n  So again, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his extraordinary \naccomplishment in moving this important, bipartisan legislation \nforward.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think we are about--I see my friend \nfrom Iowa on his feet so I will withhold. I will make a very brief \ncomment at the very end, so I withhold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume. I only have 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1039\n\n  On the very important amendment about making sure there is adequate \ncooperation and dialog between the Office of New Drugs and the Office \nof Postmarket Surveillance, I wish to make clear this amendment is not, \nas some have characterized it, about process. It seems to me this is \nthe ultimate of insurance to do the right thing to protect the American \npeople on the safety of drugs. It is based on so many examples I found \nover the last 3 years, where there was not the respect for the Office \nof Postmarketing Surveillance there ought to be from the Office of New \nDrugs.\n  A lot of safety issues would not have gotten out if we had not had a \nlot of red-blooded, patriotic whistleblowers who would come to \nCongress, such as Dr. Graham, for instance, in the case of Vioxx, such \nas Dr. Mosholder, in the case of depressants for children who were \ncommitting suicide. This ended up with Vioxx coming off the market. \nThis ended up with black-box safety measures in the case of the \nantidepressants.\n  The Institute of Medicine has recognized the importance of these two \ngroups within the FDA working very closely together on making a \ndetermination on postmarketing surveillance. That is what my amendment \ndoes. It makes sure this process works the way the Institute of \nMedicine indicated it should.\n  So as you consider voting on this amendment, I ask my colleagues--\nhimself or herself--one basic question before voting: Since the \nInstitute of Medicine recommends equality between the preapproval \nprocess--in other words, before a drug is marketed--and the \npostapproval process at the FDA, why not vote for this amendment and \nimprove postmarketing safety for the American people?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in a few minutes, we will be prepared to \nvote. I yield myself 3 or 4 minutes.\n  I will include in the Record, at the conclusion of this debate, the \nnames of the staff on our committee who have done superb work. It has \nbeen extraordinary and on both sides of the aisle. We are enormously \nappreciative and grateful.\n  I am also personally appreciative of the work of my friend and \ncolleague, the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Brown, who was here yesterday and \nfilled in. I had the opportunity to travel to Ireland, where they \nsigned and put in place, after 400 years of struggle, the democratic \ninstitutions over there, in a very moving ceremony, which President \nBush had supported--a very special day.\n  This legislation is a reflection of 2\\1/2\\ years of hearings under \nthe leadership of Senator Enzi, when he was chair of the committee, and \nmyself. It incorporates the Institute of Medicine's recommendations, by \nand large, after they had months and months of hearings. The American \npeople ought to understand the legislation, which reflects bipartisan \nsupport in the Senate, is a reflection of the best judgments we could \nhave as a result of months and years of working on this issue and of \nthe membership on it. We are enormously grateful.\n  This legislation is going to make the prescription drugs our families \ntake safer and our food safer. That is very important. It is going to \nensure that the Agency has resources to do follow-on reviews to \ncontinue its important function to be the world leader, the gold \nstandard, for safety for our people and the example for the rest of the \nworld. So this is very important legislation.\n  We are reminded every day of the additional kinds of challenges we \nare facing in terms of safety for our families. We are very aware of \nit. Senator Enzi and I and the members of our committee are going to \ncontinue our study, our review, and continue our activity to ensure we \nare going to have the best in terms of a safe and secure food supply, \npharmaceutical supply, and take advantage of this life science century \nso every American is going to have the best and, hopefully, at the most \nreasonable price, so they can have healthier and stronger families.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I have a number of people I need to thank \nfor their efforts on this bill, and I will do that following the vote \nso that we don't hold up the vote.\n  There has been tremendous cooperation, effort, knowledge, and \ncapability that has been involved, not just of the Senators but also of \nthe staffs. The staffs on both sides of the aisle have spent countless \nhours on this, even on weekends. In fact, I know of one day on one \nweekend they worked about 20 hours together to pull this thing together \nand get some of the final issues worked out. But they worked the entire \nweekend for at least the last three weekends. They will look forward to \na little time to rest, and we will probably give them a day. That is \nbecause we have so many things happening in the committee, and Senator \nKennedy and I are determined to get a lot of that done to help the \nAmerican people with their health and with their education and in the \narea of workplace safety and training and pensions.\n  But on this bill, I hope people will join us in supporting it. Of \ncourse I hope they will join us in maintaining a balance to take it to \nconference committee and to defeat the three amendments that are before \nus this morning.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1039\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes for debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 1039.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will speak in favor of 1039. I have 30 \nseconds, did you say, or 1 minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, one of the issues that has been very \nmuch a shortcoming within the FDA besides lack of respect for the \nscientific process, but it is involved in the issue of this amendment \nas well, is whether scientists in the FDA who have the responsibility \nof postmarketing surveillance get the respect they ought to from the \nOffice of New Drugs that previously had approved the drug. We have \nfound in the case of Vioxx, in the case of antidepressants for \nchildren, and in a lot of other areas as well that this has just not \nbeen the case.\n  My amendment will follow the Institute of Medicine recommendation and \nmake sure there is adequate time and consideration given to \npostmarketing surveillance, the same as there is to the approval of the \ndrug in the first place. So I ask for approval of this amendment. It is \nbacked by the Institute of Medicine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment. I appreciate the \nthought that went into it, and I know that before we did this bill and \nput into place some of the processes we have in the toolbox for \npostapproval--which, nevertheless, existed before for the FDA--this \namendment would have been necessary. But in light of the toolbox we \nprovide and the dispute resolution we have, it would add an unnecessary \nlayer of bureaucracy.\n  We have designed the bill to be a nimble and responsive process to \ndeal with emerging drug safety issues. We want drugs on the market \nfaster, we want to know about anything that goes wrong faster, and we \nthink that is built into it. We do have a dispute resolution in the \nbill with tight guidelines that will result in rapid approvals. We \ndon't need the additional process.\n  The amendment separates what should be together and delays what\n\n[[Page S5772]]\n\nshould be rapid. So I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Could we ask \nunanimous consent that we have the yeas and nays on the other two \namendments? I ask unanimous consent that it be in order now for the \nyeas and nays on the other two amendments and then on final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second on the remaining \namendments? There appears to be a sufficient second. The yeas and nays \nare ordered on the remaining amendments as well.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1039.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Indiana (Mr. Bayh) and \nthe Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes for debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 998.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I have 1 minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the issue is the level of civil and \nmonetary penalties. If the fines are nothing more than the cost of \ndoing business, you can't change behavior and you can't deter bad \nbehavior. My feeling is the levels in this underlying bill are not high \nenough to get the attention of the drug companies. After all, if a \ncompany does what it is supposed to do, a drug company doesn't need to \nfear any penalties. It is that simple.\n  I ask my colleagues to support my amendment so it has real teeth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I have to oppose this amendment in keeping \nwith having a balance in the bill that we have agreed on. This is the \nfirst time civil monetary penalties have been assessed for violations \nof the drug safety plan. That is what is in our bill. We do have civil \npenalties in the bill. The civil penalties are the same as the medical \ndevices. That is how we decided at what level to do it.\n  We added civil penalties, and there will be more work done on this \nissue probably as we get to conference. I want to establish the fact \nthat civil penalties are in the bill. I want to arrive at the level \nthat the civil penalties are assessed with more consideration and with \ndebate with the House. This amendment could burden small businesses and \ncreate problems there.\n  Civil penalties are part of the bill we put together with a \ncompromise. I ask that my colleagues vote against the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n998. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 1034.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, 2 years ago, an advisory committee of the \nFDA sat down to judge painkiller drugs and whether they were safe to \nsell to America. They made the recommendation that selling Vioxx to \nAmerica was safe. Ten of the members of that advisory committee had a \nfinancial conflict of interest when they made the decision. Had those \n10 members with the conflict not been there, the panel would not have \nrecommended keeping those drugs on the market.\n  This amendment Senator Bingaman and I offer will take the conflict of \ninterest out of the advisory committees. We will allow one waiver for \nsomeone with a conflict of interest, and we will say that others who \nparticipate as guest experts have to leave the room before any \ndeliberation or vote.\n  We will hear from the other side that the Food and Drug \nAdministration has an idea of how they are going to change this rule at \nsome future time.\n\n[[Page S5773]]\n\nThis is not an idea we are proposing, it is a law--a law to protect the \nintegrity of the advisory committees and the drugs and medical devices \nwhich are sold across America.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the FDA has a new policy, a new procedure \nout there.\n  Basically, what the Durbin amendment says is, one size fits all. That \nconcept has been rejected by the Europeans, rejected by the Canadians, \nand basically rejected by the Institute of Medicine. In this life \nscience century, researchers who are looking at cancer drugs may be \nexamining 15 different components. Are we going to say that if a \nconflict exists with one of those components that they meet the Durbin \namendment standard. This would exclude some of the most knowledgeable \npeople in this country from participating in the review of breakthrough \ndrugs.\n  The FDA says they have adopted transparency. Everyone in the Senate \nis going to know who sits on the advisory committees. There is a \nfinancial limitation of $50,000 at the FDA now. Everyone is going to \nknow the existence of any conflicts. It is a new day out there. We have \nnow have transparency, but virtually everyone who understands that we \nare in the life science century says we have to have the best \nscientific minds at the table, and so the Institute of Medicine said: \nDon't go with a one-size-fits-all, which the Durbin amendment does.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1034. The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Americans bear the majority of research and \n     development costs for the world, which could undermine the \n     value of existing United States pharmaceutical patents and \n     could impede access to important therapies.\n       (7) There is a growing global threat of counterfeit \n     medicines and increased need for the United States Trade \n     Representative and other United States agencies to use \n     available trade policy measures to strengthen laws and \n     enforcement abroad to prevent harm to United States patients \n     and patients around the world.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the United States Trade Representative should use all \n     the tools at the disposal of the Trade Representative to \n     address violations and other concerns with intellectual \n     property, including through--\n       (A) bilateral engagement with United States trading \n     partners;\n       (B) transparency and balance of the annual ``Special 301'' \n     review and reviews of compliance with the intellectual \n     property requirements of countries with respect to which the \n     United States grants trade preferences;\n       (C) negotiation of responsible and fair intellectual \n     property provisions as part of bilateral and regional trade \n     agreements; and\n       (D) multilateral engagement through the World Trade \n     Organization (WTO); and\n       (2) the United States Trade Representative should develop \n     and submit to Congress a strategic plan to address the \n     problem of countries that infringe upon American \n     pharmaceutical intellectual property rights and the problem \n     of countries that engage in price manipulation.\n\n     SEC. 517. CONSULTATION REGARDING GENETICALLY ENGINEERED \n                   SEAFOOD PRODUCTS.\n\n       The Commissioner of Food and Drugs shall consult with the \n     Assistant Administrator of the National Marine Fisheries \n     Service of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration to produce a report on any environmental risks \n     associated with genetically engineered seafood products, \n     including the impact on wild fish stocks.\n\n     SEC. 518. REPORT ON THE MARKETING OF CERTAIN CRUSTACEANS.\n\n       Not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, shall submit to \n     the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and the \n     Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the \n     Senate, a report on the differences between taxonomy of \n     species of lobster in the subfamily Nephropinae, and species \n     of langostino, specifically from the infraorder Caridea or \n     Anomura. This report shall also\n\n[[Page S5806]]\n\n     describe the differences in consumer perception of such \n     species, including such factors as taste, quality, and value \n     of the species.\n\n     SEC. 519.

ADULTERATED FOOD REGISTRY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In 1994, Congress passed the Dietary Supplement Health \n     and Education Act (P.L. 103-417) to provide the Food and Drug \n     Administration with the legal framework to ensure that \n     dietary supplements are safe and properly labeled foods.\n       (2) In 2006, Congress passed the Dietary Supplement and \n     Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act (P.L. 109-462) \n     to establish a mandatory reporting system of serious adverse \n     events for non-prescription drugs and dietary supplements \n     sold and consumed in the United States.\n       (3) The adverse event reporting system created under the \n     Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer \n     Protection Act will serve as the early warning system for any \n     potential public health issues associated with the use of \n     these food products.\n       (4) A reliable mechanism to track patterns of adulteration \n     in food would support efforts by the Food and Drug \n     Administration to effectively target limited inspection \n     resources to protect the public health.\n       (b) In General.--Chapter IV of the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 341 et seq.) is amended by adding at \n     the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 417.

ANNUAL REPORT TO CONGRESS.\n\n       The Secretary shall, on an annual basis, submit to the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions and the \n     Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and the Committee \n     on Energy and Commerce and the Committee on Appropriations of \n     the House of Representatives a report that includes, with \n     respect to the preceding 1-year period--\n       (1) the number and amount of food products regulated by the \n     Food and Drug Administration imported into the United States, \n     aggregated by country and type of food;\n       (2) a listing of the number of Food and Drug Administration \n     inspectors of imported food products referenced in paragraph \n     (1) and the number of Food and Drug Administration \n     inspections performed on such products; and\n       (3) aggregated data on the findings of such inspections, \n     including data related to violations of the Federal Food, \n     Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 201 et seq.), and \n     enforcement actions used to follow-up on such findings and \n     violations.\n\n     SEC. 608. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       Nothing in this title (or an amendment made by this title) \n     shall be construed to affect--\n       (1) the regulation of dietary supplements under the Dietary \n     Supplement Health and Education Act; or\n       (2) the adverse event reporting system for dietary \n     supplements created under the Dietary Supplement and \n     Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act.\n\n     SEC. 609. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this \n     title (and the amendments made by this title) such sums as \n     may be necessary.\n\n              TITLE VII--DOMESTIC PET TURTLE MARKET ACCESS\n\n     SEC. 701. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Domestic Pet Turtle Market \n     Access Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 702. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Pet turtles less than 10.2 centimeters in diameter have \n     been banned for sale in the United States by the Food and \n     Drug Administration since 1975 due to health concerns.\n       (2) The Food and Drug Administration does not ban the sale \n     of iguanas or other lizards, snakes, frogs, or other \n     amphibians or reptiles that are sold as pets in the United \n     States that also carry salmonella bacteria. The Food and Drug \n     Administration also does not require that these animals be \n     treated for salmonella bacteria before being sold as pets.\n       (3) The technology to treat turtles for salmonella, and \n     make them safe for sale, has greatly advanced since 1975. \n     Treatments exist that can nearly eradicate salmonella from \n     turtles, and individuals are more aware of the causes of \n     salmonella, how to treat salmonella poisoning, and the \n     seriousness associated with salmonella poisoning.\n       (4) University research has shown that these turtles can be \n     treated in such a way that they can be raised, shipped, and \n     distributed without having a recolonization of salmonella.\n       (5) University research has also shown that pet owners can \n     be equipped with a treatment regiment that allows the turtle \n     to be maintained safe from salmonella.\n       (6) The Food and Drug Administration should allow the sale \n     of turtles less than 10.2 centimeters in diameter as pets as \n     long as the sellers are required to use proven methods to \n     treat these turtles for salmonella.\n\n     SEC. 703. SALE OF BABY TURTLES.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Food and \n     Drug Administration shall not restrict the sale by a turtle \n     farmer, wholesaler, or commercial retail seller of a turtle \n     that is less than 10.2 centimeters in diameter as a pet if--\n       (1) the State or territory in which such farmer is located \n     has developed a regulatory process by which pet turtle \n     farmers are required to have a State license to breed, hatch, \n     propagate, raise, grow, receive, ship, transport, export, or \n     sell pet turtles or pet turtle eggs;\n       (2) such State or territory requires certification of \n     sanitization that is signed by a veterinarian who is licensed \n     in the State or territory, and approved by the State or \n     territory agency in charge of regulating the sale of pet \n     turtles;\n       (3) the certification of sanitization requires each turtle \n     to be sanitized or treated for diseases, including \n     salmonella, and is dependant upon using the Siebeling method, \n     or other such proven non-antibiotic method, to make the \n     turtle salmonella-free; and\n       (4) the turtle farmer or commercial retail seller includes, \n     with the sale of such a turtle, a disclosure to the buyer \n     that includes--\n       (A) information regarding--\n       (i) the possibility that salmonella can re-colonize in \n     turtles;\n       (ii) the dangers, including possible severe illness or \n     death, especially for at-risk people who may be susceptible \n     to salmonella poisoning, such as children, pregnant women, \n     and others who may have weak immune systems, that could \n     result if the turtle is not properly handled and safely \n     maintained;\n       (iii) the proper handling of the turtle, including an \n     explanation of proper hygiene such as handwashing after \n     handling a turtle; and\n       (iv) the proven methods of treatment that, if properly \n     applied, keep the turtle safe from salmonella;\n       (B) a detailed explanation of how to properly treat the \n     turtle to keep it safe from salmonella, using the proven \n     methods of treatment referred to under subparagraph (A), and \n     how the buyer can continue to purchase the tools, treatments, \n     or any other required item to continually treat the turtle; \n     and\n       (C) a statement that buyers of pet turtles should not \n     abandon the turtle or abandon it outside, as the turtle may \n     become an invasive species to the local community, but should \n     instead return them to a commercial retail pet seller or \n     other organization that would accept turtles no longer wanted \n     as pets.\n\n     SEC. 704. FDA REVIEW OF STATE PROTECTIONS.\n\n       The Commissioner of Food and Drugs may, after providing an \n     opportunity for the affected State to respond, restrict the \n     sale of a turtle only if the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services determines that the actual implementation of State \n     health protections described in this title are insufficient \n     to protect consumers against infectious diseases acquired \n     from such turtle at the time of sale.\n\n             TITLE VIII--IMPORTATION OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS\n\n     SEC. 801. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Pharmaceutical Market \n     Access and Drug Safety Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 802. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) Americans unjustly pay up to 5 times more to fill their \n     prescriptions than consumers in other countries;\n\n[[Page S5809]]\n\n       (2) the United States is the largest market for \n     pharmaceuticals in the world, yet American consumers pay the \n     highest prices for brand pharmaceuticals in the world;\n       (3) a prescription drug is neither safe nor effective to an \n     individual who cannot afford it;\n       (4) allowing and structuring the importation of \n     prescription drugs to ensure access to safe and affordable \n     drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration will \n     provide a level of safety to American consumers that they do \n     not currently enjoy;\n       (5) American spend more than $200,000,000,000 on \n     prescription drugs every year;\n       (6) the Congressional Budget Office has found that the cost \n     of prescription drugs are between 35 to 55 percent less in \n     other highly-developed countries than in the United States; \n     and\n       (7) promoting competitive market pricing would both \n     contribute to health care savings and allow greater access to \n     therapy, improving health and saving lives.\n\n     SEC. 803. REPEAL OF CERTAIN SECTION REGARDING IMPORTATION OF \n                   PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.\n\n       Chapter VIII of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \n     (21 U.S.C. 381 et seq.) is amended by striking section 804.\n\n     SEC. 804.

Her knowledge and drafting skills were central to \nthis bill.\n  I thank Keith Flanagan for his work on the children's statutes in \nthis bill, and Dave Schmickel, who is our resident drug patent expert, \nfor his ongoing work on follow-on biologics.\n  Others on the team I would like to thank include Todd Spangler and \nBrittany Moore, who provided the required backup that goes with moving \na bill of this magnitude.\n  Finally, I thank my staff director, Katherine McGuire, whose steady \nhand in negotiating and communication skills and ability to juggle a \nnumber of issues at the same time and tap dance and do all sorts of \nthings that make these bills possible provided the cement for the \nentire process.\n  I would also like to thank Ilyse Schuman, my chief counsel, for her \nprecision and attention to detail.\n  I thank Amy Angelier Shank for her great work on the budget aspects \nof the bill; my press team, Craig Orfield and Mike Mahaffey; and my \nchief of staff, Flip McConnaughey, who was good at putting out \nbrushfires throughout the process and kind of maintaining the core to \nour whole process.\n  On Senator Kennedy's staff, I would like to thank Michael Myers, \nDavid Bowen, David Dorsey, Missy Rohrbach, Jeff Teitz, David Noll, and \nTom Kraus. Senator Kennedy's staffers were reasonable negotiators \nthroughout the process and open and patient to hearing all sides of any \nissue.\n  As I mentioned before, Senator Hatch was responsible for the first \nFDA Revitalization Act, and I would like to thank him and his staff, \nPatty DeLoatche and Trish Knight, for helping me with the second FDA \nRevitalization Act.\n  With Senator Gregg's office, and for his assistance with the health \nIT for drug safety, I thank Dave Fisher and Liz Wroe.\n  Stephanie Carlton from Senator Coburn's staff and Jenny Ware with \nSenator Burr were also integral to many parts of the bill.\n  I would like to thank my colleague from Kansas, Senator Roberts, and \nhis staff, Jennifer Swenson, Kate Anderson, and Mike Seyfert, for their \nincredible work on our direct-to-consumer advertising.\n  I also thank my colleague, Senator Harkin, and his staffer, Mike \nWoody, for his hard work on the issue.\n  I thank Meghan Hauck, who is with Senator McConnell, for her great \nassistance throughout the process and her tireless hours.\n  I thank Isaac Edwards, Amanda Makki, Tyler Thompson, Jennifer \nClaypool, and Mary-Sumpter Johnson.\n  Finally, there is a group of people without whom none of this would \nhave happened. They work behind the scenes and make the rest of us look \ngood. I am talking about the dedicated folks at legislative counsel, \nStacy Kern-Scheerer, Bill Baird, Amy Gaynor, and the rest of the \nlegislative counsel team. They have drafted forever on this, and \nredrafted, helped make this concept a reality. They did it with class, \ngrace, patience, kindness, and I cannot thank them enough.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, one of the great joys of serving in the \nSenate has been working with my friend and colleague from Wyoming, \nSenator Enzi, on different legislation. He does it the old-fashioned \nway. He believes that what we ought to do is have the hearings on the \nproblem and then listen to various alternatives and then try to work \nout a solution and carry the process forward. That is the old-fashioned \nway. Today people look at different issues, file bills, and try and \nward off interventions. He has a deep-seated conservative philosophical \ncommitment. He and I differ on some matters, but we always try to find \ncommon ground. We have been able to find it certainly on this \nlegislation and many other pieces of legislation. I look forward to \ncontinuing this tradition. I am personally grateful to him for all his \nhelp in guiding us. You can see the closeness of these votes. This is \nenormously important legislation to bring the Food and Drug \nAdministration into the 21st century. But there are strong feelings, \nstrong opinions, strong arguments on different ways to do so. We have \nlegislation. It is solid legislation. We are proud of it. I think the \noverwhelming, virtually unanimous vote of the Senate on both sides is a \nvindication of the efforts our committee has made. It starts with \nSenator Enzi. I am grateful to him.\n  I see Sherrod Brown, the Senator from Ohio, was kind enough yesterday \nto stand in for me when I had the great honor to witness the coming \ntogether in Northern Ireland after 400 years of\n\n[[Page S5823]]\n\nconflict and the establishment of democratic institutions in a very \nmomentous historical moment. When I left Monday night, there was a \ncertain element of chaos surrounding this bill, and coming back early \nthis morning, under the great work of Senator Enzi and Senator Brown, \nwe had an orderly path to proceed. He is knowledgeable about health \nissues and had a very distinguished record on health policy before he \ncame to the Senate. He has not missed a beat in working through the \nissues. He has been invaluable to me personally and to our committee. I \nthank Senator Brown for all of his good work.\n  Quickly: I would like to thank my friend, Senator Dodd for his work \non all of the issues that affect kids' drugs and devices; Senator \nClinton for her work on drugs and devices; Senator Mikulski for her \nwork on the issues of transparency, enormously important provisions on \nwhich this legislation depends; Senator Hatch for his work on \nantibiotics; Senator Gregg for his work on the databases and Web \nportal; Senators Roberts and Harkin for their work on the direct to \nconsumer advertising issue, which involves a lot of different policy \nissues and a lot of emotion and feeling. They worked very hard with the \nstaff, we had very solid recommendations on this; Senator Stabenow for \nher work on the citizens' petitions in order to help get product onto \nthe markets in a quicker way. I would also like to thank Senator Brown \nand Senator Brownback, for their enormously creative innovative idea \nwith regard to neglected diseases. This is something the United States \nshould be doing more of, and they have been very creative in coming up \nwith an idea; Senator Coburn on the doctor-patient relationship, a \nsubject matter he feels intensely about and has been helpful to us on \nthe legislation; Senator Durbin on food safety provisions, very \nimportant and helpful; Senator Alexander on the children's drugs; \nSenator Allard on food safety issues; Senator Lincoln on food safety \nincluding the raised-fish issue.\n  These are some of the items. Again, we thank staff members: From my \nstaff, Dave Bowen, David Dorsey, David Noll, and Caya Lewis, all who \nhave spent a great deal of time and effort over these past weeks, \nMichael Myers and Carmel Martin and Missy Rohrbach, Tom Kraus, I thank \nthem enormously.\n  I express appreciation to Senator Enzi's staff. If people try to find \nsolutions, rather than perpetuate differences, it makes an enormous \ndifference. That was certainly true of all the staffs on our committee. \nI thank Amy Muhlberg and David Schmickel and Keith Flanagan and \nKatherine McGuire, Shana Christrup; Senator Brown's staff: Ellie \nDehoney; Senator Dodd: Tamar Magarik; Senator Mikulski: Ellen-Marie \nWhelan; Senator Hatch's staff: Patty DeLoatche, and Trisha Knight; Mike \nWoody from Senator Harkin; Senator Gregg: Liz Wroe; Senator Roberts: \nJennifer Swenson, Mike Seyfert, and Kate Anderson; Senator Clinton's \nstaff: Ann Gavaghan and Andrea Palm. I am sure I might have missed \nsomeone, but we will make sure they are included in the Record.\n  We thank all our colleagues and friends. We look forward to meeting \nwith the House and reflecting the Senate's best judgment on the \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, over the past 10 days we have had a good debate about \nimportant issues affecting the safety of our Nation's citizens, about \nthe drugs they use when they are ill, and about the food they eat every \nday.\n  S. 1082 will reauthorize two important user fee programs at the FDA. \nFirst among these is the prescription drug user fee program. In 2008, \nthe program is projected to supply the FDA with nearly $400 million to \nhelp support new drug reviews and monitor the safety of drugs once they \nare approved and on the market. Additionally, the bill will reauthorize \nthe medical device user fee program, which subsidizes the medical \ndevice review process. Both these programs speed new medical products \nto patients by enhancing the resources the FDA can devote to medical \nproduct review, without changing the standards that must be met for FDA \napproval or clearance.\n  These resources to enhance speedy access to drugs and biologics are \nbalanced with several significant provisions that will improve \npostapproval drug safety. A public-private partnership involving the \nFDA will build a network of health care databases to gather far better \ninformation about the safety risks of prescription drugs. Expanded drug \nuser fees would also be used to develop this active surveillance system \nfor all FDA approved drugs.\n  The bill will create an additional risk-based method for approving \nand monitoring new drugs and biologics, called risk evaluation and \nmitigation strategies, or REMS. A REMS consists of a flexible \ncollection of tools that the agency can apply to address the unique \nrisks associated with a new drug. From labeling changes to postapproval \nsafety studies to measures to assure safe use of a drug, the bill gives \nFDA important new authorities to address safety issues that arise after \na drug is approved. For the first time, civil money penalties will \ndeter noncompliance. The bill increases drug user fees to implement the \nREMS and enhance the postapproval drug safety system.\n  Furthermore, this legislation would improve transparency, strengthen \nthe agency's science-based culture, and inspire the trust of the \nAmerican public. For example, it would require the FDA to identify and \ndisclose conflicts of interest among advisory committee members who \nprovide the agency expert scientific recommendations.\n  It would also improve access to information for patients and health \ncare providers by launching a pubic database with the results of \nclinical trials. A clinical trials registry would enhance patient \nenrollment and provide a mechanism to track the progress of clinical \ntrials.\n  Finally, the legislation would establish the Reagan-Udall Foundation \nfor the FDA to head collaborative research projects, among the FDA, \nacademic institutions, and industry intended to improve medical product \ndevelopment and evaluation.\n  I appreciate Senator Dodd and Senator Clinton's leadership to promote \nthe safety of drugs and devices used to treat children.\n  I thank Senator Roberts and Senator Harkin for working with Senator \nEnzi and me to design constitutionally sound, effective, and feasible \ncontrols on DTC advertising. The amendment we produced will ensure the \ninformation that ads provide is accurate, clear, and conspicuous \nwithout imposing a moratorium.\n  I commend Senators Stabenow, Brown, Lott, Thune, Coburn, and Hatch \nfor coming to a solution on the issue of citizens' petitions. They were \nable to craft an amendment that ensures that only citizens' petitions \nwith meritorious claims could delay approval of a generic drug and that \nfrivolous petitions will not lead to unwarranted delays in the approval \nof new generic drugs.\n  I applaud Senator Brownback and Senator Brown for their novel \nproposal to encourage investment in new medicines for neglected \ntropical diseases. Their proposal entitles companies that develop new \ntherapies or vaccines to a voucher allowing them a priority review at \nthe FDA for a product of their choosing. It would provide \npharmaceutical manufacturers a significant incentive without raising \ncosts to consumers or relaxing the safety standards applied to the drug \ngiven priority review.\n\n  I would also like to draw attention to the essential amendment \nintroduced by Senator Hatch, with important contributions from Senators \nBrown, Burr, Stabenow, and others. The amendment would close a loophole \nthat did away with the incentive to bring old but never approved \nantibiotics to market. It would also establish a public process to \nidentify drug-resistant infections that are orphan diseases and that \ncould be treated with orphan drugs. Additionally, the amendment would \nmake certain molecules that are a part of old active ingredients \neligible for recognition as new active ingredients, provided they will \nbe used for a new indication. This provision includes limits that would \nprevent pharmaceutical manufacturers from abusing the process to extend \nthe life of old active ingredient drugs.\n  Finally, I am grateful to my friend, Senator Enzi, for his leadership \nand commitment to addressing prescription drug safety. We have worked \ntogether for over 2\\1/2\\ years to develop this legislation, and I am \nproud of where we are today.\n\n[[Page S5824]]\n\n  I have already thanked a number of people, and I would also like to \nthank, on Senator Enzi's staff, Ilyse Schuman, and on my own staff, \nStacy Sachs, Molly Nicholson, Jeff Teitz, and Charlotte Burrows, and \ntwo of my interns, Ashley Bennett and Lara Mounir.\n  I would also like to thank the many other staff members, both on and \noff the committee, who did such great work on this bill: Carmen Green, \nNancy Hardt, Paula Burg, Lisa German, Jessica Gerrity, Dora Hughes, Ed \nRamos, Ben Klein, Jim Esquea, David Lazarus, Lisa Layman, Jenny Ware, \nMary-Sumpter Johnson, Stephanie Carlton, and Jennifer Claypool.\n  I would also like to thank the legislative counsels Bill Baird, Amy \nGaynor, and Stacey Kern-Scheerer for all of their hard work on this \nbill.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, today the Senate voted to approve S. \n1082, the Food and Drug Administration Revitalization Act. I am very \npleased the Senate took this action and I now look forward to its \nconsideration in the House.\n  Unfortunately, I was not present to vote for the bill, but I would \nlike the record to reflect that I had planned to vote in favor of this \nlegislation. Just last weekend, Kansas experienced a horrible disaster \nwhen a tornado devastated an entire community and took the lives of \nseveral Kansans.\n  Late last Friday evening, the town of Greensburg, KS, was literally \nwiped off the map by an enormous tornado. As a result of this and \nstorms associated with the system, 12 Kansans are confirmed dead, and \nall of the 1500 residents of Greensburg have been displaced. What we \nhave experienced in Greensburg is unlike any other event in recent \nKansas history. The hospital is gone, the schools are gone, every \nchurch is gone, virtually every business in the community is gone, \nincluding all of Main Street. Estimates are that fully 95 percent of \nthe structures in the town are damaged or destroyed. Because of this \ndevastation, I invited President Bush to come to Greensburg, KS, and \nview the damage from this unspeakable disaster. Today, President Bush \nis in Greensburg, and I, along with other members of the Kansas \ncongressional delegation, are showing him the devastation this \ncommunity has experienced, so I could not be present to vote for S. \n1082.\n  However, I want my colleagues to know that I support this legislation \nand would have voted in favor of the bill if I were present. I believe \nS. 1082 will give FDA the tools to ensure drug safety and will renew \nsome very important prescription drug and medical device programs. I am \nalso pleased the bill includes an amendment I sponsored with Senators \nHarkin, Burr, and Coburn to improve the drug advertisement provisions \nin the underlying bill. This amendment was accepted unanimously by the \nSenate.\n  Our amendment addresses the first amendment concerns with the \nadvertising provisions in the original bill and gives the FDA the tools \nthey need to protect the public from false or misleading prescription \ndrug advertisements. We believe this amendment is a more commonsense \napproach to dealing with prescription drug advertisements and ensures \nthe public will get truthful and accurate information about new \nprescription drugs.\n  I especially want to thank Chairman Kennedy, Ranking Member Enzi, and \nSenator Harkin for their leadership and hard work on this issue. I also \nthank Senators Burr and Coburn for their cooperation and cosponsorship \nof my amendment. This amendment represents the result of our efforts to \nachieve an outcome that is acceptable to all of us. The agreement that \nwas accepted today is a fair compromise that addresses the concerns of \nall of the Members involved\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I voted against Senator Durbin's amendment \nbecause it would have forced the removal of the best scientific minds \nfrom the oversight of the safety of our Nation's food and prescription \ndrug approval process. Though well intentioned, the Durbin amendment \nwould have limited the advice available to the Food and Drug \nAdministration for critical decisions pertaining to consumer safety. I \nwill support the efforts to ensure that conflicts of interest do not \ninterfere with the safety of the American people, and I will work to \nensure that the country's best experts continue to secure our \nmedications and food supply.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/09/senate-section/article/S5824-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5824-S5837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF DEBRA ANN LIVINGSTON TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE \n                         FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in the time allotted to me, I will talk \nabout some other things. Later this afternoon, a wonderful American man \nwho had a life that epitomizes what is best in our country will be \nburied in Arlington. I am speaking about Jack Valenti. Jack and his \nwife Mary Margaret first took my wife Marcel and I under their wings \nwhen I came here as an unknown 34-year-old Senator from Vermont. We had \nso many wonderful times with both of them. There would be times, \nobviously, as many of us did during Jack's years as president of the \nMotion Picture Association, when we would gather for a dinner at the \nMPAA, always with at least one Italian dish, and then watch a first-run \nmovie. Jack would be greeting everybody by name. For those of us who \nsometimes have to remember the names of our own families, he was \nremarkable. But the remarkable thing was, he greeted everybody. He knew \nabout you and was interested in what you were interested in, but also \non the points that he wanted to get across, he would do so in a way \nwith integrity, with brilliance, and with the respect of both \nRepublicans and Democrats, as he would go through the halls of the \nSenate and the House.\n  On a personal basis, with he and Mary Margaret, we would sit \nsometimes having a quiet meal at their house or on one occasion at a \nfavorite restaurant of theirs, on a soft summer evening, sitting \noutdoors and talking about kids and, in that case, their pending \ngrandchild. I could not help but think about this man, who by all \nrights never should have made it through World War II. He was a highly \ndecorated fighter bomber pilot. He went through battles where there \nwere enormous casualties. He received the Distinguished Flying Cross \nand just about every other bravery medal one could, and he survived.\n  He came back to a career that ranged from being somber, as we all \nknow, in Texas at the time of President Kennedy's death, to going on \nthe plane with President Johnson, and sharing those Texas roots and \nworking with him.\n  From a personal point of view, I think of the time he spent with my \nlate mother who was an Italian American. They had that bond. He would \nsingle her out at national gatherings of Italian Americans. She loved \nit. She called me once and said: I saw that nice young man on \ntelevision. I said: Mother, whom are you talking about? She said: Jack \nValenti, that nice young man. I said: Mom, Jack is almost 20 years \nolder than I am. She said: Really. Well, he doesn't look it. And then \ncame the killing shot. She said: Patrick, you should take better care \nof yourself. When Jack had one of his many retirement parties--I will \nspeak to that in a moment--I told that story.\n  I am afraid more than one person in the audience agrees with my \nmother.\n  I said ``one of his many retirements.'' He never retired. He \ncontinued to write books. He had one that he just finished before a \nstroke silenced him a few\n\n[[Page S5825]]\n\nweeks ago. I have a copy of his book in my desk on the Senate floor. I \nhave a copy of all his books. They are well written. He had a command \nof the English language that all of us would like to think we could \nmaster with the best of all speechwriters, and we can't. He did it. He \nwas his own speechwriter. Nobody else could begin to match what he did.\n  One of the things I think of--and I was thinking of this at his \nfuneral, where I had the honor of being an honorary pallbearer--I spoke \nwith Mary Margaret and his son John afterward, his daughter Courtney. I \nwas speaking with others. I remembered an op-ed piece that my friend \nMatt Gerson wrote for the Saturday, April 28, Washington Post about \nJack. Matt refers to the mentoring that he did of so many people. Matt \nrefers to his own mentoring by Jack Valenti.\n  Well, I am one of those Senators--one of hundreds of Senators--on \nboth sides of the aisle mentored by Jack. I, along with my wife, am \namong the thousands of people who will miss his phone calls, who will \nmiss his conversations, who will miss his friendship, and we join in \nsending our condolences to Mary Margaret, and know she carries on great \nmemories of her own, and memories we will continue to share.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the op-ed piece I \nreferred to by Matt Gerson be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [Saturday, April 28, 2007]\n\n                    What Jack Valenti Taught Us All\n\n                            (By Matt Gerson)\n\n       Jack Valenti lived a unique life between two of society's \n     fascinations--politics and Hollywood. For Republicans and \n     Democrats, for senators and young aides, for celebrities and \n     the legions behind the cameras, interactions with him were \n     graduate seminars in history, politics, human nature and \n     common sense. This extraordinary communicator punctuated \n     every conversation with a witticism linked to his beloved \n     Texas, a quote from an obscure historical figure or a rule \n     passed on to him by his mentor, Lyndon Johnson. In the weeks \n     leading up to his death Thursday, all over town a simple \n     ``How's Jack?'' almost always led to, ``You know, I try to \n     live by something I once heard him say.''\n       I first noticed his reach when a lunch companion said, ``I \n     try to return every phone call the same day I receive it, and \n     I try to treat an appointment secretary like a Cabinet \n     secretary.'' That was followed by a senator who revealed: \n     ``Jack was the first one to contact me after my son died. I \n     will never forget his concern and support. How can I reach \n     his family?''\n       For those Jack mentored during the 38 years he dedicated to \n     America's film industry, it became clear that character was \n     defined by loyalty. In both Washington and Hollywood, people \n     often desert ``friends'' at the first whiff of public \n     disfavor. Not Jack--time and again he insisted that you never \n     abandon a friend who was going through a rough time, and he \n     always stood with a beleaguered colleague or public official \n     who was receiving unwanted publicity.\n       He would tell his team to respect every elected official \n     (``because you never even ran for dog catcher, and they were \n     sent here by the people''). He admonished us that your \n     adversary today might be your ally tomorrow. ``In a political \n     struggle, never get personal--else the dagger digs too \n     deep.''\n       Jack rejected the partisanship that gripped Washington and \n     would warn that ``nothing lasts--today's minority backbencher \n     will be tomorrow's subcommittee chairman.'' On the day the \n     Motion Picture Association of America headquarters was named \n     the Jack Valenti Building, Sen. Ted Stevens observed, ``Jack \n     works across the aisle because he doesn't see an aisle. It is \n     the root of his success and what others ought to emulate.''\n       Each of the six studio chiefs who spoke at the dedication \n     ceremony emphasized that Jack's word was his bond--if he made \n     a promise, he never wavered. His rock-solid commitment gave \n     him unusual credibility with leaders on both coasts and \n     around the world.\n       Jack was a gifted public speaker who put incredible effort \n     into making it all look effortless. He would rework his text \n     behind closed doors, reciting it until the cadence was just \n     right. Jack was ebullient when a president complimented him \n     once on the ``extemporaneous'' remarks he had made at the \n     Gridiron Club. ``The president couldn't believe I didn't have \n     a prepared text. I neglected to mention that I didn't need \n     notes because I spent several days getting ready,'' he said.\n       It was especially fun to watch Washington's most \n     accomplished professionals try to decipher one of his \n     homilies. They eventually got the point and often adopted the \n     line as their own. When a project was in trouble, it was time \n     to ``hunker down like a mule in a hailstorm.'' [Modified from \n     the original Texas vernacular for a family newspaper.] When \n     prospects got even worse, ``The ox was in the ditch.'' But \n     every problem could be addressed if you remembered ``the \n     three most important words in the English language: Wait a \n     minute.''\n       When someone from the MPAA left to take a new job, Jack \n     would say, ``I like to think I teach my people everything \n     they know. But I know I didn't teach them everything I \n     know.'' That line always got a laugh. I worked with Jack for \n     six years and was friends with him for nearly two decades. In \n     the past few years, frankly, I thought I had gleaned every \n     lesson he had to offer. But then I picked up the galleys of \n     his soon-to-be-published memoir, a book that tracks his \n     ``Greatest Generation'' fable. This grandson of Sicilian \n     immigrants, decorated combat pilot, Harvard MBA (``thanks to \n     the greatest piece of social legislation ever devised by \n     man--the G.I. Bill''), presidential adviser and confidant of \n     America's business leaders has left a treatise with even more \n     rules to live by.\n       One paragraph is a must-read for the BlackBerry-addicted. \n     Jack quoted Emerson's observation that ``for every gain, \n     there is a loss. For every loss, there is a gain.'' While \n     lamenting the number of nights he spent away from his family, \n     he reminded us that attending one more reception meant \n     missing a meal around the dinner table, and one extra night \n     on a business trip would mean one less chance to help with \n     homework or watch a soccer game.\n       I have recounted that quote many times over the past few \n     weeks. And while this loss is devastating for many in \n     Washington and Los Angeles, the life lessons that are his \n     legacy are our gain.\n\n\n                    National Guard Equipment Stocks\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier today, we had a meeting of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee. Defense Secretary Gates and Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Pace were there. I was at that \nmeeting. I had questions that I asked. I have been bothered since the \nmeeting, not so much by what they said, but by what has happened in the \nlast few days.\n  Every one of us, when we turn on our television set, sees the \ndevastation in Kansas by a tornado--something we would not see in my \nState of Vermont. But even in a State where these are not unusual \nthings, the devastation of this tornado was unique. I thought yesterday \nabout how the President of the United States, through his spokesperson, \nblatantly dismissed the all too real concerns of the Governor of \nKansas, Governor Sebelius, about the equipment levels available to our \nNational Guard for dealing with such emergencies at home as this \nhorrible disaster I spoke of that befell Greensburg, KS.\n  The White House spokesperson, sitting comfortably at the White House, \nsaid: Well, you know, there is no problem. The Guard has considerable \nequipment stocks still available.\n  Everybody who has studied the situation with our National Guard \naround this country knows that assertion is absurd on a number of \nlevels. Maybe they felt they could make a political statement because \nthe Governor is of another party. But the reality is, the Governor \nspoke the truth. She knows the Guard faces real, incontrovertible \nshortfalls in vital equipment.\n  Contrary to what the White House has said, the Governors--I am \ntalking about the Governors; Republican, Democratic Governors alike--\nand their adjutant generals--those who are the heads of the National \nGuard in their respective States--are reporting something quite \ndifferent than the blase attitude of the White House.\n  State after State reports missing humvees, medium-sized trucks, \ngenerators, dump trucks, communications systems. These are not claims \nfrom just any observer of Guard issues; these are the leaders who have \nbeen elected by the people to provide for their security and deal with \nthese sometimes terrifying State emergencies.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, the Governors command the Guard when \noperating in a State, and we have to give special credence to what they \nsay. The idea that there is no problem--this kind of dismissive ``there \nis no problem''--is equally ridiculous because it has been clearly \ndocumented there is a very real $24 billion equipment shortfall in Army \nNational Guard equipment alone. Now, those are reports that do not take \ninto consideration the shortfalls within the Air National Guard. But \nboth the Active Army and the National Guard agree on this figure. It \nwas developed together with the National Guard Bureau working closely \nwith the Army staff.\n  To say there is no problem, on the one hand, and have an arm of the \nadministration, on the other hand, say there is a $24 billion \nshortfall--to me, that is a problem.\n\n[[Page S5826]]\n\n  What is a greater problem is there are no plans to address this \nshortfall in the long-range budget. There are no plans to buy the \n18,000 needed humvees, no plans to obtain the 30,000 medium-sized \ntrucks, no plans to purchase the 12,000 required generators, no plans \nto purchase the 62,000 communications sets--the list goes on and on.\n  Another reason the White House's assessment of Guard equipment issues \nis so flawed is that everyone--from the Guard leadership to the Army \nleadership to Members here on the Hill--knows that, very frequently, \nthat equipment slated for the Guard never actually makes it to the \nGuard because it is diverted, transferred to the Active Force before it \ngets into Guard stocks.\n  Even when the Guard equipment makes it into the Guard stocks, it is \noften quickly turned around and sent right back off to Iraq, along with \ndeploying Guard units, many of which now face their second Iraq \ndeployment.\n  It is passing strange to me that while this administration asks for a \nblank check to resupply the Iraqi National Guard, they do not have 1 \ncent in their long-range budget to resupply the American National \nGuard. Now, whether someone is for or against the war in Iraq, you \nwould think our own forces--our own American national guard--could be \ntreated at least on par with the Iraqi national guard, especially as we \nsee the brave men and women of our National Guard not only answering \nthe call in Iraq and Afghanistan, but answering the call when there are \ndangers here at home. We do not see them, as we have seen in units of \nthe Iraqi national guard, setting out to kill each other or forming \ndeath squads. So why do we write blank checks for the Iraqi national \nguard when we can't take care of our own? I wish the President and the \nWhite House would come to fully realize this reality. Here is the real \nsituation when it comes to National Guard equipment: The Guard does not \nhave adequate stocks to deal with emergencies where they can maximize \ntheir full potential. In a smaller scale disaster, they cannot respond \nas quickly to support first responders and local law enforcement.\n  That is what we saw recently in Kansas. Now, suppose you have another \nemergency in Kansas or a larger scale emergency or something like \nHurricane Katrina or, God forbid, two simultaneous disasters. The Guard \nis going to be hard pressed to respond as well as it did along the gulf \ncoast almost 2 years ago.\n  Let me show you some photographs. You can see from these photographs, \nthese are things our Guard does. You see this capsized tanker, and \nhelicopters trying to rescue the people. Those are National Guard \nhelicopters.\n  Here we have a forest fire close to an urban area, where homes are in \ndanger. You can see an airplane putting down a fire retardant. That is \na National Guard airplane.\n\n  Here you see a little child being rescued, carried up to a helicopter \nin the arms--the embracing arms, the safety of the arms--of a National \nGuard member.\n  Here you see the rescue of somebody who was in an accident.\n  Here you see National Guard in armored personnel carriers in a \nflooded area. In case you are wondering where that area is, look at the \nsign in the background that says ``Welcome to New Orleans.'' Much of \nthat sign is under water. First responders--the police, fire \ndepartments--in New Orleans were totally overwhelmed, figuratively and \nliterally. The Guard responded.\n  Look at these firefighters, trudging through a forest, at risk to \ntheir own lives, to put out a forest fire. Who are they? National Guard \nmembers.\n  The Secretary of Defense maintained this morning in his appearance \nbefore the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee that the Guard has 56 \npercent of its equipment stocks available. Well, that figure \ncontradicts everything I have heard from other responsible officials, \nwho put the figure closer to 35 percent. Frankly, 35 percent or 56 \npercent is not adequate, by any means.\n  In the latest supplemental spending bill, which the President seemed \nhappy to veto, I worked with my colleague on the National Guard Caucus, \nSenator Bond. We cochair the National Guard Caucus. We also serve on \nthe Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. We added $1 billion for Army \nGuard equipment purchases. That $1 billion was not requested by the \nadministration. We had virtually unanimous support, Republicans and \nDemocrats, in this body for it. It would go directly for dealing with \nthat $24 billion shortfall. Now, that has been vetoed. We are going to \nwork together in a bipartisan fashion to get it back into whatever \nspending bill we pass.\n  We cannot do that unless we work together--unless we work together. \nThis is a case where it almost becomes a cliche to say: We cannot \nafford to let our Guard down--but we cannot. We do not have tornadoes \nin Vermont, but we have had some pretty vicious floods--one that nearly \nwiped out my hometown of Montpelier, VT, the capital. We have had some \npretty vicious ice storms--one that almost removed the agricultural \nsector of a major part of our State.\n  In each case--as hard working as the local responders were, and they \nwere, the police and the fire departments--the first call of the \nGovernor went to the Guard, the National Guard. And they came. They \nrescued people. They kept people going.\n  When you have an ice storm, and it is 10 degrees below zero in your \nState, you can't wait for them to say: Well, we have 56 percent or we \nhave 35 percent of your equipment. The other equipment you need is in \nLos Angeles, and we will ship it to you as quickly as we can. That is \nthe old ``check is in the mail.'' If it is 10 degrees below zero, and \nyou have an ice storm, with all the power lines that come down, people \nare going to die--people are going to die--if they can't get power \nwithin a matter of, really, minutes. The Guard can do that.\n  We know what a fiasco it was with our still dysfunctional Department \nof Homeland Security after Katrina. We have seen how the Department of \nHomeland Security and its FEMA division have still not responded to \nthat. But we did respond when the Governors called out the National \nGuard.\n\n  So I rarely ever respond to comments made by the White House and \ntheir press operation, even when they take gratuitous swipes at me, but \nthis one, I couldn't pass up. They know what the numbers are. They know \nthe Governor of Kansas was speaking the truth. They know the Guard is \nwoefully undersupplied. They know they have been diverting money to pay \nfor the Iraqi National Guard from our Guard. So I think it would be \nreally helpful for the White House to stop showing contempt for the \nviews of our Nation's elected Governors. Take and consider their input, \nrespect their thoughts about the Guard given their places with the \nNational Guard in their States.\n  Let's turn the situation around. Let's come up with a new plan to \nreplenish depleted Guard equipment stocks. We can't afford to continue \nto let our Guard down.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe appropriate charts on this matter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5827]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS09MY07.001\n\n\n\n[[Page S5828]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS09MY07.002\n\n\n\n[[Page S5829]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS09MY07.003\n\n\n\n[[Page S5830]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS09MY07.004\n\n\n\n[[Page S5831]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS09MY07.005\n\n\n\n[[Page S5832]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, with the \ntime to be charged to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the pending \njudicial nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate continues to make significant \nprogress today with another confirmation of another lifetime \nappointment to the Federal bench. The judicial nomination we consider \nis Debra Ann Livingston of New York, who has been nominated to the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. That is the \ncircuit for New York, Connecticut and, of course, Vermont. Professor \nLivingston has the support of both her home State Senators. I thank \nSenator Schumer for chairing the confirmation hearing at which she \nappeared.\n  Professor Livingston is the Paul J. Kellner Professor of Law and vice \ndean of the Columbia Law School, where she has been a professor for 13 \nyears, teaching criminal procedure, evidence, and national security \nlaw. She previously taught at the University of Michigan Law School. \nPrior to her academic career, Professor Livingston served as a Federal \nprosecutor and deputy chief of appeals for the U.S. Attorney's Office \nfor the Southern District of New York and worked in private practice \nfor the Wall Street law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & \nGarrison. I congratulate Professor Livingston and her family on what I \nam sure will be her confirmation today.\n  Coincidentally, this is the anniversary of the date 6 years ago, in \n2001, on which this President began his assault upon the courts by \nannouncing his first list of nominees. With the help of Senate \nRepublicans, this President has sought to pack the courts and tilt them \ndecidedly in one direction. To a great extent, he has succeeded. After \nRepublican Senators stalled President Clinton's nominees to the Fourth, \nFifth, Sixth, D.C., and other circuits, the Senate proceeded to confirm \nthis President's nominees to the very vacancies that had previously \nbeen maintained by pocket filibuster in the Senate.\n  In my time as chairman from mid-2001 to the end of 2002, I worked \nhard to reach out to this President and tried hard to change the tone \nand get the confirmation process back on track. We succeeded in \nconfirming 100 nominees in 17 months, including 17 to the circuit \ncourts. But I could not change the tone alone. This White House chose, \ninstead, to use judicial nominations to divide and to seek political \ngain in the ensuing confrontations.\n  I have tried, again, this year to restore order and civility to the \nprocess. In spite of all our progress and all our efforts, we are still \nconfronted by shrill complaints. More ominous are the signals and \nrumors that the White House is, again, gearing up to nominate more \nextreme nominees and more who do not have the support of their home \nState Senators. That is wrong. It may be the good politics to appeal to \nthe Republican base, but it is wrong to use our courts in that way--\njust as it is wrong to corrupt the law enforcement responsibilities of \nthe Department of Justice.\n  Some will undoubtedly repeat the current Republican ``talking point'' \nthat the Senate must confirm 15 circuit judges this Congress, this year \nand next, because that is a ``statistical average'' of selected years. \nWell, during the 1996 session the Republican-led Senate refused to \nconfirm a single circuit court nominee, not one. That meant that in the \n104th Congress, in 1995 and 1996 combined, only 11 circuit nominees \nwere confirmed.\n  It is true that during the last 2 years of this President's father's \nterm, a Democratic-led Senate confirmed an extraordinary number of \ncircuit nominees--20--in fact. That action was not reciprocated by the \nRepublican majority during the Clinton years.\n  It is true that during the last 2 years of the Reagan administration, \na Democratic-led Senate confirmed 17 circuit court nominees. That \naction was not reciprocated by the Republican majority during the \nClinton years.\n  Instead, the last 2 years of President Clinton's two terms witnessed \na Republican-led Senate confirming only 11 circuit nominees and then, \nwith vacancies skyrocketing to historic highs, 15 circuit nominees in \nthe 106th Congress.\n  Thus, to get to the supposed ``historical average'' that Republicans \nlike to talk about, they take advantage of the high confirmation \nnumbers during Democratic-led Senates and thereby inflate and excuse \ntheir own actions from the Clinton years.\n  There are three more factors that the Republican talking point \nignores: The first is the number of vacancies. The second is adding \nadditional judgeships by congressional action. The third is the number \nof qualified circuit nominees.\n  The last Congress of the Reagan administration, the one in which a \nDemocratic-led Senate confirmed 17 circuit nominees, the circuit court \nvacancies went down from 13 to 8 during the course of the Congress. \nSeven circuit nominations were returned to the President without \naction. In fact, in addition to filling vacancies that were arising in \nthe regular course, the Democratic-led Senate was working to fill many \nof the 24 additional circuit judgeships created in 1984. By the end of \nthe Reagan Presidency all circuit vacancies, those from existing \njudgeships and those created during his Presidency, were reduced from a \nhigh of 25 down to 8.\n  During the last Congress of the first Bush administration, the one in \nwhich a Democratic-led Senate confirmed 20 circuit judges, the circuit \nvacancies again went down, from 18 to 16. Again, the Senate was filling \nboth existing and newly created vacancies. In 1990, during President \nBush's term, Congress authorized an additional 11 circuit judgeships. \nThat was why vacancies at the beginning of the 102nd Congress rose to \n18.\n  By contrast, during the last Congress of the Clinton administration, \nthe one in which a Republican-led Senate confirmed 15 circuit judges, \ncircuit court vacancies skyrocketed from 17 to 26. This rise in circuit \nvacancies had nothing to do with Congress creating additional circuit \njudgeships, however. Unlike during the Reagan administration and during \nthe Bush administration, during the Clinton administration the \nRepublican-led Congress refused to act in accordance with the previous \n6-year cycle for reviewing needed judgeships. Not a single new circuit \njudgeship was created during the Clinton administration that I can \nrecall. Instead, the Republican-led Senate engaged in strenuous efforts \nto keep circuit judgeships vacant in anticipation of a Republican \nPresident. Indeed, at the end of the 106th Congress, the last in the \nClinton Presidency, 17 circuit court nominees were returned to \nPresident Clinton without action. More circuit nominees were returned \nwithout action that Congress than were acted upon by the Senate for the \nfirst time in modern history.\n  Likewise, during the last Congress of the first term of President \nClinton, the one in which a Republican-led Senate confirmed only 11 \ncircuit judges, circuit court vacancies went up, from 16 to 19. Again, \nthis was without the addition of new circuit judgeships.\n  Despite the carping and the clamor, the vacancies on the circuit \ncourts have gone from 26--where a Republican-led Senate forced the \ncircuit vacancies at the end of the Clinton administration--steadily \ndownward during the Bush administration. With the confirmation of Judge \nLivingston, circuit vacancies will be at half that amount today 13--and \napproaching a historic low.\n\n  Judge Livingston will be the third circuit court nomination confirmed \nthis year. It is only May, but we have already equaled the total \ncircuit nominees confirmed in the entire year of 1993. We have far \nsurpassed the total confirmed during the entire 1996 session when the \nRepublican majority would not consider or confirm a single circuit \nnomination of President Clinton's.\n  This will be the 20th circuit court nomination confirmed while I \npresided as Judiciary chairman. It is a little\n\n[[Page S5833]]\n\nknown fact that during the more than 6 years of the Bush Presidency, \nmore circuit judges, more district judges and more total judges have \nbeen confirmed while I served as Judiciary chairman than during either \nof the two Republican chairmen working with Republican Senate \nmajorities.\n  This will be the 18th judicial confirmation this year. It is spring \nand we have already confirmed more judges than were confirmed during \nthe entire 1996 session when President Clinton's nominees were being \nreviewed by a Republican Senate majority. This is the 118th judicial \nconfirmation while I have served as Judiciary chairman. That exceeds by \nmore than a dozen the confirmations Senator Hatch presided over during \nthe more than 2 years he was Judiciary chairman.\n  The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts lists 47 judicial \nvacancies, yet the President has sent us only 24 nominations for these \nvacancies. Twenty-three of these vacancies--almost half--have no \nnominee. Of the 15 vacancies deemed by the Administrative Office to be \njudicial emergencies, the President has yet to send us nominees for six \nof them. That means more than a third of the judicial emergency \nvacancies are without a nominee.\n  This is the third factor I mentioned above, the lack of nominees.\n  This President has shown that he would rather pick politic fights \nthan good judges. I was encouraged at the beginning of this Congress \nthat a few of the most controversial nominees from the last Congress \nwere not renominated. That sensible approach seems to have ended, \nhowever, and this White House seems to be returning to its old, bad \nhabits.\n  Despite the harping and the criticism, the Judiciary Committee has \nbeen working hard to make progress on those nominations the President \nhas sent to us. Of course, when he sends nominees that he knows are \nunacceptable to home State Senators, it is not a formula for success. \nSadly, that is what appears to be happening, again.\n  Before the consideration of the Second Circuit nominee today, we had \nalready proceeded with committee and Senate consideration of the \nnominations of Randy Smith and Thomas Hardiman. They were confirmed to \nthe Ninth and Third Circuits, respectively.\n  Some may recall that I had been working for more than a year to make \nprogress on the Smith nomination. When the President finally \nrenominated Judge Smith for an Idaho vacancy, we were able to make \nquick progress with that nomination.\n  Our circuit court confirmations so far this year are in addition to \nthe 15 lifetime appointments to the Federal district courts we have \nproceeded to confirm. During the entire 1996 session only 17 judges \nwere confirmed. We are doing pretty well with 18 confirmations before \nthe middle of May.\n  With respect to circuit nominees, after this confirmation there will \nbe only 13 vacancies. Eight of those are without a nomination. Of the \nfive remaining current circuit nominees, one was only nominated a few \nweeks ago. Having consulted with the home State Senators from \nMississippi, I have scheduled our next judicial confirmation hearing to \nbe held tomorrow to include Judge Leslie Southwick of Mississippi.\n  All three of the other circuit nominations are renominations that \nwere not considered last Congress with a Republican majority. Two are \nrenominations that the White House made knowing full well that they did \nnot yet have the support of their home State Senators. When I \npreviously chaired the committee, I was able to break the blockade of \nSixth Circuit nominations that was established by the Republican \nmajority when it pocket filibustered several of President Clinton's \noutstanding nominations to the Sixth Circuit. Once we broke through \nwith two Sixth Circuit confirmations in 2002, President Bush was left \nwith seven appointments to the Sixth Circuit during his term in office. \nGiven the White House's unwillingness to work with the home State \nSenators of the two current nominees, however, it will be very \ndifficult to make more progress.\n  With respect to the nomination of Peter Keisler, that renomination is \ncontroversial. He was previously nominated in June of 2006 but was not \nconsidered by the Republican majority then in control. The Republican \nmajority did not seek to proceed with this controversial nomination at \nthat time. In fact, the President and the Republican Senate majority \ninsisted, instead, to proceed over the last several years on other \nnominations to the important D.C. Circuit, which were, themselves, \nhighly controversial. The nominations of Janice Rogers Brown, Thomas \nGriffith and Brett Kavanaugh were each apparently a higher priority for \nthis White House and the Republican majority than the nomination of Mr. \nKeisler. The others have each been confirmed to lifetime appointments \non this very important court. At the end of the last Congress, the \nKeisler nomination was returned to the President without action in \naccordance with Senate Rules.\n  The Republican Senate majority pocket filibustered more than 60 of \nPresident Clinton's qualified and moderate judicial nominees. I have \nproceeded on more judicial nominees far faster than Republicans did on \nPresident Clinton's nominees.\n  With the cooperation of the President, with his working with Senators \nfrom both parties in making his nominations, with the cooperation of \nthe committee and the Senate, we can continue to make progress.\n  I will yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Texas 10 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, we are into the fifth month of the 110th \nCongress. Even before this Congress convened in January, observers were \npredicting that judicial nominations would be one of the most \ncontentious issues that we face. But I think by taking a forward-\nlooking approach, the Senate managed to avoid an unnecessary \nconfrontation. I think, by and large, we have started off on the right \nfoot.\n  Earlier this year, the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times both \napplauded the President for the difficult concessions he made in not \nchoosing to renominate certain previous nominees who generated intense \nopposition. While I thought some of that opposition was mostly unfair \nand unwarranted, I respect the President's decision to extend an olive \nbranch to the new Democratic majority in the Senate. Those two \nnewspapers also encouraged the new Democratic majority to reciprocate \nwith cooperation and fairness.\n  In that spirit of cooperation, Senate Republicans received assurances \nearlier this year from the Democratic majority of a fair and reasonable \npace for the confirmation of nominees to the U.S. courts of appeals. I \nwas pleased to hear the majority leader pledge his cooperation and \nleadership to help this Congress ``at least meet the standards of \nCongresses similarly situated as ours.'' We saw progress in the first \ncouple of months of this year, with the confirmation of two circuit \ncourt nominees.\n  Today, the Senate will vote to confirm a Third Circuit judge. I \nwelcome today's vote and hope it will be an indication of the \nmajority's intent to keep working with us on the pace necessary to meet \nthe historical average that the majority leader has endorsed.\n  Yesterday, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee \ncommented on how he views this progress. I would like to briefly \ndiscuss the historical analogy he cited. First, I should note I am \nproud to continue to closely work on several significant pieces of \nlegislation with the senior Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy. He and I \nhave found common ground on, among other things, historic changes to \nthe Freedom of Information Act and much needed reforms to the U.S. \npatent system. I look forward to working with the chairman to help make \nthese important bills become law.\n\n[[Page S5834]]\n\n  The chairman and I tend to part ways on some issues related to \njudges. I just want to take a moment to comment on the remarks he \ndelivered yesterday on the pace of judicial confirmations. In \nparticular, I am wondering why he chose the year 1996 as the \nappropriate measuring stick for progress on judges made by this \nCongress. Of course, there is one obvious parallel between 1996 and the \npresent year, and that parallel is divided government.\n  In 1996, President Clinton, a Democrat, sat in the White House, and \nthe Senate majority was held by Republicans. But I submit we ought to \nbe in the business of comparing apples with apples. We must look at \nCongresses similarly situated to this Congress. Point in fact: Looking \nto ``similarly situated'' Congresses is the very comparison cited by \nthe majority leader.\n  Mr. President, you will recall the majority leader's commitment to \njudicial nominations--in his own words--to ``at least meet the \nstandards of Congresses similarly situated as ours.''\n  Mr. President, by any reasonable measure, the proper comparison--and \nthe one the majority leader has apparently endorsed--is not with a \nsingle year but with an entire Congress; specifically, with a Congress \nthe final 2 years of a Presidency and a Senate majority of the opposing \nparty. In fact, we are fortunate to be able to look to historical \nparallels during the last three Presidencies, not just one.\n  The landscape we face in the 110th Congress was similarly faced by \nPresident Clinton in 1999 and 2000, during the 106th Congress. \nPresident Clinton worked with the Republican-controlled Senate during \nthe final 2 years of his Presidency to confirm 15 circuit court judges.\n  In 1991 and 1992, the 102d Congress, President George Herbert Walker \nBush worked with a Democrat-controlled Senate during the final 2 years \nof his Presidency. President Bush and the Democrat-controlled Senate \nconfirmed 20 circuit court judges in 1991 and 1992.\n  Finally, in 1987 and 1988, President Reagan finished out his \nPresidency opposite a Democrat-controlled majority in the Senate. \nPresident Reagan and the Democrat-controlled Senate worked together to \nconfirm 17 circuit court judges.\n  Again, I submit we have to compare apples to apples. When we do that, \nwe see somewhere between 15 and 20 circuit court judges were confirmed \nduring each of those final two years of our last three Presidents. That \nis the standard that is relevant to this discussion.\n  The facts are what they are. This Congress has confirmed two circuit \ncourt nominees. We will shortly confirm our third, and that is a good \nthing. But the fact is, we are not yet back on pace to reach the output \nof the last 2 years of the Clinton Presidency--when a 55-member \nRepublican majority in the Senate confirmed 15 circuit court nominees.\n  There is no satisfactory reason I have heard as to why no circuit \ncourt nominees were confirmed in April, or even reported out of \ncommittee. The reasons that have been offered--the vacancy rate is not \nthat bad, the President needs to nominate more circuit court judges, \nand President Clinton was treated worse--are all irrelevant to the \nmajority leader's representations on the Senate floor that this Senate \nwill ``at least'' hit the historical average.\n  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to work with us, \nas we must, and work with the President to get back on track. That is \nour constitutional duty.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, while the Senator is still on the floor, I \nwish he had heard my statement. I can assure him that neither the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee nor the majority leader intends to \nemulate what the Republicans did, with a pocket filibuster of more than \n60 of President Clinton's nominees. I know of nobody on this side of \nthe aisle who expects the Democrats to do a pocket filibuster of 60 of \nPresident Bush's nominees, as the Republicans did of President \nClinton's.\n  It is interesting, when I hear this talk about historical averages, \nthey weren't only--when you bring up the number of times there was a \nDemocratic majority with a Republican President, a Republican President \nwas treated far better than the Republicans treated a Democratic \nPresident. At no time were the Democrats ever pocket-filibustering 60 \nof the President's nominees.\n  There has been talk about President Bush withdrawing some of these \nnominees he had last year. I point out he had a Republican majority \nthroughout the year, and they didn't pass through many. One was opposed \nby organizations that had never taken a position on a judge before--the \nWildlife Federation--and all the Native American councils. Another one \nwas not only involved in running the torture memos, but after swearing \nunder oath and telling us information, he broke that oath by never \ngiving or bringing the information. That was a person who would not \nhave gotten a majority under a Republican-controlled committee. He \nwould not have gotten out of committee because both Republicans and \nDemocrats would have opposed him. So no big deal withdrawing people who \nwere not going to go forward. In fact, in one instance, because \nsomebody was nominated in the wrong State for a circuit court, that \nperson was withdrawn. We moved very quickly to put the next nominee in \nthat came from the right State.\n\n  I remember once that I got criticism from the White House, Karl Rove, \nand Vice President Cheney for holding up because a person asked about a \nnominee. I must admit, to their credit, they withdrew his name after he \nwas indicted and pled guilty to fraud. They are probably kind of happy \nI didn't let him go forward.\n  The Senator from Texas says we should compare. I wish he would stay \nwith me one more moment. If the Senator from Texas doesn't want to \nlisten and we have closed minds, I can't do anything about it.\n  I will say this: I have been chairman for 21 months during President \nBush's Presidency. During that time, counting today's, we have \nconfirmed 20 circuit judges and 98 district judges. One of the other \nchairmen was there for 2 years, there were 18 circuit judges. They were \nthere longer than I have been with less judges; 85 district judges \ncompared to my 98 in less time. Another chairman, 16 circuit judges \ncompared to my 20; 35 district judges compared to the 98 we put \nthrough.\n  What we have done, of course, is the distinguished ranking member, as \nchairman, put together strenuous debate on two Supreme Court nominees. \nI think he knows full well the Democrats cooperated with him, whether \nthey supported the nominee or not, to get them through.\n  Frankly, I am tired of misstatements of the record, and I will take \ntime--I probably will have to have time on every single judge that \ncomes up--to correct that. So people understand, we will not do as the \nRepublicans did and pocket filibuster 60 or more of President Bush's \nnominees and, secondly, obviously we know when the Republican rule, the \nStrom Thurmond rule, kicks in next April, that changes all the rules.\n  I will point out, the proof is in the pudding. In less than 2 years, \nwith the Democrats in control, we have moved faster on the President's \nnominees than during comparable times with Republicans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the subject matter at hand is the \nconfirmation of Ms. Debra Ann Livingston for the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the Second Circuit, and I urge my colleagues to confirm her. She \nhas an excellent, outstanding academic and professional record.\n  She was a superb graduate of Princeton, magna cum laude, 1980, Phi \nBeta Kappa; a graduate of the Harvard Law School in 1984, again, magna \ncum laude. She was editor on the Harvard Law Review, a law clerk to \nJudge Lumbard of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. She \npracticed law with the prestigious firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, \nWharton and Garrison. She was an assistant U.S. attorney in the \nSouthern District of New York. She was a commissioner for the New York \nCity Civilian Complaint Review Board for some years, 1994 to 2003, and \nhas been on the Columbia Law School faculty since 1994 as an associate \nprofessor, a professor in the year 2000, and\n\n[[Page S5835]]\n\nvice dean from 2005 to 2006. She has been rated unanimously well \nqualified by the American Bar Association. I believe she is an \nextraordinary prospect to go to the Court of Appeals for the Second \nCircuit.\n  There has been conversation, discussion, about the confirmation \nprocess. I commend the distinguished chairman for what he has done to \ndate. We work together very closely. In the 109th Congress, he was \nranking member. I liked it better when he was ranking member and I was \nchairman, but we have had bipartisan teamwork.\n  The record for confirmations of circuit judges in the last 2 years of \na Presidential term, when the control of the Senate is in the opposite \nparty, has been in the 15 to 17 range. I am hopeful, perhaps even \noptimistic, that we can get there this year.\n  A good bit remains to be done by the administration in submitting \nnominations. We have some 8 vacancies on the court of appeals which do \nnot have nominations from the White House. Toward that end, there has \nbeen a leadership meeting with the White House counsel. We have tried \nto structure a plan which would enable us to go forward to confirm more \ncircuit judges and to fill the vacancies of district court judges.\n  Many of these courts are in the category of judicial emergencies. As \na practicing lawyer for many years, I can attest firsthand to the \nimportance of having judges on the bench so that litigants can have a \nspeedy disposition of their trials.\n  There is an adage: Justice delayed is justice denied. I think that is \nvery true.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of a prepared statement be \nprinted in the Congressional Record following my extemporaneous remarks \nand that the specific text of my introduction be printed in the Record. \nSometimes comments are made extemporaneous and then the written \nstatement appears in the Record. If anybody reads the Congressional \nRecord, they must wonder why there is so much repetition, so I would \nlike to have an explanation included.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Statement on the Nomination of Debra Livingston to the U.S. Court of \n  Appeals for the Second Circuit and Calling for a Fair Confirmation \n                                Process\n\n                        (Senator Arlen Specter)\n\n       Mr. President, I seek recognition today as the ranking \n     member on the judiciary committee to discuss the state of \n     judicial nominations in the 110th Congress and the nominee \n     pending before the Chamber today.\n       Today, the Senate will confirm Professor Debra Livingston \n     to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. She was \n     first nominated over 300 days ago to a vacancy judged to be a \n     ``judicial emergency'' by the nonpartisan Administrative \n     Office of the Courts. She is a very fine choice for this \n     important court and I am glad she will soon bring her much \n     needed skills to the Second Circuit.\n       Before discussing judicial nominations more generally, I \n     would like to say a few words about Professor Livingston's \n     impressive background as an accomplished attorney, \n     prosecutor, and legal scholar.\n       She graduated magna cum laude from both college and law \n     school: Princeton University in 1980 and Harvard Law School \n     in 1984. At Princeton, she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. At \n     Harvard, she was the Editor for the Harvard Law Review. \n     Following law school, Professor Livingston worked as a law \n     clerk to the Honorable J. Edward Lumbard of the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the Second Circuit. In 1985, after her clerkship \n     with Judge Lumbard, she joined the firm of Paul, Weiss, \n     Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison as an associate, where she \n     worked on a variety of State and Federal litigation.\n       The following year, Professor Livingston joined the Office \n     of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York as \n     an Assistant U.S. Attorney. Her work in the U.S. Attorney's \n     Office focused on criminal trials and appeals. In 1990, she \n     was elevated to serve as Deputy Chief of Appeals, an \n     assignment that had her handling appeals before the Court to \n     which she is now nominated.\n       After a successful career in the public sector, she briefly \n     returned to Paul Weiss in 1991 before leaving the following \n     year to become a law professor. She worked as an assistant \n     professor at the University of Michigan Law School until \n     1994, when she joined the faculty of Columbia Law School as \n     an associate professor. She became a full professor in 2000 \n     and in 2004 became the Paul J. Kellner Professor of Law. Her \n     principal areas of teaching at Columbia have been criminal \n     investigations and evidence and she has published numerous \n     articles in the area of criminal law and co-authored the \n     casebook Comprehensive Criminal Procedure.\n       Professor Livingston has received a unanimous ``well \n     qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association, the \n     highest rating that organization gives. I'm sure she will \n     enjoy a strong positive vote today.\n       Chairman Leahy must be commended for working with Senators \n     on both sides in order to get us off on the right foot during \n     this Congress. Professor Livingston will be the 18th judge, \n     and the third circuit court judge, confirmed this year. This \n     is, admittedly, a much more auspicious beginning than that \n     made by the Republican controlled Congress during President \n     Clinton's final 2 years in office. That said, much work \n     remains to be done.\n       The average for similarly situated Congresses in recent \n     times is 17 circuit court confirmations. Despite its slow \n     beginning, even the 106th Congress ultimately confirmed 15 \n     men and women to the circuit courts and a total of 73 article \n     III judges. And this was a historical low point. At the very \n     least, the 110th Congress should meet or exceed this \n     standard.\n       On several occasions, members of the majority have \n     indicated that we can expect a dramatic slow down in \n     confirmations in the latter part of next year. While I do not \n     agree that historical record supports any kind of ``rule'' in \n     this regard, we do know that the press of a Presidential \n     election has a tendency of slowing down work in the \n     Senate. If nothing else, we can expect the Congress will \n     be in recess for a substantial portion of the second half \n     of next year.\n       Therefore, in order to meet the standards set by similar \n     Congresses in recent times, it will be necessary for us to \n     confirm approximately one circuit court judge for every month \n     we are in session.\n       There are five circuit court nominees currently pending \n     before the Judiciary Committee. Three of these nominees are \n     to vacancies designated as ``judicial emergencies'' by the \n     Administrative Office of the Courts. Some of these \n     nominations are being delayed by home state Senators who have \n     not returned blue slips. It has generally been the practice \n     of the Senate to not proceed without the consent of home \n     state Senators. I have urged these Senators to return these \n     blue slips and allow the process to go forward.\n       Although there is an understandable focus on the circuit \n     courts, it should also be noted that there are 18 district \n     court nominees pending in the Committee, eight of whom have \n     been pending over 120 days, and 14 of whom are awaiting a \n     hearing. These nominations also deserve prompt action.\n       I said before that Chairman Leahy deserves to be commended \n     for the progress made so far. The President also deserves to \n     be commended for acknowledging the reality of a Democratic \n     controlled Congress and withdrawing nominations that the \n     other side has adamantly opposed. This was a very productive \n     step that was rightly commended by Senators of both parties \n     and the editorial pages of major newspapers including the \n     Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times.\n       I have urged the President to build on this precedent by \n     consulting with Senators of both parties as he moves to fill \n     additional vacancies on the federal courts. As of today, \n     eight circuit court and fifteen district court vacancies \n     still do not have nominees. Three additional circuit court \n     vacancies are imminent. In addition, 15 district court \n     vacancies await nominees. The Senate cannot fulfill its duty \n     to provide advice and consent until the President first sends \n     us nominees. I am hopeful he will do so soon.\n       It will take both Republican and Democratic Senators, and \n     the White House, working together to ensure an orderly \n     confirmation process. Both sides have ample reason to \n     complain about past grievances over the last two decades. But \n     we cannot continue settling old scores. The partisan tit-for-\n     tat over judges got so bad that it virtually paralyzed this \n     body during the last Congress. This environment is \n     deleterious to the Senate, to the nominees, and ultimately to \n     litigants who wait for justice as judgeships go unfilled.\n       I believe the 110th Congress provides an opportunity to \n     turn the page. Today's confirmation is further evidence that \n     we are off to a good start. I look forward to working with \n     Chairman Leahy, and all my colleagues, in this effort.\n\n\n                              Immigration\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I now intend to take some of the time \nallocated for the judicial issue to talk very briefly about the \nimmigration question which is front and center in the Congress today. \nIt is second only to the concerns about the Iraq war and the current \nfunding impasse which we have in the constitutional confrontation \nbetween the Congress and the President, and the sustaining of a veto \nand our efforts to try to work that out.\n  I believe there is a universal agreement that the immigration \nsituation in the United States today is an unmitigated disaster. Strong \nlanguage, but not strong enough for what is going on with immigration. \nWe have a porous border and undocumented immigrants are coming into the \nUnited States. They pose a security risk. Terrorists are free to wander \nacross our borders and come into our country and pose potentially grave \nthreats to our national security.\n\n[[Page S5836]]\n\n  We find a significant number of incidents of crime among undocumented \nimmigrants. Crime does not have a sole source, but it is a problem. We \ndefinitely need to get a handle on immigration.\n  We worked very hard in the 109th Congress in the Senate. I give my \ncolleagues in the House of Representatives credit for working very hard \ntoo. We produced a bill out of the Judiciary Committee. It was reported \nto the floor, and it passed the Senate. It was comprehensive reform, \nwhich is what was called for by the President, a bill which would deal \nwith the 11 million undocumented immigrants, would provide for a Guest \nWorker Program, and would, as a preliminary to secure our borders, \nprovide for employer sanctions if employers hired illegal immigrants.\n  The House of Representatives chose a different course to provide only \nfor border security, and it was embarrassing, in my judgment, that we \nwere unable to have a conference and pass an immigration bill last year \nwith both Houses--the Senate and House of Representatives--controlled \nby the Republicans and President Bush, a Republican in the White House. \nBut we find ourselves this year with the unmitigated disaster of \nimmigration, worse now than ever.\n  There have been major efforts to try to find consensus legislation to \npresent to the Senate for consideration. The first meeting was held on \nFebruary 13 of this year, and the meetings have been held continuously \nright up to the present time, almost 3 laborious months. These were not \nabbreviated meetings. These meetings were held every Tuesday, \nWednesday, and Thursday from 4 to 6 o'clock. They were attended by an \naverage of 8 to 10 to 12 Senators. They were attended also by the \nSecretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Homeland Security, \nsignifying the President's deep concern and deep interest in the issue.\n  They started off with Republicans meeting separately, and then we \nmoved into bipartisan meetings. Last week, illustratively, we had 12 \nSenators meeting off the Senate floor for 2\\1/2\\ hours. It is pretty \nhard to keep 12 Senators in one room for 2\\1/2\\ hours, but we did.\n  We have come to what has been categorized as a ``grand bargain.'' \nThat is a term one of our most active participants, Senator Lindsey \nGraham, gave to it because we had the overall structure of an \nimmigration bill. We did not have all the aspects of it worked out, but \nwe were proceeding to provide for real border security--border security \nwhich would increase the number of border guards from 12,000 to 18,000 \nand border security which would encompass a fence. We cannot have one \nacross the entire border, but we can have a fence to secure our major \nmetropolitan areas, illustratively San Diego and southern Arizona.\n  We have worked laboriously to craft identification so an employer \nwould know whether an applicant for a job was legal or illegal. When an \nemployer has the opportunity to be certain of the legal status of those \nhe hires, then the stage is set for tough sanctions on employers so \nthat we can reduce the magnet to bring people to the United States for \njobs when they are not legally in the United States.\n  We have provided the mechanism for dealing with the 11 million \nundocumented immigrants. We have structured a program so it would not \nbe fairly or accurately characterized as amnesty. The requirements of \nthat program are that immigrants learn English, that the immigrants \nhave roots in the United States, that they have held a job for a \nprotracted period of time, that they pay a fine, and that there be a \nso-called touchback provision. It is still not decided as to the issue \nof back taxes, but that is a consideration which is on the table. We \nhave provided for a Guest Worker Program which is what it says; that \nis, people come to the United States for the purpose of filling jobs \nand then will return to their native homes.\n  We provided that if there are people living in the United States \nlegally, citizens or legal immigrants, they would have the first \nopportunity at these jobs.\n  We have held some 23 meetings over the course of the past 3 months. \nSo I was a little surprised to see the statement by the majority leader \nat a press conference yesterday. Perhaps it was said partially in jest, \nbut Senator Reid pointed out that there had been notice for some 2 \nmonths that the immigration bill would be taken up in the last 2 weeks \nbefore the Memorial Day recess. Then he said:\n\n       And anyone who thinks that 2 months is not enough time to \n     get ready should get another occupation.\n\n  Maybe he said it in humor, but certainly I would fit into that \ncategory of looking for another occupation. The distinguished chairman \nof the committee has elected to have the matter go through the \nnegotiating process which I have just described, so he doesn't have to \nseek another occupation. But there are many people on both sides of the \naisle, under the Reid dictum, who now must seek another occupation.\n  I think it is a fair representation to say we have worked \ntenaciously. The problem we face now is that the so-called stakeholders \nall want more than can be divided from what is available. There are \nstakeholders who want more green cards and who want the advantages of \nfamily admission on a widespread basis, and if it were left up to me \nalone I would be in favor of the broadest reach of family unification. \nBut if we are to find the realism of enough green cards to accommodate \nthe undocumented immigrants who are going to come through the process \nat the end of the line, there has to be some give somewhere.\n  The critics of the immigration bill are descending on us from all \nsides before we even have an immigration bill. The Hill publication \nreports today of opposition from Members of the House of \nRepresentatives for Senate legislation when we don't even have \nlegislation in existence. One Member of the House is quoted as saying:\n\n       It is important that the Senate knows there will be strong \n     bipartisan opposition to amnesty.\n\n  Well, we don't even have a bill that could be accused of having \nincluded amnesty, and the outline which we are considering and \ncontemplating is certainly not amnesty by any fair interpretation.\n  The majority leader has said he intends to file under rule XIV today \nand go to the legislation on Monday. As I said yesterday, there is \nstrong opposition to such a practice, at least on this side of the \naisle. It is my hope that we will not face a contested motion to \nproceed. It is my hope we will not face the threat of a filibuster \nagainst the motion to proceed, which would doom immigration reform.\n  We have encapsulated our views in a letter, following the majority \nleader's news conference of today, where a number of us are asking that \nwe rethink the schedule we have. If we bring last year's Senate-passed \nbill to the floor, it is going to have substantial opposition. That has \nalready been announced on both sides of the aisle. Both Democrats and \nRepublicans who supported it last year are opposed to it. If we start \nthere, the floor action is likely to be a free-for-all.\n  I understand the problems of Senate scheduling, but I also understand \nthe vicissitudes, problems, and pitfalls of proceeding where you don't \nhave the structure of a bill which can be reasonably and realistically \ndebated, with amendments, and then decided upon. We don't even have 2 \nweeks. We have to act on the supplemental before the Memorial Day \nrecess if we are to provide the troops with the funding they need.\n  So it is my hope the current process can be allowed to continue. \nThere has been a massive good-faith effort by Republicans and Democrats \nmeeting for very protracted periods of time to come to agreement on a \nbill and to reduce it to written form. I will concede that there has \nbeen a lot of wheel spinning in the process which we have undertaken. \nPerhaps it was an error to abandon the traditional committee process. \nBut that is where we are, and we need more time to flesh out the grand \ncompromise, the grand bargain which we have structured so far.\n  If we are not able to legislate, we are not going to be able to \nprovide for people who are interested in bringing 11 million \nundocumented immigrants out of the shadows, which is the main benefit \nthat comes from those who want to proceed in the traditional American \nway to welcome the immigrants under a systemized plan. If we don't have \ncomprehensive reform, we are not going to provide the border controls \nand the employer sanctions to stop illegal immigration.\n\n[[Page S5837]]\n\n  It may be this is our last best chance. I would urge all sides to \ntake a deep breath and to rethink positions on all sides and try to \nfind a rational, bipartisan way to proceed.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains on my side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 58 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Fifty-eight minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont has 49\\1/\n2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Pennsylvania has \nthe floor, but the Senator from New York wants to speak briefly, and I \nhave also been advised there are a number of Republicans who want to go \nto a burial service. So just so people can plan, as soon as the Senator \nfrom New York has finished his speech, which will be very brief, I am \nprepared to yield back our time to accommodate those who wish to go to \nthe burial service.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, do I understand the Senator from Vermont, \nthe distinguished chairman, is proposing a grand bargain?\n  Mr. LEAHY. No, sir.\n  Mr. SPECTER. A grand bargain which would allocate 1 minute to Senator \nSchumer, and then all time yielded back?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am told the Senator wishes 2 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Sounds excessive to me, but I will go along. When he \nfinishes his speech, if we are prepared to yield back time, I will \nconsider the proposal for the grand bargain.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont yields \ntime.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield to the grand marshal.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, and Raskolnikof as \nwell, since he made the grand bargain once before. It didn't work out \nso well, so I would say to my colleague from Pennsylvania, I hope his \ngrand bargain works out better than Raskolnikof's grand bargain.\n  Anyway, I rise to speak on our nominee, the confirmation of Debra \nLivingston. She is a legal superstar from my home State of New York, \nand she is nominated to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Let me just say we in New York have a system in place for nominating \nFederal judges that works. The President and I work together to name \nhighly qualified consensus candidates to the Federal bench. There is \noften rancor when it comes to judges from other parts of the country, \nbut there has been very little when it comes to New York. It shows that \nwhen both sides wish to compromise, we can probably get there. That is \nbecause in New York we have an effective and bipartisan way to select \nqualified and, almost without exception, moderate candidates for the \nbench.\n  Ms. Livingston is squarely in that mold. Her career so far has \nspanned private practice, criminal prosecution, and academia, so she \nhas a deep understanding of the law gained from many perspectives, from \nthe courtroom to the classroom. Ms. Livingston is a graduate of \nPrinceton University, received her J.D. from Harvard Law School--also \nmy alma mater--where she served as an editor of the Harvard Law Review.\n  From 1986 to 1991, Ms. Livingston was an assistant U.S. attorney in \nthe Southern District, where she prosecuted public corruption cases and \nserved as deputy chief of appeals. Before and after her time as a \nprosecutor, Ms. Livingston was an associate at one of the very \nprestigious law firms in New York, Paul, Weiss, Rifkin, Wharton, and \nGarrison. She is currently the vice dean and Paul J. Kellner professor \nof law at Columbia University, where she focuses on criminal procedure, \nevidence, and national security.\n  I think it is great that we will have an appellate judge who has both \na scholarly mind and practical courtroom experience. It is a perfect \ncombination, in my view, for an appeals court judge. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in voting for her confirmation.\n  In keeping with the prelude to the grand bargain, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Sealing the grand bargain, I, too, yield back the \nremainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time having been yielded, the \nquestion is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of \nDebra Ann Livingston, of New York, to be U.S. circuit judge for the \nSecond Circuit? On this question the yeas and nays were previously \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. \nJohnson), the Senator from Michigan (Mr. Levin), and the Senator from \nWest Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMichigan (Mr. Levin) would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. LOTT.

The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee for \nhis cooperation. Obviously, he wants to get to conference. He wants to \ncomplete the conference on the budget. Although we disagree with the \nbudget that was passed here--and I am sure we will disagree with the \nfinal product that is produced, regrettably--I think it is important \nthe process go forward. It is not our intention to be dilatory, to try \nto slow this process down. That certainly is something we could do, but \nwe certainly have no intention of doing that. Rather, we just want to \nbe able to have a fair opportunity to make the points which we think \nare important relative to the budget.\n  So I appreciate the chance to work with the Senator and the \nchairman's willingness to work with us to reach an accommodation that \nseems to be constructive, which is constructive, and which will \nhopefully move the process along.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I appreciate \nthe comments.\n\n\n                      motion to instruct conferees\n\n  Mr. President, I send a motion to instruct conferees to the desk and \nask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] moves that the conferees \n     on the part of the Senate on the disagreeing votes of the two \n     Houses on the concurrent resolution S. Con. Res. 21 (the \n     concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2008) be \n     instructed to insist that the final conference report include \n     the Senate position to provide for a reduction in revenues, \n     sufficient to accommodate legislation to provide for \n     permanent death tax relief, with a top marginal rate of no \n     higher than 35%, a lower rate for smaller estates, and with a \n     meaningful exemption that shields smaller estates from having \n     to file estate tax returns, and to permanently extend other \n     family tax relief, so that American families, including \n     farmers and small business owners, can continue to enjoy \n     higher after-tax levels of income, increasing standards of \n     living, and a growing economy, as contained in the \n     recommended levels and amounts of Title I of S. Con. Res. 21, \n     as passed by the Senate.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me take a few moments to discuss what \nthis motion to instruct conferees embodies.\n  The subject is the death tax, the tax which requires millions of \nAmerican families and small businesses to spend millions of dollars \npreparing against the possibility that they will have to pay very large \namounts of money to the Federal Government upon the death of the person \nin the family who is responsible for that small business or who owns \nthe property.\n  For a long time, there has been a bipartisan understanding that this \ndeath tax is not a good thing. The Gallup poll and other polls \nconsistently show that at least 60 percent of the American people think \nit is an unfair tax, that we should not be taking money from people at \nthe time of death. They have already paid income taxes on it, \nfrequently capital gains and dividends taxes, and yet again they are \ntaxed at the time of death on an amount of asset that remains.\n  But just as pernicious as that tax is the planning, and the expensive \nplanning, that has to go into trying to prepare for the possibility \nthat the tax will be imposed--if you have a very large estate, frankly, \ntrying to avoid having to pay a large amount of taxes into that estate \nbecause that frequently means you have to sell the small business, the \nfarm, in order to liquidate assets to pay the tax.\n  This is not a theoretical proposition. A good friend of mine from \nPhoenix, AZ, who was one of the great contributors to eleemosynary \nconcerns in Phoenix--especially the Girls and Boys Clubs; he has one \nnamed after him--moved from New York City to Phoenix and with another \nperson started a printing company. Years later, they had over 200 \nemployees. They were a great printing company in Phoenix. When Jerry \ndied, his family could not afford the death tax liability because most \nof the money in the business was in the equipment. In that business, \nyou have to constantly get new equipment to stay up with your \ncompetitors. They took out a small amount each year in salaries, but \nthe rest of it was tied up in the business. So he did not have the \nliquidity to pay the substantial death tax that would be required. The \nbusiness was sold.\n  Interestingly enough, as to the argument that we have a death tax to \nprevent the concentration of wealth, it was sold to a big corporation. \nBy the way, corporations do not pay death taxes. Also, this corporation \nhas not contributed, as far as I know, a nickel to any of the great \ncharity causes in Phoenix that Jerry contributed to every single year. \nIt was really a shame when he died. More than the head of that \nhousehold passed away at that time.\n  What we are trying to do is to permanently reform the death tax. Now, \nin the past we have tried to repeal it. What this motion to instruct \nconferees does is embodies concepts that have been agreed to by both \nDemocrats and Republicans to reform the death tax so that most people \ndo not have to worry about it, they just do not have to go to the \nlawyers and the accountants, the estate planners, they do not have to \npay money for insurance to get around it because they know the way we \nhave constructed it, they are not going to have to pay it. It is still \nthere for the very large estates, but most people would be exempted \nfrom it.\n  Specifically, the motion to instruct conferees would call on Senate \nconferees to insist that the final budget\n\n[[Page S5839]]\n\nresolution provide for a reduction in revenues relative to the baseline \nsufficient to allow Congress to approve meaningful death tax relief, \ndefined as follows: A top marginal rate of no higher than 35 percent \nwith a lower rate for smaller estates, and an exemption level that is \nsufficient to shield smaller estates from having to file a death tax \nreturn. While the motion does not specify that amount, an exemption of \n$5 million per estate indexed for inflation is what is contemplated.\n\n  As I said, I think repeal of the death tax is the best option. I have \nbeen trying to find some agreement on reform since we haven't been able \nto get the votes for repeal. It is a nightmare for families now, and \nthat is why I want to see if we can find a bipartisan way to do that \nthis year. America's small business owners, farmers, and ranchers \ndeserve this kind of certainty now.\n  I might say, this might be a bonanza for insurance companies, but I \nthink they have plenty of other ways to offer products to us. There is \nplenty to insure against. They can still make a very comfortable living \nwithout putting us through the burden to invest without insurance to \navoid paying much of the death tax. This concept, by the way, would be \nsufficient to accommodate the death tax reform similar to the proposal \nintroduced by the senior Senator from Louisiana last year and which was \nendorsed by the junior Senator from Arkansas on his Web site.\n  I might say I have worked with other Members of the majority party \nnow, and I thought last year we were very close to having an agreement \nthat might have been achieved in a bipartisan way. In particular, the \nLandrieu bill provides for a $5 million exemption indexed for \ninflation, which is great, a family business carve-out, a top rate of \n35 percent, as I mentioned, and it recaptures the benefit of the $5 \nmillion exemption for estates valued at over $100 million.\n  The motion to instruct does not specify any revenue offsets. We don't \nbelieve extensions of existing law should require that. Indeed, this \nwould be a retreat from existing tax law. It would be less generous to \ntaxpayers, and none of our provisions last year contemplated an offset. \nWe don't offset extensions of existing mandatory spending, and we don't \nthink this extension of tax relief should be offset either.\n  Some have said we should freeze the 2009 law in place. That provides \nfor a $3.5 million exemption and a gift tax exemption that would be \nseparate, a 45-percent rate, but a 45-percent rate means the Government \ntakes almost half your property above the exempted amount, and that is \nfrankly not acceptable to most small businesses or farmers. Forty-five \npercent is a rate most Americans deem to be unfair. So what we would \nsuggest is a proposal that would be able to accommodate no higher than \nthe 35-percent rate.\n  Now, a couple of final points here. We all know budget resolutions \ndon't dictate policy of the Finance Committee. It would be my intention \nto work with the Senators whom I have mentioned here, in addition to \nSenator Lincoln, who worked very hard on this the last couple of years, \nand others, to craft an estate tax reform proposal that would provide \nfor this $5 million exempted amount indexed for inflation, a lower rate \nfor the smallest estates, and it provides for a top marginal death tax \nthat is no higher than 35 percent. I would love to see it lower than \nthat. The Joint Tax Committee tells us anecdotally that a rate any \nhigher than 35 percent would drive families into aggressive tax \nplanning to avoid the tax. That is what we are trying to avoid here, \nthe extra expense of planning. I might add that the last study done \nthat I know of determined that the amount spent on trying to avoid the \npayment of the death tax each year is almost exactly the same amount \nthat is collected by the U.S. Government. So in effect, we have a \ndouble tax here. People are paying maybe $30 billion, roughly, in these \ntaxes to the Government, and spending another $30 billion to try to \navoid paying the tax. That is $30 billion that could be going to much \nmore productive activities than paying lawyers, accountants, and \ninsurance folks.\n  I conclude by saying it is important to provide the lowest rate for \nthe smallest estates, because we don't want to have to have them go to \nthe trouble of trying to protect their assets against the payment of \nthe tax. We could accommodate that through a high exempted amount and a \nvery low rate. That means they simply wouldn't have the incentive to go \npay the money to the accountants and the lawyers.\n  There is much more I could say about this. Right now I know the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee might have something to say.\n  I am happy to reserve the balance of the time on this side, subject \nto the ranking member's concurrence with that.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I again thank the Senator from Arizona for \nhis motion to instruct which he has offered. I ask our colleagues to \nresist this motion to instruct. I ask our colleagues to resist it on \ntwo grounds. No. 1, we have already provided for estate tax reform in \nthe budget resolution that passed the Senate. I will do everything I \ncan, as chairman of the Senate delegation and chairman of the \nconference, to uphold the Senate position, which is to reform the \nestate tax.\n  The motion of the Senator from Arizona is not paid for. It will blow \na hole in the budget. We are trying very hard to balance this budget by \n2012. Our budget and what will come back from conference does balance \nby 2012. But if we adopt the Senator's amendment, we will not balance.\n  Let me say what the budget resolution that passed the Senate did. All \nof us know, first, there is no death tax. It is good language, but it \nis not accurate. There is no death tax. Nobody pays a specific tax on \ndeath in America. We do have an estate tax on larger estates. In fact, \nin 2009, only two-tenths of 1 percent of estates will pay any tax. That \nmeans 99.8 percent of estates will pay zero. So this talk about a death \ntax--I am reminded of a colleague of ours who was in Missouri and was \nstopped by a baggage handler and he told him: You have to stop this \ndeath tax. He said: My family is so worried about that death tax. That \ngentlemen wasn't going to pay any death tax. Mr. President, 99.8 \npercent of Americans are going to pay no death tax, because there is no \ndeath tax. There is an estate tax on larger estates. Right now, it \napplies to estates of over $4 million a couple. Under $4 million, you \npay nothing. It is going up. In 2009, the it will be $7 million a \ncouple who will be exempt. So in 2007, the year we are in now, there \nis a $4 million exemption per family. You pay nothing if you have an \nestate of less than $4 million. In 2008, it is $4 million. In 2009, it \ngoes to $7 million. In 2010, there is no estate tax. Then in 2011, it \ngoes back to $2 million a couple. That makes no sense. It goes \nbackward. It goes from a $7 million exemption in 2009 to no estate tax \nin 2010. In 2011, it goes back to $2 million per couple. We don't \npermit that in this budget resolution. We stay at the $7 million \nexemption per couple, index it for inflation, so as values go up, the \nestate tax exemption will go up. We have covered this out of the \nresources of the budget so we are able to balance the budget by 2012.\n\n  Now, the Senator from Arizona is absolutely well-intended. He has \nbeen very persistent on this. I give him high marks for that. He is \nabsolutely dedicated to this cause. I give him high marks for that. The \nproblem is he doesn't pay for it. Unfortunately, what he would do is \nthrow the budget out of balance in 2012. I think that is a mistake.\n  In the budget resolution we have passed, beyond providing for a $7 \nmillion exemption indexed for inflation, $7 million for couples, \nanybody who has an estate of $7 million or less will pay zero, will pay \nno estate tax, which means, again, 99.8 percent of estates in our \ncountry will pay zero, nothing, not a penny. We have paid for it. In \naddition, we have provided a reserve fund that says if you want to go \nfurther, you can if you pay for it. The difference, the big difference \nwe have is the Senator from Arizona doesn't want to pay for it. He \nwants to put it on the charge card. He wants to stack it on the debt. \nHe wants to shove it off on our kids, let them pay. No. That shouldn't \nbe the way we go. We have stacked up enough debt during this \nadministration. This administration has added $3 trillion to the \nnational debt, and if they have their way over the next 5 years, they \nare going to stack another $3 trillion on the debt.\n\n[[Page S5840]]\n\n  Where are they getting the money from? They are taking it from Social \nSecurity. That is what they are doing. They have already taken over $1 \ntrillion of Social Security money and used it to pay other bills, and \nthey are getting ready to take another $1 trillion of Social Security \nmoney and use it to pay other bills. If you were in any other \norganization and you tried to take the retirement funds of your \nemployees and use it to pay operating expenses, you would be on your \nway to a Federal institution, but it would not be the Congress of the \nUnited States, it would not be the White House--you would be headed to \nthe big house, because that is the violation of Federal law. What the \nSenator from Arizona is doing by refusing to pay is he is going to take \nthe money from Social Security. He is going to take Social Security \nmoney and use it to pay other bills. I think that is a mistake.\n  We have provided for fundamental estate tax reform in the budget. We \nought to continue to support that, but we paid for it. Let's not go \nback to the bad old days of doing things around here and not paying for \nthem.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me make three quick comments and then I \nwould like the ranking member to respond as well.\n  It is true the budget already provides for some form of death tax \nrelief. The problem is that form is a 45-percent rate--45 percent. \nAlmost half of your estate would be paid to the Federal Government. I \nwant a show of hands for everybody who believes that is fair.\n  Let the Record show one person in the Chamber raised his hand.\n  Second, the idea of the chart which the chairman pointed out showing \nthe irrational treatment of the death tax, I totally agree with that. \nIt is irrational, and there is a reason why it is irrational: because \nDemocrats would not agree to cause the death tax relief to be \npermanent. All they would do is agree to the budget window, which at \nthe time was a 10-year budget window. After that, it is done. That is \nwhy you have this crazy system where we have a declining rate. In the \nyear 2010 it goes away, and in the year 2011 it comes right back again. \nWe are all for making it rational by making it permanent. All in favor \nof that, raise your hands. The problem is, we can't get 60 Senators to \nvote for that, which is why we are stuck with this irrational system.\n  Finally, the most irrational thing of all, the idea--and this is an \nodd concept if you stop to think about it. The Government takes \ncitizens' money in taxes, and then if we decide to let people keep more \nof their hard-earned money, they have to pay for that. We decide you \nshould be able to keep more of your money because you know how to spend \nit better than Washington, but this odd concept on the other side of \nthe aisle is: We can't let people keep more of their own money unless \nthey ``pay for it.'' Pay who for it? Pay Washington for it. In effect, \nwe are going to raise your taxes in some other way to make up for the \nrelief in taxes we are providing here. That is what the American people \nare stuck with under the Democratic budget's idea of a good time, of \nwhat is fair. That is not good policy, and it is not fair. When we \ndecide it is good policy to let the American people keep more of their \nhard-earned money, they shouldn't have to ``pay Washington an \nequivalent amount in some other kind of taxes.''\n  We wish to instruct conferees to pass a budget that can accommodate \nreal relief from the death tax. I think the way we have laid this out \nis the best way to provide that kind of relief, as evidenced by the \nfact that several of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \njoined with us in proposing precisely that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me correct one matter of history here. \nThe Senator from Arizona says this bizarre circumstance with the estate \ntax ending in 2010 and then coming back in 2011 with lower exemption \namounts is the fault of the Democrats. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. That is \na whopper. That is a double whopper. As the Senator knows, we weren't \nin charge when that tax policy was put in place. Our friends on the \nother side were in charge. They controlled the Senate, they controlled \nthe House, they controlled the White House. They wrote this tax policy. \nWhy? They did it because they wanted to put more tax cuts into the bill \nthan they could afford, so they played an old Washington game and an \nold Washington trick.\n  They sunsetted their tax provision at the end of the period to reduce \nits cost. They are the ones who constructed this monstrosity. It is \ntheir responsibility, and we are fixing it. We are fixing it in this \nbudget resolution and we are paying for it. That is a fundamental \nAmerican value.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have one last comment regarding the \n``whopper,'' as the Senator put it. It is absolutely true that \nRepublicans were in charge when we passed the lower tax rates for \nAmericans to help Americans out. We had 55 votes at the top amount; to \nmake tax policy permanent, we needed 60. We could not get enough of our \nDemocratic friends--not even six or seven of them--to join us to make \nthe tax policy permanent; we could not get 60 votes so we could \neliminate that irrational system.\n  So it wasn't a ``whopper'' that I told; it was the truth. Republicans \nwere in charge. If we had about seven more votes, we could have had a \nrational tax system rather than the one we have today.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, look, let's be absolutely direct with \nthose who are watching and with our colleagues. Democrats did not \nconstruct this estate tax charade that takes us up to a $7 million \nexemption in 2009 and then goes to no estate tax in 2010 and comes back \nin 2011 with a $2 million exemption. That was a construction totally \nand completely of our friends on the other side of the aisle.\n  The Senator says we did not support the tax cuts that were \ndisproportionately extended to the wealthiest among us and that plunged \nus into debt. He is absolutely right, we did not. Unfortunately, it has \nproven to be extraordinarily expensive to this country. We will pay for \nthis for a very long time because the debt of the country exploded as a \nresult of that policy.\n  Look, we supported tax reductions; we supported a more modest package \nof tax reductions--about half as much as they passed--and reserved the \nrest of the money to strengthening Social Security, getting us back \ninto a situation where we weren't raiding the Social Security piggy \nbank around here to pay other bills. I am proud of that. We did the \nright thing.\n  I am happy to yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, is this a morning business speech?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Does the Senator wish to talk on the estate tax matter?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Both.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am going to be here for a while, so we can let the \nSenator from Florida go ahead.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for his courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, we have a saying in the South: \nbeing between the devil and the deep blue sea. That somewhat \nillustrates the position this Senator is in regarding the estate tax, \nfor this Senator has been a sponsor of the elimination of the estate \ntax for the last 7 years. The problem--as I have conferred with \ncolleagues here, including the Senator from North Dakota, as well as \ncolleagues on the other side--is finding the 60 votes out of 100 \nSenators in order to be able to pass some form of estate tax relief.\n  The fact is we have Senators who are all over the lot. There are some \nSenators who don't want to have any estate tax relief, and there are \nothers on the opposite side of the spectrum who think there should be a \ntotal abolition of the estate tax and nothing short of that is any \ngood.\n  Well, the truth is, if we had been able to eliminate the estate tax \nback in 2001, when the Federal Government had a healthy surplus, we \nwould not be facing what we are today, which is trying to eliminate the \nestate tax, or part of it, when we have a drastic shortage of revenue, \nthe consequences of which keep running up the red ink of the Federal \nGovernment and continued deficit\n\n[[Page S5841]]\n\nfinancing. Of course, you know who is buying our debt: the banks in \nChina and Japan.\n  So earlier this year, when we crafted a compromise, with Senator \nBaucus in the lead, having a $3.5 million exemption and lowering the \nestate tax on that above $3.5 million per person, or a $7 million \nexemption for a couple, lowering that tax rate from 55 to 45, that \nseemed to be the compromise by which we could get the 60 votes.\n  I ask the chairman of the committee to confirm that what this Senator \nis saying is correct--having been able to get that 60 votes, then if we \ngo off onto something else, what is going to happen is that those of us \nwho want some relief for the family farms and the family businesses are \nnot going to be able to make that stick. You cannot have it all. This \nSenator's attitude is to get something if you cannot have it all. I ask \nthe chairman, the Senator from North Dakota, if the reasoning this \nSenator has laid out in the compromise that was crafted, to give some \nestate tax relief, if that is correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is entirely correct. As a valuable and valued \nmember of the Senate Budget Committee, he knows, with great precision, \nhow difficult it was to put this package together. He also knows if we \ngo the route of Senator Kyl, we will jeopardize the middle-class tax \nrelief that is in this resolution. We provided full relief for the \nmarriage penalty. We provided full relief for the 10-percent bracket. \nWe provided full relief for the child tax credit.\n  If Senator Kyl's amendment is adopted, one of two things will happen: \nIt will reduce the funds available for the middle-class tax relief to \ntransfer the money to the wealthiest among us or it will stick it on \nthe debt. There are only two possibilities. I think it would be \nunfortunate to do either. I think it would be a mistake to reduce the \nmiddle-class tax relief in our budget resolution. I think it would be a \nmistake to reduce the child tax credit. I think it would be a mistake \nto reduce the cut in income taxes that are provided for by the 10-\npercent bracket. I think it would be a mistake to reduce the marriage \npenalty relief that is here in order to stack more benefits on the \nestate tax or to put it on the charge card and add it to the debt.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I will conclude with this \nthought: Naturally, the vote that this Senator will cast on Senator \nKyl's motion to instruct conferees is a very uncomfortable one because, \nfor this Senator, if I had my druthers, would I want the estate tax \nlowered? The answer to that is yes. I have been a sponsor of \neliminating the estate tax. But the question is: What is the doable \ndeal? What is the deal that will avoid this ridiculous outcome that is \ngoing to occur in 2010, when the estate tax will go away completely in \none year and the next year come roaring back--back to its original \nposition in the law back in 2000? That is the compromise we have \ncrafted that is in the budget resolution.\n  I want anybody who is within earshot to understand the position of \nthis Senator in supporting the budget resolution.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nremarks of Mr. Nelson of Florida be moved so as to not interrupt the \nflow of debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Nelson of Florida are printed in today's Record \nunder ``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                              Immigration\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, based on comments we have heard from \nsome of our colleagues on the other side over the last 2 days, there is \nsome genuine concern that the bipartisan immigration compromise that \nMembers and staff have been working on so diligently over the last 2 \nmonths might be brushed aside in favor of last year's unsuccessful \nbill. I strongly urge all of our colleagues to reconsider this \napproach, if, indeed, it is the one they plan to take.\n  This exercise needs to be a bipartisan one or it will not--it will \nnot--succeed. That is an indisputable fact. Any effort to move \nlegislation on this issue that isn't the result of an ongoing \nbipartisan discussion would be a clear signal from the Democrats they \nare not yet serious about immigration reform.\n  So I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stay at the \ntable. Let this bipartisan working group finish its work so we can \nachieve immigration reform this year. Scrapping their work now will \nonly end in frustration and defeat for both sides.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Republican leader for reminding \nus how we should be approaching the immigration issue, which is in a \nrational way.\n  I wish to respond to a few comments that have been said, and then I \nwant to offer the motion to instruct, which I have reserved in the \norder that has been entered into, and then yield to the Senator from \nSouth Dakota for his comments, and then, obviously, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, I presume, will want to respond, if that is acceptable to \nthe Senator from North Dakota as the procedure.\n  To begin with, there has been a lot of references to what is going on \nin the area of tax policy and what the implications are, both relative \nto the death tax--and I did find it ironic that the Senator from North \nDakota said it wasn't a death tax. Well, the only way you can pay it is \nif you are dead, or the only way your relatives can pay it. That is the \nonly way this kicks in is to be hit by a truck. I think ``death tax'' \nis a fairly reasonable explanation of what it is.\n  Regarding the issue of the tax cuts which are obviously at the \nessence of much of the debate relative to this budget, this chart \nreflects the underlying question of what these tax cuts have \naccomplished. The Senator from North Dakota correctly reflects the fact \nthat revenues fell off as the tax cuts originally were put in place. \nThat is correct. Why did they fall off? They fell off because we were \ncoming out of the largest bubble in the history of organized cultures, \nan economic bubble, where the Internet bubble of the nineties exploded \non us, caused a significant contraction in the economy, which obviously \ncaused a contraction in revenues. That was coupled with the attacks of \n9/11, which disrupted the economy to a degree that our economy has \nnever been disrupted, except for the Great Depression and probably \nWorld War II. So those two events created a huge retardation of \nrevenue.\n  It was actually quite fortunate in the middle of that disruption, and \na little bit prior to that, we had put in tax cuts during President \nBush's first term which would stimulate the economy. As a result of \nthose tax cuts going into place--yes, initially there was a revenue \nreduction, but that revenue reduction was in large part due to the \nbubble burst and the 9/11 contraction in the economy.\n  Since that time, we have seen those tax cuts energize an economic \nrecovery which has truly been historic and extraordinary, and it has \ndone a great deal for our country from the standpoint of creating jobs, \nwhich is the bottom line most important thing we can do but also \ngenerating revenue to the Federal Government.\n  We have now had 3 years of the largest growth in revenue in the \nhistory of our country, the largest growth, year after year. We are \nseeing revenues explode literally at the Federal level. They went up 11 \npercent in 2005 and 18 percent in 2006. They are projected to grow 18 \npercent in 2007. These growth rates are truly extraordinary. And \nrevenues not only have grown year to year in an extraordinary way, but \nthey have grown in a relationship to the overall historic burden of \nrevenues paid by the American people to the Federal Government.\n  Historically, the American people have paid 18.2 percent of the gross \nnational product to the Federal Government. That is represented by the \nblue line on the chart. We are actually well above that now so that we \nare seeing a rate of income to the Federal Government of about 18.6 \npercent of GDP. That means we are actually generating more revenues to \nthe Federal Government than we have on average generated to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  We have a tax law in place which is doing a number of things. It is \ngenerating huge revenues, and it is generating revenues that exceed \nwhat has\n\n[[Page S5842]]\n\nbeen the historical norm for this Nation, and it is a tax law which is \ncreating jobs and causing the economy to expand.\n  We have now had 22 straight quarters of economic expansion as a \nresult of tax cuts, and we have had 44 consecutive months of expansion \nin jobs, 7.8 million jobs created. Those are massive expansions, people \ngetting work.\n  In addition, two of the essential elements of this tax cut, the \ncapital gains and dividends rates, have actually generated a huge \nexplosion of economic activity in this country because they have \nunlocked, in the instance of the capital gains area, funds which have \nbeen locked up for years in relatively unproductive assets have now \nbeen sold, the revenue has been turned over, and people have \nreinvested, entrepreneurs and risk takers, in items that have created \nmore return, which has had two effects: It has created more jobs and \nmore revenue to the Federal Government.\n  The tax cuts have been good for this country from the standpoint of \ncreating jobs, from the standpoint of economic growth, and from the \nstandpoint of revenues to the Federal Government. Yes, one can look at \nthis period from 2001 to 2003 and say revenues dropped. Yes, they did, \nbut I would argue that was a function of the bursting of the internet \nbubble and 9/11 more than the tax cuts. But if you look at the most \nrecent period, one cannot argue with the fact that we are seeing an \nexplosion in revenues to the Federal Treasury, which has dramatically, \nin addition to the other two things, caused economic growth, jobs \ncreation, the revenues, and has dramatically reduced the deficit of the \nFederal Government. In fact, we projected the deficit of the Federal \nGovernment. It was projected 3 years ago that it would be somewhere in \nthe $350 billion range. It looks as if it is going to be under $200 \nbillion, and significantly under $200 billion. And on a $3 trillion \nbudget, you are basically talking a deficit number, which is really \ngetting well under what has been the historic deficit of the Federal \nGovernment and, more importantly, had we not had the Katrina \ncatastrophe where we had to spend over $150 billion approximately on \nthat, and were we not at war, a war which we did not ask for when we \nwere attacked on 9/11, we would be in surplus, significantly in \nsurplus.\n  These tax cuts have been good for this economy. They have been good \nfor the country. They have been good for employment. They have been \ngood for economic growth. They certainly have been good for the Federal \nTreasury.\n  On the specific issue of the death tax, which is the motion which is \npending, the motion by Senator Kyl, I think the point Senator Kyl makes \nis the one on which people should focus, which is what his proposal \nsays is, we are going to put in place a compromise proposal on the \ndeath tax which was, ironically, a compromise proposed from the other \nside of the aisle. I think it was the senior Senator from Louisiana, \nMs. Landrieu, who basically came up with this idea, which is we would \nhave a higher rate for bigger estates, 35 percent, and for little \nestates, small businesses, farmers, ranchers, we would have a lower \nrate, and you would have an exemption of I believe about $5 million.\n\n  This proposal makes a lot of sense. There is no reason why it should \nbe a taxable event to die. A taxable event should involve economic \nactivity. It should be you went out, made some money, and as a result \nyou got taxed.\n  But the way the death tax works is, the taxable event is that you, \nunfortunately, die. You end up getting hit by a truck, fall off your \nmotorcycle, you get some serious disease, and as a result, your family \ngets hit with a tax bill. In many instances, if you are a small \nbusinessperson or you are running a farm or some other thing that \ninvolves one person and is the essence of the whole operation, that \ndeath is a huge, traumatic economic event, to say nothing, obviously, \nof the personal trauma that is involved. But that is a huge, traumatic \nevent, if somebody runs a restaurant and he is the cook, the bottle \nwasher, and maitre d', or runs a gas station, runs a small business or \na farm; that person is usually the key person. When they die, that \nbusiness is in extreme distress usually. That distress should not be \nmultiplied and dramatically increased by having the tax man come in and \nsay: I'm sorry, we are going to take half the value of your business, \nwhich is the way the law works now.\n  So this proposal, which was a compromise worked out among a variety \nof people around here, and actually the essence of it was put forth by \nthe Senator from Louisiana, makes a lot of sense. So what Senator Kyl \nhas said is let's do it. Let's put it in the budget.\n  The argument is, that is going to increase the deficit. That is a \nfairly specious argument because it is the essence of that argument: If \nyou let people keep their own money, you are making a mistake. The \nFederal Government should take the money and then they should have to \npay money to get their money back. They should have to pay more in \ntaxes. It makes no sense at all.\n  In addition, let's remember this proposal of the Democratic budget, \nas it left the Senate, had over a $700 billion tax increase in it. As \nit left the House, it has over a $900 billion tax increase in it. That \nis on the American people. What Senator Kyl is suggesting is you take a \nvery small percentage of that huge tax increase that is in this budget \nand use it to basically put in place proper procedures and policies \nrelative to the death tax.\n\n\n                      Motion to Instruct Conferees\n\n  And that brings me to my motion to instruct. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the pending motion be set aside and that my motion be ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object, one thing we have to do is \nmake sure we have the time figured out because we have an hour on the \nKyl matter. I will want some time to respond to the Senator's comments, \nand Senator Thune wants to apparently talk about the Senator's motion. \nSo we would be reserving our time on the Kyl motion while we go next to \nthe Senator's motion?\n  Mr. GREGG. That is fine to me, or yield it back and use the time \naltogether.\n  Mr. CONRAD. It will all wash out. Let's do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. Gregg) moves that the \n     conferees on the part of the Senate on the disagreeing \n     votes of the two Houses on the concurrent resolution S. \n     Con. Res. 21 (the concurrent resolution on the budget for \n     fiscal year 2008) be instructed to reject the House \n     amendment that assumes a $916 billion tax increase, the \n     largest tax increase in U.S. history, and insist that the \n     final conference report include in the recommend levels \n     and amounts in Title I of S. Con. Res. 21, reductions in \n     revenues commensurate with extending the existing tax \n     policy:\n       $1,000 child tax credit;\n       marriage penalty relief;\n       10% income tax bracket--so those earning $15,000 or less \n     continue to benefit from low tax rate;\n       lower marginal rates for American families and small \n     businesses (15%, 25%, 28%, 33%, and 35%);\n       Earned Income Tax Credit relief for military families;\n       adoption tax credit;\n       dependent care tax credit;\n       college tuition deduction;\n       deduction for student loan interest;\n       $2,000 Coverdell Ed. IRA;\n       15% rate on capital gains and dividends; and death tax \n     repeal.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I will speak quickly to this because I know \nthe Senator from South Dakota has been courteous and is waiting, and I \nknow he wants to speak to it. So I will highlight a little and then \ncome back to the substance of it.\n  The essence of this motion is that the $916 billion tax increase, the \nlargest tax increase in history, which is in the House budget, be \nrejected; that the $700-plus billion tax increase in the Senate \nbudget--again, that would be the largest tax increase in history were \nthe House not outbidding us--be rejected; and that instead we extend a \nseries of tax breaks which are already in place and which are very \nbeneficial to the American people, including the $1,000 child credit, \nthe marriage penalty relief, the 10-percent income tax bracket, the \nlower marginal rates for American families and small businesses, the \nearned-income tax credit for military families, the adoption tax \ncredit, the dependent care tax credit, the college tuition deduction, \nthe deduction for student loan interest, a $2,000 Coverdell education \nIRA, the 15-percent rate on capital gains and dividends, and \nessentially the Kyl death\n\n[[Page S5843]]\n\ntax proposal. That is what this instruction would do.\n  I would ask that, instead of increasing taxes by the largest amount \nin history on the American people, we continue tax policies which have \nproduced this huge economic expansion.\n  I yield to the Senator from South Dakota for his comments.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from New \nHampshire for yielding and also to just elaborate on some of the things \nhe talked about with regard to his motion. I congratulate him on \noffering this motion to instruct because I believe it gets at the heart \nof this issue, which is whether we are going to continue this economic \nexpansion, the job growth that has come with it, the explosion in \nGovernment revenues associated with the tax relief that was enacted in \n2001 and 2003 or whether we are going to go down the opposite path and \nincrease taxes by, as he said, the largest amount in American history.\n  Now, up until this last year, this budget we are talking about today, \nthe largest tax increase in American history happened in 1993. That was \n$293 billion in increased taxes that was put through the Congress in \nthat year. What has been proposed this year, through the budget process \nin the other body, in the House of Representatives, was a $916 billion \ntax increase, and, as the Senator from New Hampshire has noted, here in \nthe Senate it is a $700 billion tax increase.\n  The only question really before us is whether this conference \ncommittee which is going to meet is going to adopt the House version, \nwhich is triple the largest tax increase in American history, or adopt \nthe Senate version, which is double the largest tax increase in \nAmerican history. Either way, whether we adopt the Senate-passed budget \nor the House-passed budget, we will be adopting the largest tax \nincrease in American history--if we adopt the House version, three \ntimes the largest tax increase in history and, if we adopt the Senate \nversion, more than two times the largest tax increase in American \nhistory.\n  So the gentleman from New Hampshire, the Senator who has proposed a \nmotion that would instruct the conferees who will be meeting, the \nSenate conferees who will be meeting with the House conferees to work \nout and reconcile the differences between these two budget \nresolutions--one, as I said, is the House, which is triple the largest \ntax increase, or the Senate version, which is double--his motion would \nessentially instruct the Senate conferees to go into that conference \nwith a position that doesn't accept the House tax increase or the \nSenate tax increase; rather, it allows these existing tax cuts to stay \nin law--in other words, not to allow them to expire.\n  I have a chart here which illustrates a little bit about what I am \nspeaking of today, and this chart essentially shows what is included in \nthat $900 billion tax increase. As I said earlier, the Senate, in its \nbudget resolution, adopted a position that restored about $180 billion \nof the tax relief that would expire under the House-adopted budget \nresolution. As we can see, this is the amount taxes will go up if this \nbudget is adopted. This is the amount the Senate said we will put back \nwith the Senate budget resolution here, which our colleagues on the \nother side were able to get through the Senate. It puts back $180 \nbillion.\n  I will give the House credit because the House voted yesterday on a \nmotion to instruct their conferees to adopt the Senate language. That \nmakes sense because I think they heard what a lot of people said when \nthey went home and met with their constituents; that is, we don't want \nto see the largest tax increase in American history. We don't want \nanother $900 billion in taxes imposed on the American economy at a time \nwhen the economy is growing and expanding and creating jobs.\n  Just look at the last few years here: 7\\1/2\\ million new jobs, \nunemployment at 4.5, 4.6 percent, the lowest historical average in the \nlast three decades, 21 consecutive quarters of economic growth.\n  This is the counterintuitive part about this because, as was pointed \nout back in 2001 and 2003 when these tax cuts were being debated, if we \nreduce taxes the revenues are going to go down. Well, in fact, the \nopposite has happened. What has happened is what has happened \nthroughout the course of history--under the Harding administration in \nthe 1920s, the Kennedy administration in the 1960s, the Reagan \nadministration in the 1980s, and now currently; that is, when you \nreduce marginal income tax rates, capital gains income rates, what \nhappens? People take their realizations, they pay their taxes, they \nreinvest, and you get not less Government revenue but more Government \nrevenue--in this case, dramatically more Government revenue.\n  Between 2004 and this year, we have seen Government revenues increase \nby $300 billion; that is, revenue coming into the Federal Treasury \nbetween 2004 and 2005 was up almost 15 percent, 14.7 percent; between \n2005 and 2006, around 13 percent; and in this current fiscal year, the \nfirst 7 months of this current fiscal year, Government revenues are up \n11.3 percent over last year. In fact, in the month of April, we have \n$70 billion more Government revenue than April a year ago.\n  These tax cuts are working not only to stimulate the economy and to \ncreate jobs but, as I said before, miraculously, to generate more \nGovernment revenue. We have $300 billion more Government revenue coming \nin as a result of reducing taxes, which again proves the historical \nfact that when you reduce marginal income tax rates and capital gains \ntax rates on the American people, they take their realizations, they \npay taxes, they invest, they create more jobs, the economy continues to \nexpand, and you get not less Government revenue but more Government \nrevenue.\n\n  So I think what is happening here in the Senate is an attempt to \nprovide a fig leaf of cover when it comes to this issue of taxes. The \nproblem with that is this particular cover is a cover not for the \ntaxpayers in this country, it is perhaps a cover for the tax raisers in \nthis country. It is a small cover, however, because if you take $180 \nbillion of tax relief that is restored under the budget resolution \nadopted here in the Senate, you can cover some of this stuff.\n  What they propose is that we are going to put back some of the \nmarriage penalty that would come back into play under the House-passed \nversion, and we are going to restore some of the 10-percent tax rate--\nthe lowest tax rate, which applies to people making $15,000 and less--\nand we are going to provide some death tax relief. We will lower the \ntop death tax rate from 55 percent to 45 percent. Well, what does that \ndo? What do you do, then, about the alternative minimum tax, which is \ngoing to hit 20 million additional taxpayers if this budget is adopted? \nWhat about the child tax credit, which under the Democratic plan is \nslashed from $1,000 back to $500? What about lower tax rates throughout \nthe rest of the rate schedule? Even if you fix, as they attempt to do \nwith this small amount of tax relief, the 10-percent tax bracket, the \nlowest tax bracket, you still have tax increases in every other tax \nrate on the schedule. In fact, those who are paying 25 percent taxes \nare now going to go up to 28 percent. Those who were paying at the 28-\npercent rate currently will see their tax rate going up to 31 percent. \nThose paying at the 33-percent rate are going to see their tax rates go \nup to 36 percent. Those fortunate few paying at the 35-percent rate, \nthe highest marginal tax rate today, are going to see their tax rates \ngo up to 39.6 percent.\n  My point is, you can provide a fig leaf to say that we are doing \nsomething to allow for some of these tax cuts, this tax relief which \nhas benefited our economy and the American people into the foreseeable \nfuture, but what about the rest of all these tax breaks that are going \nto expire, which means the largest tax increase in American history?\n  If we look at what the motion of the Senator from New Hampshire does, \nit says we want to extend these tax breaks to include the deduction for \nstudent loan interest. There are a lot of working families trying to \nput their kids through college who are taking advantage of that tax \nbreak.\n  How about the earned-income tax credit, which is helping a lot of our \nmilitary families, many of them serving in Iraq and Afghanistan?\n  As I said before, the child tax credit is being slashed from $1,000 \ndown to $500, essentially cutting in half the amount of credit a \nworking family can get for their children when they file their tax \nreturns. That was something\n\n[[Page S5844]]\n\nwhich was put in place to help working families.\n  I can go right down the list. Let's take senior citizens' dividend \nincome--currently taxed at the capital gains rate of 15 percent, but \nunder this proposal it goes up to 39 percent. We have a lot of seniors \nin this country who have invested and now have dividend income, capital \ngains income. Their capital gains income rates are going to go up as \nwell. If they have capital gains income they are going to show, that \nwill go up from 15 percent to 20 percent.\n  My point very simply is that if you pay taxes in America today, the \nprescription in this budget resolution which was adopted here by the \nSenate, put forward by our colleagues on the other side and the one \nadopted by the House, has one prescription: higher taxes. Every working \nAmerican who pays taxes today is going to see their tax bill go up. In \nfact, in my State of South Dakota, which I will use as an example, the \naverage tax increase on a working family in South Dakota would be \n$2,596 under this budget, with 2,840 jobs being lost and $262 million \nlost in our economy. That is in my State of South Dakota, and probably, \nif you take any other State, you would find the numbers to be \ndramatically higher in terms of job loss, in terms of the loss to the \nlocal economy and the impact it is going to have on taxpayers.\n  Again, just in an attempt to summarize what I am saying here, the \nDemocrats have attempted, in the form of a fig leaf, to provide some \namount of tax relief cover in this budget. What they do not tell us is \nthat the amount of tax relief does nothing to cover the increase in \ntaxes that will occur under this budget. They take about $180 billion \noff the table and say to the American people: Keep that. But they are \nstill going to be raising taxes by over $700 billion, even if the \nSenate version of this budget resolution is adopted in conference. If \nthe House version ends up being adopted, it will be over a $900 billion \ntax increase--the largest tax increase in American history by three \ntimes in the House, over two times in the Senate.\n\n  Again, if you take this amount, this fig leaf, and you say: We are \ngoing to put the 10-percent rate back, we are going to do something to \nprovide some marriage penalty relief because we think married couples \nought not to be penalized for being married, which I happen to agree \nwith, and that was part of the tax relief passed in 2001 and 2003, and \nI think they realize that is a popular piece of tax relief, so they are \ngoing to attempt to restore some of these things--that still doesn't do \nanything about capital gains and dividends, which will hit seniors, or \nanything about R tax credits or the per-child tax credit or anything \non the rate structure, the rates which go from 25 percent up to 28, \nfrom 28 to 31, from 33 to 36, and from 35 to 39.6. Every rate on the \nrate schedule is going up under this particular proposal.\n  So I am here today to support the motion of the Senator from New \nHampshire to instruct the conferees as they go into conference between \nthe House and the Senate to leave these tax cuts alone. Don't allow \nthem to expire. Don't permit the largest tax increase in American \nhistory at a time when the economy is growing and expanding and \ncreating jobs and we are seeing not less Government revenue but \ndramatically more Government revenue, to the tune of a $300 billion \nincrease in Government revenues just in the past 3 years alone.\n  These tax cuts are working. They are having their desired effect. \nThey are accomplishing what was intended in the first place when this \nCongress, in its wisdom, enacted these tax cuts in 2001 and 2003. It \nwould be a shame to take a fig leaf and try to say to the American \npeople, to the taxpayers of this country, that we are going to provide \na little bit of cover for the tax raisers here in the Congress, but we \naren't going to do anything to provide cover for the American taxpayer, \nthose people who are going to pay higher rates in all these areas if \nthis budget is passed and if the conference report comes back either \nwith the Senate version or the House version, both of which increase \ntaxes, it is just a question of by how much.\n  So I hope we can adopt and get the votes necessary to pass the motion \nof the Senator from New Hampshire to instruct our conferees to allow \nthese tax cuts to stay in place. Don't allow them to expire, don't \nraise taxes, don't do something that would harm our economy and the \njobs being created by passing the largest tax increase in American \nhistory.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this is the most amusing chart that has \nbeen presented in the Senate this year. The biggest block of the \nSenator's chart is about alternative minimum tax relief. He is talking \nabout the Gregg amendment. Read the Gregg amendment. There is no \nmention of alternative minimum tax relief. That chart--I am glad he is \ntaking it down because it is a complete concoction. It has no relevance \nto anything that is being suggested here.\n  The Senator says the biggest tax increase in history--not true. There \nis no tax increase in the proposal before us. Here are the facts.\n  The President, when he produced his budget, said, through his agency \nof Office of Management and Budget, an agency he completely controls, \nthat his budget would produce $14.826 trillion of revenue over the next \n5 years. That is what the President said his budget would do. What does \nthe budget I have presented do, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice? It produces $14.827 trillion of revenue. That is $1 billion of \ndifference on an almost $15 trillion base. And they are talking about \nthe biggest tax increase ever? Come on.\n  It is a great speech. It is the same speech the Republicans have \ndelivered for 20 years. They are so used to it, they keep giving it. It \ndoesn't matter what the facts are or what the budget is before us. \nThere is no big tax increase that is in this budget. In fact, there is \nno tax increase that is contained in this budget.\n  I don't know what the Republicans are going to say next year when \nthere has been no tax increase, after all these speeches about the \nbiggest tax increase in history. What are they going to say? I can \nhardly wait until next year. I am looking forward to that.\n  There is a little more revenue in our plan. As I say, the President \nsaid his budget would produce $14.826 trillion of revenue. The CBO says \nours will produce $14.827 trillion. That is virtually no difference.\n  On a straight CBO score, apples-to-apples comparison, there is a 2-\npercent difference between our budget and the President's budget. Our \nfriends on the other side come here with no budget--none. They have no \nbudget for the country this year. Amazingly enough, they had no budget \nlast year. They never agreed on a budget. They never agreed on a budget \nthe year before. So they come here complaining about a budget that \nactually will exercise some discipline. It is pretty easy to be here \nwith no budget, but of course they produced no budget when they \ncontrolled everything. They controlled the House of Representatives, \nthey controlled the Senate, they controlled the White House--no budget. \nIt is no wonder the debt is up, up, and away.\n  According to a CBO analysis of the two budgets, the President's \nbudget and our budget, there is a 2-percent difference in revenue.\n  How could you get 2 percent more revenue with no tax increase? That \nis a good question. That is a fair question. I submit it is pretty easy \nto do. First, we have a tax gap in this country that the Internal \nRevenue Service says in 2001 was $345 billion. Today that tax gap, I \nbelieve, is in the range of $400 billion a year. That is the difference \nbetween what is owed and what is paid.\n  To collect taxes that are already owed is not a tax increase. That is \nsimply insisting everybody pay what they legitimately owe. That is the \nfirst place we ought to look. Now $400 billion a year times 5 years of \nthis budget is $2 trillion. We would only need 15 percent of that to \nget the revenue that is called for in this budget with no tax increase.\n  But it does not stop there, because the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations says we are losing another $100 billion a year to \noffshore tax havens. I have showed this building before. This building \nis in the Cayman Islands. It is a five-story building. This building is \nthe home to 12,748 companies that say they are doing business\n\n[[Page S5845]]\n\nout of this building. That is the most efficient building in the world. \nAre they really doing business out of this little building? Twelve \nthousand companies? No. They are engaged in an enormous tax dodge out \nof this building. We ought to shut that down. That is $100 billion a \nyear, according to the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.\n  It does not stop there. Here is what the Permanent Subcommittee said:\n\n       Experts have estimated that the total loss to the Treasury \n     from offshore tax evasion alone approaches $100 billion per \n     year, including $40 to $70 billion from individuals and \n     another $30 billion from corporations engaged in offshore tax \n     evasion.\n\n  If our friends on the other side of the aisle want to protect these \nabusive tax havens, let them do it. Let's see what the American people \nsay about that. Let's see what the American people think about having \nwealthy individuals and wealthy corporations avoiding what they \nlegitimately owe in this country by going off to these tax havens and \nclaiming they are doing business out of this five-story building down \nin the Cayman Islands--12,700 companies--come on.\n  It doesn't end there. I say go onto the Internet. If you wonder \nwhether this thing is real on tax havens, enter in ``offshore tax \nplanning,'' Google it, and what do you get? You get 1,260,000 hits. \nWhat do you find out there? Here is my favorite:\n\n       Live worldwide on a luxury yacht, tax free.\n\n  That is what our friends over here are defending.\n\n       Live worldwide on a luxury yacht, tax free . . . Live tax \n     free and worldwide on a luxury yacht . . . Moving offshore \n     living tax free just got easier . . . Live tax free and \n     worldwide on a luxury yacht--exciting stuff.\n\n  Indeed it is. It is costing us $100 billion a year, and it doesn't \nend there. We have these other scams that are going on.\n\n  I guess this is my favorite. This is a sewer system. It is a sewer \nsystem in Europe. What does that have to do with the budget? It turns \nout it has a lot to do with the budget. Why? Because we have now \nlearned through an investigation that wealthy investors, corporations \nin the United States, have bought European sewer systems and are \ndepreciating them on the books in the United States to reduce their tax \nobligation here and then leasing them back to the countries that paid \nfor them in the first place.\n  This assertion that there is a big tax increase here is mumbo jumbo. \nThere is no tax increase here.\n  Yes, we do have modestly more revenue, 2 percent more--although in \nthe President's estimates we have virtually no change in revenue. But \nlet's take the CBO numbers we use here in Congress. We have 2 percent \nmore revenue. We say let's go after the tax gap, let's go after these \ntax havens, let's go after these abusive tax shelters.\n  My colleague from New Hampshire talked about the explosion of tax \nrevenue, but he didn't tell the whole story. He didn't go back to when \nthis story started, in 2000, because here is the whole story. The \nrevenue of the United States back in 2000 was just over $2 trillion for \nthe year. Then we had big tax cuts put in place in 2001 and revenue \nwent down. Revenue went down the next year. Revenue went down the next \nyear. Revenue stayed down in 2004--which is the fifth this year. \nRevenue stayed down in 2005.\n  Only in 2006, 6 years later, did we get back to the real revenue base \nwe had all the way back in 2000. Is it any wonder the debt of the \ncountry exploded? Is it any wonder?\n  When they talk about the extraordinary economic performance of this \nadministration, that is not the record I see. Let's compare it to the \nprevious administration. The previous administration, in the first 75 \nmonths, produced 18.7 million new jobs. This administration in the same \nperiod of time: 5.2 million, less than one-third the job creation of \nthe previous administration in the same period.\n  But it doesn't end there. If you compare this economic recovery to \nthe nine recoveries since World War II, here is what you see. On job \ncreation, the dotted red line is the average of all of the recoveries, \nthe major recoveries since World War II. That is the dotted red line, \njob creation.\n  The black line is this recovery. It is lagging 7 million private \nsector jobs compared to the average recovery since World War II. That \nis job creation.\n  On business investment, again the dotted red line is the average of \nthe nine largest recoveries since World War II. The black line is this \nrecovery. In every one of these you see the same pattern: This recovery \nis tepid compared to every one of the other major recoveries since \nWorld War II.\n  Here on business investment we are 69 percent below the average \nrecovery.\n  It doesn't end there. If you look at revenues, revenues lag by $127 \nbillion, the average of the nine major recoveries since World War II.\n  If you look at real median household income--why is it our friends on \nthe other side talk about how good things are, yet the significant \nmajority of the American people say things aren't so good? The big \nreason is people at the top, all of us, we have done very well. The \npeople at the top in this society--and, of course, there are many who \nare far above us who have done really well. But you know the majority \nof people in this country have not done really well. Their position has \nstagnated. For many of our countrymen, their position has dropped. And \nthis shows it.\n  Here is real median household income from 2000--it was $47,599--to \ntoday, it is $46,326. That is why people, when they are asked, say they \ndon't see this economy performing in the splendid fashion described by \nour friends on the other side.\n  It has been splendid for the top 1 percent in this country. The top 1 \npercent has seen an explosion of their income. They have also enjoyed a \ndisproportionate share of the tax cuts granted by our friends on the \nother side. That is what has happened.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I first thank our esteemed budget \nchairman for raising what is so important in the context of this \ndebate. I thank him for raising the chart that actually shows the \nmajority of Americans are not seeing their incomes go up. They are \nseeing them go down.\n  As the chairman knows, we have lost 3 million manufacturing jobs in \nthe last few years under this administration--3 million good-paying \njobs with health care and with pensions. The reality is that, in \nlistening to the debate with my colleagues on the other side, I don't \nknow what they are describing. They certainly are not describing what \nis happening to the majority of Americans.\n  I did also want to thank the chairman for bringing up a building in \nthe Cayman Islands he has shown us a number of times, a picture of a \nfive-story building where there are over 12,000, I believe, different \nbusinesses that have filed that they are part of that building. In the \nFinance Committee, I used the chairman's chart and asked--I don't know \nif the chairman will remember this, but in the Finance Committee I \nactually asked the IRS and the Treasury if they had sent anybody down \nto look at that building. Has anybody walked through that building?\n  We have seen our distinguished leader on Budget point out a specific \naddress, a specific address where we know there are not 12,748 \ndifferent companies in that building. Yet, Mr. Chairman, to your \nknowledge, has anybody taken any legal action on this even now? You \nhave raised this time and again.\n  This is the way we ought to be focusing on what happens on taxes. But \nthe majority of people see their incomes going down, and what do we \nsee? Ships, yachts where people can go offshore to live to avoid paying \ntheir taxes and avoid contributing to the war and the economy and \nschools and roads and everything that is important to us.\n  Then you have a building. I don't know if the chairman would want to \nspeak to this. Has there, to the Senator's knowledge, been any action \ntaken on this building and what is happening with over 12,748 \ncompanies?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Well, the Senator asked the witnesses before the \ncommittee. They seemed totally flummoxed by the question. It was pretty \namazing. Here we have this building in the Cayman Islands, this five-\nstory building. We have got 12,748 companies that claim it as their \nhome.\n  Now, why did they do that? They do it because the Cayman Islands has \nno taxes. So guess what they do. They have subsidiaries in the United \nStates\n\n[[Page S5846]]\n\nthat report no earnings in the United States. Then they sell to a \nsubsidiary in the Cayman islands at a reduced price, and they show \ntheir profits in the Cayman Islands.\n  When I was tax commissioner, I found this kind of tax abuse going on \nrepeatedly. It was quite amazing. This was 20 years ago that companies \nwere engaged in this kind of activity. It has absolutely exploded. That \nis what the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations is telling us, \nthat we are losing $100 billion a year to this kind of scam. Of course, \nthe abusive tax shelters are on top of that. The tax gap, the \ndifference between what is owed and what is paid, is on top of that.\n  But when you ask the relevant officials: Have you audited these \ncompanies to see if they really are doing business out of this \nbuilding? Well, you got sort of--they were sort of in a trance. They \nhad no answer.\n  I would say let's go after these people who are not paying what they \nowe legitimately and fairly in this country.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Well, I just want to thank the chairman again. I am \nvery proud of this budget because it focuses on hard-working, middle-\nclass families, people I represent in Michigan who will get the tax \ncuts in this budget. It addresses the kind of things we are talking \nabout here. I am not interested in a tax policy that rewards this kind \nof tax evasion or folks moving offshore in their yacht to avoid being \npart of America and contributing to our way of life. I just want to \nthank the chairman.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me make one other point, if I can, that is with \nreference to the Gregg amendment. I will provide an alternative that \ninsists on the tax relief that is provided in the budget resolution and \nasks our Senate conferees to fight for the tax relief that is provided. \nThe tax relief that is in the budget resolution that passed the Senate \nprovides for every dime required to extend the middle-class tax cuts, \nthe 10-percent tax bracket, the child credit, the marriage penalty \nrelief. Every dime of those middle-class tax cuts is provided for in \nthe resolution that passed the Senate.\n  In addition, we provided for reform of the estate tax, to have $7 \nmillion a couple exempt from any estate tax. We index it for inflation. \nThat will exempt 99.8 percent of the estates in America from paying any \nestate tax.\n  In addition, we provided for extension of the adoption tax credit, \nthe dependent care tax credit, the treatment of combat pay for purposes \nof the earned-income tax credit. In addition, we insist that the Senate \nconferees support section 303 of the Senate resolution that provides \nfor additional tax relief, including extensions of expiring provisions \nand refundable tax relief provided that such relief would not increase \nthe deficit over the period of the total fiscal years 2007 to 2012.\n  In other words, we provide for all of the middle-class tax relief. We \nprovide for estate tax reform. We provide for the appropriate treatment \nof combat pay. We provide for the dependent care tax credit, the \nadoption tax credit. And we say: You can have other tax relief if you \npay for it. There is an interesting idea. Start paying for things \naround here.\n  The difference between my amendment and the amendment of the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire is he puts another $250 billion on the charge card, \nadds to the debt, sticks it on our kids. We say: No, let's start paying \nfor things. That is the difference. We insist on the Senate position \nthat any additional revenues meet these tax policies that are achieved \nby closing the tax gap, shutting down abusive tax shelters, addressing \noffshore tax havens, and without raising taxes. That is the resolution \nthat passed this body. That is the resolution that is before the \nconference committee. It does not raise taxes by one thin dime.\n\n\n                      Motion to Instruct Conferees\n\n  Mr. President, I call up my motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad] moves that the \n     managers on the part of the Senate at the conference on \n     the disagreeing votes of the two houses on the House \n     amendment to the concurrent resolution S. Con. Res. 21 \n     (setting forth the congressional budget for the United \n     States Government for fiscal year 2008 and including the \n     appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years 2007 and \n     2009 through 2012) be instructed to--\n       (A) insist on the Senate amendment with regard to to \n     relief, which cuts taxes in the resolution by $180 billion to \n     provide for extension of the child tax credit, marriage \n     penalty relief, and ten-percent bracket; reform of the estate \n     tax to protect small businesses and family farms; extension \n     of the adoption tax credit, dependent care tax credit, \n     treatment of combat pay for purposes of EITC; and other tax \n     relief;\n       (B) insist on Section 303 of the Senate resolution that \n     provides for tax relief, including extensions of expiring tax \n     relief and refundable tax relief, provided that such \n     legislation would not increase the deficit over the total of \n     the period of fiscal years 2007-2012; and\n       (C) insist on the Senate position that any additional \n     revenues to meet these tax policies are achieved by closing \n     the tax gap, shutting down abusive tax shelters, addressing \n     offshore tax havens, and without raising taxes.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I have referred to this as the Wizard of Oz \nbudget because there is someone behind the curtain somewhere on the \nother side of the aisle who is going to pay for all of those proposals \nthey have put into the budget. No matter how you do the numbers, it \nworks out that this budget has in it, as proposed by the Democratic \nParty, the largest tax increase in the history of the country.\n  It is interesting that the Senator from North Dakota continues to \nbring forward the chart that says his tax revenues are about the same \nas the administration's, failing to mention--well, he did mention it, \nhe just did not highlight it--that he is using one accounting scheme to \nget to one number, and another one to get to the other.\n  But when you do compare apples to apples and oranges to oranges, you \nrealize that under CBO scoring the difference is very significant \nbetween the two. Under OMB scoring the difference is significant \nbetween the two.\n  The fact is, there is a dramatic increase in taxes in both packages. \nIn the Democratic package, if you score it consistently the difference \nis about $300 billion if you do not take into effect the AMT. So you \nhave got a $300 billion tax increase in this bill.\n  Now, if it were not there, why would they have cut taxes to begin \nwith as their first amendment? Their first amendment was a $180 billion \nrevenue reduction. They were at the House number of $900 billion in new \ntaxes. They cut that by $180 billion, which the Senator from South \nDakota has ably laid out in his chart with his fig leaf, that $180 \nbillion was their first amendment out of the box.\n  They obviously needed that amendment to reduce the tax burden which \nthey had in their budget. Yet they claim they don't have a higher tax \nburden in their budget. Totally inconsistent on its face. Not \ndefensible. If they were at the House number, which they were when they \noriginally proposed the budget, they had a $900 billion tax increase. \nThey are now at the new number, which is a $700 billion tax increase. \nIf you take out the AMT number, they are at a $300 billion tax \nincrease.\n  If it looks like a duck and walks like a duck, talks like a duck, it \nis a duck. This is a tax increase. This budget has a major tax \nincrease. It is incredible to me that they can argue they do not have a \ntax increase and then oppose my motion, which basically says do not \nincrease taxes. If they are not increasing taxes, they did not have to \noppose my motion. They should be supporting it on its face. So the \ninconsistency is palpable. Palpable.\n  Then the idea that they are going to cover this $300 billion of new \ntaxes, plus the AMT, of an extra $500 billion out of one building in \nthe Grand Caymans--oh, yeah, that is where it is. That is where all of \nthe money is. They are going to get $1 trillion dollars of new taxes \nout of this building.\n  Granted, we all accept the fact that there is obviously something \nwrong, when you have 12,000 companies filed there, and they are in a \ntax haven. But to represent that they can generate this type of revenue \nby closing tax loopholes on overseas tax activity is absurd on its \nface; or that they can collect this from unpaid taxes is absurd on its \nface.\n  The Commissioner of the IRS came to us, the Commissioner. He said the \nmost they can collect over what they\n\n[[Page S5847]]\n\nare already collecting over the next 5 years is about $20 to $30 \nbillion of unpaid obligated taxes. They have obviously put in place, \nthey believe, a very robust effort to try to collect unpaid obligated \ntaxes.\n  They think the incremental increase they can get, no matter how much \nmore money it gave them, would be $20 to $30 billion, not $300 billion, \nnot $700 billion. That was the testimony before the committee.\n  The Senator, the former chairman and present ranking member of the \nFinance Committee, came down and spoke at length about the effort to \nclose overseas loopholes and what they have been able to recover. Yes, \nthere may be more dollars there, but there is nothing in the realm of \n$300 billion, $700 billion, which is what this tax bill--what this tax \nbill, which is what you should call this budget; it is a tax bill--\nproposes.\n  No, this is a budget which has in it a huge tax increase. That is \nsimply the way it is. If it did not, people would not be opposing my \nmotion. They would be accepting it, taking it, because it is a \nreasonable motion. My motion continues tax cuts for the child credit, \nfor the marriage penalty, 10 percent bracket, the lower marginal rates \nfor Americans and small business, earned-income tax credit, relief for \nmilitary families, adoption tax credit, dependent care tax credit, \ncollege tuition deduction, deductions for student loans, $2,000 \nCoverdell IRAs, 15 percent capital gains and dividend rate, and the \nKyl-Landrieu death tax reform.\n  It is a very reasoned approach. It is what we should be doing. We \nshould not be raising taxes on the American people. Now, the argument \nis that raising taxes won't have an effect on the economy; that passing \nthis budget, if it were put in full operation, will not have an effect \non the economy. Of course, it will. It will have a dramatic effect on \nthe economy.\n  You cannot put $700 billion of new taxes on this economy and not \nexpect this economy to adjust rather dramatically to a slowdown as a \nresult. You cannot ask people who are entrepreneurs, who are taking \nrisks, who are creating jobs, you cannot say to them: We are going to \nraise your capital gains rate up to 30 percent. We are going to raise \nyour dividends rate, potentially, up to 39 percent. You cannot say that \nto them and not expect there to be a reaction in the marketplace.\n  People are going to stop taking risks. One thing we have learned in \nthis economy is, if you give people a fair tax system, one where they \nare taxed at a rate that is reasonable, they will go out and take \nrisks. That is the great genius of the American economy.\n  But, if you give them a tax rate which is unreasonable, they are \ngoing to take action to avoid that tax rate, which will mean \nineffective use of dollars, inefficient use of capital. It will also \nmean a lot more people thinking of ways like going to the Cayman \nIslands to try to avoid taxes.\n  The practical effect of that is you slow the economy, you contract \nthe economy. This proposal will do that. This proposal increases \nspending over the period of 5 years by, I think it is $147 billion.\n  They have to pay for that, so they raise taxes. It is the old \napproach. I don't know why it is denied by the other side of the aisle. \nWhy don't they simply admit they like to spend money; they like to take \ntax dollars and spend money? That is what they are going to do, take \npeople's taxes and spend on it their priorities. Our philosophy is, let \npeople keep their money and they get to spend it on their priorities. \nThey usually do a better job. It is more efficient. They create more \njobs, and they create more economic activity. I thought the chart of \nthe Senator from South Dakota was one of the better ones we have seen. \nIt was a pretty good example of what the problem is. I call it the \nWizard of Oz budget, where there is somebody behind a curtain who will \npay for this. He calls it a fig leaf.\n  Mr. THUNE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. I am many happy to yield.\n  Mr. THUNE. I understand my colleague from North Dakota. We both come \nfrom an area of the country where we have a lot of hard-working, plain-\nspoken people. They get this. If you have a bunch of tax cuts that are \nin law today and you allow them to expire, which is what this budget \ndoes, that constitutes a tax increase. People in my part of the country \nget that. If you are not trying to hide something, why would you put a \nfig leaf on it? The amendment offered to the budget by our colleagues \non the other side said: We will take the more popular things, and we \nwill allow those tax cuts to be extended, which to me and those I \nrepresent very simply implies that the ones you aren't extending are \ngoing to expire, which constitutes a tax increase. We can talk about \nwhether that is $300 billion or whether, if you include the AMT, it is \n$700 billion. But the fact is, the House budget resolution allows the \ntax cuts to expire to the tune of $916 billion. The Senate said: We are \ngoing to put a fig leaf on that, and we are going to allow $180 billion \nin tax relief, which to me implies they understand exactly what they \nare doing. They are trying to hide this tax increase by putting a fig \nleaf on it.\n  To the people in my State and the people of New Hampshire and the \npeople of North Dakota, this is a very simple thing. They get this. \nThey understand what they tried to accomplish when this was debated in \nthe Senate during the debate on the budget resolution was simply to put \na fig leaf on this to offer up some tax cuts, some tax relief, and they \nwouldn't have had to do that, if they weren't raising taxes by $916 \nbillion. It is pretty straightforward.\n  The motion of the Senator from New Hampshire is very straightforward. \nAll it says is: Let's allow these tax cuts to be extended because they \nhave created jobs, 7.5 million new jobs, 21 consecutive quarters of \neconomic growth, 4.5-percent unemployment rate, and $300 billion in \nadditional Government revenue over the past 3 years. Government \nrevenues have not gone down. They have gone up. We have not less \nGovernment revenue; we have more as a result. Why would you fix \nsomething that is not broken? That is something people in the part of \nthe country I represented understand clearly. If you are allowing tax \ncuts to expire, if you are not extending them, you are raising taxes.\n  Mr. GREGG. That was an excellent question. I appreciated that.\n  Mr. THUNE. I am not sure it was a question.\n  Mr. GREGG. Why would you fix it, if it is not broken?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Under the rules, it has to be a question. We will permit \na very generous reading of the rules.\n  Mr. GREGG. I wished to comment on a couple other points. We went \nthrough this when we debated the budget and the Senator from North \nDakota used his charts and I responded with an occasional chart, not \nquite as many. But I think it is important to make these points in a \ncouple of areas.\n  He says there is a 2-percent difference now between his tax revenues \nand the President's tax revenues over the 5 years. When he brought the \nbudget out, it was 3 percent; 3 percent came out to $\\1/2\\ trillion. He \nis at the 2 percent number now because he has factored in the fact that \nthey reduced taxes or they at least allowed some of the tax extenders \nto go forward with the Baucus amendment which, basically, by accepting \nthat amendment as a first amendment, the Senator from North Dakota made \nour argument for us, which was that they were raising taxes. That 2 \npercent would translate into about $300 billion today, a lot of money. \nIf you decide you are going to create a chart and you use small enough \nincrementals, you can end up with those two lines being together, but \n$300 billion is big-time dollars. That is the American taxpayer having \nto pay a lot of money in order to cover new spending under the \nDemocratic proposal.\n  In addition, this whole issue of economic expansion, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota pooh-poohs the last few years of economic expansion. He \nsays it is not that good compared to the Clinton years. Nearly eight \nmillion jobs is a lot of jobs; 22 continuous quarters of economic \ngrowth is a lot of economic growth. Equally important, is the fact that \nwe now have a revenue stream which exceeds the national average. Let's \nput that chart up there again because that is one of the most important \ncharts we have. We have a revenue stream which exceeds the historic \naverage of what we generate for revenues to the Federal Government. \nThat is a critical issue and a critical point. We\n\n[[Page S5848]]\n\nhave a tax law which has actually gotten lower rates in a lot of areas \nfor working families, for families with children, for people who have \ndividend income and take capital gains and, thus, take risk. By the \nway, senior citizens who are on fixed incomes are by far the biggest \nreceivers as a group of dividend income. When you start raising the \nrate on dividend taxes, you are hitting seniors who are on a fixed \nincome.\n\n  The fact is, with these lower rates, which we put in place, we are \ngenerating revenues to the Federal Government today--we have been for \nthe last 3 years--which dramatically exceed the amount of revenues \nwhich have historically been generated to the Federal Government. As a \nresult, the deficit is coming down precipitously. We will be in \nbalance. I said Humpty Dumpty could balance the budget by 2011. In \nfact, under CBO's scoring, the budget goes into a dramatic surplus by \n2011. They don't take into account a couple of major issues, but it \ndoesn't matter. The fact is, you can get to balance because revenues \nare coming in dramatically. Why are they coming in dramatically? \nBecause we have a tax law that works today. What does the other side \nwant to do with that? They want to throw it out. They want to go back \nto the old ways, when you just significantly increase the taxes on \nproductive America, on working Americans, on Americans who \nunfortunately die and run small businesses and their families get wiped \nout. Why does the other side of the aisle want to do that? Why does the \nother side of the aisle want to say to a family who has a death, who \nruns a small restaurant or a small farm or small business: We are going \nto put you out of business; we are going to hit you with a 45-percent \ntax rate? That makes no sense at all. Why not agree to the Kyl motion \nwhich was a balanced approach, worked out by both sides of the aisle, a \nfair, bipartisan approach? Why not be willing to extend the capital \ngains and dividends rate which has generated so much revenue, so much \neconomic activity?\n  In fact, capital gains has actually been a net winner for us. By \nreducing rates, we have now generated significantly more income from \ncapital gains taxes than we did when the rates were higher. Why is \nthat? It is called human nature. If you own an asset, a stock, a bond, \na piece of real estate, and you know you are going to be taxed at 25 \npercent or maybe 30 percent, the odds of your selling that asset and \nrealizing the gains are pretty slim. Maybe you are figuring, I will \nhold onto it. But when that tax rate went down to 15 percent, there was \nan immediate incentive for Americans to go out and sell those locked-up \nassets. What was the effect of that? The first effect was they got \ncash, which they then reinvested in something that was much more \nefficient. They put their capital into a better working situation so \nthey created more economic activity. It is human nature that they would \ngo out and invest to try to earn more money, which means they are \nbasically investing in taking maybe more risk or creating more \nopportunity for jobs.\n  In addition, they generated a huge windfall to the Federal Government \nwhich we are continuing to receive because those assets which were not \ngoing to get sold under the higher tax rates were getting sold. We were \ngetting the revenues. The proceeds were being reinvested, and that \ngenerated more jobs, more economic activity, which generated additional \nrevenues. That is why we have seen this dramatic increase in Federal \nrevenues. In fact, the vast majority of the Federal revenue that we \nhave seen jump has been a function of capital gains revenue. That is \nwhere most of this new revenue comes from. Yet the other side doesn't \nwant to extend the rates on capital gains, doesn't want to extend the \nrates on dividends. They want to kill that goose that has been laying \nsignificant revenues for the Federal Government and giving people an \nincentive to be productive and helping senior citizens who are on a \nfixed income meet the challenges of living on a fixed income.\n  It makes no sense to me that they would oppose this amendment, if \ntheir argument is they have no tax increases in their budget. The only \nway you can oppose my motion is if you do have tax increases in your \nbudget because the only way my motion has any impact is to address tax \nincreases. So if you didn't have any tax increases in your budget, you \nwould have to support my motion. If that is their position, that there \nare no tax increases in their budget, then my motion should be a \nnonevent and should be supported. But it appears they do have tax \nincreases in their budget because they are opposing my motion. In fact, \nif we go back to the chart that shows the actual calculation of tax \nincreases, the 3 percent chart or the apples to apples, it is true. \nThere is a $300 billion tax increase over and above the AMT, even after \nthe Baucus language, and there is, in addition, an issue of where that \n$300 billion is going to come from. The concept that it is going to \ncome out of a building in the Grand Caymens or from uncollected taxes \nis not valid in the face of the testimony before our committee and the \nhistory of our attempts to try to close those, to address those two \nissues.\n  No more than 10 percent of that tax increase could possibly be gained \nout of those two accounts. The rest will have to come out of working \nAmericans who today are benefitting from the tax cuts which are in \nplace and using those tax cuts to significantly expand this economy \nand, as a result, generate significantly more revenues to the Federal \nTreasury.\n  That is obviously why I put this motion forward. The Senator has put \nforward his alternative, which is responded to by the summary I have \ngiven of mine and speaks to the fact that his third paragraph, which is \nyou are going to get the money from the tax gap and abusive tax \nshelters is not credible in the face of the facts and the situation. \nAlthough we certainly want to get as much as we can from those two \naccounts, we are not going to get anywhere near what is proposed, \nnowhere near the $300 billion. Of course, he held up my motion. He \nsaid: It doesn't address the AMT to the Senator from South Dakota. I \nwould note that his also does not address the AMT. At least we are \nconsistent on that point.\n  It is my understanding that Senator Cornyn is going to be back in 10 \nminutes to offer his motion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Obama). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have enjoyed this presentation so much. \nIt is perhaps the most creative presentation I have heard on the Senate \nfloor. The Senator wonders why we aren't going along with the policies \nof this administration. Here is why. Here is what our friends on the \nother side never want to talk about. You will never hear this word \nleave their lips--debt. They don't want to talk about debt because that \nis what they have been running up. They have run up the debt of the \ncountry by $3 trillion in 5 years. If their policy is followed, they \nwill run it up another $3 trillion, doubling the debt and doing it all \nbefore the baby boomers retire, putting us in a deep hole.\n  Here is the record. The debt at the end of the first year of this \nadministration stood at $5.8 trillion, the gross debt of the United \nStates, $5.8 trillion.\n  At the end of this year, the gross debt of the United States is going \nto be up to $9 trillion because of the policies that our friends on the \nother side put in place. But you will never hear them talk about that \npart of the record. You will never hear them talk about where it is \nheaded if we continue with their policies. They are going to add \nanother $3 trillion. You will never hear my colleague say the motion he \nhas presented will cost another $250 billion that is not paid for--not \na dime of it. He will not tell you that our budget balances in 2012, \nbut if we adopt his motion, it will not because he does not want to \nhave to be under the constraints of making things add up.\n  I admit, it is tough. It is very hard to actually balance the budget. \nBut our friends have not even had a budget for the last 2 years for the \nUnited States of America. Hard to believe, isn't it? They had been in \ncharge of everything, and they didn't have a budget.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a clarification?\n  I will acknowledge there was no budget last year. But 2 years ago, \nthere was a budget, if you recall, and it actually had a reconciliation \ninstruction in it--a very significant instruction.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, 3 of the last 5 years there has been no budget.\n\n[[Page S5849]]\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I want the Senator to be correct. Was the third year the \nyear you were in charge when we did not have a budget?\n  Mr. CONRAD. No. That was when we had split responsibility and could \nnever reach agreement because we would not go along with running up the \ndebt. I am proud that we would not go along with it. No, we insisted on \nhaving budgets that actually balance, which is a novel idea around \nhere.\n  Let me show what the results have been of the fiscal policy that our \nfriends on the other side have engaged in.\n  I have pictured on this chart all the other Presidents of the United \nStates--all 42 of them--because it took all these Presidents pictured \n224 years to run up $1 trillion of debt held by foreign countries, and \nthis President has exceeded them. This President, alone, in 6 years, \nhas exceeded all the foreign debt run up by the previous 42 Presidents \nover 224 years.\n  Now, this is a fiscal record they are proud of? I would not be proud \nof that. What is the result of this? The result of this is, we owe the \nJapanese over $600 billion. We now owe the Chinese over $400 billion. \nWe owe the United Kingdom over $100 billion. We owe the oil-exporting \ncountries over $100 billion. We owe the Caribbean banking centers over \n$60 billion. That is their record. Their record is plunging this \ncountry into deeper and deeper debt.\n  Now, let's go back to this question of taxes. I have heard over and \nover from the other side that somehow I have compared apples to oranges \nin the OMB scoring and the CBO scoring of the revenue of our proposals. \nLet me say this to you. I think it is relevant because the President \nsaid about his budget--nobody else's claim; it is his statement about \nhis budget--that it would raise $14.826 trillion over the next 5 years. \nDo you know what my budget will raise over the 5 years? Virtually the \nidentical amount: $14.827 trillion.\n  Now, my friends on the other side say there is going to be an \neconomic calamity because I am raising virtually the identical amount \nthe President called for. I do not think so. Was the President calling \nfor an amount of revenue that would derail the economy? Was he? I do \nnot think the other side would make that assertion. But the President's \nown statement about what his budget would raise said it was going to \nraise $14.826 trillion over the next 5 years. My budget raises $14.827 \ntrillion.\n  The one thing I probably should do is reduce our revenue by $1 \nbillion. Then we would have absolutely the same amount of revenue the \nPresident said his budget would raise. Now, the point the Senator makes \nthat has validity is that if you use Congressional Budget Office \nscoring on both, there is a 2-percent difference. I have 2 percent more \nrevenue. Why? Because I actually want to balance the budget. The \nPresident's budget does not balance. Mine does. We have 2 percent more \nrevenue, although according to the President's estimates, we have \nalmost identical revenue streams over the 5 years.\n\n  But under CBO scoring, we have 2 percent more revenue. I say, without \nhesitation, we can raise that amount of revenue with no tax increase. \nWhy? Let's do the math. The tax gap--that is the difference between \nwhat is owed and what is paid--the tax gap is roughly $2 trillion over \n5 years.\n  Then we have the tax havens. The Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations said we are losing $100 billion a year there. So $100 \nbillion times the 5 years of this budget is another $500 billion. That \nis $2.5 trillion of revenue that is out there that could be recovered \nwith no tax increase--none--$2.5 trillion. We would only need about 10 \npercent of that in my budget--about 10 percent--and you would have all \nthe revenue you need to balance and to provide the middle-class tax \nrelief and to provide the estate tax reform and to provide the increase \nto veterans health care that so desperately is needed and to provide \nthe kind of investment in education that is critical to secure our \nfuture and to provide for law enforcement.\n  The President's budget cuts the COPS on the street program by over 90 \npercent. Why would we do that? Why would we cut the COPS Program 94 \npercent? We do not agree with that.\n  We also think that veterans, who have served so gallantly and at such \ngreat personal cost, deserve to have the promise kept to them about \ntheir health care. Our budget does that. You can do this without any \ntax increase--none.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire says: Well, the Revenue Commissioner \nsays he can only recapture $20 billion of the $2 trillion that is out \nthere. What is that percentage?\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. It is 1 percent. We have a Revenue Commissioner who \nacknowledges you have $2 trillion out there that is not being \ncollected. He says he can collect 1 percent of it. I would say, we \nbetter get a new Revenue Commissioner. In fact, the Revenue \nCommissioner is leaving. Maybe we can get a Revenue Commissioner who \ncan do better than 1 percent. We ought to get a Revenue Commissioner \nwho can do better than 1 percent. But that is one factor.\n  The tax havens: $100 billion a year that is leaking out the backdoor \nbecause of these tax havens. That is not acceptable. We ought to close \nthat door. If we closed that door, if we shut it halfway, we would \nprovide for the revenue here.\n  There are no tax increases in the budget--none. In fact, there is \ndramatic tax relief. Of course, the reason we left AMT out of my motion \nis because AMT relief is in our budget. We do not have to put it in my \nmotion. It is in our budget. We provide for 2 years of AMT relief. The \nPresident provided for only 1.\n  If you were going to apply the same argument to the President's \nbudget that they are applying to my budget, here is what you would \nfind. You would find the President has a big tax increase in his \nbudget. If you apply their same logic to the President's budget, what \nyou find is the President has a $500 billion tax increase in his \nbudget. He has 1 year of AMT tax relief, which means he does not have \nany for the 4 following years. That would constitute a tax increase of \n$328 billion. By our friend's logic, that means the President has a \n$328 billion tax increase in the alternative minimum tax.\n  For the tax extenders, it is the same way. It provides for just 1 \nyear. So you have $104 billion in the succeeding 4 years he does not \nprovide for. Under their logic, that is a tax increase.\n  His health tax proposal is another $52 billion.\n  If you add it all up, the President has, according to their logic, a \n$500 billion tax increase. Do you know what the Secretary of the \nTreasury said when we confronted him with this? He said: That is the \nlaw. That is the law. I guess I could give that same flip answer here. \nI do not do that. Instead, I provide in the budget that we would \nprovide for the middle-class tax relief, we would provide for estate \ntax reform, and we would pay for it so we can balance this budget and \nstop the explosion of debt in this country. That is exactly what we \nshould do.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, to respond quickly, we have been over this \nground many times in our discussions, but I do think it is important to \nreinforce the differences.\n  First off, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the \nletter from Director Portman which reflects the fact that CBO scores \nthe administration revenues significantly different than what is used \nas a chart by the Senator from North Dakota and reflects the fact there \nis a $300 billion increase in the proposal of the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President,Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                   Washington, DC, March 16, 2007.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Judd: You asked for a comparison of the revenue levels \n     in the Senate-reported budget resolution and the President's \n     Budget under the Administration's economic and technical \n     assumptions.\n       The Senate-reported budget resolution uses the \n     Congressional Budget Office's (CBO) economic and technical \n     assumptions and makes a policy assumption that tax relief \n     enacted in 2001 and 2003--the child credit, marriage penalty \n     relief, the 10 percent bracket, and other tax relief--ends in \n     2010,\n\n[[Page S5850]]\n\n     unless offset by other tax increases. In addition, the \n     resolution does not reflect the impact of other revenue \n     proposals contained in the President's Budget. With these \n     assumptions, the Administration has developed an estimate of \n     the revenue levels in the Senate-reported budget resolution.\n       The table below compares the revenue levels in the \n     President's Budget to the Senate-reported budget resolution \n     based on the Administration's and CBO's economic and \n     technical assumptions. While the resolution also includes 22 \n     ``reserve funds,'' a procedure that allows revenues to be \n     increased above the levels set forth in the resolution for \n     higher spending, the estimates below do not include higher \n     revenue levels that could result from these reserve funds.\n\n      COMPARISON OF PRESIDENT'S BUDGET & SENATE-REPORTED RESOLUTION\n                   [FY 2008-2012; revenue in billions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                             Administration      CBO\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPresident's Budget.........................         14,826        14,568\n \n    End 2001/2003 tax relief...............           +374          +392\n    Drop other Administration revenue                 +225           +43\n     proposals.............................\n    Other changes..........................  ..............           +4\n                                            ----------------------------\n        Subtotal...........................           +599          +439\n                                            ============================\nSenate-reported budget resolution..........         15,425        15,007\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Please let me know if you have any additional questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Rob Portman.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. He holds up the wall of debt chart. Let me hold up the \nwall of taxes chart which the Senator from North Dakota is showing in \nhis budget. He is basically proposing dramatic increases in the tax \nburden on the American people. He claims it is going to come from this \nGrand Cayman building and that the Commissioner of Revenue is not doing \nhis job in collecting the funds that are owed and obligated.\n  But the fact is, the Commissioner has aggressively pursued this. We \nhave given him more money. He will continue to aggressively pursue \nthis. Yes, there is more that can be collected, but the numbers are \nnowhere near what the Senator from North Dakota has represented they \nmight be.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield on this chart?\n  Mr. GREGG. Not right now.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator does not want to be able to answer questions \non this chart?\n  Mr. GREGG. I will answer questions in a second.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would look forward to the opportunity to ask a question \nabout that chart.\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, let me finish my statement on the points which I am \nmaking; which is that the Grand Cayman building is not going to pay for \nthe tax increases in the Senator's budget.\n  Now, the Senator says he has a 2-percent increase in the tax burden. \nTwo percent translates into about $300 billion. That has to come from \nsomewhere. Do you know why that tax increase is in this budget? Because \nhe spends the money. He spends that money.\n  In all the numbers that are being thrown out here on the floor, all \nthe different ideas, all the different arguments about OMB and CBO and \nthis and that and this and that and Grand Cayman buildings, the bottom \nline is that the budget of the Senator and the Democratic Party \nincreases spending. In the discretionary accounts, the Democrats' \nbudget is about $145 billion above the President's request over the 5 \nyears. It increases mandatory spending by nearly $460 billion. It \nincreases taxes, above the AMT issue, by about $300 billion over 5 \nyears. It does not extend those tax cuts and rates which have generated \nthe huge explosion in revenue for this Government; specifically, things \nsuch as the dividend and capital gains tax rates and the rates that \nassist working Americans. So it is not necessarily--if it did extend \nthose rates, you would think there wouldn't be so much resistance to my \nmotion. You can't make the argument that you are not raising taxes on \nAmericans and then oppose my motion, which essentially says: Don't \nraise taxes on Americans. That is the bottom-line inconsistency of the \nSenator from North Dakota's arguments when you get beyond all the \nnumbers.\n\n  I will yield to the Senator from Iowa, but the Senator from North \nDakota had a question, and I look forward to his question. Remember, it \nhas to be a question.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am ready with a question. I say to the \nSenator, I look at this ``Building a Wall of Taxes'' and the numbers \ndon't match the visual. The Senator's chart shows under our budget that \ntaxes would be 18.6 percent of GDP in 2007 and 18.8 percent of GDP in \n2012, and it shows visually this huge increase in taxes. By his own \nchart, there is almost no difference. I would ask the Senator, how can \nit be that the Senator shows a chart that makes it look as though there \nis some big increase in taxes, when by the Senator's own designations, \nit is 18.6 percent of GDP in 2007 and 18.8 percent in 2012?\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, because--\n  Mr. CONRAD. How does this chart accurately depict the change?\n  Mr. GREGG. Because the tax burden is going up in the billions on the \nside there, the x-axis. Does my colleague see that on the side? It is \nthe amount of tax in billions--the actual taxes you are taking from \npeople, the tax burden, that is the problem.\n  Look at it this way: If you are taking $2.5 billion from people today \nand then at the end of your budget you are taking $3.15 billion from \npeople, that is all coming out of those tax numbers.\n  Mr. CONRAD. But as the Senator's chart demonstrates, if you adjust \nthat for inflation, what your GDP figure does, there is virtually no \ndifference in tax burden--virtually none. There is 18.6 percent in GDP \ntax burden in 2007 and 18.8 percent in 2012.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if I may reclaim my time, the Senator has \nmade my argument for me. My motion should not be opposed because my \nmotion would accomplish what the Senator wishes, which is to maintain a \nreasoned tax law in this country and a tax burden on the American \npeople which would be consistent. If you oppose my motion, you are \nsaying you have to raise taxes. By definition you do.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President.\n  Mr. GREGG. I reclaim my time, Mr. President. As much as I would like \nto hear from the Senator from North Dakota, I have told the Senator \nfrom Iowa I would grant him some time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. But the Senator can't hand off the floor. This Senator \nenjoys the first right of recognition, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GREGG. But I have the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If the Senator is yielding, at that point I will ask for \nrecognition to respond. The Senator cannot hand off recognition, as the \nSenator knows, under the rules of the Senate.\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, I believe I control the time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator cannot hand off recognition from himself to \nanother Senator. That violates the rules of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator can only yield time. He cannot \nhand off the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, I believe the Senator from Iowa had a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire controls the \ntime.\n  Mr. GREGG. I believe the Senator from Iowa had a question. I heard \nhim say he wanted me to yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may yield for a question.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am sure the Senator from North Dakota has some succinct \ncomment he wants to make before we turn to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator.\n  The good thing is we debate strenuously, but we do it in good humor \nand we like and respect each other. I might say I even extend that to \nthe Senator from Iowa, the esteemed ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee, whom I have grown fond of.\n  Let me say this: We don't have any tax increase in our proposal. The \nreason we resist the motion of the Senator from New Hampshire is \nbecause we would have a budget that would not be in balance. Our budget \nis in balance by 2012; with his motion it would not be. He has $250 \nbillion of tax expenditures not paid for. In our budget, we provide for \nthe middle-class tax cuts, we provide for estate tax reform, and we say \nif you want to have additional tax cuts, you can have them, but you \nhave to pay for them.\n  I thank the Senator for his courtesy.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield to the Senator from Iowa such time as he may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire controls 1 \nminute on this motion.\n\n[[Page S5851]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I can only speak for 1 minute? Is that what you are \nsaying? There is no point in my speaking if I only have 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator also has 30 minutes of general \ntime.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield to the Senator from Iowa as much time as he may \nconsume.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me say to my colleague, I know Senator \nGregg has another matter he has to attend to, and I have time \nremaining. We will try to be fair and work things out so people don't \nget shut out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I speak in favor of the motion by the \nSenator from New Hampshire, the ranking member of the Budget Committee, \nto make sure we continue existing tax policy throughout the period of \ntime of this budget resolution.\n  Considering the issue of taxes and this budget, press reports have \nindicated we may be in the ninth inning of this budget season. The \nPresident sent his budget to Capitol Hill 3 months ago. The Senate \nBudget Committee marked up a budget resolution. It passed the Senate. \nThat resolution lays out the Democratic leadership's fiscal priorities \nfor the next 5 years. As everyone knows, the American people spoke last \nNovember and as a result of that election, we have a new Democratic \nmajority in both Houses of Congress. So for the first time in 12 years, \nDemocrats have the privilege, but also the responsibility, for our \nbudget.\n  The Senate spoke very clearly in support of some tax relief. The \nvoice came in the form of Senator Baucus and his amendment. My friend, \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee, secured $180 billion to prevent \npart of the big tax increase that will go into effect January 1, 2011. \nAlthough the Baucus amendment only provides 44 percent of the tax \nrelief room that is actually needed to keep existing tax policy in \nplace so there is no tax increase, it is, in fact, far superior, \nthough, to the position on the same issue by the other body, because \nthe House position is zero tax relief. That is right: zero tax relief. \nWhat does zero tax relief mean? It means a total tax increase of $936 \nbillion over 5 years. That, in fact, is the largest tax increase in \nhistory, and it is a tax increase that will occur automatically without \na vote of Congress. Of course, it is inconceivable that people say: \nWell, we aren't responsible for a tax increase. If you like the tax \npolicy we have today and you don't do anything to stop it, and you \nautomatically have a tax increase, then the people who let it \nautomatically happen are responsible for increasing taxes--the biggest \ntax increase in the history of the country.\n  That tax increase means real dollars out of the wallets of real \nmiddle-income families. I have a chart here. The chart shows a wall of \ntax increases. The chart shows a family of four at $40,000 a year \naverage income--the national average--will face a tax increase of \n$2,052. Now, for a lot of my rich liberal friends, that may not seem \nlike a lot of money, but for a hard-working family of four in my State \nof Iowa, a $2,052 increase in taxes without even a vote of the Congress \nhappening on January 1, 2011 is a lot of money, and it matters. That is \nwhy that wall of tax increases ought to be clear to everybody, and we \nought to do everything we can to bring down that wall.\n  As a senior Republican member of the Budget Committee, I have not \nbeen consulted on the budget by our chairman, but I have made my views \nclear to our distinguished chairman. What I know about the budget I \nhave learned from press reports. If those reports are true, I would \nencourage the chairman and the Senate leadership to stand strong for \nthe Senate position, which is taking care of some of the tax increase \nthat would have taken place--44 percent of it--not as good as it ought \nto be, but it is surely better than the other body.\n  Press reports indicate that the Democratic Budget Committee chairmen \nare working on a compromise that would condition the tax relief on a \nsurplus. That is, the Baucus amendment would be subject to a trigger.\n  Now, what is a trigger? Well, I have another chart. This chart deals \nwith perhaps the most famous trigger. The chart shows, as my colleagues \ncan see, Trigger, the cowboy actor Roy Rogers' horse. You can see from \nthe chart that Trigger is a pretty impressive looking horse. We would \ndefinitely like to have such a Trigger on my farm to help with the \nchores, and I am sure my grandkids would enjoy a ride with Trigger were \nhe stabled on my farm. He is a beautiful horse.\n  As western movie buffs know, Trigger is no longer with us. Trigger is \nstuffed and on display at the Roy Rogers-Dale Evans Museum in Branson, \nMO. Although Trigger was an impressive looking horse, this trigger \ndevice the Democrat leadership is looking at is far from impressive. \nThe trigger notion is something that has a long history with Democratic \nleadership. Back in 1996, as an example, the Clinton administration and \nthe Democratic leadership argued for a trigger for the $500 per-child \ntax credit and other family tax relief issues. They took this position \nafter President Clinton had vetoed the bill containing the family tax \nrelief proposals. If the Clinton administration and the Democratic \nleadership had prevailed, millions of American families would have \nreceived the $500 per-child tax credit perhaps in 1999 through 2001--\nonly in those years. If President Clinton and the Democratic leadership \nhad won and the trigger were in place, then millions of families would \nhave lost the child tax credit in the years 2002 until now. So why \nwould anybody in Congress want to be so antifamily and put in a trigger \npolicy, as the practice was at that time, that would deny families with \nchildren the child tax credit? It doesn't make sense, but that is the \nway triggers work.\n  The same dynamic occurred in 2001. With surpluses, the Democratic \nleadership opposed broad-based, bipartisan tax relief, including a \ndoubling of the $500 per-child tax credit. One of the ideas the \nDemocratic leadership flirted with at that time was the trigger. There \nwere a few Republicans attracted to the idea as well, I have to \nconfess.\n  The trigger was debated somewhat, but it was never found to be \nworkable. It wasn't workable. So if it wasn't workable 6 years ago, why \nare they bringing it out of the attic now for consideration? Because a \ntrigger is a complicated matter. It could be suggested that the \nmechanics of a broad-based tax trigger are a little bit like \ntrigonometry. Trigonometry is a division of mathematics that deals with \ntriangles. It is simple on its face, but you can see from this \ntextbook, it can become pretty complicated pretty easily. Look at this. \nThat is complicated.\n  Interweaving the complexities and uncertainties of triggered tax \nrelief with the vast American economy could lead to a new term. That \nnew term would be ``trigonomics.'' As much as folks complain about the \nuncertainty and complexity of the tax policy, I don't think the \nDemocratic negotiators should want us to take us to the land of \ntrigonomics.\n  To some degree, the current law sunset of 2001 and 2003 is a de facto \ntrigger. If you look at those in opposition to permanence of the \nbipartisan tax relief, you will find that it is, with very few \nexceptions, the same folks who like triggers.\n  The tax system is a very complex, very pervasive force in our \nsociety.\n  It affects real Americans, all Americans, and it affects all economic \nactivity. So creating conditional tax relief through a trigger \nmechanism would destabilize an already unwieldy tax system. How are \nfamilies, how are businesses, how are investors supposed to plan their \naffairs with a trigger hanging over their current tax law rules that \nkeeps taxes low? Think about that. What would we be doing to the hard-\nworking American taxpayers?\n  Now, as an aside, those taxpayers, by the way, are sending record \namounts of revenue to the Treasury Department. This very day, it is \nreported in the Wall Street Journal that more taxes came in in April \nthan we have ever had in the history of our country--because the \nbipartisan tax relief plans of 2001 and 2003 are growing the economy. \nThey are the goose that laid the golden egg, for 3 years in a row, \nbringing in massive amounts of revenue into our Federal Treasury, to a \npoint where, by the end of this fiscal year, the annual deficit will be \nless than 1 percent of gross national product. When you are dealing \nwith a $13 trillion economy, 1 percent up or down is about as good as \nyou can do 12 months ahead in planning a budget and tax policies for \nthis\n\n[[Page S5852]]\n\ngreat country of ours. So the American taxpayer is doing his or her \npart to reduce the deficit.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a couple of \narticles from the BNA Daily Report for Executives, one dated May 3, \n2007, another dated May 7, 2007.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Daily Report for Executives, May 3, 2007]\n\nRobust Revenues Lead Treasury To Drop Three-Year, Consider Buying Debt \n                                 Again\n\n       The U.S. Treasury Department said May 2 it was scrapping \n     sales of the three-year note and that it has discussed with \n     Wall Street representatives the issue of debt buybacks, a \n     finance management tool last seen when the government was in \n     surplus, as tax collections continue to come in at a healthy \n     pace.\n       ``As you all know, receipts have been strong and largely \n     consistent with our forecasts. Based on this and other \n     factors, we're announcing this morning our decision to \n     discontinue the issuance of the three-year note,'' Anthony \n     Ryan, Treasury assistant secretary for financial markets, \n     said at the department's quarterly press briefing. The change \n     will allow Treasury to ensure auctions of remaining issues \n     are large enough to attract active bidding, help balance its \n     portfolio of debt and ``manage the improving fiscal \n     outlook,'' Ryan said.\n       The three-year note was revived in May 2003 after being \n     discontinued previously when the government began posting \n     surpluses from 1998 through 2001.\n\n\n                       Talks With Advisory Panel\n\n       The discussion of debt buybacks was held with the \n     Treasury's Borrowing Advisory Committee, a panel of private \n     sector representatives from the securities industry. Treasury \n     officials meet quarterly with the group to receive input on \n     issues facing Treasury's debt managers, who aim to sell U.S. \n     Treasuries to finance government borrowing at the lowest \n     possible cost over time.\n       Treasury had asked the TBAC to address ``what practices \n     Treasury and market participants should consider in a \n     significantly improving fiscal or surplus environment, given \n     volatility in budget forecasts and the Administration's long-\n     term plan to balance the budget,'' according to minutes of \n     the meeting released by Treasury.\n       Ryan called the talks ``an initial discussion'' that did \n     not signal any decisions and intended merely to broach the \n     issue.\n       ``We asked this question in an attempt to continue to be \n     proactive and forward-looking,'' he said. ``Given some of the \n     volatility associated with our projections, it can't hurt to \n     be prepared.''\n\n\n                         Recent Swings Volatile\n\n       Budget swings over the past decade have been particularly \n     volatile. In 1997, a Democratic White House and a Republican \n     Congress reached agreement on a 5-year plan to bring the \n     budget into balance. Thanks in large part to surging capital \n     gains revenues, balance was reached in 1998.\n       On the other hand, few analysts expected the sharp drop-off \n     in revenues that followed the relatively light 2001 recession \n     and the enactment of President Bush's tax cut plan. Revenues \n     have surprised on the upside in recent years, and that trend \n     is expected to continue this year, according to analysts \n     watching the early data on April tax returns, which bring in \n     a sizeable chunk of the government's overall annual revenue.\n       A Treasury chart prepared for the TBAC showed the possible \n     range of borrowing outcomes if historic ranges of forecast \n     error, either positive or negative, occurred. If the \n     surprises kept to the positive side, the chart showed \n     a potential need for a large paydown of debt as soon as \n     2010.\n       Asked if that implied a budget surplus in 2010, 2 years \n     ahead of what Congress and the White House have targeted for \n     a surplus, Matthew Abbott, deputy assistant secretary for \n     federal finance, said, ``What the chart illustrates is that \n     it's possible. Not that it's expected, but that's possible.''\n\n\n                `Premature' to Discuss Earlier Surpluses\n\n       A Wall Street economist also warned that reaching surplus \n     ahead of 2012 was unlikely, given uncertainty about what the \n     government will do about the Alternative Minimum Tax as well \n     as the temporary tax cuts that expire in 2010.\n       ``I think it would be premature to think about buybacks \n     because of expected budget surpluses,'' said Michael Moran, \n     chief economist with Daiwa Securities. However, he said \n     buybacks could be used instead as a tool to affect the \n     maturity of outstanding debt, a factor that influences \n     interest costs.\n       Moran also said the ``excellent inflows in April'' on the \n     tax side were likely to lead him to revise downward his \n     deficit forecast from $175 billion in 2007.\n\n\n                        Hoyer Hopeful on Budget\n\n       Democrats in Congress are continuing to work on hammering \n     out the framework for a budget resolution that can pass both \n     chambers of Congress and reach balance in 2012. With an \n     informal deadline of May 15 for completing action on the \n     budget, the House has yet to name members of a conference \n     committee for its side.\n       Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) remained optimistic, \n     telling reporters May 2, ``We want to move ahead on the \n     budget. The answer to your question is I'm hopeful we'll move \n     the budget in the next couple of weeks, that we think that's \n     important to do.''\n       A House Democratic aide said conferees may not be named in \n     the April 30 week, as had been expected, but could instead be \n     named early in the May 7 week. ``We can see our way to get \n     there'' to a resolution, the aide told BNA.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          [From the Daily Report for Executives, May 7, 2007]\n\nCBO Lowers Projection of 2007 Deficit To $150-$200 Billion Range on Tax \n                                Receipts\n\n       The Congressional Budget Office said May 4 that the \n     projected 2007 federal budget deficit could come in much \n     lower than had been expected at the beginning of the year, \n     possibly as low as $150 billion, based on continued strength \n     in tax revenues.\n       ``Revenues have risen by about 11 percent compared with \n     receipts in the same period of 2006, only slightly more than \n     CBO anticipated when it prepared its most recent budget \n     estimates in March; outlays have grown by only 3 percent,'' \n     the CBO said in its projection issued ahead of the monthly \n     financial statement to be released by the Treasury Department \n     on May 10.\n       ``CBO now expects that the government will end 2007 with a \n     deficit of between $150 billion and $200 billion, assuming \n     enactment of pending supplemental appropriations,'' the \n     agency said.\n       In March, the agency had projected about a $214 billion \n     deficit, assuming an Iraq war supplemental is passed by \n     Congress. In 2006, the deficit totaled $248.2 billion.\n\n\n                      Further Receipt Growth Seen\n\n       Healthy tax revenues were cited May 2 by Treasury \n     Department officials in their decision to eliminate sales of \n     the three-year note from their regular auctions of government \n     debt (85 DER EE-2, 05/3/07). Treasury officials also \n     disclosed they had discussed the issue of debt buybacks with \n     an advisory committee made up of private sector experts. \n     While debt buybacks were seen when the government last ran a \n     surplus, Treasury officials said the discussions with the \n     panel were only made in an effort to be forward-looking and \n     proactive.\n       Prior to the CBO release, Rob Portman, director of the \n     White House's Office of Management and Budget, said the \n     budget was benefiting from a healthy economy.\n       ``Solid economic growth is pushing Federal tax receipts up, \n     and will drive the deficit down even faster as we move toward \n     balance,'' he said in a statement.\n       ``We've just seen a record-breaking April tax collection, \n     and the outlook is for further growth in tax receipts. That's \n     good news for our federal budget, and underscores the need \n     for making the pro-growth tax relief permanent and having \n     spending restraint in place.''\n\n\n                   Lawmakers Aim for Balance in 2012\n\n       On Capitol Hill, lawmakers are struggling to close the \n     differences between House- and Senate-passed versions of the \n     2008 budget blueprint. Democrats have said they are aiming \n     for a budget that can pass both chambers of Congress by May \n     15 and reach balance by 2012. However, negotiators have been \n     stuck on several issues, including whether to allow room for \n     extending some temporary tax cuts.\n       In its report, the CBO said it expected the government to \n     post a $176 billion surplus in April, well above the $119 \n     billion surplus seen in April 2006. Because of the mid-month \n     deadline for individual tax payments, April is a \n     crucial month for government revenues. If the April \n     projection is correct, the year-to-date deficit will be \n     about $83 billion, or about $101 billion less than in the \n     first seven months of fiscal 2006, the said.\n       CBO said receipts from individual income taxes were up by \n     about $105 billion, or 17.5 percent, through April compared \n     with the same period in the previous year, while payroll \n     taxes were up by $27 billion, or 5.5 percent in the same time \n     frame.\n       ``About 85 percent of the growth in total receipts through \n     April occurred in receipts from individual income and payroll \n     taxes, the two largest sources of revenues,'' the agency \n     said. It noted, however, that some nonwithheld receipts \n     appeared to be booked earlier by Treasury in 2007 than in \n     2006, shifting some receipts from May to April. If that \n     factor is adjusted for, the agency said, overall receipts \n     would have been up by closer to 9 percent, ``only slightly \n     more'' than CBO had projected in March.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. So then why trigger tax increases when the current law \ntax levels are bringing plenty of revenue into the Federal Treasury? \nWhy would you want to mess with a policy that is bringing in what would \nnow have to add up to $750 billion more than what we anticipated would \nbe coming into the Federal Treasury from that tax policy when we \nadopted it? And in the process, we would be punishing the American \ntaxpayers, who are already working hard and paying additional revenue \nat a lower level of taxation, as we passed it in 2001 and 2003.\n  The biggest problem I have with a trigger is that it creates yet \nanother budget process bias for higher Federal spending. If Congress \ndecides to spend more than planned, the trigger gives the American \ntaxpayer the shaft. Spending taxpayers' money then trumps future \npromised tax relief if a\n\n[[Page S5853]]\n\ntrigger is in place. The American taxpayer need look no further than \nthe budget resolution conference report that we are debating now to see \ntriggered future tax relief's futility.\n  After winning the November elections by claiming to enforce fiscal \ndiscipline, Democrats have done three things with the budget in \nconference: One, they have guaranteed new spending of at least $205 \nbillion over the budget baseline. Secondly, with multiple reserve \nfunds, they have set up many arenas of new spending and new taxes. \nThirdly, for the first time in 6 years--I emphasize this--with a new \nmajority in Congress, a tax hike on virtually every American taxpayer \nis built into the budget in future years. Now, did the American people \nknow this was how the term ``fiscal discipline'' would be defined after \nthe votes were counted last November? Higher taxes and higher spending. \nDid the American people vote for this definition of ``fiscal \ndiscipline'' after the last election? My guess is the answer is the \nAmerican taxpayers didn't think ``fiscal discipline'' meant higher \ntaxes and higher spending.\n  If fiscal discipline were the real goal of the new Democratic \nleadership, they would employ a trigger, then, on the new spending they \nbaked into this budget cake. How about that. The new spending in this \nbudget would only be triggered if the Federal budget were in surplus. \nDo I have any takers among the Democratic budget negotiators on that \nissue?\n  Before the Democratic leadership rolls out its budget, I challenge \nthem to show a proposal with a single dollar of spending restraint \ndedicated to deficit reduction. It is a challenge I have issued for \nseveral years since bipartisan tax relief has been attacked on fiscal \ndiscipline grounds. My challenge has not been met. If you go back a \ndecade, you will not find a proposal for spending restraint from the \nDemocratic leadership. Check the record. You won't find anything on the \nspending side of the ledger.\n  The use of a trigger is more evidence of this obsession with higher \ntaxes and more spending. Instead of accepting the Baucus amendment, \nwhich is supported by a strong bipartisan vote in both bodies because \nit passed here with only one dissenting vote and it had more than two-\nthirds on a motion to instruct in the House of Representatives--so \ninstead of accepting the Baucus amendment, which is supported strongly \nby bipartisan votes in both Houses, the Democratic negotiators are \ntaking a different path, ignoring the overwhelming votes of both the \nSenate and the House. They want to use a trigger as cover. The trigger \nwill mean that future Democratic spending proposals will gut future tax \nrelief, thereby guaranteeing a tax increase on virtually every American \ntaxpayer, without even a vote of the people, because it is \nautomatically going to happen.\n  I don't think it is too late. I suggest that if the Democratic \nbudgeteers want to talk the talk of fiscal discipline, then walk the \nwalk of fiscal discipline, apply the trigger to spending, but apply it \nto the $205 billion in brandnew spending. Don't build a wall of tax \nrelief on the American people; build a wall of fiscal discipline \nagainst runaway Federal spending. In other words, we will tear down \nthat wall of tax increases that are automatically going to happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from North Dakota \nis recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, it is hard to debate the Senator from \nIowa, the ranking member of the Finance Committee, because he has been \na really good colleague and he has strong feelings about these issues. \nIn many of these matters, I find myself in agreement with him.\n  I want to say to those who are listening that we don't believe there \nis any tax increase in our proposal. We believe there is significant \nfiscal discipline because we are balancing the budget by 2012. There \nhas been no balancing of budgets around here during the 6 years of this \nadministration. They have run up record deficits. They have run up \nrecord debt. It is not a matter of speculation, what they have done.\n  If you look at the record of this administration on debt, it is just \nas clear as it can be. This is what happened on their watch. They have \nbeen in control of everything--the House, the Senate, and the White \nHouse.\n  This is what has happened. They took the debt of the United States \nfrom $5.8 trillion at the end of the President's first year--we don't \nhold him responsible for the first year because he was operating under \nthe previous administration's budget. But look at what he is \nresponsible for. He has taken this gross debt of the United States from \n$5.8 trillion to $9 trillion, and if his fiscal policies are pursued \nthe next 5 years, he will have taken the debt to $12 trillion. He will \nhave more than doubled the debt of the United States.\n  One of the major consequences of that is, increasingly, this funding \nis from abroad. We are dependent upon the kindness of strangers. It \ntook 42 Presidents 224 years to run up a trillion dollars of debt held \nby foreigners. This President, in just 6 years, has more than doubled \nthat amount. Now, that is a fiscal train wreck, and this administration \nis responsible, along with his party in the House and the Senate. It is \nundeniable. They controlled things here, not the Democrats. It wasn't \nthe Democrats who ran up this debt, it was the Republicans.\n  I don't like to be partisan, but the fact is, when I hear the other \nside claim that we are going to do something, they have already done \nit. It is not a matter of projection or of conjecture; it is a matter \nof fact. That is the debt they have run up. We are left to try to clean \nup the mess.\n  How do you clean up the mess? You spend less money. That is what we \nhave tried to do here. We have controlled spending. We have a chart \nthat shows this. Here is the spending under the budget resolution. We \ngo from 20.5 percent of GDP in 2008 down to 18.8 percent of GDP in \n2012. It is by having spending discipline that we get this budget \nmoving in the right direction and we are able to balance the budget by \n2012 and we are able to stop this dramatic expansion of the debt.\n  Here is what happens. Under our resolution, the debt, as a percentage \nof the GDP--which economists say is the best way to measure it--goes \ndown each and every year after 2009. Finally, we get the debt going \ndown instead of jumping up. That is what we should do. That is what is \nso defective about the Gregg motion. If it is adopted, the budget will \nnot balance in 2012 because he has $250 billion of tax expenditures not \npaid for. So he is, once again, going to return to the bad old days of \nborrow and spend, borrow and spend, borrow and spend.\n  Look, the spending on their watch has gone up dramatically. The \nrevenue, as I have shown before, stagnated. All their revenue charts on \nwhich they talk about revenue increasing have one big problem: They \nonly show the revenue from 2004 to now. They don't show the revenue in \nthe previous years. Here is a chart here. Spending has gone up, and \nrevenue has been stagnant. Look at all their charts. They only show the \nrevenue from 2004. They want you to forget about these years. Yes, if \nyou look at 2004, revenue has gone up since then. But go back to 2000. \nQuite a different picture emerges when you give people the whole story, \nwhen you give them all the years, not just a few of the years. No, no, \nno, give them all the years, tell them all the story, give them all the \nfacts. Then you see something quite different.\n\n  We are just getting back now to the real revenue level we had 6 years \nago. Yet spending under our friends has gone up more than 40 percent. \nThe result has been to explode the debt of the United States.\n  We are going in a different direction. We are going to balance this \nbudget, but not if the motion of the Senator from New Hampshire is \nadopted. Then there will be no balance. Then we will be right back in \nthe same old deficit-and-debt ditch that we have been in for 6 years.\n  Let's climb out of that ditch. Let's stop it. If we are going to have \nspending on this war, let's pay for it. If we are going to spend money, \nas we should, to take care of our Nation's veterans, let's pay for it. \nIf we are going to have educational initiatives to assure that America \nremains the dominant force in the world, let's pay for it. If we are \ngoing to insure children in this country so that every child has health \ninsurance, and we should, let's pay for it. That is what our budget is \nabout. It is about the values of the American people.\n\n[[Page S5854]]\n\n  I can tell my colleagues, in my State, they believe if you are going \nto spend money, you ought to cover the spending and not just put it on \nthe charge card.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor. My colleague is here, and I \nunderstand there is some time left on the Republican side. I recommend \nwe use that, and then if Senator Cornyn comes, if we are out of time, I \nwill extend time to him so he has time to present his motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota. I \nalways appreciate his ability to find charts and give excellent \nexplanations. We both have degrees from the George Washington \nUniversity. My speech will not be nearly as adequate as his because I \njust have an undergraduate degree, whereas he has a graduate degree. I \nam sure that is where they covered the chartmaking. I usually don't use \nvery many charts.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I would be glad to lend some to the \nSenator.\n  Mr. ENZI. I don't think the ones the Senator has have quite the spin \non them that I prefer. That is what we do during this process of the \nbudget. I am always fascinated with the budget process anyway because \nthe President sends us a bunch of suggestions on how we ought to spend \nmoney. I know the people back in Wyoming think that is the way it is \nall going to come out.\n  In Wyoming, we have just one process, and it is called the budget \nprocess. It is really the appropriations process. When the budget is \ndone, balanced, and the money is spent, they think that is the point we \nare at right now instead of just suggestions from the President. We all \nknow that Senators are going to change, and we are the ones in charge \nof making those changes. They really don't understand that the federal \nbudget process puts in place some constraints on spending, some areas \nof spending, and some suggestions on spending that the Appropriations \nCommittee may or may not pay any attention to anyway. But discipline \ncan come from this part of the process.\n  I commend everybody on the Budget Committee for all the diligence \nthey put in to covering a variety of issues. There is some good debate \nwe have over issues, where we are, where things were, and where things \nare going.\n  I do note when the President came into office, he had no idea that \nSeptember 11 was going to happen or that Katrina was going to happen. \nBoth of those events put major dents in the budget.\n  There was also a little recession that was happening about the time \nhe took office, which is one of the reasons there is a dip in revenue. \nWe tried to figure out how to reverse that dip in revenue. If we have \nmore revenue, unfortunately, we do more spending. It really is spending \nthat is the problem.\n  It would be fascinating to see how the Democratic side of the aisle \ndeals with that situation. I have noticed quite a change in rhetoric. \nPeople at one time were talking about No Child Left Behind, how it had \na tin-cup budget. I hear those same people now saying: Yes, No Child \nLeft Behind has to have a few targeted resources to make a difference. \nThat is quite a bit different wording, and when you are in charge of \nspending it, it hits a little bit different than when you are on the \ncriticism side of the spending. I am sure those in charge will \nappreciate that as time goes by.\n  I wish to address the way the Democrats balance the budget, though. \nThis budget, as it is showing coming down to a more balanced position \nand even a little faster than what the President showed, does that \nbecause of the way the taxes are handled.\n  Without dealing with taxes at all, taxes for Americans will go up. \nThere needs to be an extension of certain tax provisions or taxes will \ngo up. When taxes go up, will that increase revenue? I don't think so. \nThat is one of the problems with which we have to deal with.\n  We found that with the tax cuts, revenue has gone up, and it has gone \nup in excess of what was projected. That means the American people are \nexcited over the ability to spend their own money for what they want to \nspend it on, and the spending of their money also results in additional \ntaxes.\n  I have a chart that shows the projections--they are in blue--and the \nactual revenue. The growth in revenue is in red. In 2004, they \nprojected a 2-percent increase and came in at 5.5 percent; 2005, 9.4 \npercent, came in at 14.6 percent; 2006, 7.3 percent, came in at 11.7 \npercent; 2007, the projection is 5.2 percent; to date it is 11.3 \npercent.\n\n  I am sure somebody else has mentioned this article earlier today, but \nthe Wall Street Journal has an editorial titled ``April Revenue \nShower.'' It says:\n\n       Here's the ``surge'' you aren't reading about: the \n     continuing flood of tax revenue into the Federal Treasury. \n     Tax receipts for April were $70 billion above the same month \n     in 2006, and April 24 marked the single biggest day of tax \n     collections in U.S. history, at $48.7 billion, according to \n     the latest Treasury report.\n\n  It goes on and explains that the IRS did process more returns than \nusual this year. Does that mean more people are paying taxes? Let me \nput up another chart. The tax cuts also resulted in additional jobs. \nThe employment expanded for 44 consecutive months, generating 7.8 \nmillion jobs. People who have jobs pay taxes. More returns, more people \nworking. I think that is one of our goals. We would like to have more \npeople working, and we would like to have people who are working make \nmore money. Then, of course, we would like them to keep a bigger \npercentage of the money they earn to spend the way they think it ought \nto be spent.\n  I mentioned there is more money coming in than what we had expected, \nthan what was projected. That does affect the deficit. The more money \nwe get beyond what was expected is a reduction in deficit, unless we \nspend it.\n  There are more ways of figuring out how to spend money around here \nthan there are ways to save money. The President has had a number of \nproposals for different programs that have been evaluated. There is a \nprocess by which we do expect different programs and agencies to set \ntheir own goals, and then to report how they did on their own goals. \nThe White House followed up on that process to see how they did on the \nreport and how they did on their own goals and found 160 programs that \nwere not doing what they said they would do. That is according to their \nown goals. He asked us to eliminate those programs.\n  We kind of did four. Now ``kind of did'' means they are still in \nexistence, and they are flat lined. It doesn't mean we eliminated what \nwas being spent on them because every program in the Federal Government \nhas a constituency. Every time, even in the President's suggested \nbudget, that he shows cutting an agency, all of us in this body have \ndozens of people come to our office to show how important that program \nis to them personally. A lot of them are the ones who work in that \nprogram. They have a job in that program, and if the program \ndisappeared, they would have to get a job somewhere else. So they are \ndefinitely involved in the program and concerned with the program and \nfeel the need to sell the program.\n  I have had experience with some of those programs in Wyoming. When \nthe President says in his budget he is going to cut a program, they \ngang up on us at home, too. One of the programs dealt with children's \npreschool education. The moms and the kids showed up, and they visited \nwith me a little bit. I asked them what they would be losing if the \nprogram went away. The answer was their daytime babysitting service.\n  The program in question was designed for an hour or two a week in \nconjunction with the parent, not with the parent absent from the \nprogram. It is a little bit of instruction on parenting education, as \nwell as child education, preschool education. This is how the goals get \na little skewed. They serve a purpose; it just doesn't happen to be the \npurpose we are funding. Probably the other purpose could be funded with \na lot less money than with the requirements we have for education.\n  It is the spending that gets us into problems. The way we are going \nto balance the budget under the Democratic budget proposal, of course, \nis to allow decreases we have had in effect because they have a limited \namount of time in place. It allows them to go up. For instance, there \nwill be an increase in taxes of 33 percent for families earning less \nthan $15,000. It cuts the child tax\n\n[[Page S5855]]\n\ncredit in half to $500. It cuts the standard deduction by $1,700 for \nmarried couples. It puts that marriage penalty back into effect.\n  For a family of four with $50,000 in earnings, the tax bill for a \nfamily of four with $50,000 in earnings would see their taxes go up 132 \npercent to $3,675 in 2011 if the President's tax relief is not made \npermanent. Those taxes will reduce take-home pay by more than 6 \npercent.\n  Let's talk about a single parent with two children and about $30,000 \nin earnings. The tax bill for a single parent with two children and \n$30,000 in earnings will see their taxes go up by 67 percent in 2011 if \nthe President's tax relief is not made permanent. Those taxes will \nreduce take-home pay by more than 4 percent.\n  So a family of four with $50,000 in earnings, their take-home pay is \nreduced by 6 percent. A single parent with two children with $30,000 in \nearnings, their take-home pay will be reduced by more than 4 percent.\n  What about the average family? What are they going to forego if the \ncurrent tax policy is not extended? Some of the tax cuts have not been \nextended to 2011.\n  I am also distressed with the way the scoring happens on taxes versus \nspending because there is a lot of assumption built into the process. \nIf they were corporate assumptions, the directors of the corporation \nwould be in a lot of trouble.\n  For the average family under the current tax policy, if it is not \nextended, they might have to forego $3,347. That could be spent on \ngroceries, or a year's worth of home heating oil and electricity. It \nwould be $2,927 or almost 2 years of gasoline for two cars, $3,196, and \nthat was before last week's increases, and, yes, we need to be \nconcerned about that issue. There are some policies that we can do that \nwill make a difference in that situation.\n  It will also mean more than a year's worth of health spending, which \nis $2,574 for the average family. Again, there needs to be some things \ndone in the health area. Most of those cost money and those will add to \nthe deficit too.\n\n  So it will be interesting to see how everyone gets around to \nbalancing the budget in whatever number of years we talk about because \nall the spending happens in the next year. We are working on the 2008 \nspending right now, but we are spending the 2007 budget that went into \neffect last October and extends until this October. So there are some \ntimelines that get into this that make it a little confusing.\n  It is wrong to balance the budget by increasing taxes on middle \nAmerica, who is feeling the squeeze. The burden is placed onto low-\nincome people. So I hope we will not balance the budget by eliminating \nthe tax relief that has been put in place by the Republicans, which \nincreased the number of jobs and brought the revenues back up.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative \nclerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I am told Senator Cornyn is on his way, \nbut I would ask my colleague, Senator Stabenow, if she would like to \ntake a few minutes at this time to address her motion and then if we \ncould have an agreement that when Senator Cornyn comes, we could \ninterrupt your presentation at a reasonable point in time and then go \nto the Cornyn motion.\n  That is the order, but I think it would be unwise for us to waste any \ntime here, given the fact we are very close to out of time. Would that \nbe acceptable?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Why don't we do that, and I thank Senator Stabenow very \nmuch for allowing us to proceed in that manner.\n\n\n                      Motion to Instruct Conferees\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I rise to offer a motion to instruct \nconferees to include section 307 of the Senate-passed budget resolution \nin the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Ms. Stabenow] moves to instruct \n     conferees on S. Con Res. 21, the concurrent resolution on \n     the budget for fiscal year 2008, to insist on including in \n     the conference report the Deficit-Neutral Reserve Fund for \n     Energy Legislation in Section 307 of S. Con. Res. 21 as it \n     passed the Senate which would provide for legislation to \n     reduce our Nation's dependence on foreign sources of \n     energy and lower gas prices.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, this provision will clear the way for \nthe Senate to pass legislation that will ultimately lower gas prices. \nThis is an issue right now of great concern, I know, to people \nthroughout Michigan and throughout the country, as we see prices going \nup and up and up. This provision does that by putting into place a \nreserve fund that will reduce our Nation's dependence on foreign \nsources of energy and expand production and use of alternative fuels \nand alternative fuel vehicles.\n  This is a very important part of the budget resolution, and I wish to \ncommend the chairman for putting aside a reserve fund so we can create \nrevenues to do a number of things that will create energy independence \nand that will create competition, frankly, for the oil companies in \nthis country so we can lower gas prices.\n  Today, in Michigan, the average price of a gallon of gas is $3.15, \nand it goes up as high as $3.24. I know it is going to go up and up. We \nare constantly hearing, of course, it is not arbitrary, that it is all \nbased on competition. Yet I will bet you that right before Memorial \nDay, in Michigan--a great tourism State, and people want to have an \nopportunity to travel and see our Great Lakes--the prices are going to \ncontinue to go up even further. This summer, again because we are a \ngreat tourism State, prices are going to go up, and they will go down \nwhen it is not a peak season for driving. We all know that this is a \nserious issue, and, frankly, it affects every single family in their \nwallet or in their pocketbook.\n  A couple years ago, I offered, successfully, a provision in the \nEnergy bill that required the Federal Trade Commission to do a study, \nan investigation into whether there was price gouging. They came back \nbasically and said there wasn't and that they didn't have the authority \nbecause we didn't define what price gouging was. I am pleased to say \nthat as a result of our presiding officer and her legislation, we can \naddress what is happening as it relates to the definition of price \ngouging, which anyone in Michigan can tell you what it is, and also to \nbe able to give the authority to the FTC to do something about it.\n  I see my colleague on the floor whom I basically jumped ahead of, so \nI think if he is ready, I will turn it over to him and will later \nproceed to talking about gas prices and how we are going to bring them \ndown and how the budget resolution lends itself to that.\n  I yield to my colleague from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n\n                      Motion to Instruct Conferees\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I send a motion to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn] moves that the \n     conferees on the part of the Senate on the disagreeing \n     votes of the two Houses on the concurrent resolution S. \n     Con. Res. 21 (the concurrent resolution on the budget for \n     fiscal year 2008) be instructed to insist that the final \n     conference report include the supermajority point of order \n     against consideration of any bill, resolution, amendment, \n     amendment between Houses, motion, or conference report \n     that includes a Federal income tax rate increase, in order \n     to protect the pocketbooks of working and middle-class \n     families, college students, seniors, farmers, small \n     business owners and entrepreneurs, and to promote the \n     elimination of government waste, fraud, and abuse to \n     reduce the deficit and offset new spending, as contained \n     in section 210 of S. Con. Res. 21, as passed by the \n     Senate.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, this motion to instruct conferees should \nsound familiar to my colleagues. This actually was an amendment to the \nbudget resolution that received 63 affirmative votes in a bipartisan \nshow of support for what I believe is a commonsense provision. This \nprovision says that before we raise income taxes, we need to have a 60-\nvote point of order to do that.\n\n[[Page S5856]]\n\n  This made so much sense that my colleague, the distinguished chairman \nof the Budget Committee, said he would be willing to accept the \namendment by voice vote, although we went ahead and had a vote. I \nthought the vote was necessary to demonstrate, and did demonstrate, the \nbroad bipartisan support for this amendment. This amendment, which was \nsection 210 of the Senate-passed budget, creates a 60-vote budget point \nof order against any legislation that raises income taxes on taxpayers, \nincluding, of course, hard-working, middle-class families, college \nstudents, entrepreneurs, and you name it.\n  As I pointed out, this was a bipartisan vote, which is an insurance \npolicy of sorts so that Congress can look and make sure any increase in \nincome taxes is justified and that it would require a vote of 60 \nSenators to overcome the budget point of order before proceeding. The \nreason I thought this was a good idea in the first place is that before \nwe look at raising taxes on hard-working American taxpayers, we ought \nto look at ways to eliminate Government waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  We all know the power to tax is the power to destroy, and, indeed, it \nis a powerful tool at Congress's disposal but one we ought to use \nadvisedly. This point of order puts in place a safeguard that will \nprotect the pocketbooks of all of us.\n  Some, though, are now advocating that we pull the rug out from under \nour economy and roll back the kind of tax relief and low taxes--\nprogrowth policies--that have resulted in an incredible blossoming and \nblooming of the American economy. The last thing we should do would be \nto throw a wet blanket over this kind of economic growth that has \ncreated so much prosperity, so much opportunity, and so many new jobs \nover the last few years.\n  The progrowth tax relief has helped this economy grow and \nparticularly in the small business sector, which has created a lot of \njobs. We should view this as a matter of great pride because it is one \nof the good things that this Congress has done in the last 4 years. \nThese progrowth tax policies are working. As a matter of fact, we have \nsome charts that demonstrate 22 straight quarters of growth and almost \n7.9 million new jobs. That is nothing to be sneezed at. There have been \nalmost 7.9 million new jobs over the past 44 consecutive months, with \n22 quarters of growth.\n  As we move forward, the last thing we should consider doing is \nreversing the policies that have helped bring about America's booming \neconomy, which has reduced the deficit by producing more money for the \nFederal Treasury and also put more money in the pockets of hard-working \nAmerican taxpayers.\n  As a matter of fact, I think we ought to take a further step and make \nthese tax relief provisions, which are set to expire unless we fail to \nact, I think we ought to make them permanent. If we don't, we will not \nonly jeopardize future economic growth but also the financial well-\nbeing of millions of Americans, all of whom will face higher tax bills \nunless we act.\n  Not making this tax relief permanent will result in a tax increase \nfor every American taxpayer. For example, a family of four, with two \nchildren, making $50,000 in annual income would see an increase of \n$2,092 in their tax bill or a 132-percent increase.\n  This point of order will not hinder our efforts to close down illegal \ntax shelters or close perceived loopholes in the IRS Code, a concern \nthat I know the chairman expressed. In the colloquy we had when the \namendment was passed, I think I was able to satisfy him that we would \nstill be able to do what we both agree needs to be done but not see a \ntax increase on American taxpayers virtually assured.\n  The point of order covers the tax tables contained in the 1040 form \nthe IRS sends to taxpayers every year. It will not hinder efforts to \noverhaul the IRS Code. I support efforts to overhaul the IRS Code by \nmaking it fairer, flatter, and simpler. Any tax simplification and \nreform efforts will need bipartisan support in the Senate, so I ask my \ncolleagues to support my motion to instruct the conferees to include \nthe point of order against raising income taxes on hard-working \ntaxpayers through the budget conference committee.\n  I might add, in closing, I have had conversations with the \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee. I know he has concerns \nas a result of conversations he has had with the Parliamentarian. There \nhas been some suggestion that to include this provision in the \nconference report would render the conference report unprivileged. I \nbelieve there was demonstration of broad bipartisan support for this \nprovision, which enjoyed a 63-to-35 vote on the Senate floor. While I \ncertainly understand the budget chairman's desire to maintain a special \nprivileged status for the budget resolution, I think in this case it \nwould be warranted.\n  Including this provision will act as an insurance policy against \nundesirable and unnecessary tax increases, especially until such time \nas we do our dead level best to reduce the waste, fraud, and abuse \nthat, unfortunately, is present in Government today and to try to save \nmoney there before we begin raising taxes. It is particularly important \nbecause we have this silent tax increase that is, unfortunately, \nincluded in this framework that will now occur if we do nothing. This \nwill be the only tax increase I am aware of that will actually happen \nif we fail to act, but that is what, unfortunately, we are on course to \ndo with this budget resolution.\n  So I would respectfully ask my colleagues to support the motion to \ninstruct conferees on this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, let me first thank my colleague for his \nservice on the Budget Committee. He has been a valuable member there. \nWe do not always agree, but he has been a very constructive member of \nthe Budget Committee. He comes with a point of view and he does his \nhomework. All of us appreciate that, I and the other members of the \ncommittee. I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  Let me say it would be fine with me that we adopt this motion because \nthere is no contemplation in this budget resolution of a tax rate \nincrease. There just is not. I want to make that clear.\n  We do have a problem. I want to be very direct with colleagues. This \nmotion will not survive the conference committee. It will not. It has \nnothing to do with its merits. It has to do with the procedural \nramifications of bringing this back from the conference. We have been \ninformed by the Parliamentarian, if the conference agreement reflects \nthis motion, the budget resolution would be in danger of losing its \nprivileged status on the floor. That would be a very serious matter for \nall of us. That would be a serious matter for this institution.\n  We have a hard enough time getting a budget. If it were to lose its \nprivileged status on the floor, I suggest to my colleague, we would \nnever reach conclusion on a budget. That is in none of our interests. \nIt is not in the interests of the country, it is not in the interests \nof the Senate, it is not in the interests of the House.\n  I regret that is the reality we confront, but it is. I don't want \nanybody to be under any misapprehension about that. It is fine with me \nif we adopt that as an instruction to the conferees because it reflects \nthe will of the Senate. We voted very clearly: 63 votes, as the Senator \nhas indicated.\n  I say to my colleagues, there is absolutely no intention in this \nbudget of increasing tax rates, which is what the Senator is trying to \nguard against. But I do have to emphasize if we were to bring it back \nfrom conference, we have been informed that would put at risk the \nprivileged nature of the budget resolution, and we simply cannot do \nthat. If we did that, we truly will never agree on a budget here.\n  Does the Senator seek more time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, if I can respond briefly to the \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, I appreciate his \nwillingness to take this motion to instruct because he said it will not \nsurvive; it will not see the light of day; it is going to be killed in \nthe dark recesses of the conference committee room.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Even in the lighted room.\n  Mr. CORNYN. So it is a very strange process we are engaged in here. I \nrespect the distinguished chairman, but I\n\n[[Page S5857]]\n\nremind him, at the time we voted on this, to quote him, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee said, ``It certainly \nwill not do any damage to this resolution if it were to pass.''\n  I understand there was a subsequent conversation with the \nParliamentarian that raised this issue. But I suggest in most \nproceedings that I am familiar with, there is some notion of waiver, \nthat you have a responsibility to speak early, rather than to create a \nfalse impression that we are going to do something here to keep taxes \nlow, to create a 60-vote budget point of order, rather than lay low and \nthen raise an issue late in the game that could have been raised and \naddressed earlier.\n  None of that is to impute any bad faith to the distinguished chairman \nof the Budget Committee. It is just to say this is a very strange \nprocess, one I think the American people, anybody who happens to be \nlistening or watching, would say: This must be a Washington, DC \nphenomenon where we suspend reality, we accept amendments by a \nbipartisan vote and now a motion to instruct, only to ignore them even \nthough they represent the will of the Senate. I think that does not \nenhance the image of the Senate or the Congress in the eyes of the \nAmerican people. The fact is, if we do raise taxes, it will be like a \nwet blanket on the American economy.\n  I want to allude briefly to an article that was in the Wall Street \nJournal today that I think demonstrates my point. It is entitled \n``April Revenue Shower.'' It says:\n\n       Tax receipts for April were $70 billion above the same \n     month in 2006, and April 24 marked the single biggest day of \n     tax collections in U.S. history, at $48.7 billion.\n\n  It is the low taxes and the progrowth policies that this Federal \nGovernment has embraced since roughly August of 2003 which has \ngenerated the economic activity which has resulted in a windfall to the \nTreasury. As a matter of fact, this article goes on to say:\n\n       The deficit this year could tumble to $150 billion, or an \n     economically trivial 1 percent of GDP.\n\n  That is the kind of benefit--one of the kinds of benefits--I think \nlow taxes have produced. I think it would be a crying shame to raise \ntaxes and jeopardize job growth and economic development in this \ncountry.\n  I understand what the Senator says, that he doesn't intend that there \nis going to be a tax increase, but we have seen proposals for dramatic \nincreases in spending. The money has to come from somewhere. We have \nadopted a pay-as-you-go provision which has a built-in bias against tax \ncuts because it says before you can have a tax cut, you are going to \nhave to have some way to balance it out, a revenue raiser, which means \nin the end we are going to see a dramatic increase in taxes, whether--\nand I take him at his word that is not his intention. But we are on a \ndangerous course to seeing a huge tax increase, perhaps one of the \nbiggest in our Nation's history. That, I believe, is against the best \ninterests of the American people in this big economy.\n  I accept what the Senator has to say. He is willing to accept my \nmotion to instruct, but it will not be to any effect. It will be \nignored. I guess that is the way it is. But I think the American \npeople, and particularly the hard-working taxpayers, are the losers. I \nthink that is a shame.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, let me say to the Senator, I know he \ndoesn't intend to impugn my motives. I hope that impression hasn't been \nleft, because I operated in absolute good faith in the committee. I \ntold him his motion would do no harm because there was no intention of \nincreasing rates in this budget resolution. There truly is not.\n  I only learned subsequent to that that there was a procedural \nproblem. As soon as I learned, I think the Senator will acknowledge, I \ncame to him on the floor, some weeks ago, and told him of what we had \nlearned and urged him to send his staff to the Parliamentarian to \nverify that what I was saying was in fact the case. I have been in \ncommunication with him subsequent to that, to confirm that he had heard \nthe same thing. In fact, he told me that on the floor late this \nafternoon.\n  I regret that I told him it would do no harm. I absolutely believed \nthat was the case when I told the Senator that. It was only \nsubsequently that I learned from my staff that the Parliamentarian \nadvised us of that. I should have known it. In the back of my mind I \nwas worried about the Budget Committee overstepping its bounds.\n  It is very important for people to understand, we tell the Finance \nCommittee how much money to raise. We do not have the authority to tell \nthem how. Unfortunately, the motion of the Senator crosses that line.\n  We tell the Appropriations Committee how much money they have to \nspend. We do not have the authority to tell them how to spend it. If we \nexceed our authority, there are consequences.\n  I must say I was concerned at the time of the Senator's amendment in \nthe committee that maybe we were crossing that line, and in fact it \nturns out we were. That is the fact of the matter. That is what we \nconfront here. I say to the Senator, I hope he would acknowledge I have \ntried to communicate with him, as soon as I knew it, that these are the \nfacts we confront.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I said it once and I will say it again. The distinguished \nchairman of the Budget Committee, I am confident, is shooting as \nstraight as he could possibly do with me. I do not question his motive \nor his actions. I express my profound regret that an amendment that \nreflects the will of 63 Senators, that is bipartisan, and one that is \nso important to maintaining the prosperity of this Nation and relieving \nthe burden on hard-working American taxpayers will not see the light of \nday in this budget resolution. I am expressing my regret to him. But he \nhas been nothing but straight to me.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I thank the Senator very much for that. \nI say I have so many regrets, as we go through this budget process, \nthat we do not have authority that one might assume the Budget \nCommittee does. But we simply do not. We are in this role of telling \nthe Finance Committee how much money to raise, but we cannot tell them \nhow to do it. We tell the appropriators how much money they spend, but \nwe do not have the authority, as much as we might like it, to tell them \nhow to spend it. If we cross that line, there are real consequences.\n  In any event, I very much appreciate the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I express my support for the efforts of \nthe Senator from Texas. I understand the parliamentary situation. It \nhas been ruled that if his amendment were accepted and finds it way \nthrough the entire process--it is going be accepted, but if it were to \ncome back, it would put in jeopardy the privileged status of the budget \nand that is obviously not appropriate.\n  But the fact is this amendment highlights an essential point. Even \nthough it may not come back, it is important that we be on record as \nhaving supported it, as the 63 people did, and as we will be when we \nadopt this amendment in this motion to instruct, because it makes the \nstatement, which the Senator from North Dakota has agreed with, that \nrates should not be increased.\n  Unfortunately, the structure of this budget, in my humble opinion, \nmilitates toward increasing rates. I do not see how it does anything \nelse in the final analysis. That, of course, is why I have offered my \nown motion to instruct here, so the rates will not be increased, or at \nleast we will have that statement.\n  But I think the Senator from Texas has hit the nub of the issue, \nwhich is we should not be increasing tax rates on the American people. \nNo matter what the structure of this budget is when it comes back, even \nif it doesn't have this language, there will be a pretty clear \nstatement by this Senate that rates should not be increased, and should \nat some point down the road there be a bill brought to the floor, which \nwill be, I am afraid, reflective of the priorities of this budget, \nwhich does increase rates--or fails to maintain the rates which are \npresently in place and thus in the alternative is increasing rates--we \ncan turn to the excellent amendment of the Senator from Texas and say \nthat was not the position of this Senate. The position of the Senate \nwas that would not happen.\n\n[[Page S5858]]\n\n  I think his amendment, even if it may not return from conference \nbecause of the effect it would have on the privileged status of the \nbudget resolution, is still a very effective statement and one that \nneeds to be made.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, would it be appropriate at this moment \nto take the motion of the Senator?\n  Madam President, could we then consider the Cornyn motion on a voice \nvote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time is yielded back, the question will \nbe put on the motion.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We yield back our time on this side.\n  Mr. CORNYN. We likewise yield back our time on this motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time is yielded back, the question is \non agreeing to the motion.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I have a question. The yielding back \nis time on this motion only?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes. We would not be yielding the good Senator's time.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time is yielded back, the question is \non agreeing to the motion.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would ask if we could have a report on the time \nremaining on the motion of the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sponsor of the motion has 27 minutes \nremaining, and the opposition has 30 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We have a problem. We have less time left than time \nallocated because the vote has been set at 7:30. So we will try to be \nreasonable so that both sides have a fair shot at the remaining time.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that on the motion of the \nSenator from Michigan, we divide the remaining time 15 minutes apiece \nbefore the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, first, following the debate we have \njust been engaged in, let me say that I am very proud of this budget \nresolution because we are not only not raising taxes, but we are \nfocused on lowering taxes, tax cuts for the middle class. That is what \nI am most proud of in this budget. Our budget is focused on middle-\nclass families, what families need who are feeling the crunch at every \nturn right now in their lives. So we specifically focus on tax cuts for \nmiddle-class families.\n  We also focus on what I want to talk about now as it relates to the \nmotion to instruct; that is, an energy reserve fund that puts in place \na set of policies and allows us to move forward to lower gas prices. I \nmean, ultimately, that is what it is about. Let's get off of foreign \noil. Let's become energy independent. Let's focus on alternatives.\n  We have a whole range of things we can and should do together, but \nthe bottom line is what people are asking me about right now in \nMichigan is why in the world gas prices today are $3.15 per gallon on \naverage. They ask it in the context of another very important question; \nthat is, since this President, President Bush, has taken office, gas \nprices in my State have increased by $1.75 per gallon--$1.75 per \ngallon, an increase of 123 percent. This is according to the Federal \nHighway Administration. Right now in Michigan, families, businesses, \nfarmers will spend $789 million more this month than they did in \nJanuary of 2001. That is according to the Department of Energy motor \ngasoline consumption, price, and expenditures.\n  Now, what is happening, though? What is wrong with this picture? \nWhile I have been seeing my constituents, and I know the Chair shares \nthis concern, that while we see these prices going up, what has \nhappened on the other side with the oil companies? Well, last year, \nExxonMobil had $39.5 billion in profits, the largest annual corporate \nprofit in U.S. history, the largest corporate profit in U.S. history, \nwhile the people in my State--the farmer planting in the fields, the \nbusinesspeople who are doing their jobs, the families, the folks going \nback and forth to work, taking the kids to childcare, the students \ntrying to go back and forth to school--saw their gas prices go up.\n  In fact, they will go up higher right before Memorial Day. I will bet \nyou they are going to go up higher in a beautiful State like Michigan, \nwhere we want everyone to come in and swim in our Great Lakes and boat \nand fish and enjoy what is beautiful about Michigan. When the tourism \nseason comes--you can count it on your watch--gas prices are going to \ngo up.\n  We hear all about how there is competition when, in fact, we know \nthere is not competition. When you are driving down the road, this gas \nstation says one thing and the one on the other side says the same \nthing.\n  Now, this has to stop. We are seeing, not only last year--I am \nspeaking about ExxonMobil, but let me just say there are others. \nChevron had an 18-percent increase in the first quarter this year--an \n18-percent increase. But we are seeing with Exxon that they kicked off \na 10-percent rise in profits, the best ever first quarter, ever, in net \nprofit. To put it another way, with Exxon, their take-home pay equals \n$1,080 every time the second hand ticks on your clock--every second, \n$1,080--while the folks in Michigan today are paying $3.15. If you \nhappen to be up north, it is $3.24. This is not right. I know you agree \nwith this. This is not right.\n  There are a number of things we need to do about it. In the short \nrun, we need to make sure the Federal Trade Commission has the \nauthority--and understands that we expect them to use it--to define \nprice gouging.\n  Now, in the Energy bill that passed in 2005, a requirement that I \noffered was put into the Energy bill that the FTC had to investigate \nprice gouging. They came back and said they did not have the authority, \nwe had not defined what it was. They made some general statements that \nreally did not reflect what was going on. So now I am very pleased that \nSenator Cantwell from Washington State and others have introduced \nlegislation that will clearly define what price gouging is, although I \nhave to say, after years and years of witnessing it, if it walks like a \nduck and quacks like a duck, I think most people in Michigan, anyway, \nwould call it a duck. So we find ourselves in a situation where the FTC \nsays they do not have the authority or the definitions to use. So we \nwant to give them that. We want to give them that in the short run to \nmake sure they can address what is clearly an unfair situation.\n  Families are seeing increases on all sides, not just gas prices; it \nis the cost of college; it is the costs that relate to health care in \nmy State. In fact, I should just remind folks that when we hear about \nall of the rosy pictures in the last 6 years, we have lost 3 million \nmanufacturing jobs since this President has taken office--3 million. \nThose were good-paying jobs with health care and pensions, and those \nfamilies now, those workers, are out working other kinds of jobs. Maybe \nit is two jobs now to try to make up that salary or maybe it is three \njobs. They are paying more for health care, if they have it, and \nworrying about whether they will have their pension.\n\n  So that is the backdrop to what I see now happening as it relates to \ngas prices. One more time, people see those prices going up as they are \ntrying to get to work, as they are trying to take care of their \nfamilies. This motion to instruct focuses on the fact that we have put \naside a reserve fund that gives us the opportunity to address it \nthroughout the budget.\n  In addition to the fact that we have legislation to stop price \ngouging right away, and that is very important, I am very pleased our \nmajority is focused on going after those who are price gouging and \nbringing down gas prices, but we also know we have to look more long \nterm.\n  There is some wonderful work being done in the Senate by our Energy \nCommittee, Environment Committee, and Finance and Agriculture \nCommittees as it relates to the farm bill and what can be done with \nalternative fuels, and so on. We are committed to that as well. The \nstructure of this budget allows us to be able to do those things \nwithout procedural motions and hoops getting in the way to stop us from \ngoing forward. We all know we need to invest more in ethanol and \ncellulosic ethanol and biodiesel. We want to be\n\n[[Page S5859]]\n\nable to say: Buy your fuel from Middle America, not the Middle East. \nThat is what I am hoping. I know we are committed to doing that.\n  We also know there is much we can do to together, and, in fact, there \nare many exiting things that are already happening. I am very proud of \nour American domestic auto companies that are moving very aggressively. \nIn less than 5 years, we expect that our alternative-fuel vehicles will \nconstitute more than 50 percent of the vehicles that are being \nproduced. That is very positive. I commend them for that.\n  GM has installed displacement-on-demand technology where the \ncylinders shut off when not needed, consuming less fuel. \nDaimlerChrysler has taken the lead on clean diesel and biodiesel. There \nis excellent work being done in Michigan. Next Energy and other \ncritical research organizations are doing excellent work that would \ndeliver 20 percent to 40 percent more fuel efficiency than conventional \nautomobiles. The Ford Escape hybrid and the work that is being done \nthrough hybrids is very significant. Our plug-in hybrids, technology we \nsee being worked on that relates to plug-in electric vehicles, and so \non, that is so important. I am excited about the Volt by GM, which will \nbe configured in a way that it will be able to run on electricity, \ngasoline, E85, or biodiesel. The work goes on on hydrogen and other \nkinds of things.\n  But we know that in the end, in addition to focusing on these long-\nterm strategies which are very significant, very important to the \nenvironment, to address climate change, to address energy independence, \nwe have an issue right now we have to address; that is, the fact that \nwe continue to see, quarter by quarter, record profits by the oil \ncompanies because of the lack of competition. We are seeing, quarter by \nquarter, increases that end up with those increases and profits, that \ndo not cause them to lower prices for people. They are making more \ndollars. They do not lower the price. The price goes up as the profits \ngo up.\n  More and more of our families, our workers, our businesses are \nfeeling squeezed on all sides. We have to make sure the FTC has the \nability to call price gouging for what it is, that it is defined and \nthey are given the authority to do something about it.\n  The American people, unfortunately, are forced to be in a situation \nright now of choosing between stations and pumps where the prices look \nawfully much the same. We need to create more competition. We are going \nto do that in the long run. We are going to create competition in the \nshort run. We need to start putting consumers first, our consumers \nfirst. That is what we do in this budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey.) The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sponsor has 3 minutes 4 seconds; the \nSenator from New Hampshire has 14 minutes 30 seconds.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let me say that we expect to accept this \namendment. The issue of energy and its cost in this country is a pretty \ncomplex issue. It is not simple. There is no magic wand to resolve it. \nObviously, the things which the Senator mentioned--alternative-fuel \ncars, lowering consumption, renewables--these are all a big part of the \nenergy resolution. But it is a complex matrix.\n  One of the essences of it, which was not mentioned, is supply. The \nfact is that the world demand for energy has increased dramatically, \nespecially as China and Southeast Asian countries have begun to have \nvery robust economies. The demand for the supply is such that the price \nof oil has increased dramatically.\n  We in this country are going to have to accept the fact that we are \ngoing to have to look for other sources of energy. I regret that in the \npast domestic supply has been curtailed. For example, the opportunity \nto get supply from the northwest slope of Alaska or the opportunity to \nsearch for potential supply States which are willing to accept having \noil exploration off their coasts--all of these opportunities to get \nmore supply are being resisted, especially from the other side of the \naisle. Yet this has to be part of the equation of how we resolve the \nenergy issue. There is more than one element to the formula of \nresolution.\n  The bottom line is that we should do everything we can to get off of \nour dependance, as much as possible, on foreign sources of oil. We find \nourselves purchasing oil from countries which have antipathy toward us \nand which create problems for us.\n  It would be good if we could supply the oil domestically or at least \nwithin the Western Hemisphere and not have to go beyond the Western \nHemisphere in the manner we do. Another proposal is to get ethanol \nbrought to the east coast out of Brazil. There is a 24-percent tariff \non that ethanol. The last time we tried to repeal that tariff, it was \nopposed, opposed on both sides of the aisle but especially from the \nother side of the aisle. So there are a lot of different elements to \nthe matrix of how we resolve the energy problem. I certainly am able to \nsupport the Senator's motion, but I don't think the answer is simply \none or two items. It is a long list of items.\n  On the underlying bill, there is still this fundamental issue, which \nis going to be raised by three of the motions that were offered, of the \neffect on revenues and tax policy on the American wage earner of this \nbudget. There has been a lot of representation, a lot of numbers thrown \nout. The bottom line is pretty simple. Beginning in the year 2010, a \nnumber of tax rates which benefit Americans who create jobs and take \nrisks and especially benefit senior citizens who live on fixed incomes, \nbenefit people who have gone out and been entrepreneurs and created \njobs, benefit people who have fixed incomes because they are living off \nof dividends to a large degree and they are retired, a number of these \nrate structures are going to expire, and the cost to those people who \nbenefit from that rate structure is going to go up dramatically. Of \ncourse, it is always characterized by the other side that this is just \na benefit to the wealthy. It is not.\n  More than 75 percent of those who claim dividend and capital gains \nincome earn less than $100,000. Yet under this budget, their taxes will \ndouble on those dividends and capital gains income. Thirty percent of \ntax-paying seniors claim capital gains income, and more than 50 percent \nof tax-paying seniors claim dividends income. Almost all those seniors \nare living on a fixed income. They are not extremely wealthy. They just \nhappen to be at a point in their life where they are cashing in their \nassets in order to live. They have capital gains as a result. They sell \ntheir home. They sell their stock. Yet under this budget, their taxes \nare going to double on those items. In fact, dividend income accounts \nfor 11 percent of the total income of seniors who earn less than \n$30,000 and 14 percent of the earnings of those who earn $30 to \n$50,000. For moderate-income seniors, they are dependent on a dividend \nin many instances.\n  That is not unusual. Our society encourages people to invest in the \nstock market. Even though we have heard about the gloomy economic \nsituation in this country, while we have added 7.4 million jobs and \nhave had 22 quarters of recovery and we have had tax revenues exceeding \nhistoric levels, the stock market is now at a historic high and \ncontinues to go up. Obviously, some people don't think it is all that \ngloomy. The fact is, a lot of seniors throughout their earning career \ninvest, either through an IRA account or a pension account. They invest \nin assets which are now subject to the benefit of a capital gains and \ndividends rate, which is very helpful to them in making ends meet \nbecause it is a fair rate. Yet those people's taxes are going to go up \nunder this budget.\n  Fifteen million seniors would see their taxes increased if the \ncurrent tax policy is not extended. This budget makes no room for the \nextension of the capital gains or dividend tax rate. That is an \nimportant point to remember. Equally important is the underlying \nphilosophical difference. There is a belief on the other side that the \nGovernment should be able to take more money out of people's pockets \nand decide how to spend it. That is why the discretionary spending in \nthis budget is significantly over the President's level, $18 billion in \nthe first year of the budget. It is why there is no effort in this\n\n[[Page S5860]]\n\nbudget at all to discipline entitlement spending, which is clearly the \nmost serious issue we face as an economy and as a society after the \nthreat of Islamic terrorism, the problem of confronting the baby boom \ngeneration and the demands it will put on our society economically, to \nsay nothing of the social change of having the largest retired \npopulation in the history of the country.\n  There is no attempt at all to get into that issue of how we are going \nto handle this fiscal meltdown we are facing if we don't address the \nimpending retirement of the baby boom generation.\n  Those philosophical differences are very large. What we have tried to \ndo through the motion to instruct is to highlight those differences, \nthe fact that we believe these tax rates which benefit so many \nAmericans should be extended, that we do not believe the spending \nshould be increased well above the proposal of the President--and the \nPresident was rather generous, to say the least, in his increase in \ndiscretionary spending.\n  We also believe there should be an effort made to address expansion \nof entitlement spending, which is going to be a function of the \nretirement of the baby boom generation, and the fact that will simply \noverwhelm our capacity to support those programs in their present form, \nand our children and our children's children will be put in a position \nof having to pay so much in increased costs for the burden of the \nGovernment that they will be unable to benefit from the good life we \nhave benefited from. They will have trouble sending their children to \ncollege, buying their first home, doing the discretionary things people \nwant to be able to do with discretionary money because most of that \ndiscretionary money will have to be used to support the entitlement \nprograms to support the retired baby boom generation which will double \nthe number of people retired in this country. None of that is addressed \nin this budget. We think that is a failure that is unfortunate.\n  These are some of the concerns that remain at this time. However, I \nwould be happy to ask unanimous consent that the motion of the Senator \nfrom Michigan be accepted and that the time remaining be divided \nbetween myself and the Senator from North Dakota so he can get some \nmore time to respond to my comments which I am sure he will want to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back on this particular \nmotion to instruct?\n  If so, the question is agreeing to the Stabenow motion.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. GREGG. Did we also agree that the time between now and 7:30 would \nbe equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me indicate, on the motion just \nadopted, the strategy in the reserve fund is not just one item, as the \nSenator referenced, but involves all of these things--expanding \nproduction and use of alternative fuels and alternative-fuel vehicles \nto promote renewable energy development, to improve electricity \ntransmission, to encourage responsible development of domestic oil and \nnatural gas resources, and to reward conservation and efficiency. There \nis a production component of what is in the reserve fund. I want to \nemphasize that and thank the Senator from Michigan for her constructive \nproposal.\n  I also want to take a moment to respond to a number of points made by \nmy colleague from New Hampshire. Once again, there is no tax increase \nin this proposal. The fact is, what the President said his budget would \nproduce in revenue is virtually identical to what is in this budget. In \nfact, there is virtually no difference between what the President said \nhis budget would produce in revenue over the 5 years. He said his \nbudget would produce $14.826 trillion of revenue. My budget produces \n$14.827 trillion of revenue, virtually no change. If you look at a CBO \nbasis, there is a 2-percent difference. We believe that can be easily \naccommodated with no tax increase by going after the tax gap, by going \nafter abusive tax havens and fraudulent tax shelters.\n  When the Senator asserts there is no long-term savings, that is not \naccurate. We have $15 billion of Medicare savings, and we have a \nreserve fund on health information technology and other health savings. \nJust on health information technology, the Rand Corporation estimates \nthat if that were employed, we would save $81 billion a year. We also \nhave another health care reserve fund that relates to looking at best \npractices around the country so that we can ensure savings in the \nhealth care accounts in that way and many other proposals to address \nthe long-term fundamental imbalances we have.\n  We all understand the only way those long-term entitlement challenges \nare going to be fully addressed is in a bipartisan approach outside a \n5-year budget resolution because those are much longer term challenges.\n  How much time do we have on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank all my colleagues for \nparticipating in this debate. These instructions to the conferees will \nhave attention paid to them, and we will do our level best to bring \nback a budget that will reflect the will of this body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes 25 seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, of course, there is a lot of back and \nforth. So many numbers are thrown out, nobody can keep up. The $15 \nbillion in Medicare savings is a nice number. The only problem is, it \nis coupled with about $30 billion of new spending in the SCHIP program \nand, as a result, it is a net loss. So the long-term savings are not \nthere. In fact, they are a long-term cost. Of course, the health care \nproposals, if they score, that would be great, but they don't score. So \nwhen you throw out a number of $81 billion, you are throwing out a \nnumber that CBO won't support. If it did support it, we would \nimmediately capture those funds and use them constructively to reduce \nthe deficit or to give people a tax benefit. As a practical matter, \nthey don't score so the number is not relevant.\n  I want to speak quickly to the Senator's response to my motion. My \nmotion says: These tax reductions which are very important, which \naddress issues which are important to the American people and which are \nnot covered by the proposal which we have before us, unfortunately, \nneed to be continued. These tax reductions cover the $1,000 child \ncredit, the marriage penalty, the 10-percent income tax bracket, all of \nwhich the Senator has said are going to be picked up by the Baucus \namendment--maybe, maybe not--the lower marginal rates, definitely not. \nThe earned-income tax credit relief for military families does not \nappear to be in here. The adoption tax credit is not in here. The \ndependent care tax credit is not in here. The college tuition deduction \nfor student loan interest for $2,000, Coverdale IRA, and the 15-percent \nrate on capital gains and dividends, which as I just went through, is \nvery critical to seniors and to the economy generally and has been a \nhuge revenue windfall for us as a government, and adjusting the death \ntax so that it properly reflects fairness to small businessmen and \nfarmers, those are not in here.\n  All of those are not in the proposal of the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  In addition, there is the operative language of the Senator's \nproposal which essentially is the fig leaf or the Wizard of Oz approach \nwhich says we are going to get this money from somewhere--we really \ndon't know where, the tax gap or some building in the Cayman Islands--\nwhen, in fact, the practical effect is, you are going to have to raise \ntaxes on the American people to accomplish what the Senator from North \nDakota is proposing with his motion.\n  That is why I will be opposing this. I suspect some of my colleagues \nwill support it because obviously the Baucus language makes sense, \nalthough it doesn't go far enough.\n  In light of that, I guess the time is probably used up, isn't it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is.\n  The Senator from North Dakota has 10 seconds.\n\n[[Page S5861]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to correct the record and \nindicate the motion I have offered, and which supports the underlying \nresolution, does contain the adoption tax credit, does include the \ndependent care tax credit, does include the $1,000 child tax credit, \nthe marriage penalty relief, the 10-percent income tax bracket and \nestate tax reform. So it is all in there.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining? I don't \nhave 10 seconds? I could fit everything into it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motions be voted in \nthe following order and that the provisions relating to debate--I guess \nthis is something you ask, I say to the Senator. It was just handed to \nme. You ask that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I thank him for his \ngood humor and for working through this as we have proceeded to be \nready to vote.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motions be voted in \nthe following order and that the provisions relating to debate time and \nvote time limitation remain in effect: the Kyl motion to instruct \nregarding estate tax, the Conrad motion to instruct regarding certain \ntax cuts, the Gregg motion to instruct regarding certain tax cuts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, when I indicated that the vote time \nlimitation remain in effect, I think we should probably send that \nsignal to our colleagues. There will be 2 minutes equally divided on \neach of the motions, and after the first vote, the next two votes will \nbe 10-minute votes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nto ask for the yeas and nays on the Kyl motion and all the other \nmotions.\n  Mr. CONRAD. All three motions?\n  Mr. GREGG. All three motions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on all the \nmotions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided on the motion to instruct conferees \noffered by the Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we have in the resolution estate tax \nreform. Mr. President, $3.5 million a person, $7 million a couple is \ncompletely exempt from any estate taxation. That will exempt 99.8 \npercent of the estates, and it is paid for. The Kyl motion is not paid \nfor, would blow a hole in the deficit, would take us back to a failure \nto balance the budget.\n  I hope our colleagues will support what is in the resolution, what \npassed the Senate and which does reform the estate tax but does so in a \nfiscally responsible way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the Kyl motion is a bipartisan proposal, or \nat least it was. Actually, the original language came from the Senator \nfrom Louisiana. It basically sets a rate of 35 percent--the proposal of \nthe Senator from North Dakota sets a top rate of 45 percent--it sets \nthat rate on estates, and on small estates and small businesses it sets \na lower rate. It exempts estates of $5 million or less. It is an \nextremely reasonable approach to the death tax.\n  People should not be taxed because they die, to begin with. But if we \nare going to tax them, let's not put them out of business. Let's allow \nfamilies with small businesses to survive. That is what the Kyl motion \ndoes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back on the motion?\n  If so, the question is on agreeing to the Kyl motion to instruct \nconferees. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, it is timely for me to make \nthese remarks because there has been a conversation that has occurred \nin Kansas today between the Governor of Kansas and the President of the \nUnited States over the question of the adequacy of the National Guard \nand its equipment.\n  The reason I am making these remarks is that this Senator from \nFlorida has sounded this alarm bell several weeks ago on the basis of a \nGAO report of the inadequacy of the equipment of the National Guard in \neach of the States. In my State of Florida, the GAO report says they \nonly have 53 percent of their equipment. In the State of New Mexico, \nthey only have 33 percent of their equipment. You now heard the \ncommentary from both the Governor of Kansas, as well as the head of the \nNational Guard, the adjutant general of Kansas, who state they are \nshort of equipment.\n  I can tell you that, in Florida, we are 500 humvees short. We are 600 \ntrucks short--that is both 5 ton and deuce and a half. We are 4,400 \nnight vision goggles short. Why I am saying this today as a follow-on \nto sounding this alarm several weeks ago is we are not far from June 1, \nwhich is the beginning of hurricane season. The Florida National Guard \nis the best trained as a National Guard but especially so for taking \ncare of the aftermath of a hurricane. If we only have category 1, 2, \nand 3 hurricanes, the Guard tells me they have the equipment. But if \nthe big one hits--the big one being a category 4 or 5 hitting from the \nwater--a highly densely urbanized area of the coast, they will be \nshort. Then the Guard would rely on their compact with other Guard \nunits to supply equipment.\n  For example, Pennsylvania is one of those States in the compact. But \nPennsylvania is short of equipment as well. We are trying to put \nadditional appropriations in this war funding bill for equipment for \nour National Guard units, but as Lieutenant General Blum, the head of \nthe National Guard for the country, said, they are $40 billion short of \nequipment. I will read you a statement from the Florida National Guard \nin case there is any doubt in anybody's mind:\n\n       It is true that we are short of equipment. We need these \n     pieces of equipment to speed up our response to local \n     emergencies and to help save lives.\n\n  And he continues:\n\n       They can draw on these additional units and equipment \n     through that compact.\n\n[[Page S5863]]\n\n       But in the case of a major hurricane--\n\n  And I continue to quote the Florida National Guard--\n\n     we plan to have these other assets prepositioned prior to \n     landfall or moving to Florida as soon as possible. However, \n     we cannot afford any additional significant losses of \n     equipment. Losing more equipment from Florida to support our \n     active duty mobilization sites will put us at risk to respond \n     effectively to our State during a time of great need.\n\n  We have to be serious all over this country about the equipment needs \nfor our National Guard when it is called on to respond to that aspect \nof their job, which is to be activated by the Governor of the \nrespective States under statewide emergencies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/09/senate-section/article/S5863-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5863]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                   captain jonathan david grassbaugh\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay special tribute to U.S. \nArmy Ranger CPT Jonathan David Grassbaugh of Hampstead, NH. Sadly on \nApril 7, 2007, while supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom, this brave 25-\nyear old leader and three of his fellow soldiers gave their lives for \nour Nation when an improvised explosive device detonated near their \npatrol in Zaganiyah, Iraq. Captain Grassbaugh was assigned to \nHeadquarters and Headquarters Troop, 5th Squadron, 73rd Cavalry \nRegiment, 82nd Airborne Division, out of Fort Bragg, NC, and was \nprotecting our country in his second deployment to Iraq.\n  Jonathan, or Jon to family and friends, was born in Ohio, but his \nfamily moved to Hampstead, NH, when he was in the third grade. He \nattended Hampstead Central School, graduated from Hampstead Middle \nSchool, where his mother Patricia is principal, went on to Phillips \nExeter Academy, where he was a 4 year honor student, and then to Johns \nHopkins University, where he studied computer science, graduating in \n2003. While at Johns Hopkins University he was a distinguished member \nof the Army ROTC program and Pershing Rifles, served as captain of the \nRanger Challenge Team, commanded the ROTC Battalion during his senior \nyear and won the National two-man duet drill team competition.\n  Following completion of the arduous U.S. Army Ranger School in April \n2004, Captain Grassbaugh was assigned to the 7th Cavalry in the \nRepublic of South Korea. He was later assigned to the 3rd Battalion, \n505th Parachute Infantry Regiment where he assumed another leadership \nposition serving as an antitank platoon leader. Jon also served as an \naide de camp for the 82nd Airborne deputy commanding general, scout \nplatoon leader, and logistics officer for the 5th Squadron, 73rd \nCavalry. In July of 2006, he was deployed for a second tour of duty in \nIraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Friends say Jon was laser \nfocused, never questioned his service or his need to be in Iraq, cared \ndeeply for the soldiers in his command, and always put a 110 percent \neffort into everything.\n  Captain Grassbaugh's awards and decorations serve as testimony to his \nstellar character and performance. They include the Bronze Star Medal, \nPurple Heart, Meritorious Service Medal, Army Commendation Medal, 4 Oak \nLeaf Clusters, Joint Service Achievement Medal, Army Achievement Medal, \nNational Defense Service Medal, Iraq Campaign Medal, Global War on \nTerrorism Service Medal, Korean Defense Service Medal, Army Service \nRibbon, Overseas Service Ribbon, Parachutist's Badge, Combat Action \nBadge, and the Ranger Tab.\n  Patriots from the State of New Hampshire have served our Nation with \nhonor and distinction from Bunker Hill to Zaganiyah, Iraq--and U.S. \nArmy Ranger CPT Jonathan Grassbaugh served, led, and fought in that \nsame fine tradition.\n  My sympathy, condolences, and prayers go out to Jon's wife Jenna, his \nparents Mark and Patricia, brother Jason, and to his other family \nmembers and many friends who have suffered this most grievous loss. All \nwill sorely miss Jon Grassbaugh, the caring husband, dedicated son, \nloyal brother, good friend, outstanding Ranger. Laid to rest at \nArlington National Cemetery, Captain Grassbaugh joins his fellow heroes \nin eternal peace at our military's most sacred place. In the words of \nanother son of New Hampshire, Daniel Webster may his remembrance be as \nlong lasting as the land he honored. God bless Jonathan David \nGrassbaugh.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/09/senate-section/article/S5863-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5863-S5864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ADDRESSING THE DROPOUT EPIDEMIC\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, education has long been the key to \nopportunity, progress, and prosperity in America. Our schools and \nteachers prepare young Americans to compete and succeed in an ever-\nchanging economy. Good schools shape the character of our citizens. \nThey train Americans to participate in our democracy, and to serve our \ncountry and our communities. And a strong education system helps \nprotect our national security. Above all, it's a force to move America \nforward. It is the engine of the American dream.\n  When we enacted the No Child Left Behind Act 5 years ago, we sought \nto modernize and reform our public schools, and reaffirm the original \ncommitment made in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in 1965. \nThe No Child Left Behind Act sets lofty goals for all schools to meet, \nand requires States to establish strong standards, a rigorous \ncurriculum, and reliable assessments.\n  Congress should not abandon those fundamental goals as it works to \nreauthorize the law this year.\n  Nevertheless, we must acknowledge that too many of America's students \nstill don't receive all that is needed to engage and succeed in school, \nlearn to high standards, and graduate on time. Each year, approximately \n1 million students do not finish high school in time to graduate with \ntheir peers.\n  The Nation's dropout rate is more than a problem--it is a national \ncrisis--and one that a Nation so deeply committed to the fundamental \nvalue of equal justice and opportunities for all cannot afford to \nignore.\n  In 1963, President Kennedy decried the fact that four out of 10 fifth \ngraders did not finish high school. At that time, he called it ``a \nwaste we cannot afford.''\n  Forty-four years later, the statistics on high school graduation \nrates are still staggering. About 1,000 high schools across the country \nonly graduate half their students. Among African Americans and Latinos, \nonly 55 percent graduate on time. Every day, 7,000 young Americans drop \nout of school.\n  Reaching these dropouts--and giving them a chance to get back on \ntrack--is a national imperative. We have a moral commitment and an \nobligation to children, to parents, and to our communities to provide \neach and every one of our students with the chance to attend an \nexcellent public school and graduate with a diploma. Delivering on that \nbasic commitment is a measure of our strength as a democracy, and it's \nan expression of our values and our belief as a nation that our \nchildren are our future.\n  Reducing the dropout rate in our schools is not just the right thing \nto do. This epidemic has very real consequences for our country, and \naddressing it is an economic necessity.\n  High school dropouts earn, on average, $260,000 less than high school \ngraduates over the course of their lifetime, and nearly $1 million less \nthan individuals with a college degree. If each student who dropped out \nof the class of 2006 had graduated, America's economy would have been \n$309 billion stronger in future years.\n  If the approximately 1.2 million young people who are estimated to \ndrop out of school in the United States this year could earn high \nschool diplomas instead, States could save more than $17 billion in \ncosts under Medicaid and expenditures for uninsured care over the \ncourse of these young people's lifetimes.\n  Curbing the dropout rate requires a comprehensive solution. Our high \nschools clearly need greater assistance in supporting and retaining \ntheir students.\n  We must recognize, however, that this problem does not begin in high \nschool. Intervention should start in the elementary and middle school \nyears, when standards and expectations are set. Children who do not \nlearn to read or do basic math in these grades will fall farther and \nfarther behind, and find it increasingly difficult to catch up in the \nfaster-paced high school grades.\n  Research shows that we can identify students who are most at-risk for \nnot\n\n[[Page S5864]]\n\ncompleting high school as early as sixth grade. With early \nintervention, quality teachers, small classes, and data-driven \ninstruction, we can ensure that these students make progress, stay in \nschool and succeed.\n  Once students reach high school, we must do more to engage them in \nthe learning process. States and cities across the country are already \ntaking steps to address this challenge, such as offering extra help \nduring the school day, extending learning time, and adopting other \nschool-based interventions.\n  In Massachusetts, Boston public schools are working with private \npartners to create smaller learning communities, improve instruction, \nand strengthen professional development for teachers. Our high schools \nare undergoing a transformation to focus on business, technology, \nhealth professions, arts, public service, engineering, sciences, \ninternational studies, and social justice. In many of them, students \ncan prepare for future opportunities after they graduate, by enrolling \nin courses for college credit or pursuing hands-on experience in a \ncareer that interests them.\n  We must all work in Congress to help more districts like Boston mount \nsignificant efforts to address these issues and make progress in \nreducing the dropout rate.\n  I have joined my colleagues on the HELP Committee--Senator Bingaman \nand Senator Burr--in introducing the Graduation Promise Act, which \nwould fund state efforts that target resources and reforms to turn \naround high schools with low graduation rates. 15 percent of America's \nhigh schools produce half of our dropouts. In these schools--some of \nwhich have as many as 400 students in a freshman class--8 out of 10 of \nthe students start high school already having repeated a grade, or are \nspecial education students, or are two years or more below grade level.\n  It's very clear that these schools need more assistance in supporting \nand retaining these students, and that's what we hope to provide.\n  We must also do more to better connect schools with the communities \naround them, and provide the safety-net of services that at-risk \nstudents need to help them stay in school. The Keeping PACE Act would \nprovide federal funds for these efforts.\n  Supporting the social, emotional, intellectual, and physical \ndevelopment of our youth is a key strategy for breaking down the \nbarriers to learning.\n  Finally, in order to target reforms, we must accurately measure and \ntrack graduation rates throughout the country. Today, in some \ndistricts, students who leave school are counted as dropouts only if \nthey have registered as dropouts. In other districts, a promise to earn \na GED is all it takes to be counted as a ``graduate.'' That's \nunacceptable. Obtaining reliable data is the only way to identify and \ntarget the level of reform and resources necessary to assist schools \nstruggling with high dropout rates.\n  We have an obligation to encourage these and other creative reforms \nin our schools, and provide the support structure and safe harbor \nneeded to present students at-risk from dropping out. But we must also \nback up these essential reforms with real investments.\n  Today, the federal investment in education at all levels--especially \nin the middle and high school grades--is not sufficient. Only 8 percent \nof students who benefit from the federal investment in Title I are in \nhigh school. Ninety-percent of high schools with very low graduation \nrates have high concentrations of low-income students--but only a \nquarter of them receive federal assistance. We need to dedicate more \nresources and support for secondary schools to improve academic \nachievement and ensure that every student has a fair opportunity to \ngraduate. We need to target our efforts, resources, and ideas for \neffective reform to the schools that need them most.\n  As we consider ways to strengthen and advance our national commitment \nto leave no child behind, we have an opportunity to give teachers, \nschools, districts and states the support they need to ensure a high-\nquality education for every student.\n  We can no longer turn a blind eye to the millions of young people who \nfall through the cracks. Let us demand more of ourselves. Let us \nrecommit ourselves to the spirit and the principles of excellence and \nequal opportunity that have shaped our historic commitment to improving \npublic education. Above all, let us commit ourselves to the great goal \nof making this silent but severe epidemic--America's dropout crisis--a \nthing of the past.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/09/senate-section/article/S5864-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO KATE MARTIN\n\n  Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, I wish to honor the Bright Star \nRestaurant, one of my favorites in Bessemer, AL. The Bright Star \ncelebrated its 100th anniversary last week on May 2, 2007.\n  I know from personal experience that the Bright Star has endured for \na century due to its excellent menu. Though the restaurant has grown \nfrom a cafe that served only 25 people to its current size, seating 330 \npeople, the quality of the food has not changed a bit. I attribute this \nfact to Bill and Pete Koikos, the family-owned restaurant's patriarchs. \nBill and Pete immigrated to the United States from Greece in 1923. Two \nyears later they purchased ownership interest in the restaurant. Since \n1966, Bill's sons Jim and Nick have owned and operated the business \nvery successfully.\n  Jim and Nick Koikos are hard workers who are nearly always in the \nrestaurant greeting customers as they walk through the door. Jim and \nNick's dedication to keeping customers happy, along with their \nwonderful menu, account for the Bright Star's longevity.\n  Although the menu has a wide assortment of delicious dishes, I am \npartial to the seafood, which is always fresh from the gulf. My \npersonal favorite is the excellent Greek snapper, thought their special \ngumbo, not to mention the lemon pie, are also stand-outs.\n  For the last 100 years, the Bright Star has been one of the best \nrestaurants in the South. The emphasis on quality food and service has \nnot changed since the restaurant was founded in 1907, and I sincerely \ncongratulate the Koikos brothers on their anniversary and wish them \ncontinued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/09/senate-section/article/S5864-3", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5864-S5865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COMMENDING PAT SEAMANS WALKER\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \ncommend an outstanding Arkansan on her birthday for her truly amazing \ngifts to the State of Arkansas. Mrs. Pat Seamans Walker, a Springdale \nresident, has always been a leader in Arkansas philanthropy by \nproviding donations for many worthwhile causes, especially healthcare, \neducation and human service organizations.\n  Mrs. Walker and her late husband Willard founded the Willard and Pat \nWalker Charitable Foundation in 1986. Since that time, their generosity \nhas touched the lives of thousands of Arkansans. Mrs. Walker is a \nmember of the Foundation Board for the Arkansas Cancer Research Center, \nand an active member of First Christian Church of Springdale. She also \nparticipates in the oversight of the Walker Charitable Foundation.\n\n[[Page S5865]]\n\n  Pat Walker has received many awards in recognition of her \nphilanthropy, including the 2002 American Heart Association Tiffany \nAward, the Distinguished Services Award from the Razorback Foundation, \nthe prestigious Arkansas Children's Award, and the University of \nArkansas Medical School Distinguished Services Award. She has been \nrecognized as one of the Most Distinguished Women in Arkansas and was \nnamed to the Top 100 Women in Arkansas list by Arkansas Business in \n1999.\n  The Willard and Pat Walker Charitable Foundation has made countless \ndonations over the years, including millions to educational \ninstitutions in Arkansas, millions to healthcare research and community \nhealth centers in Arkansas, and the hundreds of thousands of dollars to \nbuild libraries in Arkansas.\n  I would like to personally thank Mrs. Walker and the members of the \nWalker family for their unwavering support of the State of Arkansas.

The F-117 was the world's first stealth aircraft and is still \none of the world's most advanced fighters. Since that date the men and \nwomen of the 49th have flown the F-117 with distinction throughout the \nworld. In 1999 the F-117s of the 49th deployed in support of Operation \nAllied Force, and flew more than 1,000 missions against heavily \ndefended targets in Serbia. The 49th also played a key role in the \nopening hours of Operation Iraqi Freedom, attacking critical leadership \ntargets.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those at Holloman \nfor keeping the F-117 flying, and for their service to our Nation. I am \nproud New Mexico has been the home to this amazing aircraft and the \noutstanding individuals who fly them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/09/senate-section/article/S5865-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRATULATING DALE B.

Mr. President, in 1932 Ray Yarnell bought a \nbankrupt dairy in Searcy, AR, and created the Yarnell Ice Cream \nCompany. At the time, there were 43 ice cream companies in business in \nArkansas.\n  Ray's son Albert began working for the company at the age of 12, \nriding his bicycle to deliver bills. During World War II, Albert \nYarnell left to serve his country as a member of the Army Signal Corps. \nAfter his service, he studied dairy production at the University of \nMissouri and returned to work at the Yarnell Ice Cream Company in 1948. \nWith the passing of his father in 1974, Albert Yarnell became the \npresident of the company. In 1978, he personally created the Nation's \nfirst all-natural ice milk, and after becoming chairman of the company \nin 1985, he led the team that invented the Nation's first non-fat, no-\nsugar-added ice cream in 1990. He is affectionately known in his \nhometown of Searcy and at the company as ``Mr. Albert.''\n  A very successful family business, the Yarnell Ice Cream Company now \nstands as the only remaining ice cream producer in Arkansas. Albert's \nson Rogers is the current president of the company and Albert's \ngranddaughter Christina is the treasurer. Albert and his wife Doris \nboth contribute to and are deeply respected in the community they have \ncalled home for so many years. Mr. Yarnell also serves on several \nboards, including Main Street Searcy, the Baptist Health Corporation, \nthe Searcy Chamber of Commerce, as well as the Arkansas State Chamber \nof Commerce.\n  Earlier this year, Albert Yarnell was inducted into the Arkansas \nBusiness Hall of Fame. He joins other distinguished members such as Sam \nWalton, Jackson Stephens, Don Tyson, and J.B. Hunt.\n  Mr. President, I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating \nboth Albert Yarnell, the patriarch of the Ice Cream Industry, and the \nYarnell Ice Cream Company on the company's 75th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/09/senate-section/article/S5865-4", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5865-S5866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING THE INN AT LONG SANDS\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I wish to honor and recognize \na small business from my home State that has triumphed over adversity \nin the wake of several major coastal storms. The Inn at Long Sands in \nYork Beach, ME, suffered extensive damage as the result of a \ndevastating storm on Mother's Day weekend of May 2006. With Memorial \nDay weekend approaching, signaling the unofficial beginning of summer--\na busy time for York County's tourism industry--Arline Shea, the Inn's \nco-owner watched countless hotel and meal reservations get washed away. \nAs a result of the storm, the Inn sustained over $100,000 in damage. \nThis was not a welcome beginning for Arline, who had just purchased the \nInn in February 2006.\n  Although the storm dealt Arline a heavy blow, she exemplified Maine's \nentrepreneurial spirit by reopening in a matter of weeks. To recover \nfrom the damage the Inn had sustained, Arline wisely made good use of \nthe tools available to small businesses in the wake of disasters. She \ncontacted the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Small \nBusiness Administration to find out what kinds of assistance she would \nbe able to receive. Arline's exemplary decision to find out what help \nwas available to her, along with her hard work and dedication, allowed \nher to reopen the Inn and Long Sands in time for last year's Fourth of \nJuly holiday.\n  Despite all of the tragedy that befell Arline Shea and her employees, \nher optimistic spirit shined through just a month following the storm, \nwhen the Portsmouth Herald interviewed her for a story on the recovery \nfrom the storm. ``Nobody died,'' Arline said. ``We all have our health. \nThat and the ice cream cone I have every day from the Village Scoop \nhelps,'' she added with good humor. Arline displayed an entrepreneurial \nspirit, combined with a sense of humor, that allowed her to prevail \nfollowing the devastation.\n  Unfortunately, the nightmare did not stop there for Arline. Just last \nmonth, Maine suffered, as did most of the east coast, a crippling \nstorm, known to Mainers as the ``Patriots Day Storm.'' This time, \nhowever, Arline was prepared for the storm, with sandbags and new sump \npumps. Because of the lessons learned--and her preparation--Arline \nsustained minimal damage from\n\n[[Page S5866]]\n\na storm that caused major flooding in most parts of the country, and \ncertainly across Maine.\n  While countless Maine businesses have overcome obstacles and \nsucceeded, Arline's story sticks out as an outstanding example to all \nMaine business owners. Shortly after purchasing the Inn, Arline's \nfather passed away. She rebounded from this personal tragedy, and from \nthe disaster that beset her business, by utilizing the resources \navailable to her, maintaining an optimistic spirit, and learning how to \ndeal with disaster in the process. Arline's inspiring example shows all \nMaine business owners that they can persevere from any challenge that \nthey face.\n  And so, I want to congratulate Arline Shea and the Inn at Long Sands \nfor providing small businesses with a beacon to look forward to. She is \ntruly a small business owner of whom we are all so proud. We wish her \nfuture success and offer her, and all of Maine's small businesses, our \ncomplete assistance. Maine, and indeed the nation, can benefit from \nArline Shea's optimism, determination, and entrepreneurship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/09/senate-section/article/S5866-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/09/senate-section/article/S5866-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/09/senate-section/article/S5866-3", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  The following message from the President of the United States was \ntransmitted to the Senate by one of his secretaries:\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/09/senate-section/article/S5866-4", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO \n    THE BLOCKING OF PROPERTY OF CERTAIN PERSONS AND PROHIBITING THE \nEXPORTATION AND REEXPORTATION OF CERTAIN GOODS TO SYRIA AS DECLARED IN \n              EXECUTIVE ORDER 13338 OF MAY 11, 2004--PM 12\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Pennsylvania urging Congress to provide equitable funding to \n     the Department of Housing and Urban Development for the \n     operation of quality affordable housing; to the Committee on \n     Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 45\n\n       Whereas, Pennsylvania's public housing authorities are \n     essential in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; and\n       Whereas, Pennsylvania is home to 90 public housing \n     authorities serving an estimated 245,819 residents of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; and\n\n[[Page S5867]]\n\n       Whereas, Pennsylvania's public housing authorities provide \n     high-quality affordable housing to residents in the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania through the use of Fedeal \n     programs; and\n       Whereas, Pennsylvania's public housing authorities have \n     successfully assisted residents of the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania with Moving to Work programs and \n     preapprenticeship training, resulting in greater self-\n     sufficiency and a reduced burden on Commonwealth resources; \n     and\n       Whereas, developments built by Pennsylvania's public \n     housing authorities have in some instances increased the \n     values of neighboring properties and communities in the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania by as much as 142%; and\n       Whereas, new funding guidelines developed by the United \n     States Department of Housing and Urban Development may result \n     in reduced funding for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, its \n     public housing authorities and the Pennsylvanians who rely on \n     these services; and\n       Whereas, Pennsylvania's public housing authorities are a \n     major employer in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and \n     funding cuts from the United States Department of Housing and \n     Urban Development may result in drastic layoffs and \n     diminished services to the residents of public housing; \n     therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania recognize the importance of the quality \n     services, support and housing provided by Pennsylvania's \n     public housing authorities and respectfully urge the Congress \n     to provide equitable funding to the United States Department \n     of Housing and Urban Development for the operation of quality \n     affordable housing; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of each house of Congress and to each \n     member of Congress from Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-80. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan urging Congress to enact legislation to increase \n     protections for the Great Lakes from Asian carp; to the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 15\n\n       Whereas, two species of Asian carp, not native to the \n     United States, are on the verge of invading the Great Lakes. \n     Silver carp and bighead carp escaped from confinement at \n     southern fish farms in past decades and have migrated up the \n     Mississippi and the Illinois River to within less than 100 \n     miles of the Great Lakes; and\n       Whereas, Asian carp could become a dominant species in the \n     Great Lakes, threatening the $4.5 billion Great Lakes \n     commercial and recreational fishery and recreational boaters. \n     Asian carp are voracious feeders that compete with native \n     fish and wildlife for food. In addition, silver carp can \n     weigh up to 70 pounds and jump up to 10 feet out of the water \n     when disturbed by boats. Boaters have suffered cuts, \n     blackened eyes, broken bones, back injuries, and concussions \n     from leaping silver carp; and\n       Whereas, the only thing preventing the movement of Asian \n     carp into the Great Lakes is a temporary electrical barrier \n     in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal operated by the United \n     States Army Corps of Engineers. A permanent electrical \n     barrier is also under construction to replace the temporary \n     barrier; and\n       Whereas, to date, over $12 million has been spent on \n     construction and operation of the electrical barriers. To \n     help match federal funding, the state of Michigan has \n     contributed nearly $70,000 toward the completion of the \n     permanent electrical barrier; and\n       Whereas, current funding is insufficient to complete \n     construction of the permanent barrier and only finances \n     operation of the temporary barrier through the first half of \n     fiscal year 2007. In addition, there is no funding to \n     renovate the temporary barrier as a permanent backup to the \n     new barrier; and\n       Whereas, there are provisions in several measures before \n     the Congress that would provide funds to upgrade the current \n     barrier and complete construction of the permanent barrier. \n     Bills with this language include the Great Lakes Asian Carp \n     Barrier Act (H.R. 553 and S. 336), the Water Resources \n     Development Act of 2007 (H.R. 1495), the National Aquatic \n     Invasive Species Act of 2007 (S. 725), and the Great Lakes \n     Collaboration Implementation Act (H.R. 1350). It is of the \n     utmost importance that Congress protect the Great Lakes by \n     providing the funding and authority for the ongoing operation \n     and maintenance of the barriers, compensate states for their \n     contributions to the project, and provide for research into \n     controlling Asian carp and other exotic species; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the United \n     States Congress to enact legislation to increase protections \n     for the Great Lakes from Asian carp; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-81. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Hawaii urging Congress to propose amendments to the No Child \n     Left Behind Act of 2001; to the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 33\n\n       Whereas, the United States Congress must decide in 2007 \n     whether to reauthorize the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 \n     or let it die and replace it with a new law; and\n       Whereas, the No Child Left Behind Act, unprecedented in the \n     history of federal and state roles in public education by the \n     mandated imposition of a federally prescribed, single \n     accountability model for all public schools, undermines the \n     established constitutional role of state and local public \n     education governance; and\n       Whereas, the No Child Left Behind Act, while purporting to \n     create an accountability system for public schools, has in \n     reality, been an enormous financial and programmatic burden \n     on schools and taxpayers; and\n       Whereas, even if states and schools are satisfied with \n     their educational programs and outcomes, they are forced to \n     participate in this top-down system in order to continue to \n     receive federal funds for education, such as Title I funds; \n     and\n       Whereas, the No Child Left Behind Act mandates consequences \n     to schools if just one of thirty seven possible adequate \n     yearly progress calculation outcomes are not met, and makes \n     no distinction in the consequences imposed on schools that \n     did not meet one or did not meet all thirty seven, resulting \n     in dilution of energy, time, and money by mandating the \n     treatment of all such schools to include identical sanctions; \n     and\n       Whereas, the No Child Left Behind Act employs a view of \n     motivation that is misguided and objectionable, using \n     threats, punishments, and pernicious comparisons to \n     ``motivate'' teachers, students, and schools; and\n       Whereas, private K-12 schools have chosen not to spend \n     their time or money adopting key elements of the No Child \n     Left Behind Act's intensive testing and accountability \n     regimen; and\n       Whereas, the No Child Left Behind Act's narrow focus on the \n     ``basics'' has discouraged the implementation of best \n     practices and cutting edge educational research in order to \n     achieve higher test scores; and\n       Whereas, the No Child Left Behind Act has driven many \n     schools and school systems into a narrowing of curriculum, \n     often focused on only tested subjects, to the detriment of \n     subjects and rich educational experiences, such as the arts; \n     and\n       Whereas, the goal of achieving one hundred percent \n     proficiency, including special education students, is \n     unrealistic, and the pursuit of which channels millions of \n     dollars into tactically targeted programs that divert limited \n     resources from other critical school programs, professional \n     training, as well as the educational and physical environment \n     of schools; and\n       Whereas, the requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act \n     penalize schools who enroll students who have inherent \n     educational deficiencies and who, as a group, will continue \n     to remain below ever increasing No Child Left Behind ``annual \n     measurable objectives''; and\n       Whereas, while there has recently been some interest in the \n     development of so-called ``growth models'' to recognize the \n     contributions of a school to individual students over time, \n     the lack of adequate funding and the prohibition against \n     states developing their own growth models has rendered this \n     initiative almost meaningless; and\n       Whereas, the No Child Left Behind Act does not provide \n     additional funds for teacher education or training if a \n     school is in ``status'' or under restructuring, which creates \n     a punitive environment with little commitment on the part of \n     the federal government for improving teaching and learning, \n     or for supporting increased school success; and\n       Whereas, Adequate Yearly Progress does not take into \n     account a school's adoption of meaningful educational \n     innovation or judicious use of research; and\n       Whereas, the No Child Left Behind Act has channeled \n     countless dollars into high-stake testing, which has largely \n     benefited national private testing companies, but at the \n     expense of ignoring genuine student accomplishments; and\n       Whereas, the No Child Left Behind Act appears biased \n     towards a one size fits all multiple choice testing system, \n     and tends to ignore other means of engaging and assessing \n     students such as project-based, hands-on, or problem-solving \n     demonstrations of competency; and\n       Whereas, the United States Department of Education has \n     shown little or no interest in creating incentives among \n     colleges and universities to incorporate innovative \n     portfolios or project-based competencies into their \n     admissions decisions, thus reinforcing the use of high-stake, \n     multiple-choice private contractors; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Twenty-fourth Legislature of \n     the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2007, That the United \n     States Congress is strongly urged to propose specific \n     amendments to, or recommend the repeal of, the federal No \n     Child Left Behind Act of 2001; and be it further\n       Resolved, that among the issues and amendments the United \n     States Congress should address are the following:\n       (1) Improving teacher quality, preparation, and training \n     by:\n       (A) Building support for a comprehensive incentive program \n     to recruit, place, and retain experienced, well-qualified \n     teachers in high-need schools (e.g., high poverty, or \n     geographically isolated communities);\n       (B) Providing significant support for teacher education, \n     professional development, in-service training, and career \n     opportunities;\n\n[[Page S5868]]\n\n       (C) Improving the occupational status and compensation of \n     teaching as a career;\n       (D) Improving qualifications of teacher candidates at \n     colleges of education;\n       (E) Providing financial incentives for institutions of \n     higher learning to incorporate portfolios and demonstrations \n     of competency into their admissions decisions;\n       (F) Strengthening teacher education preparation programs in \n     areas such as science, mathematics, technology, measurement, \n     data analysis, and evaluation;\n       (G) Recognizing teachers having achieved certification by \n     the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards as \n     ``highly qualified'' in their respective fields; and\n       (H) Providing flexibility in recognizing certified \n     secondary level special education teachers as qualified \n     teachers in their own right, and removing the unrealistic \n     expectation that such teachers be additionally certified in \n     every single core subject area;\n       (2) Improving assessment measures and systems by:\n       (A) Refining student assessment instruments designed \n     specifically for use in improving instruction as well as \n     school accountability;\n       (B) Encouraging states and school districts to utilize a \n     wider range of useful assessments, including project-based \n     competency and portfolios;\n       (C) Developing more appropriate means of assessing the \n     academic progress of English Language Learners, special \n     education students, and those with behavioral health issues; \n     and\n       (D) Supporting the development and implementation of \n     comprehensive statewide data collection and exchange systems \n     that allow for more efficient support for student record \n     keeping and informed educational policy decision making \n     (e.g., electronic student transcript systems, and \n     longitudinal analyses of growth in academic achievement);\n       (3) Improving accountability models, indicators of \n     performance, and consequences by:\n       (A) Supporting states and the educational research \n     community in research and development efforts to further the \n     pioneering work required in refining the technology \n     underlying growth (toward standards) analysis models;\n       (B) Permitting each state to adopt and pilot its own growth \n     model to calculate adequate yearly progress under the No \n     Child Left Behind Act to take advantage of inherent benefits \n     that motivate students at all levels of proficiency;\n       (C) Supporting wholesale changes to the ``adequate yearly \n     progress'' model for educational accountability that would \n     prov1de for a fairer and more balanced appraisal of school \n     performance and quality;\n       (D) Replacing punitive, conjunctive ``miss one, miss all'' \n     criteria;\n       (E) Expanding accountability indicators to reflect \n     performance on standards in other important disciplines and \n     countering unintended consequences such as a narrowing of \n     curriculum;\n       (F) Allowing for current limitations in reliable and valid \n     assessments of students within a wide range of disability \n     classifications; and\n       (G) Allowing for deferrals to test new immigrant students \n     with limited English proficiency for up to three years of \n     entering the country;\n       (4) Augmenting resources to assist states in efforts to \n     accomplish challenging educational initiatives by:\n       (A) Requiring schools to maintain a broad and comprehensive \n     curriculum to support adopted content and performance \n     standards, including the arts and physical education;\n       (B) Fully funding special education programs, as once \n     promised;\n       (C) Providing adequate funding to research and develop \n     multiple and more valid means of assessing student \n     competence, skills and knowledge for use in both improvement \n     and educational accountability; and\n       (D) Providing funding and training support for data and \n     technology infrastructure requirements;\n       (5) Supporting innovation, capacity building, and \n     flexibility to address state and local education needs by:\n       (A) Recognizing schools that demonstrate successful \n     strategies using innovative curriculum and methodologies;\n       (B) Developing new initiatives for school facilities that \n     do not push educational funding toward ever larger schools \n     and economy-of-scale construction mentality;\n       (C) Avoiding simplistic ``one size fits all'' solutions for \n     assessment, accountability, and intervention;\n       (D) Addressing unique needs of ``high-need'' schools (e.g., \n     high poverty, high immigration, extreme geographic \n     isolation); and\n       (E) Allowing states to determine which and how many grade \n     levels are best to test; and\n       (6) Returning to the original intent and purpose of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) by:\n       (A) Restoring the foundational precepts of ESEA and its \n     focus on equity in educational attainment despite \n     disadvantages stemming from socio-economic background;\n       (B) Allowing states to ``opt out'' of requirements that \n     impact schools that do not receive ESEA entitlements, without \n     loss of federal funds;\n       (C) Promoting strategies that directly reduce achievement \n     gaps through better instruction, such as incentives for \n     experienced, well-qualified teachers to accept positions in \n     high-need schools and for reducing class size;\n       (D) Resolving to build the best public education system and \n     teacher work force in the world, rather than promoting lofty \n     rhetoric and ploys that undermine and divert public funds to \n     private schools; and\n       (E) Returning policy setting and curriculum and teaching \n     decision making control back to states, school districts and \n     local communities; and be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the President of the United States, the Vice \n     President of the United States, the President pro tempore of \n     the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, and the members of Hawaii's \n     Congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-82. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Washington urging Congress to raise the \n     authorized funding levels of the No Child Left Behind Act to \n     cover the costs that states and districts will incur to carry \n     out its recommendations; to the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                 Substitute Senate Joint Memorial 8011\n\n       Whereas, Washington State supports, believes in, and has \n     been diligently working on the attainment of the goals of the \n     No Child Left Behind legislation, all students achieving at \n     high levels; and\n       Whereas, the state welcomes the additional support No Child \n     Left Behind has brought to focus on quality education, the \n     improvements needed to reach all children, and the urgency \n     nationwide to close achievement gaps; and\n       Whereas, the state supports a fair, feasible, and \n     creditable accountability system; and;\n       Whereas, Washington State has attached approval and is in \n     compliance with the requirements provided in the regulations; \n     and\n       Whereas, the reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind \n     legislation will provide the opportunity for essential \n     changes to be made to reach the goals and purposes of the \n     law; and\n       Whereras, students with limited English proficiency are in \n     a program because they cannot speak, read, or write English \n     and they must be provided appropriate and valid measures for \n     accountability that are not included in the overall \n     accountability until such students develop English academic \n     language proficiency, for a period of not more than three \n     years; and\n       Whereas, students with disabilities need appropriate \n     assessments that meet the requirements of the Individuals \n     with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), are aligned with \n     their individual educational plans, and tested according to \n     students' ability and not limited to their grade level; and\n       Whereas, all students, all schools, and all districts do \n     not improve on a uniform basis across any state as required \n     by the state uniform bar, so the state uniform bar should be \n     replaced with realistic requirements for continuous growth \n     and improvement based on required yearly percentage increases \n     in performance at the school, district, and state levels, \n     which would provide fairness to accountability and an \n     increased motivation for very low and very high performing \n     schools; and\n       Whereas, the Act imposes a significant testing burden on \n     states, schools, and districts and unless appropriate federal \n     funding is provided for administering and scoring quality \n     large scale assessments in the new grade levels required, \n     states should be allowed to continue to assess students \n     annually in selected grades in elementary schools, middle \n     schools, and high schools and even if funding is provided for \n     these assessments in the new grade levels, states should be \n     able to use that funding to assess students in a variety of \n     ways that would inform improvements in instruction but would \n     not have to meet the extensive technical standards now \n     required; and\n       Whereas, the adequate yearly progress provisions are overly \n     prescriptive and rigid, and they identify too many schools \n     ``in need of improvement'' by creating too many ways to fail, \n     which reduces the opportunities and funding to assist schools \n     that truly are in need of improvement; and\n       Whereas, the Act requires all teachers to be highly \n     qualified regardless of state systems of certification and \n     licensure in place, states must continue to have authority to \n     use flexibility in meeting these requirements so that the \n     educational needs of the students and the diverse conditions \n     in the state are met; and\n       Whereas, career and technical education teachers are often \n     hired from industries in which a bachelor's degree is not the \n     preferred level of certification; and\n       Whereas, the Washington State Legislature passed \n     legislation in 2006 that recognizes credit for core academic \n     subjects learned through career and technical education, but \n     if the teacher does not have a bachelor's degree the school \n     district must report them to parents as ``not highly \n     qualified,'' which places these teachers at a disadvantage in \n     school districts; and\n       Whereas, positive changes in the definition of highly \n     qualified teachers will assist in the awarding of equivalency \n     credits and remove the stigma surrounding industry-certified \n     teachers; and\n       Whereas, providers of supplemental services instruct \n     students and are funded with federal funds, therefore these \n     providers must meet the same safety and qualification \n     standards required of public school educators; and\n       Whereas, supplemental services are most appropriately \n     provided by public schools,\n\n[[Page S5869]]\n\n     public school educators should be allowed to offer \n     supplemental services to qualifying students; and\n       Whereas, the Act imposes significant costs on the state and \n     local school districts, teachers, and paraprofessionals; and\n       Whereas, these costs include the administration of newly \n     required assessments, and the costs of staff development, \n     certification upgrades, and coursework;

A bill to provide for the exchange of certain Bureau of Land \nManagement land in Pima County, Arizona, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nMcCain to introduce the Las Cienegas Enhancement and Saguaro National \nPark Boundary Adjustment Act of 2007. This legislation directs a land \nexchange between the Bureau of Land Management, BLM, and the Las \nCienegas Conservation, LLC in southeastern Arizona. A similar bill was \nintroduced last year, and it passed the House of Representatives. \nUnfortunately, the Senate was unable to pass it before the session \nended.\n  We can turn this disappointment into a success. The bill we introduce \ntoday adds to the exchange a highly sought after private parcel, the \n``Bloom Property.'' The Bloom Property would be added to Saguaro \nNational Park. State and local officials, conservationists, and other \nstakeholders have worked together to include the Bloom Property in this \nbill and to structure an exchange that is fair and in the public \ninterest.\n  Let me explain the details of the exchange. The land to be \ntransferred out of Federal ownership, approximately 1,280 acres, is \nreferred to as the ``Sahuarita property.'' This property is BLM-managed \nland south of Tucson near Corona de Tucson. The land is low-lying \nSonoran desert and has been identified for disposal by the BLM through \nits land-use planning process.\n  The private land to be brought into Federal ownership consists of two \nparcels. The first parcel is approximately 2,392 acres of land referred \nto as the ``Empirita-Simonson property.'' This property lies north of \nthe Las Cienegas National Conservation Area managed by the BLM. The \nEmpirita-Simonson property lies within the ``Sonoita Valley Acquisition \nPlanning District'' established by Public Law 106-538, which designated \nthe Las Cienegas National Conservation Area. The act directed the \nDepartment of the Interior to acquire lands from willing sellers within \nthe planning district for inclusion within the conservation area. The \nidea was to further protect lands with important resource values for \nwhich the national conservation area was designated.\n  The second parcel, the Bloom Property, is approximately 160 acres of \nland that was identified for inclusion in the Saguaro National Park \nduring a boundary study conducted by the National Park Service in 1993. \nIn 1994, using the data from the study, Congress enacted legislation \nexpanding the park and changed Saguaro's designation from monument to \npark. At that time, the Bloom Property did not have a willing seller. I \nam pleased to say circumstances have changed, and we are able to \ninclude it in this exchange. The Bloom Property, which lies just south \nof the Sweetwater Trail in Saguaro Park West, is a prime example of \nSonoran desert important to maintain corridors for wildlife like the \nmountain lion.\n  Although this bill is centered on the land exchange I just described, \nit also accomplishes two other important objectives: addressing water \nwithdrawals at Cienegas Creek and providing road access to a popular \nrecreation destination, the Whetstone Mountains controlled by the \nForest Service.\n  Let's talk about water. Arizonans understand that protecting our \nwater supply is crucial to the State's future. For this reason, we \ncontinually seek ways to promote responsible use of our limited water \nsupply. This bill promotes responsible use. There is a prior claim to a \nwell site on the private land that will be exchanged. That prior claim \nwould allow a developer to withdraw 1,600 acre-feet of water a year. \nPima County and the community at large are concerned about the future \nof Cienegas Creek and the entire riparian area if these water \nwithdrawals occur.\n  To address this concern, the land exchange is conditioned on Las \nCienegas Conservation, LLC conveying the well site to Pima County and \nrelinquishing those water rights it controls. The net result is a water \nsavings of 1,050 acre-feet per year. This is a significant benefit to \nthis riparian area.\n  Overall, this bill allows us to accomplish important environmental \nand conservation objectives while managing our development. It is a \nbill with broad support that includes Pima County, the city of Tucson, \nand many others. I urge my colleagues to work with me to approve this \nlegislation at the earliest possible date.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself and Ms. Collins)\n  S. 1343. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act with respect \nto prevention and treatment of diabetes, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today, Senator Collins and I will be \nintroducing the Diabetes Treatment and Prevention Act, legislation to \nhelp our Federal, State and local governments address the growing \nepidemic of diabetes across our Nation.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, the \nnumber of Americans with diagnosed diabetes has doubled over the past \n15 years.\n\n[[Page S5872]]\n\nOver 20 million Americans are currently living with this disease, but 6 \nmillion of them have not yet been diagnosed. Another 54 million are \nclassified as ``pre-diabetic,'' with a high risk of developing this \ncondition. Diabetes accounts for over $92 billion in direct medical \ncosts every year, and these numbers are only likely to increase.\n  Last year, the New York Times published an insightful series on \ndiabetes that highlighted the obstacles faced by health care providers \nand institutions seeking to prevent complications from diabetes. The \nsystem will pay tens of thousands of dollars for amputations, but not a \nlow-cost visit to the podiatrist that could have saved the foot. \nHospitals struggle to provide preventive treatment and rehabilitation \nin the Byzantine system of reimbursements. The incentives inside our \nhealth care system are backwards, and the payment system is upside-\ndown: too often paying for costly and debilitating treatment but not \nfor low-cost prevention.\n  We know what works. The landmark Diabetes Prevention Program, a \ngovernment funded clinical trial, found that moderate diet and exercise \ninterventions helped to delay and prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes \nin persons at high risk for developing the condition. Indeed, the study \nwas so successful that it was ended a year earlier than planned. Yet \ndespite the success of this study, we still haven't found a way to \nimplement these interventions in our communities.\n  The Diabetes Treatment and Prevention Act would provide additional \nsupport for the Federal, State and local programs that are working to \nfight this epidemic. Our legislation would codify the Division of \nDiabetes Translation at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \nCDC, giving them definitive authority to carry out activities in \ndiabetes surveillance, translational research, and education efforts. \nIt would direct the CDC to continue its work in coordinating the \nNational Diabetes Education Program, in conjunction with the National \nInstitutes of Health, NIH, and would increase support for its diabetes \ncontrol and prevention efforts at the State level.\n  This bill would also establish several demonstration projects. One \nwould help to translate the interventions identified as effective by \nthe Diabetes Prevention Program into clinical interventions that can be \nreplicated at the State, local and provider level. Another would allow \nacademic centers, in conjunction with state and local health \ndepartments, to examine ways to improve overall health outcomes in \npeople living with diabetes and other co-occurring chronic conditions, \nsuch as heart disease, mental illness, or HIV. Finally, the bill would \nsupport efforts to increase surveillance and education at the State and \nlocal level.\n  The epidemic of diabetes has the potential to place great burdens on \nour health care system, but it doesn't have to. We can prevent \ndiabetes, we can manage diabetes, and we can reduce the health care \ncosts associated with care and treatment for this condition. The \nDiabetes Treatment and Prevention Act will help us take necessary steps \nto supporting our public health infrastructure in dealing with this \ncrisis, and I would urge all of my colleagues to cosponsor this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY:\n  S. 1344. A bill to designate the Department of Veterans Affairs \noutpatient clinic in Wenatchee, Washington, as the Elwood ``Bud'' Link \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about legislation \nthat my colleague from Washington, Congressman Doc Hastings, and I are \nintroducing to name the soon-to-be-opened Community-Based Outpatient \nClinic in Wenatchee, WA, after Elwood ``Bud'' Link. Bud provided both \nthe inspiration and the energy necessary to make this project a \nreality, thereby fulfilling a longstanding and serious need for his \ncommunity.\n  Bud, a World War II veteran and an active member of Veterans of \nForeign Wars Post 10445, recognized the need for better, more \naccessible veteran medical services for those veterans living in north \ncentral Washington. Like countless others, Bud suffered from health \nproblems attributed to his service in the Navy, where he bravely served \naboard the USS Tracy escorting convoys throughout the South Pacific and \nprotecting medical personnel after the deployment of the atomic bomb.\n  When Bud returned to the States, he, like so many other veterans, \nrelied on the VA for health care. In order to receive the necessary \ntreatment from the VA, however, Bud was forced to make a 3-hour drive \nin each direction to the VA medical center nearest to his home.\n  Realizing that this was the case for veterans all over his community, \nBud, his wife of over 50 years, Helen, and his fellow VFW Post 10445 \nmembers, helped by the American Legion and other veteran service \norganizations, mobilized the community to work toward the creation of a \nnew, more accessible outpatient veteran center.\n  I was proud to contribute to this effort. After several years of hard \nwork, I stood with Congressman Doc Hastings at the Cashmere VFW hall on \nMarch 20, 2006 to announce the VA's final decision to create the \nCommunity-Based Outpatient Clinic in Wenatchee, WA.\n  Although Bud sadly passed away before this exciting announcement was \nmade, the creation of this facility in Wenatchee represents the \nculmination of Bud and his fellow veterans' efforts to make veterans' \nmedical care more accessible and, in turn, to hold the Federal \nGovernment accountable for fulfilling its promises to the veteran \ncommunity.\n  Bud dedicated his time and energy to addressing this and other \nveteran needs as an advocate, a leader, and a concerned citizen. Due in \nlarge part to Bud's work, the new CBOC, set to serve six counties in \nnorth central Washington, is likely to make over 25,000 visits by \nveterans more accessible next year.\n  Bud's life of service and activism, coupled with this final victory, \nreaffirms a valuable lesson for all Americans: even a single citizen \ncan see a problem and fix it.\n  Bud Link dedicated his time and energy to helping other veterans, and \nnow that the clinic he fought for is going to open, we have a chance to \nhonor his lifetime of service. My bill will ensure that Bud's efforts \nand good example will not be forgotten, but rather, that the new CBOC \nwill carry on Bud's legacy.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the work that Bud Link and \nhis fellow veterans have done to make this new CBOC a reality.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Collins, Mr. Levin, \n        Mr. Leahy, Mr. Feingold, and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 1345. A bill to affirm that Federal employees are protected from \ndiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and to repudiate any \nassertion to the contrary; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as we celebrate Public Service Recognition \nWeek and the dedication and professionalism of Federal employees, I \nrise today to introduce legislation to reassert protections for Federal \nemployees and applicants for Federal employment against discrimination \nbased on one's sexual orientation. The Clarification of Federal \nEmployment Protection Act will spell out the protections that Federal \nemployees currently have but have been denied by the Office of Special \nCounsel, OSC. I am pleased that Senators Lieberman, Collins, Levin, \nLeahy, Feingold, and Clinton are cosponsoring this important \nlegislation and that Representative Henry Waxman, Chairman of the House \nOversight and Government Reform Committee, is introducing a companion \nbill in the House.\n  When Congress passed the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, it \nestablished a list of prohibited personnel practices, personnel actions \nthat were clearly not in line with the Merit System Principles and were \nsubject to prosecution by OSC. Examples include personnel actions, such \nas hiring, firing, and changes in pay, against employees based on a \nwhistleblower disclosure, nepotism, or off-duty conduct.\n  The prohibition on personnel action based on off-duty conduct, found \nin section 2302(b)(10) of title 5, United States Code, has been \ninterpreted for years to prohibit the taking of personnel actions \nagainst employees and applicants\n\n[[Page S5873]]\n\nfor employment based on their sexual orientation. In 1980, Mr. Alan \nCampbell, Director of the Office of Personnel Management, OPM, at the \ntime, wrote a memorandum to the heads of all executive branch agencies \nadvising that, under 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(10), employees and applicants \nwere to be protected against inquiries into or actions based upon non \njob-related conduct, including religious or community affiliations, or \nsexual orientation. The position by OPM has been reaffirmed time and \nagain, most recently by the current OPM Director, Linda Springer, in \nher responses to questions posed by the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee in relation to her nomination for the \nposition. In fact, to this day, OPM's website contains a guide to \nFederal employee rights which states that section 2302(b)(10) has been \ninterpreted by OPM to prohibit discrimination based upon sexual \norientation.\n  OPM is not alone in this interpretation. The previous Special Counsel \nalso interpreted 2302(b)(10) to protect against discrimination based on \nan individual's sexual orientation. For example, in 2003, OSC secured \ncorrective and disciplinary action against a Federal supervisor who \ndiscriminated against Federal job applicant because he was gay in \nviolation of section 2302(b)(10). In 2004, following the debate spurred \nby OSC over the interpretation of this provision, White House spokesman \nTrent Duffy said the president ``believes that no Federal employee \nshould be subject to unlawful discrimination, and Federal agencies will \nfully enforce the law against discrimination, including discrimination \nbased on sexual orientation.''\n  Upon the nomination of Scott Bloch to be the new Special Counsel, I \nasked the nominee about his interpretation of the laws protecting \nFederal employees and applicants against sexual orientation \ndiscrimination. When asked if he would support the interpretation of \n2302(b)(10) by OPM and OSC, he said that he would not fail to enforce a \nclaim of sexual orientation discrimination before OSC that shows \nthrough the evidence that the statute has been violated.\n  Nonetheless, after being in office for only a few months, Special \nCounsel Bloch conducted a review of the discrimination statute and \nclaimed that section 2302(b)(10) only provides protection against \ndiscrimination based on conduct, including sexual conduct, but not \none's sexual orientation. Instead, Mr. Bloch claims that for \ndiscrimination based on status, referring to sexual orientation, it \nwould have to be listed under section 2302(b)(1), which protects \nemployees from discrimination based on race, gender, religion, or \nmarital status. This departure from the long-standing interpretation of \n(b)(10) by OSC and OPM is illogical. When a supervisor who dislikes \ngays or lesbians refuses to hire an applicant who the supervisor \nbelieves is gay or lesbian, it follows that the supervisor is basing \nthe personnel action on disapproval of the applicant's presumed sexual \nconduct. In other words, in the context of sexual orientation \ndiscrimination, status implies conduct.\n  I believe that Congress must act to guarantee the protections it has \nprovided to Federal employees and applicants for Federal employment. We \ncannot allow one administration official's opinion to undermine the \nmerit system or the rights and protections Federal workers. The \nlegislation I am introducing today would affirm that sexual orientation \nis protected by section 2302(b)(10) but also make it a clear protected \nstatus under section (b)(1). I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1345\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Clarification of Federal \n     Employment Protections Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION \n                   PROHIBITED.\n\n       (a) Repudiation.--In order to dispel any public confusion, \n     Congress repudiates any assertion that Federal employees are \n     not protected from discrimination on the basis of sexual \n     orientation.\n       (b) Affirmation.--It is the sense of Congress that, in the \n     absence of the amendment made by subsection (c), \n     discrimination against Federal employees and applicants for \n     Federal employment on the basis of sexual orientation is \n     prohibited by section 2302(b)(10) of title 5, United States \n     Code.\n       (c) Amendment.--Section 2302(b)(1) of title 5, United \n     States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``or'' at the end of subparagraph (D);\n       (2) by inserting ``or'' at the end of subparagraph (E); and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(F) on the basis of sexual orientation.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 1347. A bill to amend the Omnibus Indian Advancement Act to modify \nthe date as of which certain tribal land of the Lytton Rancheria of \nCalifornia is deemed to be held in trust and to provide for the conduct \nof certain activities on the land; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Lytton \nGaming Oversight Act of 2007, a bill seeking to ensure that Native \nAmerican tribes follow the regular process under Federal law prior to \nestablishing and operating gaming facilities.\n  I believe this approach provides a good step forward as it has the \nsupport of both the local community and the Lytton tribe.\n  I am pleased to have worked closely with representatives of the local \ncommunity, such as California Assemblymember Loni Hancock, D-Berkeley, \nas well as my colleague Senator Specter in crafting this piece of \nlegislation.\n  I introduced similar legislation in the 108th and 109th Congresses, \nbut these bills would have effectively required closure of the casino \noperations, until a point when and if the Lytton successfully completed \nthe two-part determination process.\n  This legislation, however, stalled. The legislation introduced today \nbreaks that stalemate and seeks to prevent a massive expansion of \ngaming in the Bay Area.\n  The bill requires that the Lytton Band of Pomo Indians follow \ncritical oversight guidelines laid out in Section 20 of the Indian \nGaming Regulatory Act, IGRA, before engaging in Class III gaming.\n  This legislation would amend language inserted into the Omnibus \nIndian Advancement Act of 2000.\n  That language mandated that the Secretary of Interior take a card \nclub and adjacent parking lot in the San Francisco Bay Area into trust \nfor the Lytton tribe as their reservation and backdate the acquisition \nto October 17, 1988, or pre-IGRA.\n  This backdating was done expressly with the goal of allowing the \nLytton tribe to circumvent IGRA's ``two-part determination'' process, \nan important step that requires both Secretarial and Gubernatorial \napproval, in addition to consultation with nearby tribes and the local \ncommunity and its representatives.\n  The legislation that I have introduced would simply return the Lytton \ntribe to the same status as all other tribes seeking to pursue Class \nIII, or Nevada-style gaming, on lands acquired after the passage of \nIGRA in 1988.\n\n  It would allow the tribe to continue operating its Class II gaming \nfacility provided it follows all IGRA regulations regarding gaming on \nnewly acquired lands going forward.\n  Finally, it would also preclude any expansion of the facility used by \nthe Lytton for Class II gaming.\n  I would like to emphasize what the bill would not do. It would not: \nRemove the tribe's recognition status; Alter the trust status of the \nnew reservation; or take away the tribe's ability to conduct gaming \nthrough the normal IGRA process.\n  This legislation was solely crafted to restore IGRA's rightful \noversight of the gaming process, just as Congress intended.\n  Section 20 of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act provides clear \nguidelines for addressing the issue of gaming on so-called ``newly-\nacquired'' lands, or lands that have been taken into trust since the \nenactment of IGRA in 1988.\n  Most importantly, in my opinion, IGRA's ``two-part determination'' \nprocess provides for both Federal and State approval, while protecting \nthe rights of nearby tribes and local communities.\n  Circumventing this process creates a variety of serious and critical \nmulti-jurisdictional issues, issues which can negatively affect the \nlives of ordinary citizens and deprive local and tribal governments of \ntheir ability to effectively represent their communities.\n\n[[Page S5874]]\n\n  Without passage of this bill, the Lytton could take the former card \nclub and the adjacent parking lot that is now their reservation and \nturn it into a large gambling complex outside the regulations set up by \nthe Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. In fact, this is exactly what was \nproposed in the summer of 2004.\n  While the tribe announced that it was dropping its pursuit of a \nsizable casino, it could reverse these plans at any time and proceed \nwith Class III gaming without first going through the regular process.\n  Allowing this to happen would set a dangerous precedent not only for \nCalifornia, but every State where tribal gaming is permitted.\n  I do not think it is asking too much to require that the Lytton be \nsubject to the regulatory and approval processes applicable to all \nother tribes by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.\n  This bill would do just that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1347\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. LYTTON RANCHERIA OF CALIFORNIA.\n\n       Section 819 of the Omnibus Indian Advancement Act (Public \n     Law 106-568; 114 Stat. 2919) is amended--\n       (1) in the first sentence, by striking ``Notwithstanding'' \n     and inserting the following:\n       ``(a) Acceptance of Land.--Notwithstanding'';\n       (2) in the second sentence, by striking ``The Secretary'' \n     and inserting the following:\n       ``(b) Declaration.--The Secretary''; and\n       (3) by striking the third sentence and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(c) Treatment of Land for Purposes of Class II Gaming.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), \n     notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Lytton \n     Rancheria of California may conduct activities for class II \n     gaming (as defined in section 4 of the Indian Gaming \n     Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2703)) on the land taken into trust \n     under this section.\n       ``(2) Requirement.--The Lytton Rancheria of California \n     shall not expand the exterior physical measurements of any \n     facility on the Lytton Rancheria in use for class II gaming \n     activities on the date of enactment of this paragraph.\n       ``(d) Treatment of Land for Purposes of Class III Gaming.--\n     Notwithstanding subsection (a), for purposes of class III \n     gaming (as defined in section 4 of the Indian Gaming \n     Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2703)), the land taken into trust \n     under this section shall be treated, for purposes of section \n     20 of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2719), as \n     if the land was acquired on October 9, 2003, the date on \n     which the Secretary took the land into trust.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Warner, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Obama, \n        Mr. Graham, Mr. Webb, and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 1349. A bill to ensure that the Department of Defense and the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs provide to members of the Armed Forces \nand veterans with traumatic brain injury the services that best meet \ntheir individual needs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nArmed Services.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, traumatic brain injury is the signature \ninjury of the Iraq war. The widespread use of Improvised Explosive \nDevices, IEDs, has taken a terrible toll. Even those who have walked \noff the battlefield without visible scars often find they have suffered \nthe internal trauma of a traumatic brain injury.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation, along with Senators Warner, \nMurray, Graham, Obama, Webb, and Cantwell, to create a Traumatic Brain \nInjury Program, operated jointly by the Department of Defense and the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, to ensure that those servicemembers who \nsuffer a brain injury receive all the services they need. The \nlegislation establishes a standard of care for each individual found to \nhave suffered a brain injury, improves the coordination of care, \nstrengthen the rights of brain injury patients, and expands brain \ninjury research in the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs.\n  This legislation will reduce the number of our wounded soldiers who \nfall through the cracks and are left to fend for themselves as they \nstruggle to recover from a traumatic brain injury. I am pleased to have \nthe support of Veterans for America for this legislative effort.\n  We have made tremendous progress in battlefield medical care. During \nVietnam, one in three servicemembers who were injured died. In Iraq and \nAfghanistan, 1 in 16 who are injured die. But with the changes in \nwarfare and in medical technology, more of our servicemembers are \ncoming home with serious brain injuries from Iraq and Afghanistan than \nfrom any other recent conflicts we've known.\n  For some of these wounded warriors, the greatest battle comes at home \nwhen they seek care. Many of these returning troops need long-term \ntreatment and rehabilitation long after their discharge from active \nduty, as they fight to overcome the severe disabilities that a \ntraumatic brain injury can cause.\n  For others, there is a different story. Some servicemembers don't \neven realize they suffered a traumatic brain injury until long after \ntheir discharge, because we don't do a very good job of identifying and \ntreating those who may have suffered a brain injury.\n  Fortunately, many of those who suffer a brain injury are able to \nrecover fairly quickly. But for some, the experience is life-altering, \neven life-shattering. We must not fail them in their time of need.\n  Consider the case of Sgt. Eric Edmundson. Eric left my home state of \nIllinois to serve in Iraq. In October 2005, he suffered a severe head \nconcussion when a roadside bomb exploded near him. He was cared for at \nWalter Reed Hospital, then was transferred to a VA facility where he \nand his family felt he was not receiving the kind of treatment that \nwould allow him to continue to make progress in rehabilitation.\n  He would have been stuck there if the family had not found a creative \nway to obtain the care he needed. The family found a way to ensure that \nEric could receive treatment and rehabilitation at one of the premiere \nrehabilitation hospitals in the nation: the Rehabilitation Institute of \nChicago. He is making great progress there and hopes to walk out of the \nhospital some day soon.\n  We need to use private hospitals more. In fact, we should use them \nwhenever they are the best option for our returning soldiers who are \nwounded. In the case of traumatic brain injury, they often have the \nspecial expertise needed, because the leading facilities in this field \ndeal with brain injuries day in and day out as a result of construction \naccidents and car crashes.\n  Now consider the case of Sgt. Garrett Anderson of Champaign, \nIllinois. Garrett went to Iraq with the Illinois National Guard. After \n4 months there, an IED exploded next to his armored Humvee in Baghdad. \nThe blast tore off his right arm below the elbow, shattered his jaw, \nsevered part of his tongue, damaged his hearing, and punctured his body \nwith shrapnel.\n  He spent 7 months at Walter Reed, where he received excellent care in \nWard 57, the famous amputee ward. However, the outpatient care that \nfollowed has been filled with paperwork and red tape. It was months \nbefore the VA recognized that Garrett had suffered a traumatic brain \ninjury. He has not received the kind of treatment for brain injury that \ncould make a significant difference in the trajectory of his \nrehabilitation.\n  We need to change the way we handle patients with traumatic brain \ninjury, so that they receive the care they need at the time they need \nit.\n  The legislation I am introducing takes a comprehensive approach to \ndealing with the traumatic brain injuries that plague our troops and \nveterans.\n  First, this legislation would establish a Traumatic Brain Injury \nProgram, run by DOD and the VA, to provide treatment and rehabilitation \nto servicemembers and veterans who have suffered a service-connected \ntraumatic brain injury.\n  Second, this bill would establish a standard of care for the \nparticipants in the TBI Program. Specifically, each individual in the \nprogram shall be provided ``the highest quality of care possible based \non the medical judgment of qualified medical professionals in \nfacilities that most appropriately meet the specific needs of the \nindividual. ``And they shall be rehabilitated to the fullest extent \npossible using the most up-to-date medical technology, medical \nrehabilitation practices, and medical expertise available.''\n\n[[Page S5875]]\n\n  That's the standard of care we should provide to these injured troops \nwho gave so much of themselves for us. They should receive the best we \nhave to give.\n  Third, the measure would direct the Defense Department to develop and \nadminister a standardized cognitive pre-test, which would be \nadministered to all military personnel prior to deployment and again \nupon return from deployment to determine if they have suffered a brain \ninjury.\n  It also would require DOD and the VA to refer any servicemember or \nveteran for TBI screening if it is found, in the course of later \ntreatment or contacts, that the servicemember or veteran may have \nsuffered a service-connected brain injury.\n  Anyone found to have suffered a traumatic brain injury would be \nenrolled in the TBI program and receive the care they need.\n  One of the things the families of TBI patients complain most about is \nthe confusion that surrounds their efforts to ensure that their loved \none received all needed care. The fourth thing this measure would do is \nto direct DOD and the VA to assign each patient a lead case manager to \nease the stress on the patient and family, facilitate navigation \nthrough the DOD and VA systems, ensure proper care, present options for \ncare outside of DOD and the VA, and ensure consistent guidance. \nAdditionally, DOD and the VA would assign to each patient a lead \nprimary care physician to coordinate and oversee the care provided to \nthe patient, including all treatment, rehabilitation, and medications.\n  Another complaint of families and TBI patients is that they are \nsometimes blocked from receiving the care they need due to their status \nas either a veteran or an active duty member. DOD and the VA have \ndifferent health benefit options. In some cases, servicemembers have \nfound that, because they accepted a discharge, they lost access to \nbenefits that would help them.\n  Our bill addresses this problem by establishing, for these TBI \npatients, a temporary overlap of benefits. The participants in the TBI \nProgram will be allowed, for 2 years, to receive any of the benefits \navailable to veterans and to active duty members, regardless of their \nactive duty status. This will help ensure they receive the best care \nand rehabilitation available, wherever it may be.\n  Our bill would spell out some other rights that are important for the \nrehabilitation of TBI patients. First, DOD and the VA would be required \nto provide a referral to a medical professional outside of DOD and the \nVA when requested by a TBI patient. This will allow patients to \ndetermine whether there is better care in the private sector that is \nnot being provided to that patient. They would also have a right to an \nappeals process to challenge any failure to provide the standard of \ncare required in the TBI Program.\n  In some cases, undiagnosed traumatic brain injuries may contribute to \nbehavior resulting in other than honorable discharges. Upon the request \nof a servicemember who served since 2001 and was discharged under other \nthan honorable conditions, the DOD would be directed to review the \ndischarge to determine whether a brain injury might be the root cause \nof the actions that precipitated the adverse discharge, with fair \nreconsideration of the discharge if such evidence is found.\n  Similarly, the VA would be required to make available, upon request, \nan appeals process to update the disability rating of a veteran who is \nfound to have suffered a traumatic brain injury.\n  Finally, this measure authorizes additional funding for research \nrelated to traumatic brain injury both in DOD and in the VA, to improve \nscreening, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation for traumatic brain \ninjury.\n  This is a comprehensive effort to improve the treatment of our \nNation's wounded servicemembers who have suffered a traumatic brain \ninjury. I can't imagine the anguish that must be associated with such \nan injury, but I can imagine the kind of medical system I would like to \nhave in place if it were my son or daughter struggling to recover from \nsuch an injury. This legislation reflects that vision.\n  I thank my cosponsors, Senators Warner, Murray, Graham, Obama, Webb, \nand Cantwell, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1349\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
