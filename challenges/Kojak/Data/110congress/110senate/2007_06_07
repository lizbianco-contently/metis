Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 1348, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1348) to provide for comprehensive immigration \n     reform, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid (for Kennedy/Specter) amendment No. 1150, in the \n     nature of a substitute.\n       Dodd/Menendez amendment No. 1199 (to amendment No. 1150), \n     to increase the number of green cards for parents of U.S. \n     citizens, to extend the duration of the new parent visitor \n     visa, and to make penalties imposed on individuals who \n     overstay such visas applicable only to such individuals.\n       Sessions amendment No. 1235 (to amendment No. 1150), to \n     save American taxpayers up to $24 billion in the 10 years \n     after passage of this act by preventing the earned-income tax \n     credit--which is, according to the Congressional Research \n     Service, the largest antipoverty entitlement program of the \n     Federal Government--from being claimed by Y temporary workers \n     or illegal aliens given status by this act until they adjust \n     to legal permanent resident status.\n       Whitehouse (for Coburn/DeMint) modified amendment No. 1311 \n     (to amendment No. 1150), to require the enforcement of \n     existing border security and immigration laws and \n     Congressional approval before amnesty can be granted.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill be 1 hour for debate prior to a vote on amendment No. 1311, as \nmodified, and the motion to invoke cloture on the substitute amendment \nNo. 1150, with the time equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees.\n  If no one yields time, time will be charged equally to both sides.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I understand Senator Coburn will be here \nshortly and has some time set aside. He indicated he will yield some \ntime to me. I will take a couple of minutes.\n  First, there are not any of my colleagues on the floor, but I assume \nthe objection that was received last night to my request to dispense \nwith the current business and make pending my amendment No. 1323 will \nstill be in effect. I renew it, and if any change has been made with \nregard to it, I hope they will permit it, but I assume, based on what I \nknow, that there is still an objection to bringing up that amendment.\n  I have quite a number of amendments, 10 or more amendments, that have \nbeen filed but cannot be made pending because it requires unanimous \nconsent to move those amendments to pending status, and that means if \ncloture is granted later this morning, those amendments will not be on \nthe list and cannot be given a vote.\n  I am not trying to run around and move something through to which I \nunderstand there is an objection, but I want to make the point that a \nnumber of Senators have a number of important amendments that are filed \nbut cannot be made pending, and they will fall and not get a vote if we \nmove forward with this premature cloture vote. So I strongly object to \ncloture. I believe it denies us the right to amend this bill which is \nseriously flawed.\n\n  I note that the particular amendment I want to bring up is named for \nCharlie Norwood, a Congressman from Georgia, who died recently. He was \na tremendous patriot who shared my\n\n[[Page S7272]]\n\nconcern. We worked together in drafting his amendment that was \nintroduced in the House which was designed to clarify that local law \nenforcement officers have an opportunity to participate in enforcement \nof Federal immigration laws simply as they go about their normal course \nof duties. If they arrest someone for speeding or some offense of that \nkind, then they could check their records, and if they are here \nillegally, they could detain them for Federal officials.\n  Actually, in many instances, that is still doable today, but in a \ncouple of areas it is vague. The lawyers for the departments have \nobjected to their police officers participating because they think \nthere might be a problem.\n  This is a critically important amendment. If it is not adopted, it \nindicates to me that the persons pushing this legislation do not want \nit to work because there are 600,000 to 800,000 State and local law \nenforcement officers and only about 1,200 ICE agents and only a \nfraction of them not on the border, 2,000, something of that nature of \nICE agents. They cannot cover this country. They have to rely on State \nand local officers, who, by the way, caught individuals during their \ncrime sprees or plans to attack us on 9/11. They were apprehended in \ntraffic stops. John Malvo was apprehended. Other terrorists have been \napprehended for speeding but let go because the local officers were not \nparticipating effectively in the system.\n  One of the weaknesses of this bill is that the professionals who \nunderstand how this system works were not invited and were not in the \nroom with the people who wrote this political bill. A bunch of \npoliticians wrote it. They did not understand sufficiently the details \nthat are critical to a successful report.\n  I note that Kent Lundgren, former chairman of the National \nAssociation of Former Border Patrol Agents, has said this is a bill \nwhich will not work. ``Based on my experience,'' one individual said, \n``it is a disaster.'' Another said that the system will not work as \nproposed today, that it represents, according to Mr. Hugh Brien, former \nChief of Border Patrol for the United States from 1986 to 1989--this is \nwhat he said just a couple of days ago: It is a ``sell out.'' It is ``a \ncomplete betrayal of the Nation.'' He said it is ``a slap in the face'' \nto the millions of Americans who come here legally.\n  He came here as an immigrant legally. He was former Chief of the \nBorder Patrol, and he made these strong statements about this bill.\n  I see my friend, Dr. Coburn, is here. I know he has an amendment. I \nam glad to have made my comments beforehand and I, once again, express \nconcern that amendments are not being accepted, and we should not \ninvoke cloture.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1311, as Modified\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I understand, as agreed upon, I will have \n20 minutes to discuss amendment No. 1311, as modified. I call up my \namendment, and in that 20 minutes, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Texas be given 1\\1/2\\ minutes of that time to speak.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. COBURN. The amendment is pending?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am happy to wait until Senator \nCoburn is finished, and then I would like to be recognized for 5 \nminutes following his remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That would exceed the amount of \ntime allotted.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. How much time is allotted to our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Your side has 22 minutes 45 \nseconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, let me make an inquiry. I wanted to \nspeak for 1 minute on the Coburn amendment and then for 4 minutes or so \non cloture. Is the time allotted only for the Coburn amendment at this \ntime?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is concurrent debate on the \nCoburn amendment and cloture for which 1 hour is divided equally \nbetween the two sides.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Oklahoma, it \nis my intention to speak against his amendment and then against \ncloture. I don't want to take from his time. That is not fair. So I ask \nthe Senator from Oklahoma what is the allocation that he wishes to \nmake?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I was promised 20 minutes last night. I \nwill be happy to try to finish my remarks in less than 20 minutes and \ngive the Senator from Texas the remaining time.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I appreciate that.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the Coburn-DeMint trigger amendment--that \nis what this amendment is--is about setting right what has been \npromised since 1986. It is about requiring that the existing border \nsecurity and immigration laws we have on the books today be enforced \nand that the fact they are being enforced be approved by Congress \nbefore the amnesty in this bill can be granted.\n  The Federal Government has an obligation to secure the U.S. borders \nand enforce U.S. laws. The American people expect that their laws will \nbe upheld. If the U.S. borders are not secure and an estimated 12 \nmillion--of which 4.5 million or 5 million have overstayed their visas \nand make up part of this 12 million illegal immigrants in our country \ntoday.\n  The United States faces a history since the 1986 amnesty bill of \nbeing overpromised and undersold on immigration enforcement by their \nGovernment. The Federal Government has failed and has rightfully lost \nthe trust of the people. How can the people trust that this time things \nwill be any different than 1986? This is not about having welcoming \narms; this is about the security of this country and the rule of law.\n  This amendment is the first step to help restore some of the trust \nCongress has lost. It says that before this bill can go forward, the \nPresident must demonstrate to Congress, and Congress must agree, that \ncurrent laws are being enforced--laws that are on the books.\n  This amendment is common sense. If the agencies can demonstrate that \nU.S. borders are secure and immigration laws are enforced, then the \nAmerican people have reason to believe that this time things will be \ndifferent. They will demonstrate that compassion, once again, so often \nseen in the past.\n  What will the trigger do? This trigger is the legislative mechanism \nfor ensuring that the Federal Government meets certain legal \nobligations before the process for legalizing illegal immigrants can \nbegin. It is very simple. It will add to the current trigger \namendment. It takes several provisions of existing law, laws that are \non the books, and requires they be fully implemented before we grant \namnesty or legal status to illegal aliens.\n\n  What are they? The Department must achieve and maintain operational \ncontrol over the international maritime borders of the United States, \nas required by a law passed last year by 80 to 19 in this body--the \nSecure Fence Act.\n  All databases maintained by the Department with information on aliens \nshall be fully integrated, as required by section 202 of the Enhanced \nBorder Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002. That is not \naccomplished yet.\n  No. 3. The exit portion of the U.S. visa system is to be fully \nimplemented, as required by section 110 of the Illegal Immigration \nReform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. That is not being \nenforced.\n  That the provision of law that prohibits States and localities from \nadopting sanctuary policies is fully enforced by section 642 of the \nIllegal Immigration Reform and Responsibility Act of 1996; that the \nDepartment employ fully operational equipment at each port of entry in \naccordance with section 303 of the Enhanced Border and Security and \nVisa Entry Reform Act of 2002; aliens with border crossing cards are \nprevented from entering unless their biometric card is matched to them, \nas required by section 1101(a)6 of Title VIII of United States Code.\n  How this trigger works. It requires the agencies that are responsible \nfor\n\n[[Page S7273]]\n\nimplementing these laws and the various portions of them to report to \nthe President when they have been fully implemented, and that the \nPresident review the certifications and either approve or deny them. If \nthe President denies the agency has fulfilled the requirement, \naccording to the law, the President must instruct the agency on what to \ndo and when to bring it up to date. Congress shall then, on an \nexpedited basis, once the President has certified, review the report \nand pass a resolution affirming the laws have been enforced; that they \nhave been implemented.\n  We are not ever going to gain back the trust of the American people \non immigration until we do what we have already passed. It is not about \nnot welcoming people, it is about the rule of law and understanding \nthat only can they have a future if we maintain the rule of law.\n  Why is this needed? The Gregg amendment did several good things, but \nit didn't go far enough. It lacked two key elements. It did not require \nthat existing laws be implemented and enforced. Why is it we are \ndebating that existing laws should be enforced? We are ignoring \nexisting laws. And the Gregg amendment did not require congressional \napproval.\n  A recent Rasmussen report found two-thirds of Americans believe it \ndoes not make sense to debate new immigration law until we can first \nenforce and control our border and enforce existing laws.\n  The bill is flawed because it allows those here illegally to adjust \nto legal status before any of the new or old enforcement provisions are \nmade. It requires those who are here illegally become legal before we \nhave control of the border. This is not about not wanting and admiring \nand accepting the work ethic of those who come here, but it says we \nmust secure our border.\n  Remember Fort Dix, NJ? One out of three of those involved in Fort \nDix, NJ, were terrorists who came in through our southern border.\n  This amendment requires before any illegal alien is allowed to adjust \ntheir legal status that Congress certify the Department of Homeland \nSecurity has operational control of the border.\n  The second problem: It creates a new temporary worker problem without \nfirst having a mechanism in place to verify that temporary workers and \nvisitors leave when their visas expire. We are going to set up a whole \nnew program and we cannot even tell you now when they have exited under \nthe current U.S. visa law. It has never been implemented, the visa exit \nsystem. So we have a system that controls who comes into the country \nbut no control over who goes out. You cannot have a temporary worker \nprogram if you don't know when they come in or go out under the \nexisting proposed statute under this bill.\n  The U.S. visa exit component is key to the successful new temporary \nprogram. The system created in the 1996 bill for the U.S. visa program \nwas supposed to be in place September 30, 1998. The deadline was \nchanged to October 15 and then to March 30, 2001, except the exit \nportion has never been operational. It has never been implemented.\n  The third problem addressed: The American public does not trust we \nwill enforce the laws we have; namely, they do not trust the \nenforcement provisions in this bill, such as the employer verification \nsystem, will be implemented. Congress continues to pass laws that do \nnot get enforced and then does nothing to ensure they are enforced. \nPart of the purpose of the last amnesty was to enhance our enforcement \nso Americans could maintain sovereignty, as President Reagan put it.\n  Specifically, on November 6, when President Reagan signed into law \nthe Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, he stated this \nlegislation would help meet the challenge to our sovereignty caused by \nillegal immigration. He highlighted three provisions of the 1986 bill, \nincluding employer sanctions--nonexistent--to increase enforcement of \nour immigration laws, and legalization of those here illegally more \nthan 4 years later. The amnesty happened, yet significant portions of \nemployment sanctions and the increased enforcement measures have been \ndelayed or, in some instances, never implemented.\n  Americans have a right to question whether things will be different \nthis time. What this amendment will do is ensure that a employer \nverification system, required by the current trigger, is actually \nimplemented and working properly before we grant legal status to those \nwho are here illegally. It is not enough to allow Presidential \ncertification; that will not likely be reviewed. We have that problem \nnow. Congress must review, discuss, have hearings, and then publicly \nvote to certify that the provisions required in this bill, and by prior \nlaws, are functioning. That is when we will regain the trust of the \nAmerican people.\n  This amendment will provide the transparency and accountability to \nthe public Americans want. Not only that, if the public views the \nenforcement mechanism as inadequate and not in compliance with our \nlaws, they will be able to hold elected officials accountable at the \nvoting booth.\n  The May 30, 2007 Rasmussen report revealed the public does not \nsupport or trust this immigration bill. Seventy-four percent do not \nbelieve illegal immigration will decline if the Senate passes this \nbill. Forty-one percent believe illegal immigration will increase, as \nwe heard the group of retired Border Patrol agents state.\n\n  Interestingly, if those polled had a chance to improve the \nlegislation, 75 percent would make changes to increase border security \nmeasures and reduce illegal immigration. Sixty-five percent of \nAmericans are willing to accept a compromise on illegal status if you \ncan assure them the rest of the laws are going to be enforced. This \nbill does not require that, and what they are going to get is the same \nthing they got in 1986.\n  What this amendment will do is to help improve enforcement at the \nborders. It will reduce illegal immigration, it will give the public \nconfidence, and it will give elected officials the opportunity to vote \non the status of where we are in terms of enforcing the law.\n  How did we get here? We got here through well-intentioned mistakes. \nWe got here because we gave amnesty in 1986. We said we were going to \nhave employer verification, and we told the American people the borders \nwould be secure. What this amendment does is, it says: Fool me the \nfirst time, shame on you. Fool me the second time, shame on me. What \nthis amendment does is assures the American people that this time, as \nwe grant amnesty to those who came here illegally, it is not going to \nhappen again.\n  There is no assurance in this bill that this is not a repeat of 1986. \nIt is not about not being compassionate to those who are here and are \ncontributing. It is not about saying no. As a matter of fact, 65 \npercent of the American people want to say yes, if you can prove to \nthem things are going to be different this time. However, under this \nbill, there is nothing that will say things will be different.\n  I praise the people who worked on this bill, who put together this \ncompromise. But I think history points us in a direction that says we \nhave to have proof this time. We have to know if we do this again, with \nat least 12 million people, if we grant amnesty--and I know the \nPresident says it is not amnesty, but if you come here illegally and \neventually are legal, that is amnesty--if we are willing to do that, \nthis time the American people ought to have the assurance we are not \ngoing to do that again; that we are going to have an immigration \nenforcement policy, an employer verification system, an entrance and \nexit system, and border security that is going to make sure we don't \nrepeat the mistakes of the past. I believe this bill needs a lot more \nwork. I believe it has a lot of complications that are unforeseen, and \ncomplications that we are aware of at this time.\n  I wish to take a moment to thank the majority leader for allowing me \nthis time, and Senator Kennedy for working with me to allow me this \ntime to talk about this amendment. I believe we have a critical problem \nin our country. The President's ratings are low, but our ratings are \neven lower. The trust of the American people in this institution is \nless than a third of the people in this country.\n  How do we build it up? We build it up by passing this amendment. We \nbuild it up by showing them we understand their concerns, we understand \nthey are\n\n[[Page S7274]]\n\nwilling to accept and allow people who came here illegally to live here \nas citizens and get on that pathway to citizenship provided we do the \nnecessary things to not go back to this again. This bill is severely \nlacking in demonstrating that proof to the American people.\n  We have to build their confidence. We have to regain the trust of the \nAmerican people that we will, in fact, this time do what is necessary \nto secure our borders and control our borders. We are at risk, as the \ndiscovery of the Fort Dix belated plan reflects, in terms of our own \nnational security. So it is not all about immigration, it is about \nnational security, and there is nothing in this bill that forces the \nPresident of any party who is in charge or forces the Congress to do \nanything different than we have done in the past.\n  I believe it is highly important we have this trigger mechanism for \nthe assurance of the American people that we have a secure border; that \nwe have a visa entrance and exit system that works; that we have \nemployer verification that works; that those key things are intact \nbefore we grant legal status to those who are here illegally.\n  I say again I appreciate Senator Kennedy working with me in allowing \nme the time to do this, and Senator Reid for his graciousness for this \ntime.\n  I yield to the Senator from Texas.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 6 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  Let me say first I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for allowing me to \nhave the rest of his time, and I don't disagree with one thing he said. \nI agree with his purpose. However, I have to oppose the amendment for \nthis reason:\n  Last year, the House put in the Secure Fence Act specificity about \nexactly where the fence would go. There was no requirement that the \nlocal people, private property owners, cities that are right on the Rio \nGrande River would have any input whatsoever. I do not think Congress \ncan say that the priority fencing is 15 miles on either side of the \nport of entry of Laredo. It might be 10 miles. We might be spending \nbillions of dollars that are unnecessary putting in 15 miles. It might \nnot even be possible to put it in certain places because of the \ngeography and the topography.\n  We have an amendment in the underlying bill that does require local \ninput so that Congress is not mandating, but, instead, the Border \nPatrol chiefs, who have been designated by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, will make these decisions.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. COBURN. Would that not negate the direction of the Secure Fence \nAct of last year?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. It would most certainly--it doesn't negate the \npurpose.\n  Mr. COBURN. No, no. I agree. But it would relieve that problem as you \nsaw in the Secure Fence Act of last year, of 2006.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Would what?\n  Mr. COBURN. Your underlying language would alleviate that problem in \nthe 2006 Secure Fence Act?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. It doesn't relieve the specificity of miles of fence. \nIt does relieve the specificity of exactly where it goes.\n  Mr. COBURN. So that would supersede whatever we had in the Secure \nFence Act in my amendment?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. That is correct.\n  Mr. COBURN. So therefore your argument, I believe, is moot, because \nif you have that in the underlying bill, then that problem is solved \nand you should be able to support this amendment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Unfortunately, I am afraid the amendment overrules \nthat minor revision in the Border Fence Act to which, frankly, I have \nto say to the Senator from Oklahoma, we had agreement from the \nleadership on both sides of the aisle in both Houses that we would take \nout that particular part. But the leadership changed, and we were not \nable to vote against and hold up the bill because it was the Defense \nsupplemental bill to which that Border Fence Act was attached. To have \nheld up the bill would have been to hold up our Defense supplemental, \nwhich of course overrode everything. That is why we waited to try to \nfix that minor part in this bill, which we have done and which would be \nundercut by the Coburn amendment.\n  I find myself having to oppose the amendment of the Senator from \nOklahoma, even though in many ways I understand his purpose and agree \nwith his purpose. Nevertheless, I must protect the rights of my \nconstituents--cities and private property owners. We have to have the \ninput from those local people, and the Border Patrol should be the ones \ndeciding exactly where those fences are needed, not the Congress, most \nof whom have not ever visited Laredo, TX.\n  I do hope we can defeat the Coburn amendment and go forward with the \nbill--well, not go forward with the bill as it stands today but \ncertainly with this part of the bill.\n  I would like to use the remainder of my time to talk about cloture \nbecause I am most certainly strongly against cloture on the underlying \nbill that is before us. Not that there isn't some good in this bill, \nbut this bill is not ready to be closed out.\n  The good parts of the bill are the border security parts. Border \nsecurity has specific benchmarks that must be met before the trigger is \npulled for the guest worker program to go forward. That is a good part \nof this bill.\n  I added an amendment at midnight last night that shores up the Social \nSecurity protection in this bill. There was a loophole in the \nunderlying bill that would have allowed people to gain Social Security \ncredit for hours worked illegally, for days and months and years worked \nillegally. That would have hurt our Social Security system. We fixed \nthat last night. That is a good part of this bill. There are good parts \nthat need to be worked on to make this a better bill.\n  However, closing this bill out now would be worse than the present \nlaw today, or the present lack of law today. We have chaos in this \ncountry with the estimated 12 million, maybe even 20 million illegal \npeople here. We know there are security lapses. We have to fix that. I \nrespect very much the bipartisan work that has been done on this bill, \nbut it is not yet ready. The 5-year sunset of the guest worker program \nis a killer. We could not possibly say that we are going to fix the \nchaos that happened after the 1986 act because there were not laws for \na guest worker program that worked--oh, but it is only going to last 5 \nyears. That would add to the chaos.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I also wish to make sure I have the opportunity to \npropose an amendment that would take the amnesty out of this bill. I \ncould never vote for cloture until we have the opportunity to address \nthe amnesty issue.\n  My amendment would require every person who is seeking a Z-1 or Z-A \nvisa, the people who are going to try to work in our country legally, \nto return home to apply from there. I think that would make a huge \ndifference in this bill. It would take out the amnesty because it would \nsay, if you are going to work in our country today or tomorrow or 2 \nyears from now or 25 years from now, you will apply from outside the \ncountry to come in legally so we have control of our system.\n  I hope we can avoid the cloture so we can work on this bill in a \npositive, productive way and do what is right for our country today, \ntomorrow, and in the long term.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have worked long and hard on this piece \nof legislation. It is a very complicated bill, as it should be, because \nwe have a complicated problem--that is immigration. We have come a long \nway since we started the debate on this matter. It is fresh in my mind \nwhat went on last year when we had the debate on an immigration bill \nthat passed the Senate. Last year we worked long and hard. We had 23 \nrollcall votes prior to cloture. Seven amendments in addition to that \nwere done by voice vote last year. Postcloture, we had 3 that went by \nvoice, there were 11 that were voted on.\n\n[[Page S7275]]\n\n  This year we have had 28 rollcall votes on amendments. We have had 14 \namendments by voice, a total of 42 amendments. So we are way ahead of \nwhere we were last year.\n  I understand that people were concerned yesterday about not having \nenough amendments. I think everyone had an opportunity to offer \namendments. But it is interesting--we had people who were saying: This \namendment that passed is a deal breaker. On the other side: We had an \namendment that passed that is a deal breaker. So I guess whether a bill \nis improved is in the eye of the beholder because there was certainly \ndisagreement about what improved or didn't improve the bill. I also \nthink it is interesting people agitated for amendments and then, when \nthe vote didn't go their way, they were upset.\n  This is a bill we have pushed down the road a long way. I hope we can \nfinish it. I spoke last night--I don't know what time it was, it was \n4:30 a.m. European time. I called to see if Mr. Bolton, the President's \nChief of Staff, was with the President. He was. I didn't want to \ndisturb him at that time of day. But I did have a good long \nconversation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, Judge Chertoff. \nThat was 10:30, 11 o'clock last night. I explained to him how this \nlegislative process works. He asked me to go over it with him again \nbecause he wanted to make sure he understood it.\n  I told him, as much as any piece of legislation we have had here--\nother than the supplemental appropriations bill this past 6 months--\nthis is the President's bill. He has worked long and hard. He has had \nCabinet officers working with Democrats and Republicans to come up with \na bill, the so-called compromise. Some call it a grand compromise, but \nit is at least a compromise. I told him the vast majority of Democrats \nwant this legislation to move forward. I think someone should get word \nto the President that, if this bill goes down with the vast majority of \nthe Democrats voting for this action to move forward--if the \nRepublicans vote against it, he and I discussed what the headline is \ngoing to be. The headline is going to be: Democrats Vote To Continue \nThis Bill, the Republicans Vote Against It--The President Fails Again.\n  I don't think that is good. I think we need to show we have the \nability to work with the White House.\n  I know there are some people who would like us to stay on immigration \nfor the rest of this work period. We have 3 weeks left. It would make \nsome people as happy as larks to be able to spend the rest of this work \nperiod on immigration. Why? Because some don't want us to go to the \nnext two matters we are going to have to deal with.\n  No. 1 is energy. When we went home during the Memorial Day break, \nthere were two things people wanted to talk to me about. One of them \nwasn't immigration. The Iraq war and gas prices, that is what people \nwanted to talk about wherever I went. I spent a lot of time in Nevada, \nbut I traveled to other places in the country. It was the same there: \nIraq, end this war, and do something about these gas prices.\n  We are going to take up energy. That will be what we do after we do \nthe immigration bill. So I know some people don't want us to go there. \nAfter we finish that, we have the obligation to do, for our military \nand our country, a Defense authorization bill. Again, there will be a \ndebate on Iraq. I am sure some will want to talk about timelines. I am \nsure some will want to talk about readiness. I am sure there will be \npeople wanting to talk about transitioning the mission. Maybe there \nwill be some efforts to do away with the original authorization of the \nwar. I don't know for sure. That is an issue some people would just as \nsoon we stay away from.\n  I know people would like us to stay on this forever, but the question \nis, When is enough enough?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote be \ndelayed to occur today at 5 p.m.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object--there is objection on \nthis side of the aisle to moving the cloture vote to later today. Let \nme repeat publicly what I have said earlier, both publicly and \nprivately, to my good friend the majority leader.\n  Republicans are going to need more amendments. We have had 12 \nrollcall votes on our side of the aisle on this bill to date. I think, \nat a very minimum, we need to have the same number of Republican \nrollcall votes on this bill we had last year. I think we can get there. \nWe are not going to get there by shutting off additional important and \nworthwhile amendments on this side of the aisle. But it is certainly \nnot my goal to not get this bill to passage, provided we have fair \ntreatment on this side of the aisle.\n  I do think we made progress last night. I think we can make a lot of \nprogress today. But we are not there yet. So I wish to make it clear \nthat I urge a ``no'' vote on cloture, shortly. But again, having said \nthat, I think we have a chance to get enough amendments processed to \npossibly finish this bill in the near future.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am disappointed because, as I indicated, \nlast year we had 14 votes postcloture. But I have learned a little bit \nabout this place, that sometimes you have to do indirectly what you \ncannot do directly. It makes so much sense that, if people want more \namendments, it would be wise to agree to our suggestion that we put \nover the cloture vote to later this evening. We could process \namendments during that time and have a cloture vote tonight.\n  I understand there is going to be an objection, but I am going to do \nindirectly what I can't do directly. That is, everyone should know, if \ncloture is not invoked this morning--if the Republican leader says he \nis going to recommend to all his folks that they vote no on cloture, I \nam sure cloture will not be invoked. But everyone should know, we are \ngoing to have another cloture vote this early evening. We are going to \nprocess as many amendments, in the meantime, as we can. I hope there \ncould be some more work done on what other amendments postcloture; that \nis, germane amendments. I know of a couple that are germane. I have \ntold people they can have votes on those. I repeat what I have said on \nthis floor several times, what I have told the managers of the bill and \nI have told individual Senators: We are not going to block, as we can \ndo, procedurally, votes on the germane amendments that are postcloture. \nWe are going to go ahead and process as many of those as we can \nreasonably do. If we have to spend the 30 hours doing it, we will. \nOtherwise, we will get a list of amendments that the Parliamentarian \nwill determine are germane, and we will set up a period of time to vote \non those and move on.\n  So I would hope that everyone understands that if cloture is not \ninvoked, we are going to go ahead, and I will get on the right side of \nthe issue, as we have to do here procedurally, to have the ability to \nbring this up early evening time. During that period of time, I hope \nthe people who feel they have not had enough amendments are assuaged \nand we can go ahead and have a cloture vote and move forward. I had a \nmember of our caucus explain it this way, Mr. President. She said: It \nis like running a marathon. I told her afterward that I was envious \nthat she had thought of this and I hadn't because I have run a few \nmarathons. She described it so well. It was Senator Cantwell from \nWashington. She said: You know, about the 22nd-mile mark, you are \nreally tired, and you think, maybe I should have quit earlier. But I \ncan see the end up here now, and I am going to go ahead and finish the \nrace.\n  That is how I feel. There are times during this debate that I feel we \nwould all be better off having walked away from it. It was hard. All of \nthese phone calls coming into our offices, people accosting you as you \nwalk out of the building, lobbying groups for and against this. But we \nhave withstood that. Now, as Senator Cantwell said, I think we may be \nabout at the 24-mile mark.\n  As with a marathon, Mr. President, there are times when you are \nrunning a marathon that you feel euphoric--I feel so strong, I am out \nhere alone, I am able to travel those miles--and then, just like that, \nit can change. Well, the euphoria is gone. The determination is here. I \nthink we need to complete this marathon. So I am disappointed we are \nnot going to have cloture today. But everyone should know we will have \ncloture again later on in the day.\n\n[[Page S7276]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that the cloture vote on the \nbill be delayed to occur only if the substitute amendment is agreed to.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. I know the manager of the bill is here. The two leaders \nhave used a lot of time. If you would like us to extend the time--OK. \nWe can go right to the amendments. Thank you for being so patient.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes of \ndebate equally divided before the cloture vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, what is the time? When are we going to \nhave the Coburn vote, and when is the cloture vote? How much time are \nwe allocated?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 17 minutes remaining to \nthe Senator from Massachusetts. There will then be a vote on the Coburn \namendment and then the vote on cloture, with 2 minutes prior to \ncloture.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am not sure we will need all of the 17 \nminutes. I think we had initially planned to vote close to the hour. I \nthink that is very possible.\n  I thank Senator Coburn for raising these issues. These issues which \nare included in his amendment are not greatly dissimilar from the \nmeasures in terms of adding additional what we call ``triggers'' to the \nlegislation.\n  Let me just go back a step and relate why we have real reservations \nabout the Coburn amendment. When we examined the broken immigration \nsystem--and we have had scores of hearings in the immigration committee \nand the Judiciary Committee--what was offered on a number of different \noccasions said: We can solve our problem just by building a fence in \nthe southwest border or just by having strong security in the southwest \nborder. It is 1,800 miles down there, and we can fence off different \nareas and then use different kinds of technology, and that is going to \nsolve the challenges we are facing with immigrants coming across the \nborder.\n  As we continued on through the course of the hearings, we say that in \nand of itself will not work. As Governor Napolitano said, if we just \nput a fence down along the southwest border, you put a 40-foot fence \nin, there are going to be 41-foot ladders that are going to come over \nthat.\n  What you need to do, as Governor Napolitano and others testified, \nincluding the Secretary of Homeland Security, who said: You need to \nhave a comprehensive measure. You have to have a comprehensive measure \nif we are going to secure the borders. We need to have a comprehensive \nmeasure, which means we have to do all we possibly can to secure the \nborders by the latest in technology, and I will mention that in a \nmoment. But, also, if we are going to secure those borders, we are \ngoing to have to recognize that there is going to be pressure even on \nthose borders. So we have to organize and structure some kind of way \nfor people to come in the front door. Otherwise, they are going to go \nover the back door, which means they are going to scale the various \nfences.\n  We say: No, we want to protect American workers. So we worked out an \nelaborate program to make sure that anyone who is going to come into \nthe United States through the front door is not going to displace an \nAmerican worker. We worked out a process and a system to make sure \nthere are no American workers who want to take that job, there are only \nthose who want to come in to be able to work in those areas. We have \ngone through that in the course of the debate.\n  But you need not only that--if you want to make sure you are not \ngoing to still have some leakage in there, you are going to have \ninterior enforcement. You are going to have it in the employer \nsituation. You have to have that. Otherwise, we are going to go back to \nwhat has been roundly criticized here, and legitimately so--1986. So \nyou have to have important interior enforcement in the workplace. So we \nhad to include those provisions in this legislation as well.\n  Then, if you are really going to have some kind of opportunity to \nmake sure you are going to look out after the national security \ninterests of the United States, you are going to have to know who is \nhere, not that you are just going to have millions of people living in \nthe shadows--we do not know their names, we do not know their \naddresses, we do not know where they are living--we have to bring them \nout. To bring them out, we cannot just do that, bring them out \nautomatically, because they have broken the law. So we worked out a \nsystem where these individuals pay heavy fines, and effectively they \nwill go to the back of the line. So anybody who has been trying to get \nin here legally will be able to do so before they will have any kind of \nopportunity to move ahead toward effectively normalizing their lives \nand moving on to the opportunity for a green card.\n  So it became very apparent that all of these elements work and work \ntogether, and if we accept the Coburn amendment, we are interrupting \nthis whole kind of a process. What we have heard time and time again is \nthat if you interrupt this process, then you have a breakdown in the \nwhole kind of condition and you are going to be inundated with the \nundocumented aliens.\n  We want to stop the Border Patrol--highly trained, highly committed, \nhighly dedicated individuals--from chasing after landscapers across the \nborder. We want them to be looking after terrorists and the criminal \nelement, right? Right. Therefore, you have to make sure you are going \nto have the other aspects of the security measures put in place. What \ndoes that mean? That means internal security. But the Coburn amendment \nsuspends that program, suspends the interior security in terms of the \nemployers hiring the undocumented aliens. With that, it is a \ncontinuation of a broken and a failed system.\n  I would just say finally that this proposal, in terms of our security \ninterests, may not be perfect, but it does provide the 20,000 \nadditional agents, it does provide 200 miles of vehicle barriers, 370 \nmiles of fencing, 70 ground-based radars and cameras, four unmanned \naerial vehicles, detention rather than catch-and-release programs, and \nmany other kind of features.\n  We have followed what has been recommended by the Department of \nHomeland Security to get the best security we could. But the idea that \nwe are going to suspend some of those elements which have been \nintertwined--and as Secretary Chertoff said very eloquently: You need \nthem all. I appreciate the fact that the good Senator from Oklahoma \nsays: Well, let's hold certain parts back until we get everything in \nplace. Our answer is: You better start getting everything in place if \nyou really want to have a secure border.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time and yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, first, let me yield to the Senator from \nSouth Carolina, who has a unanimous consent request to make. I yield \nfor that purpose.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I am speaking on behalf of Senator \nGrassley, who I understand last night got an agreement that he could \nbring up 10 of his amendments this morning. I am not here to speak on \nthem but just to give the numbers and to bring them up, as was agreed \nlast night.\n  Mr. Presdient, if I can request from Senator Kennedy that I just read \noff those amendment numbers.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator would yield on my time, that is the \nintention of the leadership. What we would like to do is try to work \nout these groups of amendments with the Republican leadership. We \nintend to do that as soon as we get to the beginning of the vote. \nRather than make that judgment at this particular time, we would ask if \nthe Senator would defer. We will work those out. Obviously, we are \ngoing to work them out with the Republican leaders because we have been \ninstructed to cooperate, to work and do as much as we possibly can \nduring the day. I know our leader has given those assurances to the \nSenator.\n  I am just reluctant to shortchange the process now. But I will \ncertainly work with the Senator during the course of these votes here \nand do the best we can, and he, obviously, can preserve his rights for \nlater in the morning.\n\n[[Page S7277]]\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the Senator. Senator Grassley understood that \nthese could be brought up before the cloture vote. I will certainly \ndefer to our leadership to work these in, but our commitment to him is \nthat we bring them up before cloture.\n  Mr. LOTT. I reclaim my time. I thank the Senator from South Carolina \nfor doing that and assure him and Senator Grassley that we are going to \nprotect Senator Grassley's interests and that he will be part of the \ndiscussion.\n  Let me just talk about where we are. You know, when you have the \nlegislative process in full bloom in the Senate, it sometimes is bumpy. \nOf course, last night we proved once again the absolute rule that if \nthe Senate is in voting, you know, at midnight or 1 o'clock, we are \ngoing to mess up. It happens every time, and yet leaders continue to do \nit. I used to do it. It is one of the dumbest things we do around here. \nBut, look, this is a part of the process. This is a worthwhile effort.\n  If anybody in America likes where we are with illegal immigration, \nand legal immigration, if they think what we have now is good or \ntolerable, fair or responsible, then, fine, let's try to kill this \nbill--kill it with amendments, kill it with debate, vote it down. I \ndon't think that is responsible. This is one of the biggest issues \nfacing this country, and the question is, Do we have the courage, \ntenacity, and the ability to get anything done anymore? If we cannot do \nthis, we ought to vote to dissolve the Congress and go home and wait \nfor the next election. Can we do anything anymore?\n  I don't like a lot of these amendments. I don't like a lot that is in \nthe bill. I was in and out of the meetings, but I was not one of the \npeople who worked in the so-called ``grand bargain.'' Some people are \nacting now as if it was a sinister operation. I don't believe so. \nEverybody knew there was an effort under way. Republicans were \ninvolved, Democrats were involved, the administration was involved, \nconservatives, liberals, agriculture--everybody. Now we are going to \npick it to death. I just don't think this is responsible.\n  I am getting calls. But I would say to my constituents: Do you have \nno faith in me after 35 years that I am just going to buy a pig in a \npoke here or be for something that is bad?\n  Last year, I voted against what we came up with because I did not \nthink it got better; it got worse. But we have an obligation to try, \nand we should not get all in a twit because we made one mistake or we \ndon't get the one we wanted. Look, I voted for amendments that passed \nand amendments that failed. Get over all of that. This is a big issue. \nThis is the U.S. Senate, the great deliberative body. Are we going to \nbelie that description or are we going to step up to this challenge and \ntry to get it done right?\n  We should vote down cloture now. Cloture should not have been filed. \nYou can't ram the Senate. You can't ram the minority around here. It \njust will not work. All it does is make people get madder, and it takes \nlonger.\n  So we are going to have a vote on cloture, and we are going to defeat \ncloture because more amendments are legitimately pending. But I am \nserving notice that I am going to be a part of trying to help to find a \nway to get to a conclusion, to a vote. Vote it up. Vote it down. But to \ntry to kill it with all of those amendments that are being thrown up \nhere for the purpose of killing it, to me, is not an appropriate way to \nproceed.\n  Our leaders work through difficult times. They are being pulled and \npushed by members on both sides. This is the time where we are going to \nsee whether we are a Senate anymore.\n  Are we men or mice? Are we going to slither away from this issue and \nhope for some epiphany to happen? No. Let's legislate. Let's vote. I \nthink the majority leader has a right to expect that at some point we \nend it, try to cover as many objections and as many amendments as we \ncan. But at some point we have to get this done.\n  Unfortunately, the idea that then we are going to go to a debate on a \nnonbinding, irrelevant amendment by Senator Schumer, if we defeat this \nlegislation, if we fall off into that kind of character debate on a \nnonbinding resolution--we are fixing to drop off into a basement we \nhaven't been in in a long time.\n  I urge my colleagues, let's step back from the precipice. Let's \nlegislate. Let's find a way to take up things. Do we need to take up \nenergy? Yes. We need an energy policy. We need it now. But can we do \nit? I want to be a part of a process that gets results for the American \npeople. I don't know why else you would want to serve in this \ninstitution.\n  I appreciate the legislative leadership Senator Kennedy has been \nproviding. I know it is not easy. His own colleagues and those of us \nover here have been beating him up. He is a nice poster child, and I \nthank him very much for what he does. One thing I have learned the hard \nway: when it comes to legislating, when you are dealing with Senator \nKennedy, you better bring your lunch because you are going to get \neducated. You are going to learn a lot, and you are going to get a \nresult. Hopefully, it is going to be a good one. Good luck.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And a dinner too. I thank my friend from Mississippi, \nand I commend him for a constructive and positive attitude. Those of us \nwho know him and respect him know that he is a fierce fighter for his \nvalues, but he also is an institutionalist. He understands the \nresponsibilities of this institution in dealing with the Nation's \nchallenges.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator has 2 minutes 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, there are going to be few issues that \ncome before the Senate that are more important than immigration reform. \nOur immigration system is broken. This is a national security issue. It \nis an internal kind of security issue. It is basically also a fairness \nand humane issue about how we are going to treat each other. It \ninvolves all of these factors. We are going to have a cloture petition \nthat is going to be filed. There is no sense or expectation that it \nwill be a defining moment because we have heard now that it will not be \nachieved. But we have every intention of continuing today, Democrats \nand Republicans, working all day long and into the early evening \nresponding to some of the questions and issues that have to be raised. \nWe will do our very best, as we did until midnight last night, all \nthrough yesterday, to give opportunities for Members to introduce \namendments and get an expression by the Senate because the country \nexpects us to take action.\n  I am convinced with the goodwill that has been expressed this \nmorning, we have a real opportunity to see the beginning of a light at \nthe end of the tunnel. Hopefully, by late afternoon we will have a \nclear direction about where we are going.\n  I thank the leadership for all it has done. I hope the Senate will \nreject the Coburn amendment.\n  We will have the cloture rollcall now, and since we can certainly \nassume it will not be enacted, we will announce a series of votes, and \nwe will continue to move forward on the legislation over the course of \nthe day.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time. Is the vote on the Coburn \namendment first?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is.\n  Under the previous order, the question is on agreeing to Coburn \namendment No. 1311, as modified.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask for the nays and yeas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Under the previous order, there is now 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on the motion to \ninvoke cloture.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Republican leader is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I said earlier this week that \nRepublicans would not allow themselves to be stuffed on this bill. The \nSenate isn't a factory. We don't push things down the line. But one has \nto wonder whether the Democratic majority has been told otherwise based \non the number of times it has moved to stifle debate on important \nlegislation over the last 5 months.\n  Let's look at the last Congress. On this date in the 109th Congress, \nRepublicans had sought to limit debate only nine times. On this date in \nthe Congress before that, Republicans had filed for cloture nine times. \nOn this date in the Congress before that, Republicans had filed for \ncloture only two times.\n  Contrast that with the current regime. To date in this Congress, the \nDemocratic leadership has sought to cut off debate not two times, not \nnine times, but 32 times.\n  This is what is called a power grab. But the result won't be power, \nit will be failure. At this rate, the Democratic leadership will have \nachieved at least one impressive thing--just one--in the 110th \nCongress: an all-time record for cloture filings because it is well on \npace to shatter the existing record.\n  There is a saying about courtship: Shoot for two, end up with zero. \nSo far, this would be a fitting epitaph for a Congress that has sought \nto do much but has accomplished little.\n  Republican patience was wearing thin before we took up this bill, and \nwe said so, repeatedly. The Democratic leadership knew on a bill of \nthis magnitude, Republicans would do more than complain about it. We \nwould insist that minority rights be honored. They weren't. For this \nreason I will oppose cloture on the bill and encourage my colleagues to \ndo the same.\n  Democrats and Republicans have said from the outset that this bill \nwould only pass if it was a bipartisan effort. Once it hit the floor, \nthat meant minority Members would have the chance to be heard through a \nfair and full amendment process. That is the way to fix this bill.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think the distinguished Republican leader \nhas outlined the problem, the problem that exists with the Republicans \nin the Senate.\n  The reason there weren't a lot of cloture motions filed in the last \nCongress is, as the distinguished Republican leader has pointed out, we \nbelieved in legislating, not delaying. Most of the motions that have \nbeen filed regarding cloture have been on motions to proceed to bills--\ndilatory tactics by the Republicans--and it is very frustrating to them \nthat in spite of that--in spite of that--we have been able to \naccomplish much, including ethics lobbying reform, minimum wage, 9/11 \nCommission recommendations. We did the budget. We were able to do the \ncontinuing resolution. We did stem cell research. We have done some \nvery good work, and we are going to continue to do that.\n  We have spent a lot of time on the Republicans delaying what the \nAmerican people want us to do, and that is legislate. In spite of that, \nwe were able to move on and do some significant legislating, as we are \ngoing to continue to do.\n  As I said this morning, we want to finish this legislation in a \npositive vein. The minority said they wanted more amendments. They got \nmore amendments. We don't know if there is a magic number, but we will \nwork and make sure--I think we are in the process now of lining up four \namendments on each side. We should dispose of those fairly quickly. I \nhave indicated that we are willing to do whatever is necessary \npostcloture to take care of as many of the postcloture germane \namendments as we can. We are happy to do that. This is very important.\n  I spoke last night to the Secretary of Homeland Security, one of the \npeople who represented the President in these negotiations. This bill \nthat is on the Senate floor is not a Democratic bill. It is a bill that \nhas been worked on by Democrats and Republicans in cooperation with the \nPresident of the United States and his people. My message to Secretary \nChertoff last night was that--it seems a little unusual to me when we \nhave worked so hard and we have offered opportunities for all of these \namendments, and we are going to offer more. My message to him is, why \nin the world would anyone object to delaying the cloture vote? But that \nis what has happened.\n  I think that is unfortunate because I told the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, Judge Chertoff, the message in the newspaper is going to be: \nDemocrats Support Cloture to Continue Debate on Immigration; \nRepublicans Oppose It--President Bush Fails Again.\n  Let's have some successes around here. We need to work with the \nPresident. He needs to work with us. Here is a way that it can be done.\n  I know there are people who want us to stay on this bill for the rest \nof this work period, but we have other things we need to do that some \ndo not want us to work on. When we went home for our Memorial Day \nbreak, what were the issues people talked about more than anything \nelse? Ending the war in Iraq and gas prices. So when we finish this, we \nare going to move on to energy--gas prices. When we finish that, we are \ngoing to move to the Defense authorization and again have a debate on \nending the Iraq war. I know people don't want us to do that, but we \nneed to do that. That is what the American people want us to do.\n  So I cannot accomplish directly what I think should be done, and that \nis have a cloture vote that is successful right now. But I can do \nindirectly what I can't do directly. If the cloture vote doesn't \nsucceed, I will change my vote so I will be on the winning side, and I \nwill bring up the cloture vote later today. We are going to continue \nworking this bill.\n  As my friend, the distinguished junior Senator from Washington said \nthis morning in a caucus we had, she said: You know, what we have done \nhere is like a marathon. When you run a marathon, you run 22 miles, you \nhave 4 miles more to go, and you look back and think of all the times \nyou wanted to quit, but right now, as tired as you are from running a \nmarathon, you can see the end.\n  The race is up there and we need to continue. This is a marathon. We \nowe it to the American people to move forward on this legislation to \nimprove a broken system. That is what we are trying to do. I hope my \nRepublican colleagues vote for cloture. If they don't, they will have \nanother opportunity later today and, hopefully, we can process some \namendments in the interim.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, one of the pressing items the \ndistinguished majority leader failed to mention was he filed cloture on \nthe motion to proceed to a motion that would allow us to express our \nviews about the appropriateness of the continued service of the \nAttorney General. There are plenty of people around here who have had \nsomething to say about that. There have been hearings about it, calls \nfor resignation. The distinguished majority leader wants to use up \nfloor time,\n\n[[Page S7279]]\n\nprecious floor time in the Senate so that we can express ourselves on \nthe Attorney General's service, something each of us could do \nindividually at any point we want. That is not exactly a pressing item.\n\n  If we want to finish this bill, the message is clear. There needs to \nbe at least as many Republican rollcall votes this time as last year. \nThe way to do that is not to invoke cloture and try to stuff the \nminority, as has been done 32 times already this year. The way to do \nthat is to process amendments, make it possible for amendments to get \npending, continue to discuss them, finish the bill when we get to an \nappropriate level with our amendments that produces a degree of comfort \non this side of the aisle that we have had an adequate opportunity to \nexpress ourselves on probably the most important issue we will deal \nwith in this entire Congress. This is no small matter. It is a big \nissue, a big problem, and it requires broad bipartisan cooperation to \nbring a bill such as this to a conclusion. Therefore, I urge a ``no'' \nvote on cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have a lot to say about the failed \nAttorney Generalship of Alberto Gonzales, but this is not the time to \ndo that. I may not have that opportunity because the only issue that \nwill be before the Senate is a simple vote on a motion to proceed. If \nthe minority does not wish to proceed to have a vote of confidence on \nhim, it will not happen. If there were ever an opportunity for a \nlegislative body to speak about what is going on in the administrative \nbranch of Government, it is with what is happening in that Justice \nDepartment.\n  All you need to do is read the newspaper today to find out what is \ngoing on in that Justice Department. Should we have confidence in \nAlberto Gonzales? I don't think so.\n  But we are on immigration. This is a day for getting along. I am \ngoing to do the best I can to get along, and I hope everyone will do \nthat and continue to work on a bipartisan basis to move forward on \nimmigration.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

So it doesn't frighten people, the only reason I intend to \ndo that is because we are working on a unanimous consent agreement now, \nand Senator Dodd can speak or Senator Sessions can speak or whoever \nwants to talk--they can do that. At least we can get the consent done. \nWhat we are working on now is to have three Republican amendments, \nthree Democratic amendments. I hope we can get that done very quickly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I wish to make a few comments on the \nprocess and the substance of the bill. I will take a few minutes, I \nalert my colleagues.\n  This is one of the most complex pieces of legislation that has come \nbefore the Senate. There have been months and months of negotiations. I \nwas part of those negotiations, at least on the Republican side, trying \nto put a bill together with some good, solid principles that would help \nfix our immigration problem because I think most people agree that the \nimmigration system in this country is broken.\n  We now find ourselves deep into this process--but certainly not all \nthe way through the process--because of the complexity of the issues we \nare dealing with. Yesterday afternoon a bipartisan group of folks sat \ndown to discuss several of the issues. The more you talk about this \nbill, the more you realize that when you fix one problem, it creates \nanother problem or problems. For example, have you fixed the problems \nwith the Z visa program and the problems with the temporary worker \nprogram? Have you fixed the problems related to when folks are going to \nleave the country? Especially with the temporary worker program, is \nthere going to be a strong and reliable exit visa system in place so \nyou know that when temporary workers' visas expire they are actually \ngoing to exit?\n  That is easy to do, as we found out yesterday, in airports. It is \nmuch more difficult to do when it comes to land based exits. But we do \nhave to design a system that is strong and effective. Otherwise, this \ntemporary worker program will result in millions of people staying here \nillegally in the future.\n  What we have been arguing for on this side is to make sure we get \nthis right. It is too important a piece of legislation to rush it \nthrough the Senate because of other priorities. Right now, I do not \nthink that the American people believe there is an issue with much \nhigher priority than fixing our immigration system. The system \nliterally is broken, and we have to design an immigration system that \nis good for America.\n  In the long run, we want to be a welcoming country, a land of \nimmigrants, but also a nation of laws, where people respect the rule of \nlaw.\n  I have several amendments I would like to get offered before debate \nis shut down on this bill. What fixes there are in this bill, as far as \nwhether people who are here illegally get Social Security, but these \nfixes do not go far enough. On this topic, I have an amendment that \nactually would fix the Social Security problem.\n  When we began negotiating this bill, at least amongst Republicans, we \nsaid to the American people that if the foreigners who are now here \nillegally are going to get a chance to get a green card and eventually \ncitizenship, they must not be put at the front of the line. I have \nheard it argued, that such illegal immigrants are not put at the front \nof the line. That is because there was a little sleight of hand done. \nThey actually got their own separate line. So you have people legally \napplying for a green card from outside the country over here. The folks \nwho are here illegally today, they have their own separate line. They \nonly compete amongst themselves. But anybody here illegally today, who \ncan prove they have been here before the first of the year, is \nvirtually guaranteed a green card, while those waiting outside the \ncountry literally can take years, if not decades to receive the same \nstatus.\n  Regarding the merit-based system that was put into the bill, I have \nanother amendment that would say to Z visa holders: You can stay here. \nBut if you want to get a green card and eventually citizenship, you \nwould get in line with all of the other merit-based immigrants who seek \nthat same goal. Not at the front of the line, not at the back of the \nline, the Z visa holders would get in line with everybody else who is \napplying for a green card. Then whether an applicant received a green \ncard would be decided based on merit. It is a reward system. Merit is \nnot just whether you have an advanced degree or not. Merit means you \nhave had a steady job. Merit means health insurance. Merit means you \nhave learned English and learned it well, taken an American civics \nclass and learned what America is about.\n  We should apply the same standards to the Z visa holders that we are \napplying to the rest of the folks who are applying for green cards and \neventually citizenship from outside of the United States.\n  As we are going through this afternoon, we are trying to figure out \nhow many amendments would be fair. The bottom line is what is fair is \nto get a good bill that will fix the immigration system for the United \nStates; not to just have a process where we look like we have a certain \nnumber of amendments but actually where we design a bill we can all be \nproud of. Right now there are still very serious flaws with this bill.\n  I will not take up any more of my colleagues' time, but I wished to \nsay a few words about the process and about how important it is to get \nthis bill right for the present and the future of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1199\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, my amendment prevents this bill from \ndividing millions of families by making it easier for U.S. citizens and \ntheir parents to unite. I offer it with the cosponsorship of my good \nfriends, Majority Leader Senator Reid and Senator Menendez.\n  The amendment has also been endorsed by over 25 organizations \nincluding the American Jewish Committee, the National Council of La \nRaza, the Episcopal Church, and the U.S. Conference of Catholic \nBishops.\n  Under current law, parents are defined as immediate relatives and \nexempt from green card caps. Yet this bill arbitrarily and \nirresponsibly excludes parents from the nuclear family and subjects \nthem to excessively low green card caps and a restrictive visitor visa \nprogram as well.\n  This amendment does three things. First it increases this newly \nestablished cap from 40,000 to 90,000. 90,000 is the average number of \ngreen cards issued to parents each year. Last year, however, 120,000 \nparents entered the U.S. on green cards. If this bill is really serious \nabout eliminating backlogs, then it ought to set practical caps. It is \nnot the place of the Congress to tell American citizens to wait a year \nor two or three or more to see their parents.\n  Second, it extends the newly created temporary parent visitor visa \nfrom 30 to 180 days. To think that a parent can only be with his child \nor grandchild for 1 month out of 12 is simply unacceptable. Yet under \nthis provision, a tourist can be in America six times longer than the \nparent of a citizen. That is not the America I know; nor is it an \nAmerica that cherishes family values. Parents must be allowed to stay \nwith their families for longer.\n  Third, this amendment prevents collective punishment for parent \nvisitor visa overstays. Under this bill, if the overstay rate exceeds 7 \npercent for 2 years, either all nationals of countries with high \noverstay rates can be barred or the entire program can terminated. This \ntype of collective punishment is wrong and unjust. We should not punish \nlaw abiding people because of the misdeeds of others.\n  My amendment does not strike at this bill's core; nor is it a \npartisan\n\n[[Page S7281]]\n\nissue. It is one of basic fairness to our fellow citizens. I especially \nreject the notion that imposing such excessive restrictions are \nnecessary to reduce ``chain migration.'' The fact is that once parents \nof citizens obtain visas, they usually complete the family unit and are \nnot likely to sponsor others.\n  What is at stake here is whether Congress should dictate to U.S. \ncitizens if and when they can unite with their parents; if and when \ntheir parents can come and be with their grandchildren; if and when \nU.S. citizens can care for their sick parents here on American soil.\n  It is our duty to remove as many obstacles as we can for our fellow \ncitizens to be with their parents. None of us would stand for anyone \ndictating the terms of that union to us. Why should we then apply a \ndouble standard for other citizens of this country? We must craft a law \nthat is tough yet just.\n  I know that the distinguished ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Specter, may raise a question with respect to how \nthe Dodd-Menendez amendment is currently drafted, arguing that by \nupping the subceiling on parent immigrant visas from 40,000 to 90,000 \nannually, my amendment introduces discretion to the Department of \nHomeland Security in deciding what to do on issuing family immigrant \nvisas among the subceilings as we get close to the annual cap of \n567,000 contained in the bill.\n  I would have preferred to raise the overall 567,000 annual cap \ncurrently in the bill by the additional 50,000--the increase my \namendment provides for the parent immigrant visa subceiling.\n  But had I done so, I would likely have faced a 60-vote threshold due \nto a budget point of order as my colleague Senator Menendez did last \nnight on his family unification amendment.\n  There is nothing scientific about the 567,000 annual immigrant visa \ncap currently contained in the bill. Am I to believe that this grand \ncompromise bill will be destroyed if an additional 50,000 parents of \nAmerican citizens are granted green cards annually so they can be \ncloser to their American children and American grandchildren?\n  The so called discretionary authority granted to the Department of \nHomeland Security that Senator Specter may argue is created by this \namendment can easily be fixed in conference by raising the current cap \nby 50,000.\n  I refuse to let the technicalities of the subceilings and overall \nceilings contained in this complex legislation cloud the real issue \nSenators will be deciding as they cast their votes on this amendment; \nnamely, do my colleagues believe that parents and grandparents are \nimportant members of the American nuclear family or do they believe \nthat they are merely distant relatives--irrelevant to the daily lives \nof our families?\n  I believe the former. I would suspect most of my colleagues do as \nwell.\n  And so, I urge my colleagues not to think of this amendment in terms \nof numbers and caps, but in terms of its human impact. I urge them to \nvote for it in order to remove the obstacles created by this bill which \nwill prevent American citizens--we are talking about American \ncitizens--from having their loving parents be with them to share the \njoys and challenges of the American family.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe list of organizations supporting this amendment at the end of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DODD. I will cite a couple of them for my colleagues. The 25 or \n30 organizations include the American Jewish Committee, the National \nCouncil of La Raza, the Episcopal Church, the U.S. Conference of \nCatholic Bishops, among many other organizations; Asian American \norganizations, Asian American Justice Center. There is a long list \nhere. As I say, I will include that as requested in the Record.\n  But, again, Mr. President, this ought not to be a complicated \nproposal for my colleagues. It is one that I think all of us should \nendorse and support. I don't see this violating the core agreement. It \nis not the deal breaker that we hear about, but it is merely doing what \nI think most Americans and most of our colleagues would agree on: \nletting U.S. citizens have the opportunity, at least to a larger extent \nthan this bill would allow, to have their parents be a part of the \nfamily unit, that nuclear family.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       Dear Senators: We, the undersigned organizations, write to \n     share with you our support of the Dodd amendment to the \n     proposed immigration bill. Under current law, parents of U.S. \n     citizens are defined as immediate relatives, along with \n     spouses and minor children, and are exempt from visa \n     limitations.\n       The proposed legislation removes them from this category, \n     subjects them to an annual cap of 40,000 green cards, and \n     creates a new parent visitor visa category that would allow \n     them to stay in the United States for only 30 days. \n     Typically, 90,000 visas are issued each year to parents--the \n     proposal reduces the number of visas available by more than \n     half. The agreement also penalizes all parents from a \n     particular country by barring them from entering into the \n     United States should the rate of overstay of parents from \n     that country be above 7 percent in two consecutive years.\n       The debate around this provision goes to the heart of the \n     value we place on family. Parents are not distant relatives \n     but absolutely vital members to most families. Often, parents \n     enable their adult children to work by providing free and \n     trusted care for their grandchildren. Immigrant parents also \n     contribute their labor and talents to small, family owned \n     businesses. The American economy also benefits from having \n     dollars earned here, be spent here instead of having to be \n     sent overseas to family members left behind.\n       Contrary to some arguments, immigrant parents coming \n     through the family system will not burden taxpayers or the \n     economy. In fact, as non-citizens, they are generally \n     ineligible for a majority of federal public benefits unless \n     they earn them through sufficient work. Moreover, their adult \n     children must sign affidavits of support and prove that they \n     have sufficient resources to support their parents.\n       The Dodd amendment recognizes these close family ties and \n     the economic and societal benefits that accrue when they are \n     honored by:\n       Increasing the green card cap to 90,000. The number 90,000 \n     represents the average annual number of green cards issued to \n     parents. The proposed bill slashes this number by more than \n     half to 40,000. This amendment would ensure that sufficient \n     numbers of green cards are available for parents to come to \n     the United States.\n       Extending the parent visa to 180 days, and making it \n     renewable and valid for three years. These are already \n     accepted timeframes for other temporary visas, 180 days is \n     the length of a tourist visa; H-1Bs are valid for three \n     years. The proposed bill, however, limits parents to an \n     annual stay of 30 days, and does not specify long-term \n     validity. This is too short an allotment--particularly for \n     parents who come to help their children.\n       Making penalties for parent visa overstays applicable only \n     to guilty parties. The proposed bill states that if the \n     overstay rate among visa holders exceeds 7 percent for two \n     years, all nationals of countries with high overstay rates \n     can be barred from this visa program or the program can be \n     terminated. Sponsors of overstays are also barred from \n     sponsoring other aliens on this visa. This amendment strikes \n     language that unfairly collectively punishes those who have \n     not violated the law, allowing law-abiding parents to \n     continue to unite with their children.\n       The Dodd amendment unites parents with their families in \n     the U.S. by increasing the annual cap on green cards for \n     parents; extending the duration of the parent visa; and \n     ensuring that penalties imposed on overstays are not unfairly \n     applied to others.

The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senators \nDurbin and Boxer as cosponsors of amendment No. 1392.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to offer strong support for \nSenator Dodd's amendment. I appreciate his leadership. I am proud to be \na cosponsor of this amendment in order to protect, again, the right of \nU.S. citizens.\n  Before I get to the heart of what Senator Dodd seeks to do, I think \nit is time for a little review of where we are. I do not quite \nunderstand the process of a grand bargain in which there are alleged \ncore elements of it that are inviolate, that cannot be touched, and \nthen see amendment after amendment, such as confidentiality, that \nundermine the ability of the earned legalization process and others \nthat ultimately seem to undermine the efforts of what I thought was \nthat grand bargain, and yet don't seem to disrupt the apple cart. Yet \nwhen amendments such as the family reunification amendment I offered \nlast night, the one that Senator Dodd is offering now, when they are \nraised: Oh, this will be a deal killer. This bill has become more \npunitive. It has become more onerous. It has become more impossible to \nachieve comprehensive immigration reform with every amendment that has \npassed. It has moved increasingly to the right in the process--on \nconfidentiality, on Social Security, on earned-income tax credit, on \nincarceration, on visa revocation. The list goes on and on.\n  Yet the grand bargainers don't seem to be affected by those. But when \nwe try to keep families together, it is a calamity.\n  Under current law, we recognize that parents are integral to the \nfamily structure and that they remain so even after their children have \ngrown up. That has been our bedrock principle. As such, we correctly \ncharacterize parents as part of an immediate family which exempts them \nfrom the green card caps when applying for legal permanent residency. \nUnfortunately, under the grand bargain, it removes these individuals \nfrom the immediate relative category and sets an arbitrary, \ninsufficient annual cap for green cards for the parents of United \nStates citizens at 40,000.\n  This is less than approximately a third of what last year was the \nnumber of visas for parents. It is less than half of the average number \nof visas issued in the past 5 years. By saying that parents are no \nlonger members of the immediate family, I don't know how much more \nnuclear this family can continue to get under, particularly, Republican \nproposals. I always thought, listening to the debates on family values, \nthat parents--the matriarch, the patriarch--were core elements of a \nfamily. They take existing law, the right of a United States citizen to \nclaim their parents as part of an immediate family, and do away with \nthat right and then supplant it with a limitation where we will give \nyou a limited right to bring up to, collectively across the country, \n40,000. By saying parents are no longer members of the immediate family \nand imposing unreasonable caps on the amount allowed to rejoin their \nU.S. citizen children, we are not only breaking up families, we are \nalso effectively creating an entirely new backlog, even as we are \ntrying to eliminate it with this legislation.\n  This not only changes the spirit of our immigration policy, it also, \nonce again, deemphasizes family structure, all without a single hearing \non the issue of family or the value of family in our immigration system \nin either the 109th or the 110th Congress.\n  This is not only about the rights of potential immigrants to enter \nthe country. Rather, more importantly, this is about the rights of \nUnited States citizens who wish to live with and possibly care for \ntheir parents. As it stands under the legislation, the right of those \nAmerican citizens to be reunited with their parents is virtually \ntotally undermined. From a moral perspective, this undermines the \nfamily values I so often hear my colleagues talk about.\n  I have heard the words of the late Pope John Paul who, clearly, from \na moral perspective, said:\n\n       Attention must be called to the rights of migrants and \n     their families and to respect for human dignity.\n\n  I have heard it from President Bush when he said:\n\n       Family values don't end at the Rio Grande.\n\n  I guess when it comes to your parents, it does. But this agreement, \nsimilar to his proposal before, belies those words. Besides the moral \nimperative to keep families united, practically speaking, a breakdown \nof family structure often leads to a breakdown of social stability. \nPeople living with stable families are more likely to succeed, more \nlikely to contribute to our Nation, more likely to strengthen our \ncommunities, less likely to be anything but an exemplary citizen. U.S. \ncitizens want to be together with their family members. That is a \nnatural human instinct. Yet here we are debating a provision of this \nlegislation that undermines the very essence of family.\n  This may be the next-to-last shot the Senate will have on standing up \nfor some values for families. I will be offering another amendment on \nthe new point system that will determine future immigration that, \nhopefully, will give more points to families as part of an overall new \nsystem, but ultimately the Dodd amendment and my amendment are likely \nto be the last opportunities for the Senate to put its votes where its \nvalues are.\n  In this case, Senator Dodd makes an important point. For those who \nargue the chain migration issue--and I won't take out my chain again to \nremind people how we dehumanize family members, and we want to make \nthem an abstract object so we can do away with it--the bottom line is, \nif a U.S. citizen is already claiming their parents, they have ended \nthe chain, if we want to even refer to it in those terms, because that \nparent can only come here by virtue of a U.S. citizen claiming them. So \nit means it has to be their son and daughter. That basically ends the \nchain. This is not a chain migration issue. This is the core of family \nreunification, to have parents with their children, with their \ngrandchildren who, by the way, under U.S. law, that U.S. citizen is \nresponsible for them financially without question; otherwise, they \ndon't qualify. They don't get their petition approved. It is not just a \nfamilial relationship that gives you the ability to claim as a U.S. \ncitizen your parents, you must also show the financial ability to \nsustain them when you claim them; otherwise, even that right is \nextinguished.\n  Here we have a foolproof situation--no chain migration, no public \ncharge, and, ultimately, the opportunity to strengthen family. If the \nSenate cannot vote for the Dodd amendment, it simply does not believe \nin family values.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank the Chair.\n  In a moment, I want to talk about an amendment I will be offering \nwith Senator Grassley to the immigration reform bill. That is amendment \nNo. 1332. I should mention this amendment has been endorsed by the AFL-\nCIO. It was endorsed by the Programmers Guild and by the Institute of \nElectrical and Electronics Engineers.\n  Before I speak about the amendment, it is important, as we debate the \nimmigration bill, to talk about what is happening to the lives of \nAmericans who live in the middle class and the working families of the \ncountry. I fear that in this long and complicated immigration bill, \nsometimes we lose track of the impact of this bill on the lives of \nAmerican workers. This bill deals in a reasonable way in terms of \ndealing with the very serious problem of illegal immigration. It says \nwe must strengthen our borders and not allow people to so easily come \ninto the country. That is long overdue, and it is absolutely right. It \nsays finally we must begin to hold employers accountable for the \nillegal immigrants they are hiring, something the Bush administration \nhas been very reluctant to do. That is extremely important.\n  This bill also carves out a path to citizenship which, frankly, is \nthe right thing to do. But also what this bill does not do is analyze \neffectively the impact of various aspects of this legislation--the \nguest worker program, H-1B program--on the lives of American workers. \nThe basic premise under which this bill operates in those areas is a \nfalse one. What it says is there are\n\n[[Page S7283]]\n\njobs out there, large numbers of jobs, that American workers won't \ntake. I think that is true to some degree, but this bill grossly \nexaggerates that problem. Because the truth is, if employers paid \nliving wages for jobs, we would be very surprised at the number of \npeople in this country who would be delighted to hold those jobs. But \nif people are going to pay starvation wages and not provide health care \nor other benefits, yes, it is true American workers may not gravitate \nto those jobs.\n\n  The truth is, over the last many years, there has been a war going on \nin this country, and that is not the war in Iraq. It is not the war in \nAfghanistan. It is the war being waged against the American middle \nclass, the American standard of living, and, indeed, the American dream \nitself. This is an issue, unfortunately, we do not discuss enough on \nthe floor of the Senate. It is not discussed enough in the corporate \nmedia.\n  The American public understands that since President George Bush has \nbeen in office, over 5.4 million more Americans have slipped out of the \nmiddle class and into poverty. The American people understand that \nnearly 7 million more Americans have lost their health insurance, and \nwe are now almost at the level of 47 million Americans without health \ninsurance. The American people understand that for the average American \nfamily, their income has fallen by over $1,200 and 3 million more \nAmericans have lost their pensions.\n  What does all of this have to do with the immigration bill? It has \neverything to do with the immigration bill, because we have to take a \nhard look at what various aspects of this bill do in terms of bringing \nworkers into this country and what it means to people who are \nstruggling on $8 or $9 an hour or, in fact, what it means to young \npeople who someday aspire to hold a professional position. That is an \nissue we have not focused enough attention on.\n  Some people say: Yes, it is true, poverty is increasing. Yes, it is \ntrue, there are millions of people working at the minimum wage or near. \nBut if you have a college degree, you don't have to worry. There are \nplenty of these good professional jobs out there that pay people good \nwages. The truth is, even college graduates in today's economy are not \ngetting ahead. From the years 2000 through 2004, we have seen the wages \nof college graduates decline by 5 percent. According to a new study by \nresearchers at MIT, earnings of the average American worker with an \nundergraduate degree have not kept up with gains in productivity over \nthe last 25 years. In other words, despite an explosion in technology \nand worker productivity over the past 30 years, millions of American \nworkers, including college graduates, are working longer hours for \nlower wages. In America today, the personal savings rate is below zero. \nPeople are spending more than is coming in. That has not happened since \nthe Great Depression. Home foreclosures are at their highest level in \nnearly four decades.\n  What I fear the most is if we keep going in the direction in which we \nare moving now economically, what we are going to see is our children \nare going to have a lower standard of living than we do. In fact, \naccording to a recent joint study by the Pew Charitable Trust and \nBrookings Institute, men in their thirties earned on average 12 percent \nless in 2004 than their fathers did in 1974, after adjusting for \ninflation. Incredibly, men today are earning less than their fathers \ndid despite a huge explosion in technology and worker productivity.\n  In addition, it is important to note that over the last 6 years, this \ncountry has lost more than 3 million good-paying manufacturing jobs.\n  Why do I raise that within the context of an immigration bill? I \nraise that because the argument of all the large corporations that are \nsupporting this legislation is: My goodness, we have a crisis in \nAmerica. It is that wages are going down. It is not that more and more \nAmericans are losing their health care and their pensions. The crisis \nis, supposedly, there are all these jobs out there--jobs in teaching, \npsychology, nursing, hotels, restaurants--and we cannot find American \nworkers to do those jobs.\n  Let me tell the business community: Raise wages, provide decent \nbenefits, and you are going to have all kinds of people flocking to \nthose jobs.\n  During the debate over NAFTA and permanent normal trade relations \nwith China--which I participated in as a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives--we were told by all the corporate interests who pushed \nthat legislation on the Congress not to worry about the blue-collar \njobs we would lose. I remember it distinctly. They said: Well, yes, it \nis true. If we open up our markets, yes, it is true we are going to \nlose a lot of these factory jobs. They are going to go to China, \nMexico, whatever. But don't worry because if your kid does well in \nschool, becomes computer proficient, your kid is going to have a great \njob out there at good wages. That is the future of America. Don't worry \nabout the blue-color jobs. You have all these white-color information \ntechnology jobs.\n  Well, guess what is happening. From January of 2001 to January of \n2006, we have lost 644,000 information sector jobs. Alan Blinder, the \nformer Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, has told us between 30 and \n40 million jobs in this country are in danger of being shipped \noverseas.\n  The middle class of this country is being squeezed 24 hours a day, 7 \ndays a week.\n  When Americans get up in the morning and they take their kids to \ndaycare, they find the cost of childcare is unaffordable. That is \ncertainly true in Vermont. It is true all over this country. Working \nfamilies cannot afford quality childcare.\n  When they drive to work, and they stop at the gas station to fill up \ntheir gas tanks, what they are paying in Vermont now is $3.10 a gallon \nfor gas, and in other parts of the country it is even higher. \nExxonMobil earns record-breaking profits and manages to find $400 \nmillion for a retirement settlement for their former CEO.\n  When workers go to their jobs, they are being squeezed as often as \nnot by their employer who is cutting back on their health care and \npension benefits. Then, if workers stand up for their jobs, they want \nto form a union, they are told that those jobs could go to China: So \ntake your cutbacks.\n  When workers come home, they open up their mailbox only to find that \nthe interest on their mortgage payments and their credit cards in some \ncases is doubling or tripling. There are working people in this country \nwho are paying--if you can believe it--27, 28, 29 percent in interest \nrates, while big banks are making record-breaking profits.\n  When Americans go to the hospital, they are told by their insurance \ncompanies their premiums and copays will be going up or, even worse, \nthey are not covered for the medical procedures they need.\n  When they want to send their kids to college, they look at the cost \nof tuition, and they find colleges costing $30,000, $35,000, $40,000, \n$45,000 a year, and people are making $30,000 a year. We are seeing \nkids in this country now--low-income kids--not going to college and \nothers coming out deeply in debt.\n  Now, in the midst of all of that, we have this immigration bill, a \nbill that would allow employers to hire hundreds of thousands, if not \nmillions, of workers from other countries in both low-skilled jobs and \nhigh-skilled jobs.\n  It is important to note--and this point has not been made often \nenough, but it is important to note many of the same corporate groups \nthat supported NAFTA, that supported PNTR with China, and other \ndisastrous trade agreements, that these same businesses that fought \nagainst an increase in the minimum wage, saying: Hey, $5.15 an hour, we \ndon't have to go higher than that; these same companies that have \noutsourced hundreds of thousands of jobs to China, to Mexico, to \nVietnam, to India, to other low-wage countries, these same companies \nare supporting this legislation.\n  Let's understand that, and let us ask why that is the case. Why are \ncompanies that opposed the minimum wage, that oppose the right of \nworkers to form unions, that oppose anything that makes sense for the \nAmerican middle class supporting this legislation?\n  Some of those groups are the National Restaurant Association, the \nBusiness Roundtable, the American Hotel & Lodging Association. These \nare all groups that opposed raising the minimum wage above $5.15 an \nhour, and they are sitting here saying: Well, we think this immigration \nbill is a good bill for us.\n\n[[Page S7284]]\n\n  High-tech companies that have sent hundreds of thousands of jobs \noverseas, they think this legislation is good. Why? Why do they think \nit is good legislation? Well, if you listen to them, they will tell you \ntwo things: First, in terms of low-skilled jobs, they say they need \nforeign workers to do the jobs Americans will not do. In terms of high-\nskilled jobs, they say they cannot find enough Americans who are smart \nenough, who are skilled enough, who are well educated enough to be \nengineers, to be scientists, to be mathematicians, et cetera.\n  In other words, corporate America tells us they need a new guest \nworker program because they cannot find any Americans for construction \njobs, for manufacturing jobs, hotel jobs, restaurant jobs. Then they \ntell us they need more foreign agricultural workers because no American \nis willing to break their back working in the fields, picking \nstrawberries or lettuce for poverty-level wages and no health care.\n  Then--this is what gets me--they tell us they need more H-1B visas \nbecause Americans are not smart enough to be computer professionals; \nengineers; university professors, they cannot find anybody to be a \nuniversity professor; accountants--I guess Americans do not add very \nwell--we cannot do that work; financial analysts; nurses, I guess we do \nnot have the capability of producing nurses; psychologists, Americans, \nI guess, cannot do that; lawyers--lawyers--lawyers--my God, if there is \nanything the United States is capable of producing it is lawyers, but I \nguess we need more lawyers to come into this country; and elementary \nschool teachers, I guess the young people who graduate from college in \nAmerica are not quite qualified to be school teachers.\n  Now, if Americans will not take low-skilled jobs that pay poverty-\nlevel wages and, presumably, if they are not smart enough to do high-\nskilled jobs, I think the question we have to ask is: What kind of jobs \nare going to be available for the American people? Can't do low-skilled \njobs; can't do high-skilled jobs. Hey, what is there for us?\n  I happen to think the Congress should be spending a lot more time \ndiscussing this issue and making it easier for us to create decent-\npaying jobs for American workers instead of allowing corporate \ninterests to drive wages down by importing more and more people to do \nthe work Americans should be doing and, conversely, exporting and \noutsourcing a lot of decent jobs.\n  As someone who, as a young man, worked in a hotel and worked in a \nrestaurant, I can tell you the guest worker provisions, for the most \npart, have nothing to do with a shortage of workers but have everything \nto do with a concerted effort by corporate America to drive down wages \nfor our people.\n  Now, one of the largest corporations that is involved in an \nassociation in support of this legislation is Wal-Mart. I made this \npoint yesterday, but I think it is worth repeating. Wal-Mart says, \nbeing a part of this association, that apparently there is a shortage \nof Americans willing to work at Wal-Marts. Well, let's take a look at \nthat.\n  Two years ago, when Wal-Mart announced the opening of a new store in \nOakland, CA, 11,000 people filled out applications for 400 jobs. I \nthink most Americans know that Wal-Mart is not a great employer. Wages \nare low. In many instances, they do not provide 40 hours a week; health \ncare benefits are not particularly good.\n  Oakland, CA: For 400 jobs, 11,000 people filled out applications. \nMore recently, in January of 2006, when Wal-Mart announced the opening \nof a store in Evergreen Park outside Chicago, over 24,000 people \napplied for 325 jobs at that store. What does that tell us? It tells us \nthat even in low-paying jobs, such as at Wal-Mart, when given the \nopportunity, Americans want those jobs. They want to make a living for \ntheir families.\n  So the idea Wal-Mart and other similar-type companies would say: Gee, \nwe can't find workers to do that work, is just plain wrong. What they \nwant to do is have a surplus of workers coming into this country so \nwages do not go up. So instead of having to raise wages and benefits, \nin order to attract workers and retain workers, what you do is simply \nopen the door and you bring in more and more cheap labor. That enables \nthem to keep wages low.\n  Then we have the situation with high-skilled jobs, with our \nprofessional jobs. Again, we have associations and organizations made \nup of different corporate groups that are strongly supporting this \nimmigration bill, and they include, among others, companies such as \nMotorola, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Microsoft, Intel, and Boeing, to \nname a few. These are corporations with a main argument that we cannot \nfind Americans to do this work, and we need to go all over the world to \nbring in people.\n  Well, I find it interesting that many of these same companies that \ntell us they cannot find workers in the United States are exactly the \nsame companies that have recently announced major layoffs of thousands \nof American workers: We can't find workers. Oh, by the way, you are \nfired. We need more workers from abroad. Five hundred workers are gone. \nWe are laying you off. It does not make a whole lot of sense to me.\n  Let me give you a few examples. A few days ago, the Los Angeles Times \nreported Dell would be eliminating 10 percent of its workforce, \nslashing 8,800 jobs. But Dell, last year, applied for nearly 400 H-1B \nvisas to bring people into this country--at the same time they lay off \n8,800 workers. Maybe they might want to retrain some of those 8,800 \nworkers for these new positions, if possible, rather than simply \nbringing in new employees from abroad.\n  Dell is not alone. The Financial Times, on May 31, reported Motorola \nwould be cutting 4,000 jobs, on top of an earlier 3,500 job reduction, \ndesigned to generate savings of $400 million. Yet last year, Motorola \nreceived 760 H-1B visas. The list goes on and on. It is IBM. It is \nCitigroup--companies bringing in foreign professional workers at the \nsame time they are laying off American workers.\n  So we have a situation where, on one hand, these companies say they \ncannot find highly skilled American workers while, on the other hand, \nthey are eliminating thousands of American jobs.\n  What upsets me is how our young people feel about this situation. \nThese are kids who go to school--sometimes they borrow a lot of money \nto go to college--they work hard, and what they are looking forward to, \nwhether through a BA or a BS or an MA or a Ph.D., is a good, secure, \nchallenging, meaningful job with a decent income. What they are seeing \nis companies saying: We do not want you. We want somebody from abroad \nwho will work at lower wages than you. I think that must be very \ndiscouraging for so many of our young people.\n  Madam President, the amendment I am offering today, along with \nSenator Grassley, is a pretty simple amendment. What it would do is it \nwould prohibit companies that have announced mass layoffs from \nreceiving new visas of any kind, unless these companies could prove \nthat overall employment at their companies would not be reduced by \nthese layoffs. In other words, we are calling their bluff, and we are \nsaying: You can't lay off large numbers of American workers and then \ntell us you desperately need workers, professionals from abroad. Those \ncompanies which are truly experiencing labor shortages would not be \nimpacted by this amendment and could continue to receive increases in \nforeign workers, but companies that are reducing their U.S. workforce \nby laying off thousands of Americans would be prevented from importing \nworkers from abroad.\n\n  The bottom line is, the companies that are laying off thousands of \nAmericans shouldn't be allowed to import workers from overseas. Let us \nstand up for the American people. Let us stand up for American workers. \nLet us support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1236\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I thank the good Senator from Vermont \nfor his comments. I appreciate them very much. I think they are on the \nmark.\n  I would like to address amendment No. 1236, the Baucus-Tester \namendment. I ask unanimous consent that Senators Akaka, Sununu, Leahy, \nand Collins be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I also ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Akaka be recognized for 10 minutes following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S7285]]\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I am proud to offer this amendment 1236 \nwith my colleague, Senator Baucus, as well as the Senators I just \nlisted as cosponsors. It strikes a portion of the bill that relates to \nthe REAL ID Act. These REAL ID Act provisions are not central to the \nbill. We all want secure documents, but REAL ID is not needed to meet \nheightened security requirements. If we leave these provisions in \nplace, the result of this legislation will be to bully the States into \naccepting something they do not want. If we do not pass the Baucus-\nTester amendment, we will expand the REAL ID Act and we will impose \nsignificant new costs on employers, open up prospective employees' most \nsensitive personal information to theft, and create new administrative \nheadaches for workers, employers, and State governments alike.\n  Do not misunderstand, it is right for employers to have to do their \npart to make sure they do not hire illegal immigrants, and if they do \nhire illegal immigrants, we need to penalize them. But what we do not \nwant to do is impose a massive new tax on employers, and that is \nexactly what this bill would do in its current form.\n  This bill requires employers to use REAL ID-compliant documents to \nverify prospective employees' immigration status, and that means \nemployers will have to link into the national database that REAL ID \nwill create. If, as expected, the Department of Homeland Security \nmandates that employers confirm the biometrics of the employee, \nemployers will need to purchase expensive biometric card-reader \nmachines and train employees and staff on how to use them. This will \namount to a massive new tax on businesses, and these costs will be on \ntop of other mandates employers will pay to screen their workers and \nget linked into the national ID database created by the proposed \nemployment eligibility verification system.\n  Our amendment would also lift a burden off potential employees. This \nbill mandates that every potential employee present a REAL ID driver's \nlicense by June 1, 2013, to begin every new job. State government \norganizations such as the National Governors Association and the \nNational Conference of State Legislatures have said these States need \nat least until 2018 to implement REAL ID. This means many States will \nnot even be able to provide their citizens with the documents they \nwould need under the mandates of this immigration bill by 2013. What \nhappens then? Are the people in these States not allowed to get work? \nThat is what will happen if you leave this provision in the bill.\n  Sixteen States have passed legislation or resolutions opposing REAL \nID or preventing the States from being a part of REAL ID. So unless the \nBaucus-Tester amendment is adopted, individuals who live in these \nStates may not be able to get jobs because they will not have the REAL \nID-compliant documents.\n  Finally, this provision threatens workers' privacy. REAL ID creates \nthe first true national ID card system by aggregating every adult's \nmost sensitive, personally identifiable information in one place \nwithout any protections for the data or limitations on who can access \nit. We are going to give to every employer in America access to this \nsystem. This invites identity theft on the part of unscrupulous \nemployees and government workers with access to this REAL ID database.\n  So we know that including REAL ID in this bill is a recipe for \ndisaster. It will be harder to hire folks, it will be more expensive to \nhire them, and it may even be impossible to hire many people. It opens \nemployee personal identification information to identity theft.\n  We can remove this section from the bill and still have a strong \nemployment eligibility verification system. We can lift a significant \nburden from employers and employees, and we can limit the adverse \neffects of this bill on States. The Baucus-Tester amendment will do \nexactly that. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I rise today in support of the Baucus-\nTester-Sununu-Leahy-Akaka-Collins amendment to strip the references to \nthe problematic REAL ID program from the underlying immigration bill.\n  We may agree or disagree about the merits of the actual REAL ID \nprogram, but as hearings in the Judiciary Committee and the Homeland \nSecurity and Government Affairs Committee have shown, REAL ID is far \nfrom being ready for primetime. In fact, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity has not even released final regulations directing the States \non REAL ID implementation. With 260 million drivers in this country, I \ndo not see how we could have the massive national databases required by \nREAL ID and this immigration bill up and running by the 2013 deadline \nset in this bill.\n  In addition to numerous privacy and civil liberties concerns, REAL ID \nis an unfunded mandate that could cost the States in excess of $23 \nbillion. Opposition spans the political spectrum, from the right to the \nleft. A large number of States have expressed concerns with the \nmandates of the REAL ID Act by enacting bills and resolutions in \nopposition. Georgia, Washington, Oklahoma, and Montana have gone so far \nas to indicate that they intend to refuse compliance with it. The \nNational Conference of State Legislatures and the National Governors \nAssociation have expressed concerns about the costs imposed on the \nStates. The reaction to the unfunded mandates of the REAL ID Act is a \ngood example of what happens when the Federal Government imposes itself \nrather than working to create cooperation and partnership.\n  On top of that, even though they are not even in production yet, REAL \nID cards are rapidly becoming a de facto national ID card--since they \nwill be needed to enter courthouses, airports, Federal buildings, and \nnow workplaces all across the country. In my opinion, REAL ID raises \nmultiple constitutional issues whose legal challenges could delay final \nimplementation for years.\n  For any new immigration measures to be effective, they must be well \ndesigned. Forcing employers, employees, and the States to use this \ntroublesome national ID card will slow down the hiring process, stifle \ncommerce, and not serve as an effective strategy. As a result, we \nshould not jeopardize the future success of the immigration reforms \nsought in this legislation by tying REAL ID too closely to it. I do not \nsee how it is possible for all of the States to have their new license \nprograms up and running by the 2013 deadline called for in this bill. \nThus, I think that instead of mandating REAL ID in this bill, we should \nsupport the Baucus-Tester amendment to strip REAL ID from this bill and \nput together a workable employment verification system that does not \nneedlessly burden every legal job seeker in this country with the \nonerous and problematic requirements of REAL ID.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I rise today in support of an amendment \nwith my good friend from Montana, Jon Tester. Our amendment would \nrepeal all references to REAL ID in the immigration bill.\n  Supreme Court Justice William Douglas once wrote that ``the right to \nbe let alone is indeed the beginning of all freedom.''\n  If the right to be let alone is the beginning of all freedom, then \nReal ID is a step toward the end.\n  REAL ID creates the framework for a national ID card and is a big \nFederal unfunded mandate. In sum, REAL ID requires two things:\n  No. 1, Federal agencies can only accept State-issued driver's \nlicenses in compliance with new Federal regulations. These new \nregulations would require all State-issued licenses to include a \ncardholder's personal information such as their home address and their \nfingerprints.\n  No. 2, this information would then, by law, be accessible by all \nother States on an electronic database.\n  These requirements may sound harmless to many, but REAL ID has \nserious flaws. Three merit special attention.\n  No. 1, REAL ID puts America on track for a national ID card. This \nraises both privacy and practicality concerns.\n  No. 2, REAL ID represents a large unfunded mandate on the States.\n  No. 3, REAL ID poses a potential national security risk by dictating \nto States where their precious homeland security dollars should be \nspent, and it creates a magnet for identity theft.\n  Let me take a moment to walk through these concerns individually.\n  The standardized national driver's licenses created by REAL ID could \nbecome a key part of a system of identity\n\n[[Page S7286]]\n\npapers--similar to a national ID. These standards would require State \nDMVs to collect extensive personal information from all cardholders.\n  To issue a driver's license, the DMV will be required to collect \nbirth certificates, utility bills, and other documents to verify an \nindividual's residency. These documents would then be stored within the \nDMV database and accessible by all 50 States.\n  The machine-readable technology required by REAL ID will enable \nbusinesses from taverns to airlines to collect personal information \nabout their clients. They could then sell this personal information to \nanyone willing to pay.\n  In addition, Federal agencies could use this new ID as an ``internal \npassport,'' tracking American's movements around the country.\n  Americans will need a federally approved ID card to travel on an \nairplane or open a bank account. Seniors will need a new ID to collect \nSocial Security payments. Citizens will need a new driver's license to \ntake advantage of nearly any Government service.\n  Finally, REAL ID requires that driver's licenses contain American's \nactual addresses. No post office boxes are allowed. The legislation \nfails to offer exceptions for judges or police. I can't imagine how \nsuch a violation of privacy could make our Nation more secure.\n  In addition to causing problems for individuals, REAL ID is a \nnightmare for the States. REAL ID requires States to remake their \ndriver's licenses, restructure their computer databases, and create \nextensive new document-storage systems.\n  It is no wonder, therefore, why 15 States have passed legislation \nrejecting REAL ID. Another 11 have pushed bills rejecting REAL ID \nthrough one of their legislative chambers.\n  From Washington State to Maine, Nevada to Georgia, red States and \nblue States, coastal States and the bread basket, all agree--they will \nnot accept the provisions of REAL ID.\n  In my home State of Montana, REAL ID has caused real headaches. It is \nestimated that it would cost $2.6 million for Montana to comply with \nREAL ID.\n  Nationwide, the Department of Homeland Security estimates that the \ncost of implementing REAL ID could reach as much as $11 billion--a \ngross unfunded mandate from the Federal Government.\n  My friend, Montana's Governor Brian Schweitzer, signed a law in April \nthat bans Montana's Department of Motor Vehicles from enforcing the \nrequirements of REAL ID. Republicans and Democrats alike in Montana's \nLegislature voted unanimously to reject REAL ID.\n  I cannot support legislation that requires States to implement costly \nnew security procedures--including security clearances and employee \ntraining--without providing the funds to implement such changes. I \ncannot support an effort to hoist this kind of bureaucracy upon \nMontanans, or any American, for that matter.\n  However, some have argued that REAL ID is essential to protecting \nAmericans from terrorism.\n  Opponents of this amendment argue that REAL ID is required to deal \nwith the influx of people expected to cross the border as a result of \nthis bill. In short, larger waves of immigrants call for tougher \nstandards on ID cards.\n  While I am sympathetic to the concern that IDs should be secure, I \nbelieve that REAL ID does not achieve this goal. In fact, I believe \nREAL ID could harm our national security.\n  In response to the 9/11 Commission's recommendations, Congress passed \nthe Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. This act \nprovided a number of improvements to our Nation's driver's licenses.\n  The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 \nestablished a cooperative framework between State and Federal \nauthorities to make our State driver's licenses more secure.\n  The REAL ID Act ended that cooperative spirit. Instead of listening \nto State authorities, the REAL ID Act dictates to them.\n  We should have stuck with the 9/11 Commission's recommendations. REAL \nID goes a step too far. It makes it impossible for State authorities to \ndecide for themselves where their scarce funds should go to fight \nagainst terrorism. Handcuffing our States with Federal bureaucracy is \nnot the way to protect the American people from terrorism.\n  I will always continue to fight for increased law enforcement \nfunding, but I will not support a law that ties State officials' hands \nwith more Government bureaucracy.\n  I am also concerned that a centralized national database makes it \npossible for criminals or terrorists to perform identity theft on an \nunprecedented scale. We need to take a closer look at how a national \ndatabase would be safeguarded from malicious hackers.\n  We have already witnessed identity theft scares at Federal agencies \nlike the Department of Veterans Affairs, where a simple burglary put \nnearly 27 million Social Security numbers in jeopardy.\n  Now, imagine a terrorist having access to the name, height, weight, \nsocial security number, and biometric information for every American, \nall by penetrating one single firewall.\n  REAL ID is a large unfunded mandate that impedes on American's \nprivacy and could hurt our Nation's security.\n  Our amendment joins the chorus of Montanans and Americans who say no \nto REAL ID.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Hawaii is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to support the amendment \noffered by Senator Tester and Senator Baucus to remove the provisions \nin the immigration bill relating to REAL ID. I am pleased to cosponsor \nthis amendment, and I applaud Senators Tester and Baucus for their \nefforts.\n  I have very strong concerns with REAL ID; namely, the burdensome \nmandate on State and local governments and the impact REAL ID will have \non Americans' privacy and civil liberties.\n  I have introduced legislation, S. 717, the Identification Security \nEnhancement Act, with Senators Sununu, Leahy, Tester, and Baucus, to \nrepeal the unworkable REAL ID and replace it with a more realistic \nprocess to secure identification cards and driver's licenses.\n  As such, I am deeply concerned about the provisions in the \nimmigration bill that would mandate REAL ID given the fact that 15 \nStates have passed legislation rejecting REAL ID. Under the immigration \nbill, every employee in America must present a REAL ID-compliant \ndriver's license by 2013 to begin a new job. This, of course, is \nproblematic as it is unfair to employees and States that have rejected \nREAL ID. It is also impossible for States to implement REAL ID by the \nyear 2013.\n  In testimony before the Senate Oversight of Government Management \nSubcommittee in March, the National Governors Association and the \nNational Conference of State Legislatures, in addition to the mayor of \nthe city and county of Honolulu, called for a 10-year reenrollment \nperiod. The 5-year period contemplated by the REAL ID proposed \nregulations, as well as by the immigration bill before the Senate now, \nis part of what is contributing to the $23 billion unfunded mandate in \nthe States.\n  Moreover, given the numerous problems with REAL ID, expanding the \nofficial uses of this card to the employment context will only make the \ncard more attractive for counterfeiting and misuse. With the vast \namount of personally identifiable information to be stored on the REAL \nID card, I fear such action will only ensure that the cards provide \none-stop shopping for identity thieves.\n  Congress must act to address the fundamental flaws with REAL ID and \nprovide realistic and workable solutions to ensure that States have the \nresources to secure licenses and that such efforts protect our privacy \nand civil liberties. I look forward to working with my colleagues to do \nso in the near future. However, regardless of one's position on REAL \nID, it is impracticable to tie our immigration reform efforts to a \nflawed program that States cannot implement.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to remove provisions \nin the immigration bill relating to REAL ID.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks, the\n\n[[Page S7287]]\n\nfollowing Senators be recognized for the times specified: Senator \nSessions for up to 15 minutes, Senator Webb for up to 10 minutes, and \nSenator McCaskill for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the legislation before us deals with one \nof the most important subjects any nation should concern itself with, \nwhich is immigration. The American people care about it. Many people \nare watching it extremely closely. They are cynical about Congress. In \n1986, Congress passed a major bill that was supposed to fix so many \nproblems, all of those things they are aware of, and the problem has \nonly gotten worse. They have also discovered that our leadership in \nWashington, the executive branch and the Congress, really is not \ncommitted to creating a lawful system. Some people think it can't be \ndone. Some people think Congress just doesn't want to do it. Some \npeople think it would interrupt the flow of labor. For whatever reason, \nthe American people have concluded this Congress is not to be trusted \nwith this bill. We have had for decades--in the full decade I have been \nin the Senate and before--Members asserting they are going to fix these \nproblems at the border, and nothing gets fixed. We arrested a million \npersons last year--a million who were illegally entering the United \nStates. What kind of broken system is that?\n  So people are not going to go for--they are not going to bite a \npromise in a poke. They are not going to take a pig in a poke. They are \nnot going to buy into a bill that is not going to work. They expect us \nthis time to do something that works. I really believe we can. This is \nnot impossible. The more I have studied it, the more confident I am \nthat we can make progress and create a bill that would actually end the \nunlawfulness and create a flow of workers to meet our real needs, \nwithout having so many workers that the wages of Americans are reduced; \nthat we tilt, as Canada and Australia and other nations have, to a \nsystem that focuses more on high-skilled workers.\n  So those are the things that are important. Well, how did we get in \nthis fix with this bill that, I suggest, is losing steam? Like that \nmackerel put out in the sunshine, as the days go by, it begins to have \nan odor. Well, it started in an unusual way. Normally, a bill is \nintroduced--especially a big piece of legislation--and it is assigned \nto a committee. The committee brings in expert witnesses and hears \ntestimony. Depending on the complexity of the bill, it could be the \nsubject of many weeks of testimony and hearings.\n  For example, on the asbestos bill in Judiciary Committee, I bet we \nhad 25 hearings. We had all kinds of meetings outside. We brought in \nexperts and we talked to them about how to solve this very complex and \nimportant issue of asbestos in America. I think if the American people \nwere to rate asbestos compared to immigration, they put it on a scale \nof 2 or 3 and immigration on a scale of 9 out of 10.\n  What happened? A group of Senators met, along with special interest \ngroups and activist groups that want everybody to come to America, and \nbusiness groups who want cheap labor. They all met and talked to a \nbunch of politicians. They didn't have a Border Patrol professional \nthere. Mr. Chertoff, the Homeland Security Secretary, was in and out of \nthe room. They were not involved in the kind of public fact-finding \nthey should have been. They skipped the committee entirely. Last year's \nbill--the one the House refused to even consider--that passed this \nSenate, a bill that was fatally flawed and would never have \naccomplished what it promised to accomplish, should never have become \nlaw. That bill was introduced on the floor of the Senate. For about a \nweek, that was the bill. It sort of sat there, but everybody knew there \nwere secret meetings going on among good Senators, good people, who \nwere trying to figure out what kind of bill they were going to write.\n  So Senator Reid pushed them and pushed them and made it come out \nbefore they were ready. They plopped it down in the Senate the Tuesday \nbefore Memorial Day recess week. They said it was 300 pages. But it was \nwritten in small print, and not the legislative format in which \nlegislation is supposed to be introduced. Had it been printed in the \nproper form, it would have been nearly a thousand pages. It is over 300 \nas it is. They plopped this bill down, and nobody knew what was in it \nexcept those who had been in the room. It is obvious when they \nannounced it, they didn't even know everything that was in it.\n  This is a big matter. It is very important. Now we want to rush this \nthrough. We had Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday--Tuesday being the day \nthe bill or the substitute hit the floor, the week before Memorial Day. \nWe did nothing on Friday, except a few of us came down to the floor and \ntalked. The next Monday--Monday of this week--all we did was talk. This \nweek, we have been on the bill for a couple of days so far, and a few \namendments have been heard.\n  Mr. President, I had 15 minutes. I see the majority leader here. I \nknow he is busy and his time is short. I respect him. If he needs to \nmake an announcement, I will be glad to yield to him for that purpose.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, we have a unanimous consent request we \nwant the Senator to look at. It lines up a number of Republican votes \nand Democratic votes. We need the Senator to sign off on it.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Let me wrap up and then I will look at it. I am \nconcerned that there is a desire to move this bill through quickly. \nThat is the goal, just to pass something. I am worried if we pass \nsomething that is not right, it will not get any better, especially \nafter going through conference committee, where the Democratic leader \nand the Speaker of the House will appoint the conference committee \nmajority and they will decide what changes get made in conference. I am \nworried about the legislation.\n  Let me tell you one thing that is causing some of us to get our backs \nup a little bit about this. The group that met to decide how to write \nthis bill and put it together--that group made a pact with one another. \nWhat they said is this represents the final, real agreement between us. \nWhen the bill hits the floor, if anybody offers an amendment that \ndisagrees with anything significant you and I have agreed to, we will \nall get together and oppose it. You have heard them say it publicly on \nthe floor repeatedly. This goes against the agreement. This goes \nagainst the grand bargain. This is a killer amendment because we all \ngot to stick together. ``We'' who? We have to stick together and cannot \naccept any change.\n  Let me tell you, this is the Senate. The group that met was not the \nfull Senate. I have had members of that grand bargain tell me: Jeff, \nthat is a good amendment, but I cannot vote for it because it is not in \nour agreement. I agree with you, Jeff, but I cannot vote for that \nbecause it wasn't part of our agreement.\n  What kind of legislation is that? So we have that factor going here. \nI am getting tired of it. I wasn't in on the grand compromise; neither \nwere the American people. They weren't in on that deal.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator from Alabama yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am pleased to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I appreciate the Senator from Alabama yielding for a \nquestion. I had several in mind.\n  I have been asked by the majority leader to ask a substitute \nquestion; that is, would the Senator approve the agreement so we can \nproceed with the amendments?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, I have been here since 1 o'clock and, all of a \nsudden, I start speaking and they want me to look at an agreement. How \nmany minutes do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12 minutes 40 seconds.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I wish to finish my remarks and then I will look at the \nagreement, if that would be all right.\n  Mr. SPECTER. It would be all right. The Senator yielded for a \nquestion and I wish to ask a question. Did the Senator make any effort \nto join the Democrats and Republicans, including this\n\n[[Page S7288]]\n\nSenator, who were working on the legislation?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think most of us knew that discussions were going on \nof that nature. We knew the deal. The deal is what all of you have \nagreed to. If you reach an accord, you are committed to vote for the \ndeal on the floor, even if you agree with the amendment that is brought \nup. I was not prepared to tie my hands in that fashion. I submitted \nideas because some Members were concerned about it. I don't say \neverything was blocked totally, but the final print analysis was not \navailable to those not participating and who didn't agree to sign on to \nwhatever was produced between you, Senator Kennedy, Senator Kyl, \nSenator Menendez, and the others who participated in the agreement.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think I probably reserved my independence as a \nSenator to maintain my ability to make an independent evaluation of the \nlegislation that was produced.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If the Senator will yield for one more question.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I can understand that and appreciate why he would not \nwant to give up his independence and would not want to be bound by an \nagreement. But I think the important factor is the Senator from Alabama \nwasn't excluded, if he wanted to join under those terms.\n  The followup question I have for the Senator from Alabama is this: \nHow would the Senator structure negotiations on a matter of this kind, \nas complex as it is, as many views as there are, to try to have a \npractical bill that would be presented on the floor of the Senate--\nrecognizing that this Senator has said on a number of occasions that I \nwould have preferred the committee process? The Senator from Alabama is \non the Judiciary Committee and was an active participant in the \nformulation of the bill in the 109th Congress. But given our situation, \nhow would the Senator from Alabama have proceeded differently to try to \nstructure a bill to present to the Senate?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, when the Senator from Pennsylvania chaired the \nJudiciary Committee, the immigration bill did have hearings--a few \nhearings--and did have a markup, as the Senator knows. But I will tell \nyou that last year's hearings and markup were quite insufficient, in my \nview, considering the intensity and enormity of the subject.\n  I will tell you what I believe needs to be done. It is much closer to \nwhat you did, as I mentioned before the Senator came to the floor, with \nasbestos. When you led the effort to reform and fix the very big \nproblem with asbestos--and I was pleased to support you--you traveled \nall over the country and had hearings with judges, lawyers, and \ninterest groups. We had hearing after hearing. We had markup days, and \nrecess, and more markup days. It went on for months. It was brought up \non the floor and knocked down--and then brought up on the floor again \nand it went on for months. We didn't quite get it done, but I supported \nthe Senator's view of it.\n  That is what we need. Even though asbestos was exceedingly complex, \nthis is even more complex and even more significant for the average \ncitizen. So I think that is where we messed up. I know this was a real \nattempt to get something done. People said we needed to do something. \nBut do what?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I have one final question for the Senator from Alabama. \nI know the Senator from Alabama acknowledges the existence of the \nproblem. Would the Senator from Alabama consider drafting legislation \nwhich the Senate could consider, perhaps in the nature of a substitute, \nas to how we should deal with this problem, which I know the Senator \nfrom Alabama acknowledges?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. We do have a problem, Mr. President. I say to my \nesteemed colleague, one of the most able Members of this Senate, I have \nin my mind a framework that I believe would work for immigration \nreform. A number of the things I thought were critical I was told might \nbe in this new bill this year. But the fine print convinced me it was \nnot there. I believe we have a problem with the American people. They \nwant to make sure this is done in the open light of day. I am not \nprepared to say at this point in time that I could meet and reach an \naccord on the overall difficulties with this bill in a matter of hours, \nor even days.\n  I think we need to start over with an open process and maybe \nsomething else can be accomplished. My inclination is to say let's get \nit out there and let the American people be involved. They understand \nthe difficult choices that have to be made. They are also principled \npeople and want to be sure we do it right.\n  I thank Senator Specter for his efforts.\n  My time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would sure like to be able to get this \nunanimous consent agreement. We keep changing things around and have \ndecided we don't need to have an equal number of Democrats with \nRepublicans. Let's get what we can. We have three Republicans lined up. \nThey are all important amendments that the Republicans and Democrats \nhave. I hope we can get this done.\n  We have a vote at about 3 o'clock. We changed the time to 10 minutes \neach, I say to my friend from Alabama, because people have had the \nopportunity to speak already, except for Senator Webb.\n  Mr. WEBB addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will withhold.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am sorry.\n  Mr. REID. Is it OK that we do this?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Please give me a few moments to review this because I \nhave some concerns.\n\n\n                             Amendment 1313\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to discuss \namendment No. 1313 to this bill which is going to be scheduled for a \nvote later today. Before I do that, I wish to recognize the incredible \neffort that has gone into this bill. I want to be able to support the \nbill. I have enormous respect for our distinguished majority leader and \nthe others who have put so much time into the bill and given us time \ntoday to discuss some of these other amendments.\n  As I said, I want to be able to support this bill. We have seen some \nreal divisions in the Senate on different provisions. I feel confident, \nI feel strongly that the amendment I am offering, which is cosponsored \nby Senator Dorgan, will address what I believe are two crucially needed \nimprovements in this legislation.\n  The first relates to what some people are calling amnesty, wherein \nthe bill legalizes almost everyone who entered this country by the \nbeginning of this year. And the second improvement relates to what I \nbelieve is an unworkable set of procedures applicable to those who are \nproperly offered legal status. I believe it is very important to the \nhealth and practicality of our system that we attempt to fix these two \nflaws in the bill.\n  My amendment would achieve three critically important goals. It would \ncreate a fair and workable path to legalization for those who have \ntruly put down roots in America. It protects the legitimate interests \nof all working Americans, and it affords honor and dignity to the \nconcept of true American justice.\n  If one accepts the premises of these three goals, then I strongly \nbelieve this amendment is the best way forward for us.\n  As a general matter, I agree with my colleagues the time has come for \nfair and balanced reform of our broken immigration system. When I say \nfairness, I mean a system of laws that is fair to everyone in the \nUnited States and especially to our wage earners.\n  I strongly support the provisions in this bill that strengthen our \nNation's borders. I also support the sections of the bill that create \ntough civil and criminal penalties for employers who unfairly hire \nillegal immigrants, creating both a second-class population and \nundercutting American workers.\n  As a point of reference, I did not support the bill's creation of a \nmassive new temporary worker program, and I am pleased to see at least \na portion of that was adjusted by the vote last night.\n  With those points in mind, I wish to address my amendment which \nconcerns the other major component of this bill,\n\n[[Page S7289]]\n\nand it is an area that has not really received the kind of examination \nthat other portions of the bill have, and that is the legalization \nprogram.\n  My amendment reflects a proposal that I have been discussing with \nVirginians ever since I began to campaign for the Senate. I have always \nsupported tough border security and cracking down on large employers \nwho hire illegal workers. I also have always supported a path to \nlegalization for those who came here during a time of extremely lax \nimmigration laws but who have laid down strong roots in their \ncommunities. I do not, however, favor this path to citizenship for \neveryone who have come here as undocumented persons.\n  Under the provisions of this bill, virtually all undocumented persons \nliving in the United States would be eligible to legalize their status \nand ultimately become citizens. Estimates are that this number totals \n12 million to 20 million people. This is legislative overkill. It is \none of the reasons this bill has aroused the passions of ordinary \nAmericans who have no opposition to reasonable immigration policies but \nwho see this as an issue that goes against the grain of basic fairness, \nwhich is the very foundation of our society.\n  By contrast, my amendment would allow a smaller percentage of \nundocumented persons to remain in the United States and legalize their \nstatus based on the depth of a person's roots in their community.\n  Under my proposal, undocumented persons who have lived in the United \nStates for at least 4 years prior to the enactment of the bill could \napply to legalize their status. I note that this 4-year period is even \nmore generous than the 5-year threshold that was contained in several \nbills in the past few Congresses--bills that were supported by Senators \nfrom both parties and by immigrants rights groups.\n  After receiving the application, the Department of Homeland Security \nwould evaluate a list of objective, measurable criteria to determine \nwhether the applicant should receive a Z visa and thus be allowed to \nget on the path to citizenship.\n  Among these criteria are work history, payment of Federal or State \nincome taxes, property ownership, business ownership in the United \nStates, a knowledge of English, accomplishment in schools in America, \nimmediate family members in the United States, whether the applicant \nhas a criminal record, and, importantly, whether the applicant wants to \nbecome a citizen.\n  These applicants would be given probationary status, as in the \nunderlying bill, while the DHS considers their Z visa applications, and \ncould lawfully work during this probationary status period.\n  I believe these provisions are fair to our immigrant population and \nalso that they will help us avoid the mistakes this Congress made in \n1986 with the Simpson-Mazzoli amnesty bill, which resulted in a tidal \nwave of illegal immigration.\n  My amendment would also make the underlying bill more practical. It \nstrikes the bill's unrealistic touchback requirement. Few immigrants \nwould have the money or the ability to return to their home countries \non other continents. Most of these persons would lose their jobs, leave \ntheir families in turmoil, and place further strain on our community \nservices. Basic fairness and common sense dictates that these persons \nshould be allowed to apply for a green card from here in the United \nStates.\n  I believe this amendment sets forth an equitable system that not only \nrecognizes the contributions of immigrants to our society but also \nintroduces practical measures that would help us avoid the mistakes \nthat were made in 1986.\n  I have heard loudly and clearly from Virginians, and I have talked \nwith people on all sides of this issue. What I hear over and over is \nthat Congress should find a fair system that both protects American \nworkers and respects the rule of law. This amendment represents the \nfairest method I know to do so, and to do so realistically.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment when it comes up for a \nvote in the Senate later today.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the issue of \nillegal immigration in this country in a very simple way. As a \nprosecutor, it is about following the law. As an auditor, it is about \nfollowing the money. I state for my colleagues today that so much of \nthis problem is about following the money.\n  We have crimes we can deter in this country and we have crimes we \ncannot deter. Let me tell my colleagues a crime we can deter. We can \nstop the hiring of illegal immigrants in this country if we prosecute \nthe people who are hiring them because other business owners will stop \nhiring illegal immigrants if they see businesses being held \naccountable. This administration has not been interested in enforcing \nthe law against employers.\n  What is hard to deter is families who are trying to feed their \nchildren. And the wall, yes, I support border enforcement. Of course. \nAs a former law enforcement official, I support enforcing the law \nagainst anyone who breaks the law. But let's be realistic about this. \nAs an auditor, I want to be efficient and effective.\n  Is it going to be efficient and effective to think we are going to \nsolve this problem at the border? It is not the border that is going to \nstop the people coming into our country illegally. It is what is on the \nother side of the border. It is the promise of that job and the hungry \nmouths they are trying to feed.\n  So when I look at the raid that occurred in Springfield, MO, a few \nweeks ago when over 100 illegal immigrants were arrested, I kept \nwatching the news for some word about that employer. Silence. With all \nthe raids that have been occurring recently, I think, because of the \nadministration's anxiousness to try to get this bill across the line, I \nhave yet to hear one word about an employer going to jail for hiring \nillegal immigrants.\n  I know, I know, they are going to say the employer down near \nSpringfield at the chicken processing plant--these people had fake IDs. \nThey had fake Social Security numbers. If anyone believes that employer \ndid not know they had illegal immigrants working there, I have a bridge \nI want to sell you. Of course, they knew. You give a good prosecutor a \ncouple of investigators, you send some people in undercover, and you \nwill gather the evidence in short order that dozens and hundreds and \nthousands of employers in this country are not playing by the rules.\n  Is that fair? No, it is not fair, and I will tell you to whom it is \nnot fair. Many of my colleagues have said it is not fair to the \nAmerican worker. I will tell you to whom it is not fair. It is unfair \nto the businesses that are playing by the rules. It is fundamentally \nunfair that many businesses in America are requiring the kind of \ndocumentation that assures them they are they are following OSHA \nstandards, they are withholding for taxes, they are doing all the \nthings they must do, while other employers are paying cash under the \ntable to pad the bottom line. Follow the money, Mr. President.\n  Employers right now under the current law can serve up to 6 months in \nprison. If we would do some of those prosecutions in this country, it \nwould do more to shut the flow of illegal immigrants, frankly, than all \nthe legislation we could ever pass in this Chamber because it would \nsend the message to American employers that they are not going to be \nrewarded with more profits by breaking the rules.\n  There are so many people behind this bill who have hearts that are \nfull of compassion, and I certainly, Mr. President, think of you and \nyour family as I make difficult decisions on this bill. But I have to \ntell you, there are lots of people behind this bill for whom it is all \nabout the money. It is all about the profit.\n  If we want to stop illegal immigration in this country, we have to \nget serious about the magnet that is drawing it to our country, and \nthat is we look the other way when people hire illegal immigrants. \nUntil we stop looking the other way from those businesses that are not \nplaying by the rules, we will never effectively deal with immigration \nin this country.\n  I have an amendment that would also bar for a minimum of five years \nany company that is found to hire illegal immigrants from participating \nin Federal contracts. I hope that will become part of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I know there have been enforcement measures added to\n\n[[Page S7290]]\n\nthis bill that would increase the fines and jail time for employers who \nrepeatedly, willfully hire illegal immigrants. But, frankly, 6 months \nis plenty if this Administration would only enforce current law. If you \nput an owner of a business in jail for 6 months in a Federal \npenitentiary for hiring illegal immigrants and let that word go out \nacross America, you will do more to clean up this problem without \nspending another dime of the taxpayers' money than anything else we can \ndo.\n  If this President is serious about illegal immigration in this \ncountry, I suggest he call his Attorney General and he say to his \nAttorney General--we know they have been given instructions; we have \nheard about it in the Judiciary Committee--tell this Attorney General \nthat we want employers who are hiring illegal immigrants by the \nhundreds in this country to be prosecuted under the law and to spend \nsome time in jail. That would get to the bottom of the problem.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have been told that the Republicans are \ninterested in more amendments. We finished the vote approximately 2 \nhours 15 minutes ago. We have been trying for that period of time to \nget up some Republican amendments. We had four and four, and they would \nnot agree to that request. We had three and three, and they would not \nagree with that request. Then three Republican amendments, two \nDemocratic amendments, and they would not agree to that request.\n  I repeat, it is time for the President and his folks to get involved \nin this matter. This is the President's bill. This isn't a bill we came \nup with. Democrats and Republicans working in unison with the \nadministration came up with a bill. We want to help. No one has worked \nharder on the President's bill than Senators Kennedy, Feinstein, and \nSalazar. I would sure hope we get some help. We can't have Republican \nmembers vote on it if they won't let us call up amendments.\n\n  The distinguished Senator from Alabama is interested in this bill. We \nknow that. He has spoken long and hard about his opposition to this \nlegislation. But it is just not appropriate that the minority can have \nit both ways. They want these amendments but don't allow us to call \nthem up. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Come the end of the day, \nwhen we have a cloture vote, they will say: You didn't give us any more \namendments. They didn't get more amendments because they wouldn't let \nus call up more amendments. And they have control over that.\n  So, Mr. President, I think we need to have the record reflect that \nthis bill isn't going anyplace, but it is not our fault. I repeat: This \nis a bill which was negotiated in good faith by Democrats and \nRepublicans, and it is the President's bill. He says he wants this. Why \ncan't we get this agreement?\n  Here are my friends. I see on the floor my distinguished friend from \nAlabama. I have told him personally, and I will tell him publicly--and \nI have said this before--there are times I don't agree with him, but \nwith Jeff Sessions, you never have to guess where he stands on an \nissue, and I appreciate that. We know where he stands on this issue of \nimmigration. But having said that, can we do this agreement?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I was looking for whoever had it. They \ndisappeared. And also Senator Grassley has to look at it.\n  Mr. REID. Well, he is part of the deal here.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Good. I think the only disagreement we have is perhaps \ntime, and I can make a suggestion on that. Is there someone authorized \nto talk to me about it? I am looking for Mr. Schiappa.\n  Mr. REID. If I could say, through the Chair, to my distinguished \nfriend, we did have this set up so we could vote at 3 o'clock. Senator \nDodd has already spoken; Senator Webb has already spoken. He is part of \nthe agreement. Senators Grassley, Coleman, and Brownback have not \nspoken, so we have put 15 minutes in here for those three Senators. It \nshould be equally divided, but we can make it----\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if the majority leader will yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. REID. Be happy to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I direct a question to the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  What would you like on the timing?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think about 45 minutes per amendment. Some of these \namendments are very significant. We have not heard opposition to the \namendments. Maybe some have spoken in favor of them, but I don't agree \nwith some of the amendments. The amendment of Senator Dodd--I think \nthere are some important reasons that one is not satisfactory.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Is the Senator from Alabama asking for 45 minutes \nequally divided for each of the amendments?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am saying that I am not going to be able to support a \nlot of amendments that are rushed up here to receive votes when \nSenators have very little time to review them. I think this is \nimportant. If we are going through a process just to say we have a \nbunch of votes, that is one thing, but I think we need an intelligent \ndiscussion about these amendments.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is obvious we are not going to be able to \ncomplete the President's legislation based on the request of my friend \nfrom Alabama. I took math at Searchlight, NV, Elementary School, where \n1 teacher taught all 8 grades, but I can still figure out what 5 times \n45 is, and it is a long time--hours. It is approximately 4 hours.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the majority leader yield for a moment?\n  Mr. REID. Be happy to yield for a request of my friend.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, pending is the regular order of the \namendment by Senator Dodd, which has been pending since before the \nMemorial Day break. So any argument that Members haven't had a chance \nto take a look at this amendment--they could have taken it home over \nthe Memorial Day recess and read it almost every day and be ready to \ndebate it right now.\n  I don't want to speak for Senator Dodd--no one could--but I think it \nmight be appropriate for us to consider that amendment in a shorter \ntime span.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it has been now 2\\1/2\\ hours. We have tried \nevery possible way of getting an amendment up to vote on it. We have \ntried this. We have tried that. We have tried this. We have tried that. \nWe have tried everything.\n  There are individuals who don't like this bill. The Senate being as \nit is, they have a right to object to what we do.\n  And they are objecting; that is for sure. The objections have been \nnonpublic to this point, but it is frustrating because the people who \nwant to move this bill forward, Democrats and Republicans, are being \nthwarted in their effort to do so.\n  As I have said before, we need to make sure the record is clear we \nare not trying to impede the offering of amendments. There have been \nsome who oppose the legislation and are concerned there hasn't been the \nability to call up amendments and have them pending. But until we \ndisposed of the 14 pending amendments yesterday, it was thought by most \nto be inappropriate to call up more amendments and have, instead of 14 \npending amendment, 28 pending amendments. I am going to ask unanimous \nconsent in a minute that we vote on five amendments. Originally, we \nstarted the day with four on each side. Then we had three Republican \nand three Democratic. There was objection to both of those. So I said: \nFine, let's have three Republican and two Democratic. There was \nobjection.\n  We thought we had it worked out once, and then the time for debating \nthese was a lot of time, which is another indication there are some \nwho, no matter what we do, we can't move forward on this legislation.\n  I know I am being repetitive, but this is not a Democratic bill. The \nDemocrats have helped get this bill to where it is.\n\n[[Page S7291]]\n\n  The main proponents of this legislation on the Democratic side have \nbeen Senators Kennedy, Feinstein, and Salazar. On the Republican side, \nwe have had a number of people work very hard: Senator Specter, Senator \nKyl, and others. I appreciate how hard they have worked. This is a bill \nthat is bipartisan in nature, supported by the President of the United \nStates. I wish to help the President. I am not always in a position to \ndo that. I think I am in a position to do that now, and I have done \neverything I can with this piece of legislation to do that. So I will \nask consent that we have a series of votes set up. When I finish that \nconsent, I will call up some amendments and have them set aside.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time until 4:15 \np.m. today be for debate with respect to the following amendments; that \nthe time run concurrently and there be whatever the allocated time is \nfrom now until 4:15 of debate with respect to each amendment, equally \ndivided and controlled in the usual form, with no amendment to be in \norder to any of the amendments covered under this agreement prior to a \nvote; that at 4:15 p.m., the Senate proceed to vote in relation to each \namendment in the order listed here; that once this agreement is \nentered, the amendments that are not pending be reported by number; and \nthat prior to each vote there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided \nand controlled; and after the first vote in the sequence, the remaining \nvotes be 10 minutes in duration.\n  I would also say, to show what we are trying to do in good faith, \nwhen there was a request on the other side to have a large block of \ntime, on this side we agreed, 30 minutes, 5 minutes. We want to try to \nmove this along. Thirty minutes for the proponents and 5 minutes for \nthose opposed. The amendments are Dodd 1199; Brownback 1160; Webb 1313; \nGrassley-Baucus 1441; and Coleman 1473.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I believe there is enough frustration to \ngo around. I appreciate all the managers of the bill, those on both \nsides who have worked to come up with a constructive solution. I feel \ncompelled to object to this process because our side has not been able \nto bring up the amendments we want. They have been carefully selected \nby the other side, which ones we are going to vote on. It appears this \nwhole scene has been choreographed. We had a cloture vote a few hours \nago. We are going to have a few more votes.\n  Then we are going to have another cloture vote, with, I imagine, the \nstatement that now they have accommodated us on our amendments. I have \ncolleagues on the floor who have waited a week to bring up an \namendment.\n  They have not been able to do so. I believe what we should do is to \nsubmit the amendments we want to bring up en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, is there an objection?\n  Mr. DeMINT. I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \namendments be called up and set aside: Sessions 1323, Thune 1174, \nBaucus-Tester 1236, Menendez 1317, and Sanders 1332.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DeMINT. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry. I ask my friend, does he object to calling up \nthese amendments?\n  Mr. DeMINT. I think it is important that we decide what amendments \nare going to be brought up on our side. I certainly know folks on our \nside have been working on this. I don't know about this particular \ngroup of amendments, if they have been selected on our side or yours. \nPerhaps there is no problem. But at this moment, I am going to object \nto those and then confer with our side to see what the big plan is. At \nthis point, instead of doing this a little at a time, I think it is \nimportant we know before the next cloture vote that we are going to be \nable to bring up the amendments we have been waiting on. Until that \ntime, I am going to object to additional action on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I would only say to my friend, and those within the sound \nof my voice, I didn't come up with these amendments or the numbers. \nThese were done by the Republicans and the floor staff of the \nRepublicans, indicating the ones Senators had been waiting on for a \nwhile. We are happy to have a number of other pending amendments, and \nwe will work with the two managers to see if we can get others. We \nthought this was a good place to start. But obviously, some do not \nbelieve it is a good place to start. I am sorry we are not able to move \nalong. I say in the most positive way, there is good faith on both \nsides of the aisle to move this legislation. I, of course, was \ndisappointed in the earlier cloture vote, but I was told before the \ncloture vote took place what was going to happen because there was a \ngenuine need on the other side for more amendments. I understand that. \nI accept that. I am not the judge of what is to be enough. We have \ntried hard, and I will keep trying, but I do say everything we have \ntried doesn't work. There are people in years past who know more about \nSenate floor procedures than I, but I know a little bit. I don't know \nof anything I have missed to try to bring up other amendments in a \nbipartisan way. There is no one at this stage trying to take advantage \nof anyone else.\n  This is an effort by Democrats and Republicans who want to help the \nPresident get a bill he believes in, for which I have publicly said I \nappreciate the President doing this. For me to say this, after all the \nbattles the President and I have had, is good for the President and for \nme. I wish to do something to move this along. The American public \nneeds the cooperation of Democrats and Republicans, with the President \njoining in.\n  I apologize to everyone for whom we have not been able to figure out \na different way to go forward. We are going to continue to try.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n\n                           Stem Cell Research\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, a few minutes ago in the Mansfield Room, \nwhich is right off the Senate floor, we had a very moving ceremony, one \nthat brought home to so many of us just what we ought to be about as \nrepresentatives of the people. It was the enrolling ceremony for the \nbill, S. 5, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, that passed the \nHouse of Representatives a couple of hours ago. In the Senator \nMansfield Room off the Senate floor were Senator Reid, our majority \nleader, Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House, along with Congresswoman \nDeGette from Colorado, who has been the prime mover of this legislation \nin the House, Congressman Mike Castle of Delaware, also a prime mover \nin the House. It was Representatives Castle and DeGette who worked \ntogether to get this bill through the House both last year and this \nyear; also, Congresswoman Capps from California and Congressman Jim \nLangevin from Rhode Island.\n  We had this enrolling ceremony to send the bill to the President. \nWith us in the room at the time were people who in their own personage \nrepresent so many of the illnesses and diseases that stem cell research \nholds so much promise for curing, everything from juvenile diabetes to \nParkinson's, Rett Syndrome, spinal cord injuries, multiple sclerosis, \nand so many others were there. You see these little kids and you see \ntheir families, and what they have left is hope. They have hope that \nscientists, working collaboratively, will unlock some of these \nmysteries, will find the interventions and the cures to so many of \nthese illnesses and diseases.\n  I saw there a little girl who had Rett Syndrome, with her mother. \nThere was another young girl with juvenile diabetes, thinking about \nwhat her life is\n\n[[Page S7292]]\n\ngoing to be like. We know stem cell research holds hope that scientists \ncan unravel some of these mysteries. Those of us who have been involved \nin at least the legislative end of stem cell research, through all the \nhearings we have had going clear back to 1998 when the first embryonic \nstem cells were derived in Wisconsin, we know the great advances that \nhave been made. We know how close we are to having some wonderful \nbreakthroughs.\n  Yet on August 9, 2001, President Bush, in his first year in office, \nspoke to the Nation--I remember it very well--and limited the number of \nstem cell lines that could be investigated by Federal researchers or \nthrough the auspices of the National Institutes of Health. They might \nnot be Federal employees. They could be researchers at the University \nof Minnesota, the University of California, or the University of Iowa, \nbut they would be getting grants from the National Institutes of Health \nfor biomedical research. On August 9, 2001, the President basically \nsaid we are going to limit the number of stem cell lines.\n  We thought at the time maybe 75 lines were enough. Then it turned out \nthere were 20 some lines, then fewer than that. Then we found out later \nevery single one of these stem cell lines was contaminated because they \nhad been grown in a medium with mouse cells. So they are contaminated. \nNone of them will ever be used for any kind of human intervention.\n  Since that time, we have worked to overcome this Presidential fiat, \nif you will, one person, the President of the United States, being able \nto limit the expenditures of Federal money for stem cell research. Here \nI give my utmost praise and thanks to Senator Arlen Specter of \nPennsylvania. He has been stalwart, first in his chairmanship of the \nAppropriations Committee that funds biomedical research. He was the \nfirst one to have congressional hearings on embryonic stem cell \nresearch. I believe we have had 20-some hearings since then. I was his \nranking member and, of course, now I am Chair and he is my ranking \nmember. But we have worked hand in glove all these years to overcome \nthis Presidential fiat that limits, that put shackles on the scientists \nwho want to unlock these mysteries, who want to work to help cure \ndiseases such as juvenile diabetes, Lou Gehrig's disease, and spinal \ncord injuries.\n  I can remember once when my good friend--now he is deceased--\nChristopher Reeve, whom we all remember as Superman, the first \nSuperman, had a severe spinal cord injury and he labored hard all the \ntime for overcoming the President's order of August 9, 2001. He worked \nso hard to try to get a stem cell bill passed.\n  One time, we had seen a film of a mouse--actually a rat, sorry, a \nrat--whose spinal cord had been severely damaged. There were pictures \nof this rat that couldn't walk--only with its front feet; its back feet \nwere totally paralyzed--treated with stem cells, and the rat then \nwalked. That was when Christopher Reeve uttered his famous line: ``Oh, \nto be a rat.'' Or as I said at the time, we are actually about 99 \npercent rat. I don't mean politicians, I mean humans, genetically, DNA-\nwise. And if that could be done there, then there is so much hope that \ncan be investigated and taken on in trying to cure severe spinal cord \ninjuries, for example.\n\n  It was a very moving ceremony, looking at the faces of the mothers \nand the fathers, the children who were there, and thinking that this is \nwhat we ought to be doing. We ought to be giving them the hope that we \nare going to employ our best minds, our best science to heal the sick--\nto heal the sick. I think and I hope that is one of the primary reasons \nfor government, for our government--to help alleviate human suffering \nwherever we find it. So I am hopeful that the President will change his \nmind about his thoughts on vetoing this bill.\n  As you all know, we passed this bill last year. I might add that this \nbill was passed with the House and Senate under Republican control, \nsent to the President, and he vetoed it. Well, we did not have the \nvotes to override the veto. But we said we would be back under a new \nCongress, and we did come back. The Senate passed a bill a couple of \nmonths ago, in April.\n  I might add, if you add up all of the votes--and there were some \npeople missing, but if you added up all the votes with those who were \nfor the bill and those against it, basically we had 66 votes in favor \nof this bill. That is one vote shy of enough to override. If I am not \nmistaken, I believe we had 18 Republican Senators. So this is not a \npartisan issue. It is not partisan. The same in the House. One of the \nleaders in the House is Mike Castle of Delaware, a Republican, and I \nmentioned Senator Arlen Specter, one of our great Republican leaders in \nthe Senate on biomedical research.\n  I guess you have to wonder why it would be that just one person, the \nPresident of the United States, has the power to deny so much hope to \nso many people. I am hopeful the President will reexamine his thoughts, \nlisten to the kinder voices of his nature, and listen to those around \nhim who understand this legislation has strong ethical guidelines. This \nbill has stricter ethical guidelines on stem cell research than is \nexisting in law today.\n  I might also add that the President has made it clear there was one \nmoral line he would not cross. He said Federal tax dollars should not \nbe used to destroy embryos. Well, we expressly crafted this bill, S. 5, \nto ensure that it does not lift the existing Federal ban on using \nFederal funding to destroy embryos. We have fully addressed the \nPresident's No. 1 concern. As I said, S. 5, the bill that was just \nenrolled and sent to the President, imposes stricter ethical \nrequirements than exist today.\n  We tried to meet the President halfway. Isn't that what this is \nabout--the art of compromise? Maybe he is not all right all the time, \nmaybe we are not, so we try to meet halfway. Last year, when the bill \npassed the Senate floor, there was a Specter-Santorum provision that \nwas not put in the bill. The President said he was in favor of that. So \nwe put it in the bill. That provision promotes alternative ways of \nderiving stem cells. The President last year said he endorsed that. \nHere is his chance to sign it and make it a law, along with a bill that \nhas stricter ethical guidelines than what exist today.\n  I see no reason, no ethical reason, no logical reason why the \nPresident would once again veto this bill. It is not the same bill he \nvetoed last year. It is a different bill. We put in the Specter-\nSantorum language. We put in the ethical guidelines. I want to make it \nclear this bill we will send to the President has requirements that are \nvery strict.\n  First, the only way a stem cell line can be eligible for federally \nfunded research is, No. 1, if it were derived from an embryo that was \notherwise going to be discarded.\n  What do I mean by that? Well, there are about 400,000 embryos right \nnow frozen in in vitro fertilization clinics. The moms and dads have \nhad all the children they want, they no longer need any more of the \nembryos, and so those embryos are going to be discarded. It happens \nevery day at fertility clinics all over America. All we are saying is, \ninstead of discarding them, let's allow a couple to donate those, if \nthey wish, to create stem cell lines that can cure diseases and save \nlives. Throw them away or use them to ease suffering. It is the second \nchoice--use them to ease suffering--that I believe is the truly moral \npathway and truly respectful of human life.\n  Think about it. Think about a couple who has used in vitro \nfertilization to have a family. Over 50,000 children are born every \nyear to couples who otherwise would be infertile. Let's say the couple \nhas had the kids they want to have but there are leftover embryos. The \ncouple's only choice now is to continue to pay the IVF clinic to keep \nthem frozen in nitrogen for all their lives, and perhaps when they die \nthey will be thrown away, or to throw them away. Those are the only two \nchoices. Why not give a couple the choice of saying to the IVF clinic, \nyou can take the leftover embryos we have and donate them to science \nfor embryonic stem cell research.\n\n  Some people might say, maybe then people will get into the business \nof paying couples--paying them to donate embryos, embryo farming and \nall of that, which we have heard about. We have covered that in the \nbill. We have strict ethical guidelines. No. 1, no money or any other \nconsideration can be given to a couple for donating embryonic stem \ncells. No money or any other consideration. It must be strictly \nvoluntary. And the donors have to give\n\n[[Page S7293]]\n\ntheir informed written consent. The last ethical guideline is that \nthese embryos that are donated can only be used for embryonic stem cell \nderivation and nothing else.\n  As I said, these are stricter guidelines than exist today. So why \nwouldn't we allow couples who have had their family, rather than saying \nthrow them away, why not allow them to be able to donate them for the \nkind of research that will ease human suffering and lead to cures?\n  There is overwhelming support across the country for this \nlegislation. Some 525 different groups have endorsed this bill--patient \nadvocacy groups, religious groups, health organizations, scientific \nsocieties, and universities. They know it holds hope, hope for people \nwith Lou Gehrig's disease, Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injuries, \nheart disease, people with diabetes, and people with cancer.\n  This is not just us saying that. Don't just take our word for it. In \nMarch of this year, in front of our committee, Dr. Elias Zerhouni, the \nDirector of the National Institutes of Health--keep in mind he is the \nhead person of all of the Federal biomedical research, Dr. Zerhouni, \nhead of the NIH--appeared before our committee. I asked him whether \nscientists would have a better chance of finding new cures and \ntreatments if the administration's current restrictions on embryonic \nstem cell research were lifted. Dr. Zerhouni said, unequivocally, yes.\n  Keep in mind, Dr. Zerhouni is the Federal Government's top scientist \nin the area of medical research. He was appointed by President Bush to \nhis present position. So I think it took great courage on Dr. \nZerhouni's part to say in public that his boss had it wrong on stem \ncell research. But I know Dr. Zerhouni. He is a preeminent scientist; \nthe greatest doctor, and I know that he knows--he has so stated it--\nthat we must move ahead on embryonic stem cell research. Here is what \nhe said, and let me quote him:\n\n       It is clear today that American science would be better \n     served and the Nation would be better served if we let our \n     scientists have access to more stem cell lines. It is in the \n     best interest of our scientists, our science, and our country \n     that we find ways and the Nation finds a way to allow the \n     science to go full speed across adult and embryonic stem \n     cells equally.\n\n  Well, Madam President, we must move forward. We must move forward. I \njust hope the President will sign this bill. But I can assure you, on \nbehalf of the hundreds of millions of Americans who suffer from \ndifferent kinds of diseases that have the potential--the potential--to \nbe cured through embryonic stem cell research, if the President vetoes \nit, we will be back, and we will back again and again and again. This \nissue is not going to go away. We are going to keep hope alive for \npeople with spinal cord injuries, with Parkinson's disease, and with so \nmany others.\n  We don't require astronomers to examine the skies at night with \nGalileo's telescope. We don't tell our geologists to study the Earth \nwith a tape measure. Are we really serious about unlocking the \nmysteries of stem cells and all of the things that we have seen happen \nwith stem cells? We have already seen stem cells that have \ndifferentiated into motor neuron cells, nerve cells, and heart muscle \ncells. We have already seen this take place. Now it is just a matter of \nmore science, getting more of our smartest scientists involved in this \nto take the next step and the next step and the next step so that \nsomeone suffering from Parkinson's disease will have a cure. I believe \nit is possible. From all the scientists I have talked to, I believe it \nis possible, and it could be possible in our lifetimes.\n  A Nobel prize winner, the discoverer of the double helix of our DNA, \nDr. Jim Watson, said to me not too long ago: With all that we have done \nin unraveling the mystery of the human gene--we have mapped and \nsequenced the entire human genome--with that and with these new \nbreakthroughs in finding that embryonic stem cells can differentiate, \nwe can take them and differentiate them into different tissues--if our \nscientists are allowed to really go at this full speed, medicine 50 \nyears from now, as it is practiced, will make it look like what we are \ndoing today as being in the dark ages. That is the hope and the promise \nof embryonic stem cell research. It should not be that one person, the \nPresident of the United States, can stop this from going forward.\n\n  With this enrolling ceremony we had today and the focus of the Nation \non this, all I can ask is: President Bush, listen to the better angels \nof your nature. Think about all those who are suffering in our society \nwho need this hope and the scientists who can work together, \ncollaboratively, to find the interventions and the cures for so many \ndiseases--think about this before you put pen to paper and veto this \nbill. So much rides on this. But as I said, if the President does veto \nit, we will be back, again and again. This is not going to stop. We are \ngoing to lift this ban, and we are going to move ahead with embryonic \nstem cell research.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I commend the Senator from Iowa, \nSenator Harkin, for his tremendous work and advocacy that has gotten us \nto this place today, a very important day that he talked about, where \nthe House of Representatives voted to pass the embryonic stem cell \nresearch bill, joining the Senate. That bill is now on its way to the \nPresident's desk.\n  It is because of the work of Senator Harkin over the years and his \nadvocacy and his not giving up that we are here today. I am very proud \nto join him on the floor to urge the President, now, to do the right \nthing.\n  The House of Representatives today, in voting for this bill, offered \nhope to millions of Americans in supporting embryonic stem cell \nresearch. There is now one person who can make this decision for \nmillions of Americans and that is the President of the United States. \nHe has a choice. He can stand with so many people who are looking for \nthat desperately needed cure or he will stand against them. I hope, \nsimilar to my colleague from Iowa, the President pauses, thinks about \nthe lives he holds in his hands and makes the right choice and signs \nthe bill for embryonic stem cell research.\n  This is an issue I know personally. I grew up in a family of nine. My \ndad was a wonderful, physically active human being. He served our \nNation in World War II; raising his children. He was a strong man. In \nmy eyes when I was growing up, he was indestructible, but when I turned \n15 years old, things changed dramatically in my life and my dad's life. \nMy dad was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. That is a horrific \ndisease, for anyone who is not familiar with it. It wasn't long until \nhe could no longer walk, he was in a wheelchair and required my mother \nto take care of him full time.\n  It was a very difficult time for my family. We had to watch my dad \ndeteriorate physically. We had to watch as my mom returned to work. She \nwas on welfare for a while and finally was able to get some schooling \nand get a job. But she had to work, take care of my dad, and raise all \nseven kids.\n  We all hoped a cure one day would be found for my dad and people like \nhim. You never lose hope when something such as this happens to you. It \nis essential to dealing with what you have been handed. But we were \nalso realistic. Scientists didn't have any promising leads, doctors \nsaid there wasn't much they could do, there was no cure on the horizon, \nthere was nothing to hinge our hope on when I was growing up. But now \nwe have a chance finally to offer families across this country hope, \nopportunity, a chance for a cure.\n  It is time for President Bush to stop his obstruction and to stop \nsaying no to cures and to stop saying no to hope for families such as \nmine.\n  Unfortunately, we know since being elected, President Bush has \nblocked robust federally funded research on embryonic stem cells. \nOriginally, he told us there would be 78 stem cell lines available for \nstudy. In truth, there were only 21, far fewer than scientists say are \nneeded for this research.\n  Even the Director of the National Institutes of Health, as Senator \nHarkin talked about, who was appointed by President Bush, said: ``It is \nclear today that American science would be better served, and the \nNation would be better served, if we let our scientists have access to \nmore cell lines. . . .''\n  The President refused to heed that advice from the scientific \ncommunity\n\n[[Page S7294]]\n\nor his own Director of the National Institutes of Health. He did so--\nwhy? To pacify the ideological views of a few in his political base. \nWhat he did by blocking that was to force millions of Americans who \nsuffer from many ailments to put their hope on hold and to stand idly \nby and watch as a family member's condition worsened.\n  Besides putting the hopes of millions of people on hold, the \nPresident's action actually pushed stem cell research overseas. Our \ncountry, which has been known as the world leader in medicine and in \nscientific research, is now falling behind other countries in this \nfield.\n  Reuters recently reported that British scientists, with funding from \nan American who was upset with President Bush's actions, were using \nembryonic stem cell research to cure some forms of blindness.\n  Our country must remain at the forefront of innovation. Institutions \nsuch as the University of Washington, in my home State, have to have \nthe ability to compete with organizations in other countries. This \nPresident has denied that.\n  The bill that has been sent to the President today is on its way to \nhis desk. The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007 allows the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to finally begin robust \nresearch on embryonic stem cells from frozen embryos, embryos, it is \nimportant to note, that would otherwise be discarded.\n  That bill also promotes research into funding alternative ways to \nderive stem cells from embryos, and it does these things while it \nimposes strict ethical guidelines, as all of us have insisted upon. In \nfact, the standards in the legislation that is on its way to the \nPresident's desk today are more stringent than even the President's own \npolicy.\n  Most important, though, the legislation we want this President to \nsign takes hope off hold for millions of Americans. We all know the \nPresident has threatened to once again veto this legislation, as he did \nlast year. I am here today, and I hope he hears me, to say: Please \ndon't do that.\n  There are millions of sick Americans and their families who are \nwatching and waiting and praying and hoping he signs this bill. If he \nvetoes this bill, he will likely claim, as he did last year, the \nlegislation is unnecessary since researching adult stem cells, which he \nsupports, is as promising as studying embryonic stem cells.\n  Similar to last year, he would be wrong. Scientists say embryonic \ncells, which can be used to grow any type of human or cell tissue, show \nthe most promise. They offer the most hope.\n  I have lived with someone with a serious illness. I have seen the \nsuffering that happens, personally, to their families, and to everyone \naround them. I know how hard it can be. We must not block the discovery \nof cures for these people. We must not block their hope. Today, at \nleast 17 million Americans suffer from diabetes. At least 500,000 \nAmericans suffer from Parkinson's, 250,000 Americans suffer from \nmultiple sclerosis, and 250,000 have spinal cord injuries, including, I \nwould add, many veterans of the Iraq war. All these Americans, and many \nothers who suffer from a variety of conditions, will stand to benefit \nfrom embryonic stem cell research.\n  Finally, today, in sending this bill to the President, this Congress \nis offering a chance to families across the country to have hope, to \nhave an opportunity, to have a chance for a cure. I hope President Bush \nhears their calls, picks up that pen, stops his obstruction, stops \nsaying no to cures, and signs his name to the legislation. We are all \nwatching.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, before I say a word on immigration \nreform, I would like to add a closing word to the comments of the \nSenator from Washington and the Senator from Iowa.\n  Just as Senator Murray has talked about her own family experiences \nwith her dad and mom and all, my own mom passed away about 2 years ago. \nShe had had Alzheimer's disease for a number of years. Her mother had \nAlzheimer's, her grandmother had Alzheimer's, and last year my mother's \nyounger sister, 10 years her junior, was admitted to a residential \nfacility in Huntington, VA, where she has Alzheimer's disease as well. \nThis is one that strikes close to the heart for us and our family as it \ndoes for you and literally for millions of families across the country. \nThank you for your great leadership and that of Senator Harkin and Mike \nCastle, my own Congressman, who has been a stalwart in these efforts.\n  I would like to return to an issue we have been focused on in the \nSenate in the last couple weeks and that is what we do to secure our \nborders, what to do to make sure employers are not knowingly hiring \nillegal aliens, at least not without penalty if they do, and what are \nwe going to do about the 12 million or so people here undocumented, \nroughly 60 percent of whom came here illegally. What are we going to do \nabout all of that?\n  For a while this afternoon, it looked like we might not do anything. \nFor a while this afternoon, it looked like we may basically finish up \nwithout taking any kind of definitive action and having debated these \nissues for a couple of weeks, as we did last year for several weeks, to \ngo home without having taken definitive steps. I am told that \nnegotiations are going on, even as I speak, which would allow us to \ncome back into session, for our Republican friends to offer 10 more \namendments, for our side to offer 10 more on top of the 45 or so that \nalready have been offered and voted on. That would take us to 65 \namendments. That is a lot of amendments on any piece of legislation. I \nrealize this is a contentious one, but at some point in time I think it \nis fair to say we have had an opportunity for people to say this is \nwhat I think we should do and for people to offer their countervailing \nviews, but I think it is time to move on.\n  My view is the worst thing we can do is, frankly, do nothing. I don't \nbelieve the status quo is acceptable, the status quo, which last summer \nfound as many as 10,000 people coming across our borders illegally \nevery week, mostly coming for work. Some could have been criminals, who \nknows? Maybe there was a terrorist or two in those numbers. But for us \nto go home not having dealt definitively with that problem, with that \nchallenge, is a big mistake.\n  A country such as ours--any country but especially a country such as \nours--has to be able to secure our borders. I read some information \nprovided by some folks in Washington, a think tank in Washington, who \nlooked back at the number of employers who were sanctioned for \nknowingly hiring illegal aliens in the last several years. The comment \nwas made--I don't know if the Presiding Officer saw this--the comment \nwas made that a person in the last several years had a greater chance \nof being eaten by an alligator in this country than, if you were an \nemployer hiring illegal aliens, being caught.\n  That may sound like a stretch, but it is not much of a stretch. We \nactually saw the number of people prosecuted under the law in the last \n6 years dropping by some 30 percent below what it was in the last \ndecade.\n  We were not enforcing the laws against employers. We need to do that. \nThere are sanctions in laws and they need to be applied. Those laws \nneed to be enforced.\n  Sort of a question remains: How about all those people who are here \nwithout--who are not here legally? They may have come here legally and \ntheir visas expired and they stayed on. But when you add those to the \nfolks who came across the borders illegally, it totals some 12 million \npeople. I can understand the views of some folks in my State, and maybe \nin Minnesota and other places around this country--Washington, Iowa--\nthat we ought to simply put them all on buses and send them home. I can \nunderstand how people would feel that way.\n  I would say I don't know how realistic that is. But the idea of \nproviding some way for them to stay here and work, under a condition of \nprobation, to be able to work over a number of years toward a legal \nstatus--before we countenance doing that, before we go down that path, \nI believe it is critical that, No. 1, we enforce and secure our \nborders.\n  Second, that we make sure those folks who are knowingly hiring \nillegal aliens, that we prosecute them with every ounce of energy we \nhave under the law.\n\n[[Page S7295]]\n\n  With respect to the enforcement of our borders and the securing of \nour borders, let me just mention a couple of things that this \nlegislation requires us to do and to question whether that makes sense, \nwhether that is sufficient. We have thousands of Border Patrol \npersonnel arrayed on the Nation's borders, from the Pacific coast, west \ncoast, San Diego, all the way across to the gulf coast, a couple-\nthousand-mile border.\n  The legislation that is before us today basically says we are going \nto double the number of Border Patrol personnel. They have to be better \ntrained and better equipped. Today we are supplementing their numbers \nwith the National Guard. And as an old Governor who once was commander \nin chief of our National Guard in Delaware, I am all for continuing to \ndeploy those assets as well to secure our borders, to supplement our \nBorder Patrol personnel.\n  However, those Border Patrol personnel have to be better trained. \nThey have to be better equipped. We have technology today that, \nfrankly, we did not have 2, 3, 4, 5 years ago to deploy along the \nborders. We have unmanned aircraft that can be flown, aircraft that can \nsee for miles, aircraft that can see in good weather like today, \naircraft that can see when people are moving on the ground when it is \nnighttime, aircraft that can see when it is foggy, aircraft that can \nsee through the rain. We have that capability today. We did not have it \nthen.\n  We have the capability with surveillance cameras to look long \ndistances, in all kinds of weather conditions, day and night, to detect \nthe movement of people toward our borders. We have the equipment. This \nlegislation says we have to deploy it and we have to use it and we have \nto fund it. We have the ability to provide ID, identification, for \npeople applying for jobs in this country, identification that is \nlargely tamper proof. Ten years ago we may not have had the capability. \nWe have the capability today. If I were an employer, I would take great \nsolace in knowing that the identification being presented to me was \ngenuine, was real, had not been tampered with, and to know that I could \ntrust the technology. This legislation seeks to make sure that \nemployers have that confidence.\n  I believe one of the major problems in this country in recent years \nthat has led to a greater influx of folks coming here illegally is, \nwhen we catch them at the border, if they happen to be from Mexico, \nfrequently our Border Patrol personnel take those people back to the \nborder across into Mexico.\n  However, if the folks we catch at the border, if they are not from \nMexico--Guatemala, Honduras, other countries to the south, if we \ncapture those people, we take them to a detention center. We have been \ntaking them to detention centers for several years. If we have ample \nspace in the detention center, bed capacity, if you will, the folks are \nbasically registered, charged, and have the opportunity to argue \nwhether they are here as refugees, whether they are being politically \npersecuted, persecuted for their religious beliefs.\n  However, for too long when we have captured people not from Mexico \nand we take them to detention centers, they do not have enough beds. \nThey cannot book these folks, hold them, retain them in custody because \nthey just do not have the capacity. So what do we do? Well, we \nbasically register them, find out who they are, as best we can, and \nthen we essentially release them on their own recognizance and say: \nCome back in 2 months, 3 months for a hearing. Surprise, surprise. We \nnever see them again. They just disappear. They melt into the fabric of \nthe communities across this country.\n  For the most part they get jobs and go to work, stay out of trouble. \nBut the idea that people can come in illegally like that, and once \ncaptured not be detained, for us not to find out if they are here as \nrefugees, that is wrong. It is especially wrong if you happen to be \nsomebody who is trying to come here legally, not for a couple of months \nbut for years waiting in line patiently, abiding by the law.\n  Meanwhile other folks come into this country whom we capture and \nessentially release to become workers in this country. That is wrong. \nIn terms of equity, that is basically unfair. It says to people trying \nto play by the rules: You're foolish. You're foolish. It sends \nabsolutely the wrong message.\n  That is one of the reasons amnesty is not the answer either. It sends \nthe same kind of message to people who have been waiting to come here \nfor a long time. It says: You are foolish for playing by the rules. It \nis why amnesty is no good. And the idea of us simply releasing people \non their own recognizance because we do not have bed capacity in these \ndetention centers makes no sense as well.\n  With respect to employers knowingly hiring illegal aliens and our not \nprosecuting them under the law--unacceptable. When we have employers \nwho know that the man or woman they are hiring is not here legally, \nthat the documentation paperwork that is being presented to them is \nfalse, it is unacceptable that that employer is allowed to do that, to \ncontinue to do that, week after week, month after month, year after \nyear. That think tank which told me recently that the chances of a \nperson being eaten by an alligator were greater than a person being \nprosecuted under the law, whether that is true or not, we know this: \nToo few employers have been prosecuted.\n  One of the best ways to send a chilling message back home to folks \nwho are thinking about coming here is, one, make sure if they get \ncaught they go to a detention center. If they are not here as a \nrefugee, they are going to go home. And the time they serve in the \ndetention center is not going to be pleasant.\n  The best way to deter, to put a chilling effect on those who come \nacross illegally is to make sure that employers know if they hire \nfolks, they are going to pay a severe price. That sends a strong \nmessage to those who otherwise would take a chance and come here.\n  The last thing I would mention is what to do about all of those \npeople here who are undocumented. If there are 12 million, if some 60 \npercent of them are folks who came across the border illegally, if the \nother 40 percent who are people who came here legally stayed beyond the \ntime they were allowed to stay here, and now they are here illegally, \nalthough they came legally in the first place, what do we do with all \nof those people?\n  The legislation we have before us that we are debating and we have \nbeen amending for the last 2 weeks says: If you came here legally and \nstayed beyond your time, or if you came here illegally, we want you to \nstep out of the shadows. You have to register with the Government. You \nhave basically one chance to do that. If you do that, take advantage of \nthis opportunity, and you are willing to meet the conditions--I think, \ntough conditions, a multiyear period of what I would call probation--\nthose people can work their way toward legal status. It might take 8 \nyears, it might take more. But for folks who have been here for a \nwhile, they have worked, they have been good workers, they have paid \ntaxes, they have stayed out of trouble with the law, under this \nlegislation if they are willing to continue to work, continue to pay \ntaxes, pay any back taxes that are owed, pay a very significant fine, \nthousands of dollars in fines, learn English, learn about the history \nof our country, and so forth, if they are willing to do those things, \nthey have a chance to work toward a legal status not in 8 weeks, not in \n8 months, but in as long as 8 years.\n\n  If they are not willing to live by the conditions that are laid out \nin this legislation, they are out of luck. They will not have a chance \nto ever have the kind of legal status that they otherwise would have.\n  Let me close, if I can, by saying I do not know if the Presiding \nOfficer remembers this, but during orientation for new Senators last \nNovember, when I was privileged to spend some time with our newly \nelected Senators, I mentioned one of the things we do in my Senate \noffice back home is we try to do a good job on constituent service.\n  We actually keep track. I get reports every week on how we are doing \non constituent services. We do a monthly survey for the people we serve \nthrough constituent services. They can evaluate our services: \nexcellent, good, fair, poor. And I have a great staff. They get, for \nthe most part, excellent and good marks. About 95 percent of them are \nexcellent and good. We are very proud of the work they do.\n  In the weekly reports I have received for weeks now, actually for \nmonths\n\n[[Page S7296]]\n\nnow, each weekly report from my head of constituent services starts off \nwith an update on a person who came to this country legally, I think \nfrom Greece, who was an older woman, I think in her midseventies, who \ncame here to see, I think, her son, maybe a daughter-in-law, who \napparently has dementia, who ended up being hospitalized, essentially \nabandoned by her son, and ended up in a hospital for treatment.\n  She needed hospitalization and treatment for less than a week for her \ncondition. Less than a week. Unfortunately, no one was there to take \ncare of her, to look after her, to be responsible for her. She stayed \nin that hospital not for a couple of days, not for a week, more than a \nmonth--actually I think for more than 2 months.\n  How much did it cost? It cost that hospital about a quarter of a \nmillion dollars because that hospital in Dover, DE, essentially had to \neat the cost of that hospitalization.\n  The last week or so I understand that the daughter-in-law has stepped \nforward. This woman who has her documentation, apparently arrangements \nhave been made with folks back in Greece to take her back. The hospital \nhas bought tickets, and I am told they are going to fly this elderly \nwoman back to Greece. Her daughter-in-law is going to take her. \nHopefully the paperwork is being arranged for the woman to be received \nby her own family back in Greece.\n  I would like to say that is probably the only time that has happened \nin this country this year or last year or the year before. \nUnfortunately, it is not. And it is unfortunate that a lot of times it \nis a failure of us at the Federal level to enforce our borders, to \nsecure our borders, as in this case, when people stay beyond their \nlimited period of time, has led to a situation that has cost this \nhospital a ton of money. There are probably other hospital facilities \nthat it has cost a lot of money.\n  It is being borne by other people in my State who paid for their \nhealth care, and oftentimes State and local governments end up picking \nup the tab for what really is a failure at the Federal level. It is not \nright. It is unfair. This legislation would begin to address that.\n  Let me close with this thought. Last year, when we debated for a long \ntime immigration reform, passed from here a pretty good bill for \nimmigration reform, I remember when I talked about the legislation, I \nalways used the words, ``tough,'' ``smart,'' ``comprehensive.'' That is \nwhat I believed and said again and again and again that that is what we \nneeded to do in terms of our work on immigration reform--tough, smart, \ncomprehensive.\n  I still think that applies. I would add to that maybe a couple of \nother terms. One of those is ``fair.'' The ``fair'' that I am thinking \nof is the ``fair'' to taxpayers in this country. What we pass here \nought to be fair to taxpayers, not just Federal taxpayers but State and \nlocal folks, including hospitals, and people who are running hospitals \nand funding hospitals around this country; fair to American workers.\n  The idea that people are coming here and taking away jobs in some \ninstances, too many instances, from people who are willing and able to \ndo the work is not acceptable. The idea of having a large guest worker \nprogram like the President has envisioned, in my view, is not \nacceptable.\n  We obviously are going to have some kind of guest worker program, but \nnot on the magnitude that this President has sought, but tough, smart, \ncomprehensive, and fair--fair to taxpayers, fair to American workers.\n  The last point I would add is practical. As I said earlier in my \ncomments, as much as I can understand the desire to round up 12 million \npeople who are here undocumented, put them in planes, buses, whatever, \nand send them home, I can understand the rationale, the feeling to do \nthat, but, my friends, it is just not practical. What we have to do is \nfind a way for them to come out of the shadows. If they do not abide by \nthe law, take them home. But if they are willing to work hard, pay \ntaxes, stay out of trouble, learn English, learn our customs and our \nlaws, they can have a chance over time, for a long period of time, \nmultiple periods of years to work toward a documented legal status. I \nthink that is the right approach. And, hopefully, sometime in the next \nhour or two we will reconvene on the Senate floor, and those Senators \nwho have amendments on the Republican side and the Democratic side will \nhave the opportunity to offer even more than the 45 that we already \noffered and disposed of.\n  Once we have done that, sometime maybe tonight we will have an \nopportunity to vote to begin to draw to an end the debate on this \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Stem Cell Research\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today this Congress is once again taking \nan important step forward toward creating a better future for America. \nEarlier today the House of Representatives passed the Stem Cell \nResearch Enhancement Act, a bill the Senate passed in April. Along with \nthe first minimum wage increase in over 10 years and a fiscally \nresponsible budget, this is yet another accomplishment for the American \npeople which this Congress has been able to achieve.\n  This bill will expand Federal funding for embryonic stem cell \nresearch, a type of stem cell research that holds great promise for \nmillions of Americans suffering from debilitating diseases such as \nheart disease, diabetes, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's. It has been over \n5 years since the Senate began discussing stem cell research, 5 years \nof discussion, 5 years of searching for answers and, most importantly, \n5 years of hope that one day our country would make a much needed \nchange in policy for the health of all of its people.\n  Today we stand at the brink of an historic opportunity to reestablish \nour country as a global leader in biomedical science and reaffirm our \ndedication to curing some of the greatest sources of human suffering. \nWe are here with the support of over 500 well-respected organizations, \nincluding the American Medical Association, the American Public Health \nAssociation, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, the March of \nDimes, and Parkinson's Action Network. These organizations represent \nscientists, doctors, religious entities and, most importantly, American \npatients and their loved ones.\n  Unfortunately, President Bush has once again publicly stated he \nintends to veto this bill. This is a bill both Houses of Congress on a \nbipartisan basis have passed for 2 years in a row, a bill that \ncontinues to be supported by a majority of the American people. But it \nis also a bill President Bush has already vetoed.\n  For the President to reject this legislation again is to take another \nstep backward, away from the possibility of lifesaving medical \nbreakthroughs and dash the hopes of millions who depend on the untapped \npromise of medical research. Time is precious for those who suffer from \ndebilitating disease and for their loved ones who suffer with them. The \nlack of Federal support for embryonic stem cell research may cost many \nAmericans the chance for a cure, a treatment, and a better life. Our \ncountry is in a position to do the right thing. This President has done \nsomething no other President has done before him; that is, to ban \nFederal funding of a certain level of medical research--in this case, \nresearch involving embryonic stem cells--to close off Federal funding \nthat could open opportunities for cures for diseases.\n  The argument made by the President is that these embryonic stem cells \nshould not be used for this type of research. These stem cells are \ngenerated, of course, in the process of in vitro fertilization for \ncouples who have difficulty conceiving a child they want to love and \nrear. They go to a laboratory and spend an enormous amount of money in \nthe hopes of having that baby that is the object of their dreams. The \nday may finally come. But in that process, embryonic stem cells that \nare\n\n[[Page S7297]]\n\ngenerated may be lost, discarded, unused. How can it make any sense for \nus, how can this reflect compassion for us to say it is better to throw \naway these stem cells and discard them rather than to use them for \nresearch which can bring life and hope and spare people of their \nsuffering?\n  Congress has shown the political will, and the passage of S. 5 is the \nway to do the right thing. I hope President Bush will not veto this \nbill. If he does, listening to a vocal minority, he will be \ndisregarding the health of our country and the hopes of so many \nsuffering today. It is time for America to move forward in medical \nresearch, to find the cures that will give us a brighter tomorrow.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Durbin pertaining to the introduction of S. 1563 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today a piece of legislation is being sent \nfrom this Congress to the President dealing with stem cell research \ncalled the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act.\n  On the way to the White House is a piece of legislation called the \nStem Cell Research Enhancement Act. Now, I know there are some who say: \nWell, what does this mean to our lives? Well, the research in stem \ncells is some of the most promising research in medicine we have seen \nin our lifetimes. We have a lot of people in this country today who are \nsuffering. They suffer from dread diseases. They suffer from \nAlzheimer's. They suffer from Parkinson's disease, cancer, heart \ndisease, diabetes--so many ailments and so many difficulties.\n  Research occurs in this country to try to address these issues and \nfind cures, to unlock the mystery of these diseases. One of the most \npromising areas of research has been stem cell research.\n  Now, the President has indicated he does not support Federal funding \nfor certain kinds of research in stem cells. He says he will veto this \nlegislation. I hope he changes his mind. He has a right to veto the \nlegislation. We then would try to override the veto. But I think it \nwill be a significant setback if the President vetoes the legislation.\n  This legislation deals only with a specific area in stem cell \nresearch. It deals only with stem cells from embryos that were created \nfor fertility purposes by the in vitro fertilization process. Those \nembryos that are created in the in vitro fertilization clinics--they \ncreate more of those embryos than are needed, and then they throw them \naway if they are not needed.\n  We have had about 1 million people walking on this Earth now in the \nlast 25 years who were conceived, in many cases, in a test tube or a \npetri dish in the process of in vitro fertilization--nearly a million \npeople. It was big news when the first such conception occurred, but \nnow it is relatively routine for those couples who are unable to \nconceive to go through in vitro fertilization and conceive. When doing \nthat, there are embryos created--a sperm and an egg create an embryo; a \nfertilized egg creates an embryo--and there are more embryos created \nfrom the in vitro fertilization process than are used. Some are then \nstored frozen. After a period of time, when it is clear they are not \ngoing to be used, they are simply discarded. They are thrown away.\n  The piece of legislation that goes to the President, saying let us \nproceed with additional research, deals only with those embryos that \notherwise would be thrown away. These are the embryos that could be \nused instead for this critical area of research. Rather than throwing \nthe in vitro fertilization embryos in the garbage, it is much more life \naffirming, I think, to use them to better understand and to treat some \nof the devastating diseases and illnesses--diabetes, heart disease, \nAlzheimer's, Parkinson's.\n  I know there is great passion about this issue. Often, the issue is \ncast in terms of: When does life begin? But that is not about this \ndebate on this bill. These are embryos that are about to be discarded \nand could instead be used to search for the cure for these diseases and \nto enhance life, to extend life.\n  I am sure there are desks in this Chamber--perhaps every desk--\noccupied by someone who knows a friend, a loved one, a neighbor, an \nacquaintance who is suffering today from one of these awful diseases.\n  A former colleague of ours asked a question. I wish to put it up on a \nchart because it is such an interesting way to address this issue. One \nof our former colleagues, former Senator Jack Danforth, from Missouri, \nwho is also an ordained Episcopal priest--he was a Senator, yes, but is \nan ordained Episcopal priest as well--here is what he said about this \nissue. He says:\n\n       It is not evident to many of us that cells in a petri dish \n     are equivalent to identifiable people suffering from terrible \n     diseases. I am and have always been pro-life. But the only \n     explanation for legislators comparing cells in a petri dish \n     to babies in the womb is the extension of religious doctrine \n     into statutory law.\n\n  Senator Danforth is a Republican, an ordained Episcopal priest--\ninteresting person and legislator. I served with him in the Senate, and \nI think he puts it well.\n  Nancy Reagan says:\n\n       Science has presented us with a hope called stem cell \n     research, which may provide our scientists with answers that \n     have so long been beyond our grasp. I just don't see how we \n     can turn our backs on this--there are just so many diseases \n     that can be cured, or at least helped. We have lost so much \n     time already, and I just really can't bear to lose any more.\n\n  Nancy Reagan. We know, of course, her husband, the late Ronald \nReagan, suffered from Alzheimer's disease. In fact, he sent a message \nto America in which he announced he was suffering from Alzheimer's \ndisease. He entered into a long period of darkness from this terrible \ndisease that is affecting more and more people in our country.\n  There are about 400,000 embryos frozen in in vitro fertilization \nclinics. It is estimated that about 8,000 to 11,000 of these embryos \nare going to be discarded, thrown away. This debate is about whether we \nshould, with the consent of those who own those embryos--or from whom \nthose embryos were created, with their consent--whether we should use \nthese embryos that would otherwise be discarded for research that has \nthe potential to cure diseases and save lives.\n  There is a young woman in North Dakota. She has recently come to \nWashington, DC, with her mother. She is a young woman who suffers from \ndiabetes--a very significant form of diabetes. She has had a pretty \naggressive time dealing with it. Her name is Camille--Camille Johnson. \nThis is a picture of Camille, with her clarinet and her two friends who \nplay in a middle school band. Camille has nearly lost her life on more \nthan one occasion as a result of having to battle this disease. Her \nmother Andi and Camille have told me it is fine to use her picture \nbecause she has worked very aggressively in the juvenile diabetes area \nto try to address these issues and say to the Congress: Won't you \nplease--won't you please--give us the opportunity to proceed with stem \ncell research to unlock the mysteries of these terrible diseases?\n  So there are thousands--there are millions--of Camilles and people \nwith different names, young and old, who rely on this Congress and rely \non this President to do the right thing.\n  This is a quote from Dr. Elias Zerhouni, who is the Director of the \nNational Institutes of Health for this administration. He says:\n\n       From my standpoint, it is clear today that American science \n     will be better served, and our nation better served, if we \n     let our scientists have access to more stem cell lines.\n\n  That is from the President's own adviser on these issues. Yet the \nPresident says he is going to veto this legislation.\n  I care deeply about this issue for a lot of reasons. I lost a \nbeautiful 23-year-old daughter to heart disease, and I decided, not \njust for her sake but for the sake of others in my family who are gone \nas a result of devastating diseases, that we must do everything--\neverything--possible to find a way to cure these terrible diseases that \ntake so many lives. Some say: Well, you\n\n[[Page S7298]]\n\ndon't have to use these embryos. There are other things much more \npromising, such as adult stem cells. There are adult stem cells you can \nuse. The fact is, we have been working on adult stem cell research for \ndecades--for decades. Yet, while I support that, it doesn't show nearly \nthe promise that embryonic stem cells show in the ability to respond to \nsome of these diseases.\n\n  Let me go through just a couple of them. One day, I was on an \nairplane, and I was talking to a man who is called the father of the \nHuman Genome Project, Dr. Francis Collins. He told me of some \nfascinating research that is going on. They induced heart attacks in \nmice, severe heart attacks in mice, and I believe, as I recall, there \nwere a dozen and a half or two dozen mice in which they induced severe \nheart attacks. Then they extracted stem cells and invested those stem \ncells back into the heart muscle of those very same mice, and in a \nmatter of weeks, a good number of those mice--in fact, I think the \nmajority of those mice--had no evidence of a damaged heart. These were \nhearts which had been severely damaged, and in a matter of weeks, the \ninvestment of stem cells that could build new heart muscle, and those \nhearts showed no evidence of damage.\n  At Johns Hopkins University, paralyzed rats partially regained the \nuse of previously immobile hind legs in studies where they injected the \nrodents with stem cells from mouse embryos. At the University of \nWisconsin, they have turned stem cells into nerve cells carrying the \nmessages between body and brain offering the possibilities for \nrepairing damage caused by ALS, by spinal cord injury, and other nerve-\nrelated disorders. At UCLA, at the AIDS Institute, they were able to \ncoax human embryonic stem cells into becoming maturity immune T cells. \nThis discovery might suggest new ways to fight immune disorders such as \nHIV and AIDS.\n  Until now, it is impossible to study the complete progress of \nAlzheimer's disease, which robs both memory and life. We don't know how \nor even when it exactly begins. With human embryonic stem cells, we \nmight be able to isolate the disease and observe its progress from \ninception to death on human tissue--excuse me, on human tissue cells--\nnot necessarily on the human beings themselves, and find a cure for \nthis terrible disease.\n  The ability for embryonic stem cells to transform into any cell type \ngives them the potential that adult stem cells simply do not have. We \njust have not had the capability with adult stem cells that we have \nwith embryonic stem cells.\n  So those patients in this country who are struggling and are \nsuffering today with these terrible diseases, looking to the Congress, \nlooking to science, say: Don't lock in areas that prevent research from \ncontinuing, but expand opportunities for research; yes, with ethical \nguidelines; yes, with a sensitive understanding that there are issues \nyou have to resolve, but proceed. Don't stop them. Proceed ahead to \nconduct this research and give us hope.\n  There are so many patient groups and scientific organizations and \nfoundations and others that support this Federal research. I know they, \ntoo, believe what Congress has done here is a breath of fresh air. It \nis the right thing to do. I know they hope the President will not keep \nhis promise to veto this legislation. That is one promise he should not \nkeep. It is exactly the wrong thing for the President to do. By a wide \nmajority, the American people believe that, rather than discard those \nembryos, rather than simply throw them away, they ought to be used for \nlife-affirming research, with the consent of those from whom they were \ncreated. That is what this bill does. That is why this bill is so \nimportant.\n  As I end, let me say again, this is about giving life, affirming \nlife, saving life. My hope is that the action today by which we move \nthis legislation from Congress to the White House will be seen as great \nhope for a different approach and a more aggressive approach on this \nstem cell research, and my hope is the President will take another look \nat this and decide what we have done is the right thing for us and \nespecially, most especially, for those in this country who have waited \nso long for this kind of approach taken by the United States on stem \ncell research.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, for those who have been interested in \nthis legislation, as all of us are, and for those who have been \nwondering about what has been going on through the course of the \nafternoon, I think they probably have been seeing the intermediate \nactions which have been taken, the requests that have been made by the \nmajority leader, and the response. Even as the time is moving along, \nthere are efforts to try to sort of find some common ground in \nconsideration of additional Republican amendments, as well as some of \nthe additional Democratic amendments. We made remarkable progress, I \nthought, yesterday afternoon and last evening. We were very hopeful \nthat we could move, this afternoon, in a similar way to consider both \nthe Republican and Democratic amendments. I know and expect we are \ngoing to have a proposal that is going to be made by the majority \nleader in the near future to see if we can't get back on track. I am \nvery hopeful that will be the case.\n  We have had good debates, good discussions over the last couple of \nweeks, and I think we have made good progress. We know there are still \na number of outstanding issues for our colleagues. We had hoped we \nwould be able to address a number of those during the course of the \nafternoon but, as we saw when the leader made the requests, there were \nobjections to proceeding in that way. We are not giving up, and the \nleader is preparing now to make some additional requests. I myself find \nthat his plan is virtually irresistible, but we will have to find out \nwhether our colleagues on the other side feel that way as well.\n  I thought I would take a moment and just review some of the essential \naspects.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Sure.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator allow me to ask unanimous consent to be \nrecognized at the conclusion of his remarks?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Sure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thought I would just review how we got \nhere with this legislation and basically the highlights of it. I think \nit is fairly familiar to the Members, but I think it is always useful \nto have an understanding about the nature of the challenge we are \nfacing, the dramatic challenge we are facing in terms of our borders, \nin terms of our national security, and to briefly review for our \ncolleagues what we have tried to do with this legislation.\n  So often during the last days, these debates are focused like a laser \non a very specific aspect, and we lost the central thrust and the \npurpose of this legislation and perhaps even the need for urgent \naction.\n  There is a need for urgent action, and the need is now, the need is \ntoday, the need is tonight because of the kinds of conditions that \nthreaten our national security and result in the exploitation of human \nbeings and even deaths out in the desert and leave many millions of \nundocumented in fear of their future, and the conditions which threaten \nto undermine agreements that have been made in the AgJOBS area and the \nlost opportunities that would result for many of those who might be \neligible for the DREAM Act. So I thought I would try to put this into \nsome proportion and take a few moments to review again where we are.\n  I think one of the most dramatic statistics we see, as reflected in \nthis chart, is deaths due to unauthorized border crossings. If you look \nat the period of the last 5 years, you will see these numbers continue \nto go up, they continue to escalate. The fact is, there are 425 men, \nwomen, and children, including infants, who die every single year on \nthe border. That is a dramatic figure under any set of circumstances. \nThe numbers are going to continue if we fail to take any action. Those \nnumbers are going to continue to escalate. They reflect the number of \ndeaths at the border. They don't reflect the several hundred thousand \nindividuals who are able to come across the border.\n  What happens when these undocumented come across the border is that \nmore often than not we find that these individuals, as the rest of the \nundocumented population, undergo extraordinary exploitation.\n\n[[Page S7299]]\n\n  We have a picture showing a situation that took place in my own State \nin New Bedford fairly recently, several weeks ago. It is fairly \ntypical. There have been these types of raids on these types of places \nin other parts of the country. This is replicated in scores of places \nall over this country. We find these undocumented, now estimated to be \n12.5 million, 13 million of them, who suffer the exploitation we saw in \nNew Bedford, MA. This photograph illustrates what is going on in this \nplant. These workers' rights were trampled on. These individuals were \nfined for going to the bathroom, denied overtime pay, docked 15 \nminutes' pay for every minute they were late to work, fired for talking \nwhile on the clock, forced to ration toilet paper, which typically ran \nout before 9 a.m.\n  Then we look at another industry. You can look here at the \nundocumented workers in the meatpacking industry who are exploited. One \nin ten workers is injured each year by the sharp hooks and knives. They \nsuffer exhausting assembly-line speeds and painful damage from \nrepetitive motions. That is the old ergonomics issue. Workers are \nsubjected to chlorine mists that lead to bloody noses, vomiting, and \nheadaches. Undocumented workers don't report their injuries because \nthey live in fear that they will lose their jobs and be deported.\n  The life of fear that is taking place is replicated in communities \nall over this country. We have these several hundred thousand \nindividuals coming across the border. We don't know who they are. We \ndon't know their names. They are living in different places in our \ncountry. They are subject to this kind of exploitation, and they pose a \nnational security issue and a national security problem. We have the \nexploitation of these workers. We have the deaths that take place in \nthe desert, and we also have a national security problem with hundreds \nof thousands of people coming across. So this issue is a national \nsecurity issue. It is a national security problem.\n  This gives us some idea of what we have included in this legislation. \nWe have increased the Border Patrol to 18,000 agents, and with the \nGregg amendment, it is more than 20,000 now. It has the border \nbarriers, including 200 miles of vehicle barriers and 370 miles of \nfencing. It includes radar and camera towers, UAVs. For detention and \napprehension, it provides the resources to detain up to 27,000 \nnoncitizens per day rather than arrest and release. This will be for \ndetention and apprehension. We have important workplace enforcement \ntools and processing applications of Z status. The Department of \nHomeland Security will process the applications in terms of security. \nSo we are coming to the issue of law enforcement and security--national \nsecurity, protecting our borders, and law enforcement. We are going to \ndevelop a process.\n  This legislation is about respect for the law--law at the border, law \nin employment, and law for those individuals who are here and are \nundocumented. They are going to have to live with this law which \nensures that they are going to suffer a penalty if they expect to stay \nhere and live here.\n  We have a virtual lawlessness out there on the border which is a \nthreat to our security and a lawlessness in so many areas of employment \nwhich is promoting the exploitation of the human condition.\n  We have this extraordinary atmosphere of fear by the 12\\1/2\\ million \nindividuals who live here; they are in fear because they are illegal. \nWe are trying to legalize the process and get respect for the law and \ntry to ensure our national security. So we do that, as I mentioned, at \nthe border, which is important.\n  As I have mentioned during the course of these discussions, the one \nthing we have learned following hour after hour after hour of hearings \non this matter is that just doing border protection is not enough. If \nyou were able to put 1,800 miles of fencing along the Southwest border, \nas has been pointed out by Governor Napolitano, who is so familiar with \nthis, along with others who have made their views very well known, you \nhave to not only have a border, but no matter how tall your fence is \ngoing to be, the ladder will always be a little taller. You have to \nhave strong law enforcement, but you are going to have to have internal \nemployment enforcement as well, work site enforcement, as well as \nregularizing those here at the time. So we have the work site \nemployment; employers must verify the identity of work authorization of \nall employees; there are increases in civil and criminal penalties \nagainst employers who hire unauthorized aliens knowingly, or with \nreckless disregard; and it includes measures to prevent identity theft \nand fraud.\n  It is dramatically different from the 1986 act. We here on the floor \ndon't want to repeat 1986. That legislation was signed into law by \nPresident Reagan and enforced by a Republican administration from 1986 \nto 1992. I voted against that legislation for many of the reasons I am \nmentioning now. You had absolutely no workforce enforcement, none at \nall, virtually no requirements. We see the problems we had. We had \nabuse of that system.\n  We have in this legislation, as I pointed out previously, addressed \nthose kinds of problems that lent themselves to fraud after 1986. We \nhave tough enforcement in the workplace. We have inspectors, close to a \nthousand inspectors, who are going to go in and look at these \nemployment sites and make sure the kinds of protections that are \nguaranteed under this legislation are respected. We are going to insist \nthat with any kind of employment program, they are going to get the \nprotections of the prevailing wage and those are not going to be taken \nby surveys that are done by the private sector; they will be done by \nthe Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n  We will have protections under OSHA, and workers compensation, and \nwhistleblower protection is in this legislation for any individuals \nworking in those sites. For the first time, whistleblower protections \nwill be there for those individuals. We are going to have a thousand \ninspectors who will be inspecting the work sites to make sure that the \nrights of individuals who are going to come into this country will be \npreserved.\n  At the present time, we find out the differences. This chart shows \nhow this process and system must work. If they are going to be in the \ntemporary program, the employer must advertise before applying for a \nworker. The employer must hire any qualified American applicants before \napplying for a temporary worker. Temporary workers are restricted to \nareas with high unemployment, and employers cannot undercut American \nwages by paying less to temporary workers.\n  Now we know even for the temporary workers, they are to be treated \nunder the labor laws, with those protections, and they are not now. The \nborders are broken. If we don't pass this legislation, that is going to \ncontinue. That is the alternative--the kind of exploitation that exists \nnow in so many communities, the fear, the exploitation, the harassment, \nand the driving down of wages, which threatens American wages. All of \nthat exists now.\n  So we are ensuring, again, respect for the law in coming into this \ncountry, the law at the border, the law at the work site, and the law \nin transition. This chart is a good explanation made by Secretary \nChertoff:\n\n       Enforcement alone will not do the job of securing our \n     borders. Enforcement at the border will only be successful in \n     the long term if it is coupled with a more sensible approach \n     to the 10 to 12 million illegal aliens in the country today, \n     and the many more who will attempt to migrate into the United \n     States for economic reasons.\n\n  That is what we have heard from the Department of Homeland Security \ntime in and time out--that there has to be a comprehensive approach to \nthis issue. We have to bring people out of the shadows. They are going \nto have to pay a penalty. We insist that they pay a penalty. Then, \nrather than let them go to the front of the list, they have to go to \nthe end of the list in order to begin a process--if they are able to \ndemonstrate the payment of the penalty, if they demonstrate they can \nlearn and are willing to learn English, if they are able to demonstrate \nthey have long work experience, and if they can demonstrate they are \nnot involved in criminal activity. We know 70,000 permanent resident \naliens are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan since these wars started--\n70,000. So we know that so many of these families who are coming here--\nwhy do they come? Basically, what are their values? What are the values \nwe consider positive in the United States? We admire people who work \nhard. That is an important factor. That is essential in terms of the\n\n[[Page S7300]]\n\nachievement of the American dream. We admire people who are devoted to \nfamily and their children.\n  We find so many of these undocumented, but why do they come here? It \nis because they want to have a better life for their children. How do \nwe know that? Because there is more than $40 billion returned by these \nimmigrants to the countries of Central and South America every single \nyear. These are individuals who are making a total of $10,000, and $40 \nbillion is returned to their countries. To whom? It is returned to \ntheir families and children. They work hard, they are devoted to their \nchildren and families and have an extraordinary dedication to their \nparents and grandparents, caring for them. Those are the positive \nqualities that all of us admire.\n  On the other hand, they have broken the law, so, therefore, they have \nto pay a penalty. Why did they break the law? It is because we have the \nmagnet of the American economy drawing them here. That magnet doesn't \npay any penalty. These people risk their lives to get in here. They \nsuffer the risk of exploitation. And even through all of that, they \nreturn the resources back to their families. So it is the magnet of the \nAmerican economy, but still we are making them pay--not the employer, \nthe magnet, or the American economy, but they make an extraordinary \ncontribution. Sure, there are some bad apples. But they make an \nextraordinary contribution--the immigrants--just as all of our parents \nand grandparents and forebears have made in terms of this country. This \nis what we have done. We have seen what happened at the border.\n\n  We have talked about what is happening in terms of the employment \nsituation. We know what is going on, in terms of the kind of \ndistinction between the past and present. Those individuals, the 12\\1/\n2\\ million people who are here--this is the explanation of what we call \nthe Z visa eligibility: They entered the United States before January \n2007. They remained employed and continuously present and not a \nnational security threat. There has to be a review. They have to \nregister--the 18 months--to make sure they are registered and are not \nany national security threat. There can be no serious criminal record \nin or out of the United States. We have outlined that. We have gone \ninto detail and explanation in earlier kinds of considerations of \namendments. If they have committed serious crimes, they are out; they \ndon't come back. We have explained that and we have gone through that \ntime and time again through the course of this debate.\n  They have to pay the processing fees of $1,500; State impact \nassistance fee, $500; and a penalty of $1,000. All of that--some \n$3,000--is not even getting you down the road toward a green card and \ncitizenship. The $500 from 12 million people--$6 billion--goes to \nStates that have the great impact to help them in terms of offsetting \nany of their additional burdens, in terms of health care and education. \nThat is not an insignificant amount of resources. We went through \nduring yesterday's discussion and debate how, by and large, these \nindividuals are healthier, and we also went into about how they had \nutilized the health care system, and it shows that is effectively an \nincidental additional kind of expense. They must comply with the \nSelective Service Act, submit fingerprints and undergo a background \ncheck, and they must get in the back of the line for a green card. That \nmeans, for all of those who have been waiting in line, about 4 million \npeople who have relatives here and have petitioned for them to come \ninto the United States many, without this legislation, would have \nvirtually no opportunity to do so.\n  They will have that opportunity to come into the United States over \nan 8-year period. Then, after that 8-year period, these individuals we \nhave discussed here could begin to move, and depending on their work \nrecord and their participation and sense of community, they could get \non path toward a green card. Then it takes 5 more years to become a \ncitizen. The earliest is maybe 13 or 14 years before they would be able \nto have that opportunity for citizenship. It is more distant than that \nfor the majority of the people. All the time they have to behave and \nfollow the law and pay the kinds of penalties that will be included.\n  Mr. President, other colleagues wish to address the Senate, so I will \nbe brief. I give credit to our friend and colleague from Illinois, \nSenator Durbin, who reminded us about the opportunities we have in \ncreating an educational pathway for the children of the undocumented. \nWe know the children who come in here are coming in through the action \nof their parents. We understand that. It is through the actions of the \nparents. The DREAM Act students are eligible for Z visas and permanent \nresidence if the student came in as a child under age 16 and has good \nmoral character, or attends college or enlists in the military for 2 \nyears. I know, as chairman of the Education Committee, the challenge we \nhave in terms of having those students--Hispanic students and others \nfrom other cultures and traditions, in terms of the education \nexperience. Having a good education opportunity for those children in \nthis country is key to our national security, key to the success of our \neconomy, and key to the success of the hopes and dreams of these \nchildren.\n  Too often, half of the children from the Hispanic tradition drop out \nbefore they are ever able to be successful. But we know that others who \ncomplete the educational system and graduate--in my home State of \nMassachusetts, we have seen so many in Lowell, Lawrence, New Bedford, \nand other places who have children from undocumented families end up \nbeing valedictorians, class presidents, and extraordinary leaders. Then \nthe opportunity comes for continued education and it is virtually \nclosed down because they are denied that opportunity.\n  Under the DREAM Act, this gives them the opportunity for in-State \nhelp and assistance. That is what this bill is about, too. It is about \nhope in terms of the future. It is about hope. It is relieving the \nkinds of anxiety those 12 million or 13 million undocumented are \nexperiencing this afternoon and will experience tonight when they have \na knock on the door and wonder if ICE is coming there to arrest and \ndeport them, separate their families, and send them back--even after \nthey have been here for a number of years.\n  We don't hear much discussion about that. Everything seems to be \npretty cut and dried around here. That is a major factor. How many of \nus have met some of these individuals, the undocumented? I did just 3 \nor 4 days ago, returning here at the airport. I talked to a person who \nhas been here 28 years, as have his two brothers. The brothers have \nbeen able to get green cards, but he had not. He talked about the fear \nhe and his family have at this time of being arrested and deported.\n  In this legislation is another extremely important provision. That is \nwhat we call the AgJOBS bill. I see the Senator from California here, \nSenator Feinstein, who has done an extraordinary job in helping to \nbring this part of the legislation before the Senate, with Senator \nCraig, whom I commend for his diligence. They have been the real \nleaders in this proposal.\n\n  For many of us, to go back to the time of the Bracero Program--I can \nremember being a member of our committee in the early 1960s when we had \nhearings in southern Texas and also in California about the Bracero \nProgram. Few times in our history did we have the kind of exploitation \nof individuals--slavery certainly; slavery, yes; slavery first--but \nafter that, the Bracero exploitation was one of the darkest sides of \nAmerican history in the exploitation of individuals.\n  There are a number of blemishes out there. We can talk about those--\nAmerican Indians and others--but this was really one of the very worst. \nWe took time to get rid of it, and we did get rid of that. Then we went \nthrough a long period of enormous tension between the workers and the \ngrowers. We all remember the extraordinary contribution of Cesar \nChavez, the dignity he gave to so many of these farm workers. That kind \nof tension existed for years.\n  Now, finally, in recent years there has been an agreement between \nthese two very strong groups who are committed in their own ways to \ntheir own views and philosophies. They have come together and have \nagreed on a pathway that will ensure success and give these workers the \nrespect and dignity they have been denied. It is called the AgJOBS \nbill.\n  A great deal of credit goes to our colleague in the House, Howard \nBerman, who spent years working on this legislation. That legislation \nhas had 65, 66\n\n[[Page S7301]]\n\ncosponsors, but we have been unable to get it before the Senate for \nratification of that program. It is included in this legislation.\n  If this legislation passes, the message it sends to about 900,000 \nagricultural workers, who, again, have been exploited, and to their \nfamilies, is the fact that over the next 8 years, they are going to \nhave to work and continue to work hard. They can work in agriculture. \nThey have some opportunity to work outside agriculture too. They have \nto play by the rules, demonstrate they are paying their taxes, work \nhard and pay the fines and penalties, but they have some opportunity to \nmove forward after all these years, get a green card, and then 5 years \nlater move forward. So it is an enormous period of hope for all those \nindividuals.\n  This legislation is about dealing in a tough way with a tough problem \nat the border. We do that by taking the best advice, the best \nrecommendations, the best suggestions from the best people who know \nabout homeland security. We have done that and worked closely together. \nI don't think there are any differences on that point.\n  We need to have tough enforcement in the workplace, and we have \nachieved that. It can be improved further, but it has been achieved, \nand we have talked about it.\n  We have also provided a pathway for earned legalization after these \nindividuals pay the fines, significant fines, in many ways, fines for \nan average family who makes about $10,000 to $12,000 a year, that \nrepresents years of work with their kinds of salaries. They have to go \nto the end of the line. They have to demonstrate good work experience. \nThey have to earn, earn, earn, earn, earn the ability to adjust their \nrelationship with our country.\n  We know these families. We have seen them in our churches. We have \nseen them in our shops. We have seen them in the Armed Forces of the \nUnited States of America, and they serve with great pride and dignity \nand they want to contribute and be a part of the American dream like \neveryone else. And we are giving them that opportunity.\n  If we vote no on this legislation, we are dampening and canceling \nthat opportunity, and we are returning to the law of the jungle because \nthat is what it is. It is a jungle on that border.\n  Every day we continue without this legislation, we have these well-\ntrained, well-disciplined, highly motivated border guards chasing \npeople across the desert who are landscapers. They ought to be looking \nfor the terrorists, the smugglers, the lawbreakers. That is who they \nshould be looking after. If we don't pass this legislation, they will \ncontinue to be looking out after the landscapers instead of the \nterrorists, instead of the smugglers, and instead of those who threaten \nthe security of the people of this country.\n  That is it. Take your choice. Anyone can flyspeck this legislation. I \nam not accusing those who differ with me on particular proposals being \nnecessarily flyspeckers, but sometimes we have to make a judgment. \nSometimes we have to make a decision. Sometimes there has to be \nfinality. We have debated this issue on the floor of the Senate for 2 \nweeks. We debated it last year for 2 weeks. We are not just coming at \nthis legislation for the first time. We have debated just about every \nfeature of this program, somewhat different from last year, but the \nthemes are the same, the arguments are the same, the amendments are \nalmost the same.\n  The only question is the will of this body and the will to make a \njudgment, a decision that we are going to clean up our borders, get a \nsense of law in terms of those borders and in the employment areas, get \na respect for the law from those who have been undocumented; they are \ngoing to pay their price, give a sense of hope to the young people who \ncan benefit, and give a sense of dignity and pride to those who work in \nthe fields across this country in AgJOBS.\n  This is going to be an important vote this evening. If we are talking \nabout a vote about America's future, this is it. This is it. This is it \ntonight. We can all find the excuses. We all can find the reasons to \nsay no. We can all find different aspects of this legislation with \nwhich we differ, but underneath, this is a proposal that is deeply \nrooted in remedy, one of the great national challenges we have--broken \nborders and a broken immigration system.\n  This legislation is a downpayment that the American people are asking \nand demanding of the Senate of the United States that we move forward \non. Let's not disappoint them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, will the Senator from New Hampshire yield \nfor a unanimous consent request as to order of speakers following him?\n  Mr. GREGG. Of course.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nSenator from New Hampshire, I be recognized for up to 6 minutes, and \nthen the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, be recognized for up \nto 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I had the opportunity to listen to the \npresentation of the Senator from Massachusetts which, as always, was \nextraordinary. He is one of the people I admire around here the most \nbecause he has been such an extraordinary force. Even though I disagree \nwith him so often, I still admire him immensely. How he has maintained \nthe energy and commitment to his causes over such a long period of time \nis beyond me. I certainly could not do it. One just has to respect that \nability. He is clearly one of the great legislators in the history of \nthis body. In fact, I wish he were not quite so great on many \noccasions.\n  In any event, much of what he says makes sense on this issue. His \ncommitment to it is obviously intense and thorough, and I admire it.\n  The point he makes, which is that we now have a dysfunctional system \nand there is basically chaos within the immigration system in this \ncountry relative to illegal immigrants being in this country and the \nborders remaining regrettably reasonably porous--although they have \ntightened up over the last few years--is very legitimate. This bill is \nan attempt to genuinely address those issues in a number of areas.\n  I have made the point throughout the discussion of this bill that \nfrom my standpoint, a good piece of immigration legislation has to \naccomplish essentially four things.\n  First, it has to make the borders secure. There is no reason we \ncannot secure the southern border. The northern border is a bigger \nproblem because of its length and its topography, but the southern \nborder can be secured.\n  As chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Appropriations \nand prior to that as chairman of the Commerce-State-Justice \nSubcommittee, I tried to commit major new resources in this effort. \nThere was a consensus to do that and a bipartisan effort to do that, \nand we have dramatically expanded the number of agents on the border, \nthe technology on the border, and the detention bed capability. But we \nstill have a ways to go.\n  Actually, the first or second amendment adopted--it seems like an ion \nago, but it was only a week ago--was an amendment I offered to this \nbill which would bring the commitment in numbers in this bill in the \narea of Border Patrol agents, in the area of detention beds, in the \narea of electronic fencing and regular fencing along the border up to \nwhat was the consensus position as to what was needed to secure the \nborder. So this bill now has in it the necessary language.\n  The question is, do we have the capacity to put that in place. But \nthat goes back to the trigger which is in this bill, and the trigger in \nthe bill says, until that is in place, none of the other language can \ngo into force which deals with guest worker and illegal immigrants and \nhow we regularize their status in this country.\n  So I believe that issue has been effectively addressed in this bill, \nand with the amendment I offered and put in the proper position--\nalthough more can be done in the area of how one defines ``trigger,'' \nand certainly there are proposals going around here which will be voted \non which I will support that will deal with the funding--it makes sure \nfunding cannot dry up as a result of the annual discretionary process. \nThat has been addressed.\n  The second issue is we have to have an effective guest worker \nprogram, and to have an effective guest worker program, we have to \naddress the third\n\n[[Page S7302]]\n\nissue. And the third issue is that we have enforcement at the employee-\nemployer meeting place, so the employer is hiring people effectively in \nthis country legally and not able to hire illegal aliens, people who \ncome into this country illegally.\n  Those two issues are intertwined, and the bill does address the issue \nof employment through strict enforcement and the requirement of \nidentification cards, which is going to be very difficult to \naccomplish, but again it is a trigger. Nothing in this bill goes \nforward, as I understand it, until that trigger is met.\n  Second is the guest worker program. There is no way we can have an \neffective immigration process unless we take some of the pressure off \nof the fact we have an economy that demands people to work in this \neconomy above and beyond what we have as a citizenry in our country \ntoday. There simply is a demand in our Nation for people to come here \nand work, and it should be done under a guest worker program so that \nthose folks who come here, work, and go back know they are coming here \nto participate in the worker program, not to be here permanently. That \nwill relieve the pressure at the border significantly if we have that. \nIt is a big part of border security and, of course, is important not \nonly from a standpoint of controlling who comes into the country, but \nit is critically important from the standpoint of dealing with the \nthreats we face as a country from terrorism. An effective guest worker \nprogram is critical.\n  Fortunately, as this bill was originally drafted, it did have such a \nprogram. It had a guest worker with a significant number of guest \nworkers, 400,000 every year. It had a guest worker program that was \nproperly structured. Unfortunately, as a result of the amendment \nprocess around here, that guest worker program has been fundamentally \nundermined, and in its present structure, as was pointed out last night \nwhen the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota was adopted, that \nwas, somebody called it a killer amendment, a fatal amendment to this \nbill. If it stays in place, it makes the guest worker program \nessentially useless.\n  All we are going to be able to do is bring guest workers in for \nagricultural activity, and they will be limited in that area; and guest \nworkers needed in other functions of the economy, whether it is the \nresort industry or simply in the day-to-day activities functioning as a \nnation, there is going to be pressure for them to come here illegally \nagain, and that undermines the purpose of the bill. So unfortunately \nthat was done. The Bingaman amendment prior to that purely did a lot of \ndamage to the guest worker program. So that didn't work out as well as \nit should, but hopefully it can be corrected.\n\n  The fourth element I have talked about is how you deal with this \npathway, how you deal with the issue of who are here illegally. We are \nnot going to, as a practical matter, take 12 million people, or maybe \neven 15 million, who are here illegally, assuming we could even find \nthem, and deport them. That is simply not going to happen in our \nculture. We wouldn't tolerate it. As a practical matter, we couldn't do \nit. So what we need to do is figure out some way to get those people \nout from behind the shadows so they are publicly identified as being \nhere, not only from the standpoint of dealing with them but from the \nstandpoint of a national need of knowing who is here for reasons of \nnational security. So this bill attempts to do that.\n  The bill has some flaws in that area, but it also has some strengths \nin that area, and they have been previously outlined. The discussion on \nthat has been extensive, so I will not get into the specifics. But \nthose four items, for me, were the test of how this bill goes forward.\n  As a corollary to those four items, however, is the theme behind \nimmigration, which I think is critical, and which there is specific \nlanguage in this bill which needs to be dealt with. One of the themes \nbehind immigration, besides having a secure border and a guest worker \nprogram that works and making sure we take the pressure off having \npeople coming into this country illegally, is the need to go around the \nworld and take the best and the brightest who want to come to America \nand let them in to participate in our economy and make our economy more \nvibrant.\n  We have had hearings on this issue, and there is a certain \nobviousness to this issue. I mean, if somebody is in India or China--\nand those are the examples most often used, but it could be \nCzechoslovakia or Poland--if somebody has an advanced degree of some \nnature or is highly educated and has the capacity to contribute to our \neconomy--and who wants to come here--why would we want to leave that \nperson in those countries as a competitor, when we can bring them here \nand have them actually be a job creator?\n  We hear a lot about outsourcing in these debates that we have had \nover the last election cycle, where we are sending jobs overseas. If \nyou bring a person who has unique talents that our Nation needs and \nthat is an adjunct to, rather than a replacement for, people who are \nalready here, that creates jobs. That person is a job center.\n  In fact, it was interesting. We had Bill Gates testify before our \ncommittee, and this is exactly what he said. Here is a guy who has \nprobably done more to make the American economy vibrant over the last \n20 or 25 years than any other person alive. I mean, he is an individual \nwho essentially transformed our economy and made us the leader in the \nworld in what was the leading issue in the world, which is technology. \nHe comes before the committee and he comes before the country in \ngeneral and he says: Listen, we need to bring these people here because \nthey are being developed in these other countries; and if we don't \nbring them here--if they want to come here--and take advantage of their \nabilities, then they are going to do it somewhere else.\n  I don't want the next Bill Gates to be in China or in India. I want \nthe next Bill Gates to be right here in the United States creating \njobs. The point is, when you bring these folks in, they create jobs \nhere. So one of the programs where we have to do this is the H-1B \nprogram. This is a program where we say specifically, if there are \ncompanies in this country or businesses in this country or colleges in \nthis country or educational facilities in this country that need \ntalented people, and they can't get them here in this country--because \nwe don't have the pool necessary--then they can bring people in from \noutside the country who have the talent to do those jobs.\n  Most of this is in computer science. Most of the H-1B visas, 45 \npercent of the applications, are computer science people; with the next \nbiggest group, about 11 percent, being teachers. So industries, \nbusinesses, entrepreneurs, colleges, and schools that need these folks \nto make their businesses work and to give them the opportunity to \ncreate jobs, whether it is in New Hampshire or Washington State or \nacross this country, need to be able to attract these people into the \ncountry.\n  But the H-1B program, for some reason, has opposition. It doesn't \nmake any sense to me. I look across the aisle and I say: This should be \na logical thing for both sides of the aisle to be supportive of. The \nconcept of bringing in, insourcing jobs, as opposed to outsourcing \njobs, should be very attractive to the other side of the aisle. The \nconcept of bringing intelligent people here to create opportunities \nshould be attractive to both sides of the aisle, but there seems to be \nsome undercurrent that they are taking away American jobs. They aren't. \nIn fact, they are adding to American jobs.\n  As a matter of fact, the National Science Foundation has pointed out \nwe need these types of people; that we are woefully short of the people \nin the math, science, and technology areas and are not producing the \nkinds of numbers we need to be out of our own university systems. So \nwhy not go overseas to see if we can find these people to come here and \nparticipate?\n  In fact, there is such a demand for these people that, under the \npresent law, they are allowed 65,000 of these applications every year, \nplus the 20,000 add-on for highly talented people. The first day the \napplicant process opened, on April 2, 140,000 applications came in to \nfill the 65,000 available slots.\n  My own view is we should have taken all 140,000, if they were \nlegitimate, and brought them here. I mean that probably multiplies 10 \ntimes. Probably a million and a half jobs could have been created with \nbringing those folks in here. But under the present law, we are \nlimited.\n\n[[Page S7303]]\n\n  This bill represents that it increases that number from 65,000 to \n115,000. But here is the problem. It knocks out the 20,000 specialists. \nSo actually the increase is rather marginal compared to what we need in \nthis country to take care of the concerns we have. Plus, unfortunately, \nthis bill creates layer after layer of bureaucracy, in addition to the \nbureaucracy which already exists. It costs on top of the costs that \nalready exist as a result of a number of amendments on this floor, \nwhich makes it more difficult to get these folks into the country.\n  In addition, the bill creates a new standard which makes absolutely \nno sense--absolutely no sense--which says that the skill of the \nindividual relative to talent--let us say a physicist, an \nastrophysicist--has to match up exactly with the job that is available. \nWe have an incredibly fungible economy, and the requirement that the \napplicant who has an advanced degree, that his degree match identically \nwith the job, is a new requirement and a hurdle that is unnecessary and \nis counterproductive to getting talent into this country. I don't \nunderstand why it is in here, and it should be taken out before it goes \nmuch further.\n  Clearly, in our society, there is tremendous mobility within the \ndisciplines. If you are trained as a physicist, an astrophysicist, you \nare going to be able to do a lot of things in our society and move \nwithin the job areas. Under the rules of the H-1B application, you have \nto be able to move in a way that you are not displacing Americans.\n  That is just a very difficult issue, if we keep that in here. In \naddition, there have been attacks on the H-1B program to claim that \nthere is ``warehousing'' of these types of folks. I guess that is \nprobably a pejorative, but that is the term which is used, involving \nIndian companies that basically collect together a large number of \npeople with these degrees and then basically get all the applications \nfor H-1B and use them in that manner. This bill corrects that, but we \ncontinue to hear that complaint from folks on the other side of the \naisle, not necessarily because they are on the other side of the aisle \nbut because they oppose the H-1B program, because really that is a red \nherring. This bill corrects that issue. That should not be raised \nagainst this.\n  We know for a fact we need these types of individuals in our country, \nand it is a huge advantage for us to draw them into this country. I \nhope before this bill goes much further that we correct the problems \nthat are in this bill relative to the H-1B program and make it a much \nmore expansive program and make it a much more flexible program and one \nthat will allow us to bring these talented people here so they can \ncreate jobs and make this economy stronger along the lines of what Bill \nGates suggested is necessary and which I strongly endorse.\n  I know the junior Senator from Washington, Ms. Cantwell, has an \namendment in this area. I have an amendment in this area. I have been \ngoing on the assumption that Senator Cantwell's, which is a little \nbroader amendment than mine, would be the one that will go forward. I \nunderstand it is being held up on the other side. If that continues, it \nwill be a problem for me. We at least deserve a vote on it, at the \nminimum, and I certainly hope that will occur.\n  As a corollary to this discussion, I wish to highlight quickly a \nconcern I have for the merit system. I think the merit system is \nexactly the approach we should take and the point system is exactly the \napproach we should take, but I still don't understand why somebody who \nhas worked as an agricultural worker for 5 years gets the same number \nof points as somebody who has a physics degree--even more points, \nactually, than someone who has a physics degree. It seems to me, if you \nare going to weigh this properly in a merit system--we are not talking \nabout a guest worker program here; we are talking about a merit system \nproposal. We are not talking about the AgJOBS proposals; we are talking \nabout the merit system.\n  In a merit system, what we should be looking for is talent and people \nwhose abilities are unique and those which we need in this country. \nThat is why there should not be this strange allocation of points which \nmakes no sense at all in the context of the purpose of the merit \nsystem. I hope that will also be changed.\n  On balance, of the things that concern me about this bill, two of \nthem are moving in the right direction, which are border security and \nthe issue of pathway. But the things that really concern me continue to \nbe the guest worker program and how we are going to handle the H-1B \nissue.\n  So the jury is still out, to put it quite simply, on this bill. There \nneeds to be a lot more time spent on the amendment process so we can \nfind out how we are going to end up working this bill through the \nprocess. This is a complex bill. It deserves significant time on the \nfloor, and it deserves to have proper discussion with amendments that \nare put forward by people who did not happen to be in negotiations for \nthe grand compromise. Those guys did a good job negotiating, but they \ndidn't necessarily touch all the bases that are of concern to many of \nus.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. First of all, Mr. President, let me tell everyone within \nthe sound of my voice, no tricks. What I am doing is trying to protect \nthose people who feel it would be to the advantage of the country and \nthe Senate if we got a bill. This doesn't change any of the things I \nhave said privately to Senators or publicly. Basically, what I am going \nto do is send a couple of amendments to the desk so there is some \ncontrol over amendments that are offered. This will allow those of us \nwho feel there should be a bill some control over the next amendment \nthat is offered.\n  Again, no tricks. I have alerted everyone the best that I can what I \nwas going to do, and I hope this works out well. I am confident we are \ndoing the right thing.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1492 to Amendment No. 1235\n\n  Mr. President, I call up a second-degree amendment, which is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1492 to amendment No. 1235.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require the use of objective criteria to determine which \n undocumented persons have sufficient community ties to be awarded a Z \n             visa and remain in the United States lawfully)\n\n       At the end of the amendment add the following:\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this act the \n     following shall take effect for the Z Nonimmigration \n     Category:\n       (b) Establishment of Z Nonimmigrant Category.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 101(a)(15) (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)), \n     as amended by section 401(a), is further amended by adding at \n     the end the following:\n       ``(Z) subject to title VI of the Secure Borders, Economic \n     Opportunity, and Immigration Reform Act of 2007, an alien \n     who--\n       ``(i)(I) has maintained a continuous physical presence in \n     the United States since the date that is 4 years before the \n     date of the enactment of the Secure Borders, Economic \n     Opportunity, and Immigration Reform Act of 2007;\n       ``(II) is employed, and seeks to continue performing labor, \n     services, or education; and\n       ``(III) the Secretary of Homeland Security determines has \n     sufficient ties to a community in the United States, based \n     on--\n\n       ``(aa) whether the applicant has immediate relatives (as \n     defined in section 201(b)(2)(A)) residing in the United \n     States;\n       ``(bb) the amount of cumulative time the applicant has \n     lived in the United States;\n       ``(cc) whether the applicant owns property in the United \n     States;\n       ``(dd) whether the applicant owns a business in the United \n     States;\n       ``(ee) the extent to which the applicant knows the English \n     language;\n       ``(ff) the applicant's work history in the United States;\n       ``(gg) whether the applicant attended school (either \n     primary, secondary, college, post-graduate) in the United \n     States;\n       ``(hh) the extent to which the applicant has a history of \n     paying Federal and State income taxes;\n       ``(ii) whether the applicant has been convicted of criminal \n     activity in the United States; and\n       ``(jj) whether the applicant has certifies his or her \n     intention to ultimately become a United States citizen;\n\n       ``(ii)(I) is the spouse or parent (65 years of age or \n     older) of an alien described in clause (i);\n       ``(II) was, during the 2-year period ending on the date on \n     which the Secure Borders, Economic Opportunity, and \n     Immigration Reform Act of 2007 was introduced in the Senate, \n     the spouse of an alien who was subsequently classified as a Z \n     nonimmigrant\n\n[[Page S7304]]\n\n     under this section, or is eligible for such classification, \n     if--\n\n       ``(aa) the termination of the relationship with such spouse \n     was connected to domestic violence; and\n       ``(bb) the spouse has been battered or subjected to extreme \n     cruelty by the spouse or parent who is a Z nonimmigrant; or\n\n       ``(III) is under 18 years of age at the time of application \n     for nonimmigrant status under this subparagraph and was born \n     to, or legally adopted by, a parent described in clause \n     (i).''.\n       (2) Rulemaking.--Not later than 6 months after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall promulgate \n     regulations, in accordance with the procedures set forth in \n     sections 555, 556, and 557 of title 5, United States Code, \n     which establish the precise system that the Secretary will \n     use to make a determination under section 101(a)(15)(Z)(ii) \n     of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as added by paragraph \n     (1).\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1199\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order with respect to \nthe Dodd amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1493 to Amendment No. 1199\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I call up the amendment that is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require employers seeking to hire aliens to certify that \nthey have not, and do not intend to, provide a notice of a mass layoff)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, I will be seated in a brief period of time, \nbut I wished to let everyone know we have people working in different \nrooms in this building trying to come up with some way for us to move \nforward. We have tried on a number of occasions this afternoon to have \namendments. We started at noon--6\\1/2\\ hours ago. We have been thwarted \nat every attempt. So we are arriving at a point now where I hope there \ncan be agreement as to how we proceed. If not, we will proceed anyway \nin a manner I hope will be in keeping with the intent of the Democrats \nand the Republicans and the White House.\n  I do say in this interim this afternoon that I have had some \ninteresting calls from people who care a great deal about this bill. \nOne of the choice experiences of my life was a year ago, in my office, \nright back here, on a Saturday. We were debating immigration. I had the \ngood fortune to meet for the first time Cardinal McCarrick and Cardinal \nMahony, and they were very interested in doing something that would \nhelp the immigration problems they see on a daily basis.\n  I had the good fortune to speak to those good men during the past \nhour or two. The reason I mention the meeting of that Saturday is that \nsome people know I am not a member of the Catholic faith. I have the \ngreatest respect in the world for Catholics. The best friend I ever had \nin my life was a devout Catholic. He went to church every day. He was \nGovernor of the State of Nevada and I was Lieutenant Governor. He \ntaught me how to fight. He was my best friend. He taught me in high \nschool. He died in church. He went to church every day, and he went to \nchurch one morning, put his head on his shoulder, and died.\n  For someone who set such a great example for Christianity and \ngoodness, there couldn't be a better way for this good man, Michael \nCallahan, to die. But the reason I mention that is that as the meeting \nwas breaking up, and there was some staff there, I said, I have the \ngood fortune of being able to meet with prominent people on occasion, \nbut this is a special meeting for me. I would like to be able to tell \nmy children and grandchildren about this meeting. So before we go out \nto the press, could we say a prayer together?\n  We gathered there in my conference room and Cardinal Mahony said a \nprayer for our country. When he finished, Cardinal McCarrick said a \nprayer for me. That was one of the highlights of my life. When it was \nover, Cardinal McCarrick said: Well, I am not going to be able to tell \nmy children and grandchildren about this, but I can tell my nieces and \ngrand nieces about this.\n  So during the 6\\1/2\\ hours we have been away from the floor, there \nhave been a lot of good people working on a way to finalize this \nlegislation, and I hope that everyone understands the efforts I have \nmade now. It is not an effort to trick anybody or deceive anyone. It is \nan effort to try to move this legislation forward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                           Stem Cell Research\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, earlier today the other body passed S. 5, \nthe embryonic stem cell research bill, by a vote of 247 to 176. This \nlegislation offers hope to literally 100 million people in our own \ncountry.\n  I think of the individual names. Mr. President, I had a friend in law \nschool, Larry Katz, who died of ALS. If you have ever seen someone who \nsuffered from that disease, you know how cruel it can be. So today I \nthink of Larry Katz and I think of those individuals who are suffering \nfrom diseases in which embryonic stem cell research holds out hope of a \ncure, of a way of dealing with these diseases. I think of Josh Basil. \nJosh was a young person who was on the beaches in Delaware. A wave hit \nhim, picked him up, turned him upside down, and fractured his spine. He \nis a quadriplegic today. He has hope that he will walk again. He \nexercises and works out every day to keep his muscles in great shape. \nBut he wants us to meet him halfway. He wants us to give the tools to \nthe scientists so they can look at ways in which we can regenerate the \ndamaged parts of his body.\n  Embryonic stem cell research holds out tremendous hope. It allows, we \nhope, for the regeneration of damaged cells. This is incredible work \nwhich is being done at research institutions in this country. I am \nproud of the work being done at Johns Hopkins University in my own \nState and the University of Maryland Medical Center and NIH looking at \nALS, looking at spinal cord injuries, looking at Alzheimer's, heart \ndisease, Parkinson's, diabetes, and looking at embryonic stem cell \nresearch as perhaps finding the answer to these diseases.\n  Dr. John Gearhart and Dr. Douglas Kerr at Johns Hopkins have helped \nme to understand what embryonic stem cell research could mean. They \nhave taken paralyzed mice and have been able to get movement by \ninjecting embryonic stem cells into mice.\n  The United States has been the leader in the world on research. We \nhave seen incredible discoveries in this country. Yet, today, we are \nseeing researchers leave the United States because of the restrictions \non embryonic stem cell research. They are going to other countries \nwhere those restrictions do not apply, robbing this Nation and robbing \nthe world of the collaborative research that could be taking place. The \nreason, frankly, dates back to August 9, 2001, when President Bush \nissued his Executive order.\n  We have a lot more information today than we did in 2001. In 2001, we \nthought there were 60 to 78 stem cell lines available that researchers \ncould use. We were wrong. There were only about 22 lines available. \nMost are contaminated. We don't have the diversity we need in order \nthat scientists can really look at embryonic stem cell research and get \nthe best potential out of\n\n[[Page S7305]]\n\nthat type of research. We know that today. If we knew then what we know \nnow, we would have realized those restrictions are not workable.\n  S. 5 is a bipartisan bill. It deals with embryos that are currently \nin existence. It sets up the ethical framework to do the proper \nresearch. You cannot create an embryo for the purpose of sale for \nresearch. It has to be in existence today. It has to have the consent \nof the donor. You can't get financial incentives for doing it. They \nhave to be embryos which were going to be used for in vitro \nfertilization which now are going to be destroyed. It allows those \nembryos to be used for legitimate medical research. It is the right \nthing to do for this country. It is the right thing to do, to give hope \nto 100 million people in this country. Now it has passed this body, it \nhas passed the other body. We have a bill that provides the right \nbalance for us to move forward as the world leader in medical research.\n  Dr. Elias Zerhouni, the Director of NIH, said:\n\n       From my standpoint, it is clear today that American science \n     will be better served and the Nation will be better served if \n     we let our scientists have access to more stem cell lines.\n\n  Dr. Zerhouni is our leader on this issue in this country.\n  We are now at another crossroads where we can take a choice and move \nforward so America can continue to lead the world in appropriate \nresearch to try to end the misery of suffering for those who have ALS \nor spinal cord injuries or Alzheimer's, heart disease, Parkinson's--so \nmany different types of diseases in which embryonic stem cell research \nholds out such promise.\n  I urge the President of the United States, don't let your veto stand \nin the way. Don't do it. Move forward with a bill that is bipartisan, a \nbill that has been vetted properly among all communities.\n  This is a bill which, we understand, provides the right framework for \nresearch in this country. We have that opportunity if only the \nPresident will sign this bill and allow our scientists to do the \nappropriate work to help the people of this Nation and literally help \nthe people of the world. I urge the President of the United States to \nsign S. 5, which will shortly be presented to him.\n  At this point, I have been informed that the Senator from California \ndoes not intend to use her time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I was not intending to speak at this moment, but I \nlistened to several of my colleagues talk about the immigration bill. \nWe apparently will cast another cloture vote this evening and perhaps \nvotes beyond that, depending on how that cloture vote turns out. But \nbecause of a number of statements by colleagues this evening, I wanted \nto make a couple of comments.\n  There is a suggestion by a number of our colleagues who brought a \nplan to the floor, what is called a grand bargain or the grand \ncompromise. This is a group of people--self-appointed, I guess--who \nspent a lot of time in rooms together, with the White House \naccompanying them, and produced a plan they brought to the floor of the \nSenate and said: Here is our immigration plan. And by the way, if you \ntry to change it, you will destroy it.\n  Most Members of the Senate were not part of these meetings and not \npart of this grand compromise. A number of us have offered amendments. \nA number of our colleagues have tried to offer amendments. I am \nthinking of Senator Webb, who has waited for 2 weeks to offer an \namendment. It is problematic whether he will be given an opportunity to \noffer an amendment. He wasn't part of the group, wasn't part of the \ngrand compromise, but thinks he could improve the legislation. But, \nbecause those who have brought the bill to the floor have done so with \narms locked together, believing that anyone who could try to improve on \ntheir work would be destroying their compromise, we have people who are \nnot able to offer these amendments.\n  There is also some implied suggestion here that those who do not \nsupport this grand compromise are not sensitive to the issue of \nimmigration, are not willing to look and understand that there is a \nreal, serious problem here which needs to be addressed. Nothing could \nbe further from the truth. In fact, while I have substantial difficulty \nwith the plan that is brought to the floor of the Senate--I think it is \na flawed plan--I happen to think immigration is a very serious problem \nin this country.\n  The first and obvious answer to our immigration problem is to try to \nprovide some real border security. We have about 12 million--perhaps \nmore--people who have come into this country without legal \nauthorization. Why? Most of them wanted to come to the United States of \nAmerica to work. Most of them wanted to come here because they believe \nthere is hope and opportunity here. They want a job here.\n  It would be wonderful if our country, having over a century lifted \nthe middle class up with good wages and good jobs and benefits--it \nwould be wonderful if we could say: We have created on this planet \nsomething very special here called the United States, and we would like \nto share it with everyone right now. We, of course, cannot do that. We \nwould be overrun. We have immigration quotas. We allow 1.5 million \npeople in our country every year legally. There is a legal process by \nwhich we do that.\n  But we are on a planet here that circles the Sun, and we have 6.4 \nbillion neighbors. One-half of them live on less than $2 a day, one-\nhalf of them have never made a telephone call, and one-half of them do \nnot have access on a regular basis to clean, potable water. It is a \nchallenging planet. We have a lot of neighbors who live in great \ndifficulty.\n  In this little spot on this planet which is labeled ``the United \nStates of America,'' we have created something pretty special. I have \ndescribed it at great length, how we did it and why we did it over the \nlast century, lifting America up, providing good jobs that pay well. It \nis not surprising to me that on a little planet on which we all travel, \nwhere, if you are in India, the average hourly wage is 11 cents an \nhour--in China, it is 33 cents an hour; if you live in Honduras, the \naverage hourly wage is 33 cents an hour; it is not surprising to me \nthat people who are living in poverty in other countries, making a \npittance for a long day's work, would like to come to the United States \nand find a job and improve their life and make a better life for them \nand their family. That is not surprising to me.\n\n  I would like it if we could say to them: You know what. Come on, join \nus. Just think for a moment if we decided we have a new immigration law \nin this country, that new immigration says: You know what, this country \nis wide open. You want to come join us from anywhere, anytime, \nanyplace? Come on. Come and live with us. Come and work with us. Come \nand be part of our country right now. No restrictions. Come and stay. \nCome and work.\n  We would be overrun. Millions and millions and millions of people \nwould try to find their way to this wonderful country of ours because \nwe have created an economy that lifted the standard and broadened the \nmiddle class.\n  We cannot do that. We instead have a process of legal immigration \nthat allows about a million and a half people a year to come into this \ncountry. They apply. They are part of the quota from their country. \nThey wait. They wait a year, they wait 5 years, they wait 10 years. If \nthey are lucky, they reach the top of that list and they are able to \ncome to this country through this legal system of immigration quotas.\n  Now, my colleagues have brought to the floor the ``grand \ncompromise.'' And what they have said is this: Well, we do not have \nmuch border security. We have got a lot of people coming into this \ncountry illegally now, without legal authorization. So I will tell you \nwhat. They say: We will pass a piece of legislation that says anyone \nwho came to this country by at least December 31 of last year--that \nincludes, we think, 12 million--anyone who came here by December 31 of \nlast year, you are going to be legal. We are going to decide that you \nare here legally and you get a work permit. You are no longer illegal; \nyou are legal.\n  Now, we have people overseas in their home country who thought this \nwas all\n\n[[Page S7306]]\n\non the level. They applied to come to the country as part of the quota. \nThey have waited 6, 7, 8 years. They discover they made a mistake. They \nshould have come here last December 20 or December 31 and snuck across \nthe border someplace because then they would be described by this bill, \nby the folks who created this grand compromise, then they would be \ndescribed as legal citizens, not citizens as having legal status, I \nshould say. Well, is that fair? No. No, it is not fair. Is it right? \nNo.\n  But more than the issue of dealing with those 12 million, this \nlegislation also says we should have more people who do not live in \nthis country come into this country to assume jobs with something \ncalled temporary workers or guest workers. Now, I happen to be \nsensitive to this issue of those who have come here without legal \nauthorization. Some have come here decades ago. There are people, I am \nsure, who have been here 20 years without legal authorization to be \nhere.\n  They have probably raised a family. They have worked. They have been \nmodel citizens. They have been neighbors. They have been good people. \nShould we round them all up at this point and deport them? Of course \nnot. But should we, on the other hand, decide: If you snuck across the \nborder on December 31, good for you. You are now declared legal? I \ndon't think so.\n  My colleague, Senator Webb, has an amendment that I think would move \na long way toward addressing some of these issues in terms of the time \nthat you have been here to try to be sensitive about those things which \nI support. But this legislation says: If you showed up last December \n31, you are given legal status.\n  But the issue I raised last evening, and the amendment that I offered \nthat prevailed by one vote was on the guest worker provision, temporary \nworker provision. My colleagues have said, the Senator from Arizona and \nthe Senator from Massachusetts have said, you know, we need to have a \ntemporary worker provision because if we don't have a temporary worker \nprovision to bring in people who are not now here to assume jobs in \nthis country, they are going to come anyway. They are coming across \nanyway.\n  They will come in as illegal immigrants. Well, I said: I don't \nunderstand that. You say that this bill would strengthen our border, \nprovide border security, and stop illegal immigration. Now you are \nsaying that in order to stop illegal immigration you have to have a \nguest worker provision because, if we do not have a guest worker \nprovision, they are going to come anyway. Maybe you are misrepresenting \nthis issue of border security, are you not?\n  So the Congressional Budget Office comes out with a report. Guess \nwhat they said. This bill, the grand compromise, means those who come \nacross the border illegally, 75 percent will keep coming under this \nbill; 75 percent will keep coming under this bill. Yet the proponents \nof the bill are out here with big banners and trumpeting that this is a \nbig border security bill. It is not. It is not that.\n  I have raised the question about American workers because there is no \ndiscussion of American workers. You know they have a role in this \ndebate. We are told, in fact, my colleague from New Hampshire said \nthere are not enough workers in this country, so we need to bring in \nworkers. There are not enough workers to assume the jobs that are \navailable.\n  Well, that is a line that I understand. I don't agree with it, I \nunderstand it. I understand where it is coming from. We have got a lot \nof businesses in this country that have decided that workers are like \nwrenches. They are like wrenches. You just use them up and throw them \naway. Don't worry too much about them. Make sure you hire them for as \nlittle as possible. By the way, keep downward pressure on that income \nbecause workers are disposable.\n  If you wonder about that, by the way, just go back and read the paper \nfrom a few weeks ago when a company called Circuit City decided they \nwere going to layoff 3,400 of their workers. Why? Were they bad \nworkers? No. It was not that at all.\n  This is a company with a chief executive officer who made $10 million \na year, and his workers made an average of, I believe, $11 an hour. \nThey wanted to have a workforce that was paid lower than that. So they \nsaid to 3,400 of them: We are going to get rid of you because we want \nto rehire people at a lower rate.\n  So if you wonder about this wrench analogy, just check the newspaper \none of these days. But we have a lot of people in this country who work \nat the bottom of the economic scale, bottom of the ladder.\n\n  I told a story yesterday about a company from Georgia. The story was \nfrom the Wall Street Journal. This was a poultry company. I believe \nthey had roughly 700 workers. Three-fourths of them were illegal \nimmigrants working in that company. They were paying them a pittance. I \ndon't remember the exact wage, but they were paying them a small amount \nof money. Then they were raided by the immigration folks. It was \ndiscovered they had all of those illegal immigrant workers, so they had \nto get rid of them.\n  So then they had to hire other workers. Well, guess what. They went \nto the newspaper and put a help wanted ad in the newspaper. They said: \nWe are now paying higher wages. Immediately they got a lot of \napplicants because they were paying better wages. So they filled those \njobs.\n  A few years later they began, that same company, to contract with one \nof those temporary worker groups that was able to bring together \nillegal workers and package them and sell them to companies. They \nstarted doing the same thing one more time. Why? So they could push \ndown wages.\n  Now, my point today and yesterday was, I think this is an interesting \ndiscussion about a serious problem, immigration. But I think there is a \nparty that is not at the table, and that is the American workers. \nNobody wants to talk about that. We are talking about 12 million \npeople. What about 140 million people? What about the people, \nespecially that part of our workforce who, this morning, got up with \ngreat hope, got dressed, went to work, worked hard, got paid the \nminimum wage, and then finished after 8 hours of back-breaking work and \nwent to the second job and did another 6 or 8 hours at the minimum \nwage, and then went home exhausted because they are trying to make do \nwith two jobs at the minimum wage for their family.\n  Increasingly, by the way, those workers are women. What about those \nworkers? Do they matter? Does it matter when you bring in people \nthrough the back door who are willing to work for lower wages, that you \nthen begin pressing down and pushing down wages in this country? Does \nthat matter?\n  I have spoken at great length on this floor about the larger economic \ninterests who want to export American jobs to China, Sri Lanka, \nBangladesh, and Singapore and various parts of the world in order to \nsearch for lower wages.\n  I have spoken at length on the specific companies who left our \ncountry, why they left, where the jobs are. I have spoken at great \nlength about Huffy bikes. Huffy bikes fired their workers, moved their \nproduction to China. I know where they make Huffy bikes. Yes, I know \nwhere they make them now. They don't make them in Ohio. They used to. \nAll of those folks got fired. They make them in Shenzhen, China. They \nare made by people who make 30 cents an hour. They work 12 to 14 hours \na day 7 days a week.\n  Why do I say that? Because exactly the same economic interests that \nare searching the globe for low wages, to move jobs to where they can \nfind the lowest wage, are some of the same economic interests that want \nto bring cheap labor through the back door for the jobs that are left \nto put downward pressure on American wages.\n  Now, the American worker has been more productive. Productivity has \nincreased substantially in the recent period. Yet their wages have not \nkept pace. The reason is obvious. There are all kinds of ways to put \ndownward pressure on the wages of American workers.\n  Alan Blinder is no radical economist. He is a mainstream economist. \nHe used to be Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. They all wear \ngray suits all the time. Alan Blinder is a guy who I am sure supports \nfree trade--supports what is called free trade. That is kind of the \nmantra these days. But he wrote a piece in Foreign Affairs. Here is \nwhat he said, the former Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. He \nsaid\n\n[[Page S7307]]\n\nthat there are over forty million American jobs that are tradeable, \nwhich means subject to being moved offshore in search of lower wages. \nHe said not all of them will go. They won't. But even those that remain \nhere are going to have downward pressure on their wages because they \nare competing with others in other parts of the world who are willing \nto work for less.\n  My point is simple. This immigration issue and guest worker issue is \nthe reverse side of the same coin; the outmigration of American jobs \nand the inmigration of cheap labor. This is about money. It is about \nprofits for big economic interests. It is sold as something else on the \nfloor of the Senate. We are hearing about compassion. Boy, I don't lack \ncompassion for anybody who is mistreated in the workplace. I know they \nare.\n  But for a moment, instead of just talking about the immigrant worker \nwho came here without legal authorization, let me talk about the worker \nwho is here. Let me talk about a woman who lives in a used trailer \nhouse with no running water, with an outdoor toilet, trying to raise \nfour kids and walking to work for the minimum wage.\n  Do you know how they heat that trailer house? A wood stove with a \npipe sticking out the window of the living room of a used trailer \nhouse. A wood stove, mind you.\n  You want to talk about deplorable conditions. There are plenty of \nthem in this country for people at the bottom of the ladder struggling, \njust trying to get ahead, trying to get a better way, to be lifted up \nproviding for their family. There is no discussion of that at all. This \nentire discussion is about another group, a group of immigrations who \nhave came here without legal authorization.\n  Let me tell you, my ancestry came here from somewhere else. I am a \nproduct of immigrant ancestors. We all have these stories. I am very \nsensitive to them. I want people to be able to do well and to \nparticipate in this American dream of ours.\n  Let me describe one side of my ancestry who was a woman named \nCaroline who came from Norway. She came with her husband to the new \ncountry. She ended up homesteading 160 acres of land. What happened was \nthey landed in Minneapolis-St. Paul as immigrants, and her husband died \nof a heart attack.\n  This Norwegian woman got on a train with six children, they went out \nto the prairies of North Dakota with six children, pitched a tent and \nhomesteaded 160 acres and raised a family and ran a farm.\n  One can only think what must be in the inner strength of someone to \ndo that alone in a new country. All of us have those stories. They are \nwonderful stories about immigrants. This is not pro- or anti-immigrant. \nThis country is refreshed as a result of immigration. It has always \nbeen. That is why we have a process of legal immigration. A million and \na half people come here every year, plus more for agricultural work. \nThat is what this process is about.\n  The dilemma is this: When I described this spot on the planet called \nthe United States, this spot on the planet is different. It is \ndifferent because we created something very different. Starting about \n100 years ago, we began to lift up this country, expand the middle \nclass, provide worth to the workers of this country, understanding they \nwere part of the productive capability that could lift this country's \neconomy and provide opportunity for more Americans.\n  We did that in a remarkable way, and it was not easy. I have spoken \non the floor about James Fyler. James Fyler, I said, died of lead \npoisoning. Well, actually, you know, he was shot 54 times. That is \nprobably lead poisoning. It is also being killed by 54 bullets.\n  You know why James Fyler was killed almost a century ago? He believed \npeople who went underground in this country to mine for coal--hard \nwork, dangerous work--he believed people who did that work--underground \nmining for coal--ought to be paid a decent wage, ought to be working in \na safe coal mine. For that he gave his life, was shot 54 times.\n  Well, from James Fyler on forward, decade after decade after decade \nwe made progress, demanded progress, safe workplaces, child labor laws, \nfair wages. We demanded progress--the right of workers to organize.\n  We lifted this country up because we expanded the middle class. More \nand more Americans had opportunity. From that opportunity came \nprosperity. That is a subject that has largely been ignored in the \nSenate in the last couple of weeks.\n  What is the impact of all of this? I asked the question yesterday \nabout the American worker: Where is the American worker in this \ndiscussion? What is their interest? Who represents their interest? The \nanswer is, the American worker is not a part of this discussion at all. \nThe American worker is left behind. I described them the other day as \nthose workers who understand seconds. They understand second mortgage, \nsecond shift, second job. They understand second place, all of them, \nstruggling to make ends meet. Yet they are not a part of this \ndiscussion. But this discussion does impact this country in many ways, \nabout working standards, standards of employment, wages, opportunities \nto continue to expand the middle class.\n  I think there are claims on the floor of the Senate that if you don't \nsupport this grand compromise, you just don't understand it, because it \nis a wonderful piece of work. It provides border security. It provides \nemployment sanctions. It provides temporary workers to fill jobs for \nwhich there are no Americans available, we are told. Let's look at \nthat.\n  Border security doesn't need new legislation. In 1986, the last \nreform bill passed on immigration said: We will have border security. \nThey stood up and said: This is going to provide for border security. \nWe are going to stop illegal immigration. The problem is, the mask is \noff the myth here as of yesterday, when the Congressional Budget Office \nsays the bill they brought to the floor of the Senate is a bill that \nwill allow 75 percent of the illegal immigration that now occurs to \ncontinue. What kind of security is that? Apparently not much.\n  How about employer sanctions? We have already done that as well. That \nis already the law. We don't need a new law for that. We have employer \nsanctions. In 2004, the Bush administration took action against four \ncompanies in the entire United States for hiring illegal workers. What \ndoes that tell you? That tells you they said: We surrender. We have no \nintention of administering this law. We have no intention of enforcing \nthe law. We surrender.\n  We don't need a new law to do that. All we need is some determination \nthat we are going to enforce employer sanctions.\n  With respect to temporary workers, that is the biggest ruse of all. \nThe temporary worker provision in this legislation is simply a request \nfor big business from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce saying: We will \nsupport this bill if you give us the opportunity to bring some cheap \nlabor through the backdoor. That is what this is about. Don't take it \nfrom me. Go to some of the newspaper columns that describe this grand \nbargain and why the big economic interests have said: We will support \nthis if you allow us to bring in some immigrant labor legally under the \nposition of temporary workers. Apparently those who are part of the \ngrand compromise said: We will do that. That is a fair thing.\n  How do they do it? In the worst possible way. Even if you were \ninclined to do it, you wouldn't do it this way. I am not inclined to \nbelieve we ought to do it. Most of the folks who are trumpeting this \nproposal are people who would talk about supply and demand. Let the \nmarketplace govern. The marketplace; right? I used to teach a little \neconomics. I know about the supply/demand curve. Except the marketplace \ndoesn't work very well, does it, when in fact if you can't find a \nworker for a job, you might have to advertise that job at a little \nextra price, a little higher wage. People who are carrying the bedpans \nin the hospitals on the midnight shift, people making the beds in the \nmotel early the next morning, people across the counter at the \nconvenience store, maybe if you can't get them for the minimum wage, \nmaybe you will have to pay an extra 50 cents an hour. That is the \nsupply-and-demand relationship. But if you can bring someone else in \nwho says, I am sorry, I will take that job, you don't have to pay \nanybody more, I will take that job for the very minimum, you can keep \ndownward pressure on wages. And that is\n\n[[Page S7308]]\n\nthe strategy here. That is what this is about. Apparently supply/demand \nis a good theory, but it doesn't work in a circumstance where the big \neconomic interests want you to keep putting downward pressure on wages.\n  So you say: OK, let's bring in some temporary workers. Here is the \nway they did it. Follow this for a moment. They wanted 400,000 a year. \nSenator Bingaman reduced that to 200,000 a year. Here is the way it \nwould work. You can bring in 200,000 the first year. They can stay for \n2 years. They can bring their family, if they choose. Then they have to \ngo home for a year and their family has to go with them. They can come \nback for a third year, stay for a fourth. They have to go home for a \nfifth. If they never brought their family at all, they can come back \nfor a sixth and then a seventh year. And each year below that you can \nget another group of 200,000 coming. If you didn't understand that, you \nare not alone. No one understands that. That defies any kind of logic \nat all. Yet that is exactly what was stuck in this legislation.\n  I offered an amendment last evening that passed by a vote of 49 to \n48. There are people here having an apoplectic seizure about that. They \nhave spent most of their day gnashing their teeth and wiping their \nbrow, trying to figure out how to deal with it. It was simple enough, \nit was a sunset after 5 years of the temporary worker program. We say \nafter 5 years, let's take a look. It is a new a program, a new \napproach. Let's take a look and see what the impact is. What if we find \nout it has a tremendous depressing impact on wages, which it very \nlikely will? What if we find out that 75 percent of those who were \nbrought in under the temporary worker program refuse to go home and \nhave stayed here illegally? Would you maybe want to make some \nadjustments? Why not sunset it in 5 years so you are required to \nevaluate that it doesn't work?\n  We are told: If you do that, you will be killing this legislation. \nThis is a poison pill. We have locked arms on this grand compromise. \nYou are going to kill this bill.\n  As I said yesterday, it is like the cheap sweater. Pull a thread, the \narm falls off. God forbid, it is going to destroy everything we have \ndone.\n  It is unbelievable. It is as if nobody else has an idea around here \nexcept those who were in a room someplace in the Capitol called the \ngrand bargainers.\n  I have been here long enough to see many of these grand bargains. \nSometimes there are two of them. Usually not two, because that wouldn't \nbe called grand. But maybe six, sometimes 10, sometimes they call them \na gang. It is a gang of 12 or a gang of whatever. Every time it \nhappens, what you find as a result is terrible legislation. I guarantee \nyou, you get a gang or a group or a gaggle or whatever it is who go \ninto a room someplace and close the door and start developing this \nsense of self-importance pumped up by a little more helium or hydrogen, \nand all of a sudden, they get out here and they say: Here is the \nanswer. And you may not change it. Because if you do, you destroy this \ncarefully balanced work of ours.\n  So here we are--it is 7 o'clock at night--having to work 2 weeks on a \npiece of legislation that, A, won't secure our borders, unfortunately. \nI wish it would. I think we should. In fact, that is what we should be \ndoing. What we ought to do is have a bill that deals with border \nsecurity. Once we have done that, we come back, after we have border \nsecurity, and say: Now the next step, which is as important but you do \nit next, is to provide for the status of those who are here without \nlegal authorization. We should do that. I wouldn't do it by saying the \npeople who came across December 31 of last year are given legal status \nand a work card. That is not how I would do it, but I would be \nsensitive to a lot of people who have contributed to this country for a \nlong time, even without legal authorization to come here. But that is \nnot the way this works. It is not what was brought to the floor of the \nSenate.\n\n  So now we will have a second cloture vote tonight. I don't know how \nthat will work. Whatever the Senate will decide tonight on a second \ncloture vote, if cloture is invoked, then we have 30 hours postcloture. \nWe will see. There are a good many amendments that have been prevented \nfrom being offered. I mentioned Senator Webb has one. Senator Webb has \na very important amendment. He has been prevented from offering that \namendment. I know Senator Tester has one. If we are in a postcloture \nperiod, my hope is we will relent and decide there are ideas in the \nSenate that exist at every desk, not just a couple of desks. If we \nbelieve that, maybe we will get the best of what each has to offer \nrather than the worst of what most have to offer.\n  I wanted to make a couple comments because I heard a substantial \namount of discussion that we don't have enough Americans for the jobs \nhere, so we need to bring people in, all these interesting, in some \ncases very convoluted, approaches to supporting legislation that is not \njust imperfect but falls far short of that which is necessary to \naddress a very serious problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders) The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                                 Darfur\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am going to take this \nopportunity, while we are waiting for the next proceeding that will \ncome somewhere around 7:30 on this immigration bill, to report to the \nSenate, having just returned from the recess from Africa, on the very \nserious situation in two respects that this Senator from Florida has \ntried to get his arms around. The first is, of course, the crisis in \nDarfur.\n  Since the Government of Sudan would not give this Senator a visa to \ngo into Sudan to go into Darfur, there is another way to do it, and \nthat is to go to the backdoor by going into the neighboring country of \nChad which I did. And the Sudanese Government would not even give us \noverflight rights leaving from Addis Ababa going to N'djamena, the \ncapital of Chad, and having to fly completely around the country of \nSudan to get to the capital of Chad which is located to the west of the \nSudan, then from the capital city of Sudan, then to take a series of \nflights to get close to the eastern border where all of the Sudanese \nrefugees are, the Sudanese refugees who have fled the slaughter allowed \nby the Sudanese Government, the slaughter of innocent people often \nperpetrated by a terrorist group called the jingaweit that have been \ninstruments aided and abetted by the Sudanese Government, even to the \npoint of the Sudanese Government sending in Sudanese aircraft, \ngovernment aircraft that they sometimes paint white so as to mask as if \nit is a humanitarian airplane such as the United Nations, aircraft that \nbombed them, helicopters that are painted the same way that come in and \nstrafe them.\n  This has only been going on for 4 years. Look what the world \ncommunity has done to be so slow in response to this humanitarian \ncrisis, this genocide, this slaughter. I visited one of those refugee \ncamps. This particular one had about 16,000 people.\n  Indeed, part of their life is better off because they do not have \nviolence unless, by the way, the women go outside to collect firewood, \nwhich, interestingly, is the woman's job. As a result, the food aid \nrelief workers there do not let the women go outside the camp to get \nbeat up and the young ones to get raped. They are providing them \nfirewood. And oh, by the way, they are providing them a stove for the \nfirewood that saves 80 percent of the firewood and produces the same \namount of heat. So that is progress.\n  It is progress in the rudimentary health care they have. That is \nhealth care they did not get back in the Sudan, in Darfur. It is \nprogress those children whom I talked to in the school--the very \nrudimentary school with extraordinary teachers--do not get back in \nSudan.\n  But what they have is a very Spartan existence. One of the mothers we \nwere talking to said she wanted to go back. I said: Why? She said: I \nwant my native food. I want meat. I want vegetables. Of course, what \nthey are being provided--that the World Food Program is providing so \nthey would not starve--is a basic diet of porridge and grains, and that \nis it--and an attempt to giving them some potable water, which is a \nhuge problem all over Africa.\n  Well, that is one problem I tried to get my arms around because it is \nimportant those of us who care about\n\n[[Page S7309]]\n\nthese things get as educated as we can so we can speak out on them.\n  But there is another problem--and this was an intelligence mission \nfor me; I am a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee--and that is \nthe rise of al-Qaida in Africa. Various terrorist organizations have \nmorphed into an organization called al-Qaida's Committee in the \nIslamic--and I do not know the African word, but it starts with an \n``M.'' AQIM is the acronym. This is on the rise. That is of \nconsiderable concern to the free world, to the industrialized world, \nand especially to the United States.\n  After Chad, I went to Nigeria. Now, the Niger River Delta in the \ncountry of Nigeria produces about 3 million barrels of oil a day. Mr. \nPresident, 600,000 of that production is siphoned off or destroyed. \nOften it is siphoned off simply through graft and corruption and all \nkinds of banditry that is going on.\n  Simultaneously, while we were there, over the course of 2 days in \nNigeria, a group of 11 people--I think they were Russians--were \nkidnapped. No, it was some other nationality. It was women and \nchildren. That was the first group kidnapped. We do not know the \nresult. Another group of about six Russians was kidnapped. By the time \nI left the country, a third group of another nationality--all there \nbecause of being oil workers--was kidnapped. That is the kind of \nlawlessness that is going on there.\n  But what is even a greater threat--and it would be nice if the \ncountry of Nigeria did not allow that 600,000 barrels, so they are \nonly, net, producing 2.4 million barrels a day, but there is a greater \nproblem. There is virtually no protection for the production of that \noil, whether it be in the Niger Delta itself or it be offshore in the \nwaters off the West Coast of Africa. There are huge reserves for future \nproduction virtually unprotected. It is an accident waiting to happen.\n  And oh, by the way, the United States gets between 12 and 14 percent \nof its daily consumption of oil from Nigeria. So what do you think is \nthe target? That is the bad news.\n  Let me tell you the good news. The good news is that despite the \ngraft and corruption among governments throughout, despite the optimism \nof new governmental leaders in various countries, including the new \nPresident of Nigeria--who had been in office 5 days when I met with \nhim--despite the inability of their infrastructure to produce what they \nneed, let me tell you, they understand that the one partner they can \nrely on is the United States.\n  How? Their intelligence services work with us. For that, I am \nprofoundly grateful and not only in those countries, those four--and \nthe fourth I visited was Algeria; I met the President of Algeria and \nshared the same thing with him--but in other countries throughout the \nregion we have a good cooperation in sharing intelligence.\n  Ultimately, it is that intelligence that is going to prevent that \nattempt by a terrorist group, such as AQIM, from destroying \nactivities--such as oil production--that are so important to the United \nStates.\n  Now, it is another subject for another day, that of energy \nindependence and start weaning ourselves from that dependence on \nforeign oil. From just Nigeria--there is an example--12 to 14 percent \nof our daily consumption of oil comes from that country. That is at \nthreat.\n  Another 12 to 14 percent of our daily consumption comes from \nVenezuela. By the way, have you heard of a fellow named Hugo Chavez, \nwho keeps pounding his fist and says he is threatening to cut off the \noil to the United States?\n  It is another whole discussion for another day that one of the most \nimportant agenda items of this country is weaning ourselves from that \nforeign oil by going to alternative sources. But it is what it is.\n  That is why I was in Africa last week. To encourage that cooperation \nwith our intelligence services, to protect our mutual interests, to \nencourage the reform of those governments so they can provide some \nprotection for themselves and modernize their political systems and \ntheir economies to be of a greater benefit to their people who have so \noften been put down and to realize that their future, with a richness \nof natural resources, is going to become increasingly important to the \nwhole world.\n  So it is with mixed feelings that I give this report to the Senate. I \nwill continue to give a series of reports next week on various \nterrorist activities and how they affect our interest in that part of \nthe world. But I wanted to give this first installment while we are at \nthis late hour of the day awaiting some of the first test votes we are \ngoing to have now on this immigration bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Georgia be allowed to speak for up to 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss two amendments \nI have filed to the pending immigration legislation.\n  I was at home over the Memorial Day recess and had an opportunity to \ntalk about the pending bill with a number of constituents. For many of \nthe folks I spoke with, their top concern was border security. There \nwas a deep feeling of skepticism about the ability of the U.S. \nGovernment to deliver effective control of our borders. Their concerns \ncertainly have merit, and that is why it is so important that we prove \nwe are serious about border security by securing our borders before any \nproposed immigration reforms are put into place.\n  The issue before us is critical to the future of our country in terms \nof national security, economic prosperity, and the fabric of our \nNation. I hope we will proceed with a thoughtful and thorough debate in \nthe Senate, because the proposals we are going to be asked to consider \nare enormous in scope and have far-reaching implications.\n  I have filed some amendments, and I know a number of my colleagues \nhave filed amendments, to try to improve this legislation. It is my \nhope we will have an opportunity to continue to work through this \nprocess in a manner that recognizes the importance of this issue, \nrather than adhering to an arbitrary timeline for completion. We must \nensure that not only the Senators, but also the American people, have \nample opportunity to fully comprehend the consequences of any action we \ntake.\n  America needs secure borders. Right now, we do not have them. As a \nnation of immigrants which honors the rule of law, we must secure our \nborders to make America safe so we can fix our country's immigration \nsystem. A nation that cannot secure its borders cannot secure its \ndestiny or administer its laws.\n  The current proposal contains the first border security trigger \nenvisioned by my fellow Senator from Georgia, Johnny Isakson. It says \nno temporary worker program or transition to Z visa status for those \ncurrently illegally in the country can begin until the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security certifies to the President and to the \nCongress that the specific key border security measures are funded, in \nplace, and operational. These triggers include constructing 370 miles \nof fencing that was previously authorized, 200 miles of vehicle \nbarriers at the border, and finishing the goal of doubling the size of \nthe Border Patrol since this President took office.\n  The trigger also includes a provision that detention facilities must \nhave a total capacity of 27,500 beds to end the practice of catch and \nrelease on our southern border. It is absolutely vital that the Senate \nact to put the resources and mechanisms in place to allow the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to gain operational control of our \nborders and to have stronger and more meaningful enforcement of our \nimmigration laws in the interior of the United States.\n  With enhanced enforcement, we have already seen a positive change at \nthe border. The number of people apprehended for illegally crossing our \nsouthern border is down by nearly 27 percent\n\n[[Page S7310]]\n\nin 2007 from this point in time in 2006. You might say, the numbers of \napprehensions are down; that does not sound as though the agents are \ndoing a very good job, and more people are getting in. The fact is the \nnumbers are down because our Border Patrol agents are doing an \noutstanding job and because illegal entrants are deterred from even \ntrying to cross as news of our increased security has made its way \nsouth. So starting with border security and ensuring we get our borders \nsecure through certain mechanisms is my top priority, and this bill \ndoes that.\n  While I have been supportive of getting us to this point and \nsupportive of the framework of this approach, there are certain issues \nI believe can be improved upon. Some of my colleagues have amendments \nto do that, and I wish to discuss briefly a couple of amendments I have \nfiled.\n  My first amendment, No. 1318, deals with protecting the Social \nSecurity trust fund for the future retirees of this Nation. I ask \nunanimous consent that Senators Inhofe, Isakson, Enzi, and Murkowski be \nmade cosponsors of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. In 2004, the Commissioner of Social Security signed a \ntotalization agreement with the Director General of the Mexican Social \nSecurity Institute. While the President has not yet submitted the \nUnited States-Mexico totalization agreement to Congress, I am concerned \nthe agreement could threaten the retirement benefits of Americans. \nTotalization agreements allow workers who divide their careers between \ntwo countries to combine work credits from both countries to qualify \nfor Social Security benefits. It also prevents workers from paying \nSocial Security taxes in both countries. While this seems like a good \nidea that ensures fairness, the proposed totalization agreement with \nMexico leaves many questions unanswered in terms of its cost to \nAmerican taxpayers. I am concerned the proposed totalization agreement \nwith Mexico and possible future totalization agreements will impose \nsignificant costs on the already overburdened U.S. Social Security \nsystem.\n  The problem is current law doesn't require Congress to affirmatively \nreview a totalization agreement and determine if it is in the best \ninterests of American taxpayers. Under current law, a totalization \nagreement automatically goes into effect unless either the House of \nRepresentatives or the Senate adopts a resolution of disapproval within \n60 legislative days of the President submitting it to Congress. If no \naction occurs during this timeframe, Congress is deemed to support the \ntotalization agreement and it automatically goes into effect.\n  My first amendment will change this current practice so that Congress \nhas its proper constitutional role in determining whether totalization \nagreements are in the best interests of our country by ensuring that \ntotalization agreements only go into effect after explicit approval \nfrom both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The amendment \nwill also require the Social Security Administration to provide regular \nreports to Congress that examine both the projected costs and the \nactual costs of all totalization agreements. In short, this amendment \nwill ensure that proper debate and analysis take place prior to the \napproval of an agreement that can impact our Social Security trust \nfund.\n  The second amendment I wish to address tonight is No. 1319. This \namendment deals with the fine structure for Z-A workers, which is a \npart of the agriculture piece of this legislation. I worked very \nclosely with my colleagues, Senator Craig and Senator Feinstein, to \nmake some changes to the agriculture portion of this bill which was \ninitially drafted, but one area that was left unresolved in our \ndiscussion was the amount of fines agricultural workers would be \nrequired to pay under the Z-A visa program. Under the substitute bill \nwe are debating, an agricultural worker's fine to obtain a Z-A visa is \n$100, as compared to the $1,000 that regular Z applicants must pay. \nThen, for those Z-A workers who wish to depart the country and make \napplication for a green card, the fine in the underlying substitute is \n$400 as compared to the $4,000 for regular Z visa holders.\n  This amendment is very simple. This brings into parity the fine \nstructures for Z visa workers and Z-A visa workers. However, the \namendment also recognizes that annual earnings from agricultural \nemployment are generally lower than in other sectors of the economy due \nto the often seasonal nature of agricultural work.\n  The amendment requires agricultural workers to pay a $1,000 fine at \nthe time they make application for a Z-A visa, just as workers in other \nsectors of the economy must pay a $1,000 fine when they make \napplication for a Z visa. Further, the amendment requires Z-A visa \nworkers to pay a $4,000 fine at the time they make application for a \ngreen card, just as Z visa workers must pay a $4,000 fine. However, Z-A \nworkers would be allowed to discount $1,000 from the $4,000 fine for \neach year they worked in agriculture under the terms of the bill, with \na maximum deduction of $3,000. So the total fine amount a \nZ-A worker will be mandated to pay is $2,000, as compared to the $5,000 \nthe Z visa workers are mandated to pay, provided those workers stay in \nthe field of agriculture, which is one of the ideas behind the base \nbill, as well as this provision. I think this fine structure is much \nmore equitable than the current total of $500 that Z-A workers are \nexpected to pay.\n  It also recognizes some of the unique aspects of agricultural work. \nRegardless of the sector of the economy in which the Z visa applicants \nwork, we need to ensure that the fines, which are penalties, are \nmeaningful and difficult to achieve.\n  These are two commonsense, straightforward amendments. I hope the \nSenate will have an opportunity to consider them soon.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Change of Vote\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, on rollcall vote No. 194, I was present \nand voted no. The official record has me listed as absent; therefore, I \nask unanimous consent that the official record be corrected to \naccurately reflect my vote. This will in no way change the outcome of \nthe vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I oppose the amnesty provisions included in \nthis bill.\n  Nevertheless, I voted against the Coburn amendment, because it would \nhave codified expedited procedures in the Senate for considering the \nPresidential certifications required by the amendment. Exempting \nlegislation from debate and amendment in the Senate is a dangerous \npractice, and contrary to the constitutional purpose of this unique \ninstitution. One need only look to the legislative line-item veto or \nbudget reconciliation process to understand how such procedures could \nbe abused.\n  Had those expedited procedures not been included in the Coburn \namendment, I would have supported it.\n  Mr. President, I oppose amnesty for illegal aliens. Waiving our \nimmigration laws, instead of enforcing them, is amnesty--no matter what \nthe level of fines and penalties assessed. It encourages others to \nflout our laws knowing that they could be similarly rewarded.\n  Amnesties undermine the great American principle that the law should \napply equally and fairly to everyone. This bill would create a separate \nset of rules--one for those who obey the law and one for those who do \nnot. It is a special set of laws for those who chose not to follow the \nregular process that everybody else had to go through. It is a \ncongressional pardon for lawbreakers--both for illegal aliens and the \nunscrupulous employers who exploit them.\n  Many employers are anxious to take advantage of the cheap labor that \nthis bill would provide, but the responsibility would fall on the \nNation as a whole to make the public investments necessary to absorb \nthese workers into the economy. It is a false promise, to immigrants \nand U.S. citizens alike, when the infrastructure of our Nation--our \nschools, our health care system, our transportation and energy\n\n[[Page S7311]]\n\nnetworks--are increasingly unable to absorb this untenable surge in the \npopulation.\n  I speak from experience when I say that this amnesty will not work. \nPresident Reagan signed his amnesty proposal into law in 1986. At the \ntime, I supported amnesty based on the very same promises we hear \ntoday--that legalizing undocumented workers and increasing enforcement \nwould stem the flow of illegal immigration. The 1986 amnesty did not \nwork. After 1986, illegal immigrant population more than quadrupled \nfrom 2.7 million aliens, to an estimated 12 million illegal aliens \ntoday. In that time, the Congress continued to enact amnesty after \namnesty, waiving the Immigration Act for lawbreakers.\n  I will not vote to make the same mistake twice.\n  Our immigration system is already plagued with funding and staffing \nproblems. It is overwhelmed on the borders, and in its processing of \nimmigration applications. It only took nineteen temporary visa holders \nto slip through the system to unleash the horror of September 11. The \npending proposal would shove tens of millions of legal and illegal \naliens--many of whom have never gone through a background check--\nthrough our border security system over the next decade, in effect \nswamping a bureaucracy that is already struggling to keep its head \nabove water. Terrorists and criminal aliens have exploited these kinds \nof amnesties before, and they will do so again.\n  The United States cannot guarantee the security of its borders, and \nsimultaneously waive the law for those who circumvent that security. \nThe Congress must choose between law enforcement and amnesty. I choose \nlaw enforcement. The Congress must choose between border security and \namnesty. I choose border security.\n  I will oppose this measure, in the hope that the amnesty provisions \nare removed, and that the Senate quickly passes a clean border security \nbill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, late last night we voted on amendment \nNo. 1151 offered by the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Inhofe. The \ndisposition of this amendment can be seen in the Record under rollcall \nvote No. 198. I was allowed to speak for 1 minute prior to this \nrollcall vote; however, I wish to extend my remarks in order to fully \nexplain my stance on this important issue.\n  Let me begin by stating emphatically that I fully support English as \nthe official language of the United States. However, I cannot vote in \nfavor of an amendment that would eliminate rights that currently are \nreserved for my constituents under the New Mexico Constitution. We must \nbe cautious before we act and it is the devil in the details of the \namendment that was placed before the Senate, which would chill and \ninfringe on the constitutional rights of our diverse citizenship and \nwould stand in direct contradiction to the constitution of my home \nState of New Mexico that makes this amendment overreaching.\n  Most people do not know that Congress delayed New Mexico's admission \nto statehood until speakers of English became the majority of the \nState. To underline the point, the New Mexico Enabling Act required \nthat the public schools be conducted in English and that ``ability to \nread, write, speak and understand English without an interpreter . . . \nbe a necessary qualification for all state officers and members of the \nstate legislature.'' However, in 1911 the U.S. Supreme Court found that \nCongress could not place such conditions on newly admitted States and \nremoved the English language restriction from the New Mexico Enabling \nAct.\n  Thereafter, New Mexico adopted its State Constitution which contains \nimportant guarantees of the rights of Spanish speakers, including the \nright to vote, hold office, and sit on juries. Specifically, the New \nMexico Constitution states ``[t]he right of any citizen of the state to \nvote, hold office or sit upon juries, shall never be restricted, \nabridged or impaired on account of religion, race, language or color, \nor inability to speak, read or write the English or Spanish languages \nexcept as may be otherwise provided in this constitution . . .''\n  Moreover, the New Mexico Constitution requires public school teachers \nto be trained in both English and Spanish to ensure that Spanish-\nspeaking students are properly taught the English language. Coupled \nwith this constitutional provision is another constitutional right that \nensures children of Spanish descent are entitled to a public education.\n  This amendment would not amend the New Mexico Constitution. I \nmentioned this only to point out another New Mexico constitutional \nprovision that requires all ballots that would amend the New Mexico \nConstitution be printed in both English and Spanish. The Spanish \ninfluence in my home State dates so far back that for the first 20 \nyears of New Mexico's statehood, all laws passed by the State \nlegislature were required to be printed in both English and Spanish.\n  I am always interested to hear others discuss their family histories, \nsome of which date back at least 200 years in this country. However, I \nthink that there is a misconception that the adoption of an official \nlanguage is strictly in response to illegal immigrants. That is not \ntrue. The declaration of an official language directly impacts the \nhistory, customs, and traditions of our American families. The family \nhistories that can be heard throughout New Mexico date back over 400 \nyears. These are not illegal immigrants; these are the first \ninhabitants of the land that is now called New Mexico.\n  Mr. President, while I fully support English as the official language \nof the United States, I will not support a proposal that would cast in \ndoubt the laws and rights afforded to all of the citizens of New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wish to discuss why I voted against \ncloture this morning on S. 1348, the border security and immigration \nreform bill currently being debated by the Senate.\n  As a border State Senator, I know first hand the need to secure our \ninternational borders because every day I hear from constituents who \nmust deal with illegal entries into our country. We have a crisis on \nour borders and the status quo is not acceptable. I support many of the \nprovisions in S. 1348 because we must address this border crisis. \nHowever, I was forced to vote no on the motion to invoke cloture on S. \n1348 because Democrats are refusing to allow votes on amendments to the \nlegislation on the Senate floor.\n  More than 300 amendments have been filed to this bill. Only about 10 \npercent of those amendments have been dealt with. Clearly the Senate, \nwhich is known for its deliberative nature, has not had an adequate \nopportunity to improve upon this bill on the floor. What's more, this \nbill did not go through the committee process and so there was no \nopportunity to improve the bill there.\n  I was here in 1977 and 1978 when the Senate debated the Natural Gas \nPolicy Act. That debate went on for weeks and hundreds of amendments \nwere considered. There is no reason to avoid that process in this \nsituation. The issues of border security and immigration are some of \nthe most important issues facing America today, and those issues \ndeserve full and fair debate.\n  The Democrats' refusal to allow votes on amendments means that my \namendments, which are very important to New Mexico, the southwest \nborder, and the Nation, cannot be considered. Those amendments would \nhave provided two more Federal judges in New Mexico to deal with \nimmigration cases, ensured that small businesses have access to \ntemporary workers they need, provided more personnel for Federal land \nagencies that must help secure Federal land on the international \nborder, allowed New Mexico to reap the economic benefits of Mexican \nnationals coming legally to the United States for a short period of \ntime for tourism and travel, called for Mexico's cooperation on border \nsecurity and border crime, addressed the lack of law enforcement radio \ncoverage on remote parts of the international border, strengthened and \nimproved the Border Patrol Academy at Artesia, NM, and called for \ncoordination between the Department of Homeland Security and the \nDepartment of Defense on aerial surveillance efforts along the border.\n  My amendments are based on needs that are imperative to border \nsecurity, and many of them were suggested specifically by New Mexicans \nto help New Mexico. I would like to discuss a few of those amendments \nin more detail.\n  First, I have heard from many Federal judges from the District of New\n\n[[Page S7312]]\n\nMexico and the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals about the crisis New \nMexico faces from an overloaded immigration docket. Seventy-one percent \nof Federal criminal cases filed in New Mexico are immigration cases. \nThis is the highest percentage of immigration cases anywhere in the \nUnited States, and New Mexico needs more judges to handle that \ncaseload. Unfortunately, I was not allowed to address this crisis by \noffering an amendment to S. 1348 that would have provided New Mexico \nwith two new Federal judges.\n  Second, I have heard from New Mexico small businesses about their \nneed for temporary workers in the food processing, construction, oil \nand gas, and restaurant industries. These small businesses were \nconcerned that they would not have access to the temporary workers they \nneed under S. 1348 as it is written, so I offered an amendment to set \naside a number of temporary worker visas to only be used by small \nbusinesses. Unfortunately, I was not allowed to address New Mexico \nsmall businesses' needs.\n  Third, some of the land on New Mexico's international border is \nFederal land. The Bureau of Land Management, Forest Service, and Park \nService are working with the Department of Homeland Security, DHS, to \nsecure these lands, but these Federal land agencies need more personnel \nto work on these issues. I offered an amendment to provide this \npersonnel, but that amendment has not been considered.\n  Fourth, remote parts of the New Mexico/Mexico border do not have \nradio coverage, which prevents DHS and law enforcement from \ncommunicating. I have filed an amendment that would enhance radio \ncommunications capabilities in these areas, but this amendment has not \nbeen considered.\n  Fifth, New Mexico is at an economic disadvantage over neighboring \nborder states because there are no border towns in New Mexico that \nMexican nationals can access when they legally enter the U.S. on a \nlaser visa. This is because such nationals can only travel 25 miles \ninto New Mexico. I have filed an amendment to expand the limit laser \nvisa holders can travel into New Mexico so that laser visa holders can \nlegally visit Las Cruces and other towns near the New Mexico/Mexico \nborder. Unfortunately, this amendment, which would bring economic \nbenefits to southern New Mexico, has not been considered.\n  The refusal of Democrats to allow consideration of these and my other \namendments is nothing short of irresponsible behavior towards the \nsecurity of America and the needs of New Mexico, and I cannot support \ncloture on S. 1348 without assurances that these measures will be \nconsidered.\n  Additionally, many of the provisions that I have supported in S. 1348 \nhave been amended to the point that the bill no longer has its initial \nimpact. For example, the temporary worker program that is critical to \nso many industries in my State does not meet those industries' needs. \nFurther, the bill as amended calls into question some laws and customs \nof my home State.\n  Because of Democrats' refusal to consider important amendments to \nthis bill, we will not see any of the comprehensive border security \nimprovements that New Mexico and other border States desperately need, \nand I could not be more disappointed.\n  I support efforts to address border security and immigration reform \nlegislation, and I applaud Senators Kyl, Kennedy, Specter, Salazar, \nMartinez, Graham, and others who have worked long and hard on this \nbill. However, I cannot support cloture on the bill at this time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, our country today faces serious issues \nwith our immigration policy. I appreciate the opportunity that we have \nbefore us to engage in this important debate and to work the will of \nthe Senate on this complex matter.\n  The legislation we have before us, the compromise reached by a number \nof our colleagues, has provided us with a starting point for reform of \na broken immigration system and to strengthen our border security.\n  Recognizing, however, that there are ways that we can improve upon \nthe work of the ``grand compromise,'' as it has come to be known, I \nhave joined with Senator Cornyn as a cosponsor of an amendment that \nwould increase the amount of funding made available to State and local \ngovernments to mitigate the costs of public education and health care \ncreated by the inadequacy of our current immigration system.\n  I understand from my conversations with Virginians around the State \nthat unauthorized immigration has caused a fiscal burden on State and \nlocal governments, one which must be addressed by this Congress. The \nprovisions of the legislation before us include a crucial State impact \nassistance account that would provide reimbursement for state and local \nentities for the vital services that they provide.\n  The amendment that I am pleased to cosponsor adds additional funding \nto this account without adding a burden to taxpayers. By increasing, \nfor immigrants in both the Y- and Z-visa categories, the fee that these \napplicants must pay at the time of their application, this amendment \nmakes a positive step toward alleviating the burdens faced by health \nproviders, educational agencies, and others eligible for funding \nthrough the State impact assistance account.\n  Under this amendment, the fee on applicants for these categories \nwould be set at $750, and an additional fee of $100 would be set for \neach additional dependent. For the primary applicants in both the Y- \nand Z-visa categories, this represents an increase of only $250 above \nthe legislation in its current form. I note that this amount $750 is \nalso the same fee agreed upon under legislation passed by the Senate \nwith a majority of support last year.\n  In my view, any legislative approach to provide overall immigration \nreform must rest on the foundation that an outright amnesty is \nunacceptable and that securing our borders is imperative. Then, in a \nsound, workable, and realistic way, this Congress must address the \nissue of the millions of undocumented workers who are already in our \ncountry. All of these components are absolutely essential to ensuring \nour security as a nation.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll and the \nfollowing Senators entered the Chamber and answered to their names.\n\n                          [Quorum No. 3 Leg.]\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Kennedy\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order and pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will state.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the substitute \n     amendment No. 1150 to Calendar No. 144, S. 1348, \n     comprehensive immigration legislation.\n         Harry Reid, Jeff Bingaman, Dick Durbin, Charles Schumer, \n           Daniel K.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on \namendment No. 1150, an amendment in the nature of a substitute offered \nby Mr. Reid of Nevada, to S. 1348, to provide for comprehensive \nimmigration reform and for other purposes, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, this has been a very difficult time. I think \nthere has been a lot of bending over backward to accommodate people who \nhave wanted to offer amendments. Initially, as you will recall, the \nnegotiators were given quite a bit of time, and then when that ``quite \na bit of time left,'' they wanted another week and they got that.\n  After the debate started, the majority leader said, this is a 2-week \nbill, and it is. I extended debate past the recess. During the floor \ndebate, we have disposed of 42 amendments, including 28 rollcall votes. \nLast night we asked for consent to move the cloture vote from this \nmorning to tonight so we could have another full day of amendments. \nThat didn't work out.\n  I understand why some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nthought maybe that wasn't a good idea. But I thought we could, after \ncloture was not invoked this morning, move some other amendments. We \ntried hard to do that. We were unable to do that. I tried every \npossible way to get amendments up today; every possible way.\n  A real short recounting of this. I offered votes on eight amendments, \nfour on each side. Then we tried six, three on each side. Again, my \nfriends on the other side of aisle objected to that. Then I tried three \nRepublican amendments, only two Democratic amendments. That was \nobjected to by my colleagues on the other side.\n  Finally, I tried to get a significant number of additional amendments \npending so they could receive votes after cloture. That was objected \nto. Republicans even objected to calling up their own amendments.\n  So having spent all day trying to diligently work out a way to vote \non Republican and Democratic amendments and facing objections from my \nRepublican colleagues, I found the only thing we can do is try to get \ncloture tonight.\n  I was hoping my friends on the other side of the aisle would \nunderstand that small groups shouldn't dictate what\n\n[[Page S7314]]\n\nhappens around here, but that is what happened.\n  But I, even though disappointed, look forward to passing this bill.\n  We are going to take the bill off the Senate floor, as I just \nindicated and we have done. But there are ways we can do this. There \ncould be an agreement of a number of amendments. I am saying to \neveryone here, I would do my very best to have more Republican \namendments than Democratic amendments. I know some of my colleagues \ndon't want me to say that, but I would be willing to do that, with a \ntime certain for passing this bill. Hopefully, we can do that in the \nnext several weeks. There is a lot of support for this bill on the \noutside. The problem was on the inside of the Senate Chamber.\n  People have worked very hard on this bill. One of my colleagues in my \noffice today, who has worked on this bill so hard, shed some tears. \nThis is a bill about which people have a lot of emotion.\n  I have to acknowledge that my first reaction was, look how many votes \nthey gave us, six or seven. All the Democrats could have voted for \ncloture--and we did, all but 10--and we still couldn't have gotten \ncloture. That was my reaction, to be upset. But there is no reason to \nbe upset. I think we have to look toward passing this bill. It is \nsomething that needs to be done. There are some really good things in \nthis bill. The DREAM Act--I will not belabor the point, but I will just \nbriefly say that in Smith Valley, NV, a little mining community, a \nnumber of years ago, this beautiful child came up to me, a senior in \nhigh school. I knew she wanted to talk to me, and she did. She said: I \nam the smartest kid in my class. I can't go to college. My parents are \nillegal. What am I going to do, Senator? She couldn't do anything. I \ndon't know what she is doing now. She is a grown woman, probably \nworking on the onion farms in Smith Valley. Maybe she got married. I \ndon't know what happened to her. She should have been able to go to \ncollege. We had a provision in this bill to allow people like that \nyoung lady to go to college.\n  A young man in Reno, NV, a small-in-stature Hispanic--he would be the \nmaster of ceremonies at events. He could sing. He could talk. It took \nme a number of years to realize he was in the country but he had bad \npapers. He couldn't drive a car. I haven't seen him for a number of \nyears, don't know what has happened to him. He couldn't go to college. \nUnder this legislation which is now no longer on the Senate floor, he \ncould have had a pathway to legalization. He already knew English. He \nspoke better English than I do. Get a job, pay taxes, stay out of \ntrouble--I am confident he would do that--pay some penalties and some \nfines to go to the back of the line, to be able to come out of the \nshadows, get the ability to drive a car. But we are not going to be \nable to do that for him now.\n  I have every desire to complete this legislation. We all have to \nwork--the President included--to figure out a way to get this bill \npassed. I am a creature of the Senate. I understand we live by the \nrules that govern this body. A small number of people can disturb what \ngoes on here. My disappointment--and I have expressed this to Senator \nMcConnell--is I wish more of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle had in effect thumbed their nose at a few of these people and \nvoted for cloture, at least giving us more votes than what we got. It \ndidn't happen. There are personal reasons for doing that. I accept \nthat. But in my office, about 7 o'clock tonight, a number of we \nDemocratic Senators met there and made a commitment to each other that \nwe are going to do everything we can to pass this bill as soon as we \ncan. When is that? I don't know. But we are going to work hard. We are \ngoing to try to put aside the hurt feelings we have and move on with \nthe anticipation that this bill is something the country needs, and the \nSenate needs to do this. I hope we can figure out a way to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, my good friend the majority leader and \nI frequently are on opposite sides of issues and fighting to a draw \noccasionally. But on the matter we are dealing with tonight, both of us \ndesire the same result, which is to get a bipartisan immigration bill \nthat would be an improvement over the disastrous status quo we have on \nthis important issue in America today. The utility, however, of a great \nmany cloture votes, particularly when you don't succeed, is that it \ndoesn't produce results.\n  I had indicated to my good friend the majority leader at the \nbeginning of this debate that we needed--``we'' meaning this side of \nthe aisle--to have roughly the same number of Republican rollcall votes \non this bill this year that we had the last time we brought it up. Now \nI think we were very close to getting there. My advice to my good \nfriend on the other side was to not have this vote we just had tonight. \nI didn't believe I could support cloture at this point, although I \ncertainly could at some point, provided we had enough votes on the \namendments for which there was a demand on our side of the aisle. But \nwe were not there yet. We could have finished this bill in a couple of \nmore days, in my judgment.\n  Frankly, we have had too many cloture votes this year to get \nsuccessful results. This is the 37th cloture vote we have had this \nyear. By this point in the 109th Congress, we had had 13. By this point \nin the 108th Congress, we had had nine. By this point in the 107th \nCongress, we had had two. So my suggestion on a bill like this which \ndoes enjoy bipartisan support is to meet the threshold of \nacceptability, to get enough support over here to get to final passage.\n  I think we are giving up on this bill too soon. I like what I think I \nheard the majority leader say, that he doesn't want to give up on it \neither. I think we are within a few days of getting to the end of what \nmany would applaud as an important bipartisan accomplishment of this \nCongress. I encourage the majority leader to return to this issue in \nthe near future. I doubt if the prospects will get better with the \npassage of time. There are a number of Republicans who are prepared to \nvote for cloture as soon as they believe their colleagues on this side \nof the aisle have had a reasonable opportunity to have offered and \nvoted upon amendments they think would improve the bill. I don't think \nthat is asking for too much.\n  I would be happy to commit tonight to the majority leader to continue \nto work with him to try to finish this bill at the earliest possible \ntime. Obviously, it is his decision to decide when we go back to it. My \nadvice would be to do that sometime soon. In the meantime, we will \nstill be working with people on this side of the aisle to try to winnow \ndown the number of amendments that really seem to need a rollcall vote \nand be prepared to try to work on this again at whatever point the \nmajority leader decides to return to the measure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the distinguished Republican leader has laid \nout the problem: We are very close. At some point, we will be ready to \nvote for cloture. We need more votes on amendments, even though we have \nhad more than on the bill last year. We are getting close to being \nprepared to vote for cloture. We have spent so much time on this bill \ntrying to make people happy whom you couldn't make happy on this bill \nanyway. They had no intention of voting for the bill, voting for \ncloture. But we spent an inordinate amount of time----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the leader yield on that point?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in a brief minute.\n  I want the right tone set here. I don't want this to be an \nadversarial process. This is not a battle between Reid and McConnell. \nThe votes show what happened. It doesn't take Einstein to figure that \none out. Republicans didn't vote for cloture. They hadn't had enough. \nWhat is enough? I don't know what is enough.\n  One of the elements that hasn't been mentioned here tonight--but only \nin passing, because I want to set the right tone--this is the \nPresident's bill. Last year, we passed the Democratic immigration bill. \nWe passed it with help from some courageous Republicans. Here, part of \nthose courageous Republicans met with some very strong Democratic \nSenators, working with Cabinet officers, to come up with a bill. They \ncame up with a bill. The press has declared this to be the grand \ncompromise. I accept that term. Where are\n\n[[Page S7315]]\n\nthe President's men? Where are the President's people helping us with \nthese votes?\n  We are finished with this for the time being. As we have been for \ndays, we are going to have a list for you right away. We should have it \nby 5 o'clock tonight. We will have it for you in the morning. We are \nvery close. At some point, we are going to do this. Pretty soon, we \nwill have enough votes so we can support cloture. We are prepared to \nvote for cloture but not right now.\n  I want to finish this bill, but I can't do it alone. We can't do it \nalone. We did more than our share here tonight on cloture votes. We \npicked up seven votes during the day from the vote this morning to the \nvote this evening. But we need some help. I would hope the President \nunderstands that it is only going to be about 16 months until there is \nan election for a new President, either a Democratic or Republican \nPresident. He has a relatively short period of time to help us with \nthis piece of legislation.\n  People know I am very concerned about what comes up on the floor. I \nam very time-conscious with what needs to be done. I am not always \nright, and I acknowledge that. But no one can take away from the fact \nthat I try to get as much as we can out of this Senate. I am going to \ncontinue to do that. Part of the time I want to make sure we are able \nto add into the picture is time to do an immigration bill, but we over \nhere can't do it alone. We need some help. We have an opportunity, as I \nsaid before. We want this number of amendments, and we are not going to \ngo for 34. I heard that one yesterday. But whatever it is--10, 6, 5, 4, \n3, a time for final passage--we will find time to get this bill up. If \nthey--meaning the other side--have another idea how to get it done, we \nwill work with them. We want to pass this bill. We are committed to \nimmigration reform. We believe our country needs it, not only for the \npeople who live in this country but people outside the country who \nrecognize we have the ability to solve our own problems. Immigration is \na problem. We are committed to work on it. And we will continue to do \nthat. I hope for the good of this country we can move forward in a \npositive manner and pass this legislation.\n\n  I say again, let's have President Bush work with us. I want to work \nwith him. You do not hear that from me very often. I will do whatever I \ncan to have this part of his legacy, his immigration bill. I want no \ncredit for it. No one else wants any credit for it. It can be his bill \nbecause if we pass this, there is credit to go around for everybody.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this is a complicated bill, but the key \nto passage is not complicated. Let me say again what I have been saying \nfor 2 weeks. There is a demand on this side of the aisle to have \nroughly the same number of Republican rollcall votes that we had when \nwe took up this bill in the last Congress.\n  Now, my good friend, the majority leader, keeps referring to Members \non our side of the aisle who are not going to vote for the bill under \nany circumstances, and there are a number of those on our side of the \naisle. But they are not the key to getting cloture. It is the rest of \nus.\n  Let me be perfectly clear about it. What I am saying is, the rest of \nus who would like to be able to vote for cloture and would like to see \nus pass a bill are going to insist that the others of our colleagues--\nwhether they vote for or against the bill in the end--have a chance to \nhave roughly the same number of rollcall votes we had before.\n  It is not complicated. It is a very complicated bill, but the key to \ngetting it passed is not complicated. We are not that far away from \nbeing able to get cloture on a bill. And the people like myself, who, \nif this procedural hurdle of getting an adequate number of rollcall \nvotes is met, are going to vote for cloture would probably be able to \nbring enough of our colleagues along to get cloture on the bill.\n  That is why I advise my good friend to give it a couple more days. \nThat is why I also advise him--right now, again, tonight--if he is \ngoing to turn back to this bill, I would not wait a whole long time to \ndo it. It strikes me that it ought to be done sometime in the near \nfuture. If we can get this reasonable number of additional rollcall \nvotes, I think there is an overwhelming likelihood of cloture on the \nmeasure and a bipartisan accomplishment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, keep in mind the logic of this. It has been \nmade graphically clear to me that the Republicans wanted more votes on \ntheir amendments. One problem: They objected to bringing up their own \namendments. It makes it a little tough to vote on them. It is like \nhaving a basketball tournament where you have the five players on each \nside, and they are going to have a tournament, and the winner is the \nteam with the most points, but--one problem--nobody will supply a \nbasketball. That is what we had here.\n  The logic of the statement of my friend from Kentucky leaves me \nwithout a lot of understanding. They want more amendments. We did \neverything we could to have amendments today. I will go through it \nagain. We started out with eight. They objected to it. Six, five; they \nobjected every time. We said: Do you want more amendments pending? Here \nthey are. We will give you six or eight. Objection.\n  So we know where we are. But let's realize where we are and not make \nup the facts. The real true facts: We wanted to give the Republicans \nvotes on amendments. Voice votes did not count. It had to be rollcall \nvotes. And I accepted that. But we could not get any kind of votes \nbecause we could not get amendments up--not for our fault.\n  So, Mr. President, I do not want to leave this floor tonight without \nstating how much I admire and appreciate seven courageous Republicans \nwho did the right thing. They know what went on here in the last few \ndays is wrong. They voted for cloture tonight. I am confident that \nothers will join them in the future, if we have to do cloture again. \nBut everyone--everyone--should acknowledge that what these seven \nSenators did was not easy. It is an act of courage that they did this.\n  While my compliments for them may not be very much, when the history \nbooks are written, this will be a profile in courage for their doing \nthis tonight. I am convinced that is true. I admire them and appreciate \nwhat they did, setting an example.\n  I think we have all said enough, but I want to get the last word. So \nif people want to say more, I will--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, then I want to express my admiration \nfor the 12 Democrats who voted against cloture for being profiles in \ncourage.\n  Look, the point is, it is quite simple. We all know how to get \ncloture. It is to have enough Republican rollcall votes, as I have \nrepeatedly told my good friend from Nevada over the last 2 weeks. At \nwhatever point we want to turn back to the bill and meet that threshold \nrequirement, I think there is an overwhelming likelihood of getting \ncloture and moving forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last word--I hope. You cannot have votes on \namendments that people do not let you bring up to vote on. There is no \nbasketball, remember. We have a game going but no basketball.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this vote was obviously a disappointment. \nI think those of us who have worked on this issue are encouraged by \nwhat both leaders have stated, that we are not giving up or forgetting \nthis legislation, and we have every intention of ultimately finalizing \nand getting a bill.\n  Tonight we cannot look away from what is happening on the southern \nborders that are open to the kind of vandalism that has taken place, \nthe exploitation which has taken place. We cannot look out at our \nbroken immigration system and think we can let that continue. We cannot \nlook away from so many locations across this country where people who \nare undocumented are being exploited--dangerously exploited--\ndehumanized.\n  We cannot look away from those who have worked in the agribusinesses \nof this country and had real hope we were going to take action in the \nSenate, where we have worked for years and years and years in order to \nget legislation through, which 67 Members of this Senate have \ncosponsored. Their dreams are dashed this evening.\n\n[[Page S7316]]\n\n  We cannot look away from the 12.5 million people out across America \nwho tonight, after finding out what has failed to happen in the Senate, \nknow they are going home to their children, and know tonight their fear \nis enhanced and increased because we have failed to take action.\n  Sure, they broke the law, but they broke the law because they wanted \nto work, work, work. They wanted to provide for their families. They \nwanted to provide for their children. They wanted to work. And 70,000 \npermanent resident aliens have served in the military in Iraq, in \nAfghanistan. They wanted to be part of the American dream.\n  Well, I think as both leaders have stated, doing nothing is not an \nalternative. It is not an alternative. This issue is not going away. \nAnd I leave this evening actually encouraged by what both leaders have \nstated. Most of all, I am encouraged by the spirit which I have seen in \nthe Senate among Republicans as well as a number of our colleagues who \nbelieve we have a real responsibility to accept the challenge of both \nof our leaders and find a way we can secure a fair and just immigration \nbill.\n  It is in that spirit that I hope those who have been involved in this \nwill continue to work so we are going to have a constructive \nresolution. No bill at all is not a solution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have a sense of wonderment as to what \nthe American people are thinking about what has just transpired in the \nSenate, if there are any people watching on C-SPAN 2.\n  This is reputed to be the world's greatest deliberative body. But to \nlisten to the debate for the last several days, and to the speeches \nhere this evening, I think people wonder just what is going on.\n  We worked through the immigration issue in the last Congress, in the \nJudiciary Committee, and extensively produced a committee bill. We came \nto the floor and passed a bipartisan bill.\n  This year, we chose a different course. As I have said before, I \nthink it was probably a mistake not to go through the committee \nprocess. But we crafted a bill, bipartisan. About a dozen Senators sat \nthrough tedious, laborious hours to construct a bill. As of this \nmoment, we have not succeeded. But I believe we will yet succeed.\n  We have faced a very difficult issue. We know our borders are porous. \nWe have constructed a way to do our utmost to stop people from coming \nin illegally. We know the United States is a great magnet, and we have \nstructured a way that employers can find out who is legal and who is \nnot legal. We have crafted a way, with a guest worker program, to \nprovide for the labor needs of the United States and have structured a \nway to deal with the 12 million undocumented immigrants as best we \ncould.\n  Accusations have been made it is amnesty. But the fact is, if we do \nnothing, it is silent amnesty. The 12 million undocumented immigrants \nwill stay here. And the alternative to amnesty--if amnesty it is; and I \ndo not think it is because we have done everything we can to construct \nthe factor of earned right to citizenship, with fines, payment of back \ntaxes, learning English, holding a job, contributing to our society--\nbut the alternative to amnesty--if it is; and I repeat it is not--is \nanarchy, which is what we have now.\n  I believe the central point ought to be understood by anyone who is \nwatching C-SPAN 2 that this matter is on life support, but it is not \ndead, it is not morbid, and ultimately we will produce a list of \namendments. We will satisfy those on the Republican side of the aisle \nwho want to vote for amendments. There is no obligation on the part of \nany Senator who offers an amendment to be committed to vote for the \nbill. The bill could be improved by those who are opposed to it. But \nwhatever is the case, they have a right to offer amendments. \nUltimately, we will satisfy that interest.\n  I voted for cloture tonight because I think the Democrats were wrong \nbut the Republicans were ``wronger''--to use a word which does not \nexist. But we will return to this issue because it is too important for \nAmerica not to improve the status quo.\n  We are still open for business on this bill. If anybody has a better \nidea on how to deal with the borders, let's hear it; to deal with the \nemployers, let's hear it; to deal with the 12 million undocumented \nimmigrants, let's hear it; to provide a workforce, let's hear it.\n  One thing I do take difference with my colleagues who have been \nopposed to the bill--on both sides--they have not come forward with an \nalternative. I had a discussion with one of the leaders of the \nopposition who is dead set against this bill today about what would he \nsuggest. He did not have a suggestion. He is still thinking about it.\n  Well, there has been a lot of time to think about it. We tackled this \nbill more than 2 years ago in the Judiciary Committee, which I chaired, \nand it is time that the dissenters came up with something as an \nalternative, just not be naysayers.\n  But I am glad to hear what Senator Reid has said and Senator \nMcConnell has said about the determination to produce a bill yet, and I \nthink we will return to it. We will yet earn our title as the world's \ngreatest deliberative body.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I want to make a few comments about the \nlegislation we have been working on so hard. The overall comment I want \nto make is, failure on this issue is simply not an option. Failure is \nnot an option. The people of America deserve the Congress to resolve \nthis issue because of the very important values that are at stake.\n  I want to say, first, before I make some other comments, that we \nwould not be here, frankly, if it had not been for the leadership of \nMajority Leader Reid in setting aside this time for us to debate this \nissue of such national significance. So I appreciate him and all the \nleadership he has provided in this effort.\n  I also appreciate the leadership of both my Democratic and Republican \ncolleagues who have worked hard on this issue for the last 4, 5 months. \nIndeed, it has been more than a 4- or 5-month debate and \nstruggle. Indeed, it has been more than a 4- or 5-month debate. We were \non this floor for a month last year casting some 30, 35 rollcall votes, \nand we have been on this issue now for the last several weeks. We had a \nwarning it was coming up. But there has been a lot of work that has \ngone into this legislation. It is my hope, with the sense of optimism \nexpressed by my good friend, Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts, that \nSenator Reid and Senator McConnell will lead us to some resolution of \nthis issue.\n\n  I want to say a quick word about why I don't think failure is an \noption. I don't think anybody here ought to be saying the immigration \nreform package is dead, because it isn't. It isn't. We are very close \nto coming up with legislation that will address the fundamental values \nwe have been trying to address from the very beginning. In my mind, I \nwant to say what I believe some of those fundamental values are.\n  First and foremost, we have to fix our borders. We have a system of \nbroken borders in this country where people come across the border and \nwe don't know who is coming into this country. We don't know who is \ncoming into this country. In a post-9/11 world, that is absolutely \nunacceptable.\n  We also have a broken immigration system within the country, because \nwhen people come into the country, we don't know where they are and we \ndo know that many of them overstay their visas. Forty percent, fifty \npercent of the people come into the country legally and simply overstay \ntheir visas. How can we have a system of national security when we \ndon't know where these people are? So national security compels us to \nmake sure that we get to a solution, and that is why failure is not an \noption.\n  Secondly, there are significant aspects to this legislation. I look \nat the great work Senator Dianne Feinstein and Senator Larry Craig have \ndone with respect to AgJOBS, a piece of legislation that has been \nalmost a decade in crafting. I know about the fruit that rots in places \nin California. I know about the agricultural disaster problems we have \nin many places across our country, including my State of Colorado. \nAgJOBS is an important part of\n\n[[Page S7317]]\n\nthe legislation. People and organizations, both Republican-leaning \norganizations and Democratic-leaning organizations, from the United \nFarm Workers to the Farm Bureau of America, and others, want us to pass \nthis legislation because it included AgJOBS. Today, the farmers and \nranchers of America ought to be saying to this Senate and to the \nleaders of this Senate that they want this bill and they want to get it \ndone as soon as we possibly can.\n  Third, there are moral issues that frankly ought to guide us in \ndealing with some of these issues that are so important to our country. \nSure, there are 12.5 million people who came here to America and they \ncame here to work and to live the American dream. Tonight, many of \nthose people live in fear not knowing what is going to happen to them, \nnot knowing what is going to happen to their families the next day. \nBecause they broke the law, we said in this compromise, in this piece \nof legislation we put together, that we were going to have them pay a \nfine. We were going to punish them. That is what we do in America all \nthe time. We pass laws in this body. The Presiding Officer and I served \nas attorneys general for a long period of time, and what we do is when \npeople break the law, we punish them. So we created a system here that \nprovided punishment to people by requiring them to pay a fine.\n  We also in this legislation require that they pay fees, impact fees. \nWe require them to pay other kinds of fees. So this was not what some \nof those people from places around the country have said is an amnesty \nbill. This was a bill that put people into probation and into purgatory \nwhere over a period of time, over a period of 8 years--you wait for 8 \nyears and at the end of 8 years, if you do the time, if you pay the \nfine, if you stay crime free, if you learn English, you go to the back \nof the line, you meet all of those requirements, then--then--you become \neligible for a green card. So what we crafted was a bill that was in \nfact a workable bill.\n  Having said all of that, I think the aim here still is to address \nthose very important strategic interests of the United States of \nAmerica, and I do not believe failure is an option. I believe that the \nDemocrats, working with the Republicans, can still move forward to find \nlegislation that will address the imperative of fixing our broken \nborders and our lawless immigration system which we currently have in \nAmerica.\n  The last thing I want to say again is the best of times, frankly, for \nme in the Senate have been when Democrats and Republicans came together \nto solve the problems of our country. The issue of immigration isn't a \nRepublican issue or a Democratic issue; it is an issue that is an \nAmerican issue. If we are going to solve an issue that is as difficult \nas this very contentious issue for America, it is going to take \nRepublicans coming over and working with the Democrats so we can get \ncloture on the bill, so we can get whatever amendments crafted that are \nnot the poison pills some would try to offer, and we can get that done. \nI have confidence. I have confidence in my Democratic colleagues as \nwell as my Republican colleagues that we can live up to the optimism--\nwe can live up to the optimism Senator Reid shared with us here \ntonight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I wish to share in the comments of my \ncolleagues who have spoken in favor of this legislation in expressing \nconcern that we were not able to proceed tonight to the final steps for \nits consideration, but also to express appreciation to the majority \nleader and others who have expressed a willingness to continue to \nensure that legislation can move forward as quickly as possible.\n  We should not here this evening cast any blame for our failure to \nmove it forward tonight. In a sense, all of us who were supporters \ndidn't do a good enough job of ensuring all of the process could occur \nthat Members properly insist on in order to vindicate their rights to \ndebate and have amendments to get the job done. By the same token, \nthose who oppose the bill need to appreciate that at a certain point, \nthere is adequate consideration of their amendments.\n  The majority leader expressed this evening the view that we hadn't \nquite reached that point. And reluctantly, because of that, I joined \nthose who decided to vote to keep the debate moving forward, which at \nthis point means the majority leader has, at least temporarily, set it \naside. But it shouldn't be too hard to get about a dozen amendments of \nMembers considered. That is why I say we all share some responsibility, \nbecause that shouldn't have been that hard of a task. I hope our \nleadership will ensure that once we get that list available and ready \nfor consideration, we can quickly take up the legislation again and \nfinish it in this body so it can move forward to the other side.\n  I am not going to talk about the substance of the legislation \ntonight. I do want to thank those who worked so hard on its behalf on \nboth sides of the aisle. The Senator from Colorado who has just spoken \nwas an incredible inspiration in getting it done. The work Senator \nKennedy did throughout this effort to ensure that he drove us to a \nconclusion that was one that didn't satisfy anyone 100 percent, but \nwhich all of us at the end of the day found we were able to support--\nwithout his leadership, it wouldn't have been possible. My colleague \nfrom California, Senator Feinstein, with whom I have worked on so many \nthings, made some very difficult decisions and in that, as always, I \nrespect the way she provided her leadership. On our side, colleagues \nsuch as Senator Mel Martinez, who is on the floor now, my colleague \nJohn McCain from Arizona, Lindsey Graham, and Senator Specter who \nspoke, and all of the others who helped so much on this legislation, we \nare committed to seeing it through to the end. Another one of our \ncolleagues on the Democratic side, Senator Cantwell, who also was a \nhelp in moving part of this along, said this is a marathon, and she is \nright. We are not quite to the finish, but we are going to finish.\n  I know there are those out in America who think this is not a good \nbill. If you want to criticize the bill, there are a hundred ways to do \nit. I could point out all the flaws, and there are plenty. But you \ncannot solve big problems without trying. We have tried hard. We have \nproduced an imperfect product, but a product that is the best to come \nalong yet. In the amendment process we can make it better, and in the \nrest of the legislative process, hopefully, we can approve it. Hearing \nfrom the American people, we have put many of their suggestions into \nthe mix here to help improve it. But if we don't try, this problem that \nhas bedeviled us for years will continue.\n  As so many others have said, failure is not an option. We have a big \nproblem in this country that needs solving, and I respect those who \nhave put their shoulder to the wheel to solve it in the face of great \nopposition and misunderstanding in some respects from some of our \nconstituents. But if you don't try, you don't reach these tough \nsolutions. We came here to solve the tough problems.\n  I will conclude with comments that have always inspired me by Teddy \nRoosevelt, who was not afraid to get in a dusty arena and fight it out. \nHe said the thing he most appreciated about his opportunities in life \nwas the opportunity to work on work worth doing. This is work worth \ndoing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I wanted to say a few words because \nfor me, this is a very sad day. I had hoped the outcome would be very \ndifferent. I too want to thank my colleagues.\n  Earlier this evening, I happened to listen to the gray-haired Senator \nfrom Massachusetts speak and I think he probably spoke for an hour \nwithout a note. It was a lesson in immigration and a lesson on this \nbill. I think he knows more and has worked harder and worked longer--\nnot months, but decades--on these issues. So, Ted Kennedy, I want you \nto know I have the deepest respect and feeling for you, and I am so \nsorry this day ended the way it did.\n  But to my other colleagues: Senator Kyl, Senator Martinez, who is \nhere, Senator Salazar, Senator Menendez, Senator Specter, Senator \nGraham, all of those people who came to the hot rooms and sat around a \ntable and put forward something they hoped could be bipartisan and \ncould pass, I think we\n\n[[Page S7318]]\n\nall know the fact is that any immigration bill has to get 60 votes. \nTherefore, it is not going to be a Democratic immigration bill and it \nis not going to be a Republican immigration bill; it is going to be a \nbipartisan bill.\n  Having said that, when you deal with one word, which is \n``comprehensive,'' which means all encompassing, you have to deal with \na system that is huge. A visa system by the millions, a broken border, \ninterior enforcement, employer sanctions, all of those things you need \nto do to fix a system that has existed are broken.\n  Someone said earlier today: What we have now today in America is \neffectively amnesty, because people know you can't pick up and deport \n12 million people. You can't hold 12 million people. Therefore, what \ndevelops is a kind of subterranean, fearful culture that never becomes \nhealthy and part of the main culture of America, and it is so too bad, \nbecause it doesn't have to be that way. I think those of us who see \nthat, who looked at the comprehensive picture, who struggled between a \nDemocratic ideology and a Republican ideology and to put those things \ntogether that we could put together in virtually every area of \nimmigration reform, found that indeed it was a difficult task. We also \nfound another thing: that there are very strong feelings in this \ncountry; and secondly, this bill was misunderstood from the very day it \nwas brought out on the floor. In many different ways, it was \nmisreported. It is still being misreported to this very day.\n  People never have understood the complexities of the bill. For \nexample, if you sunset the point system after 5 years, you essentially \nsay that agricultural workers can't get green cards because they have \nto wait for 8 years, or Z visas can't get green cards because you have \nto wait for 8 years. The agreement was that in exchange for being able \nto bring people out of the shadows, to put them through the hoops of \nbecoming legal--not amnesty--oh, and I must tell my colleagues, my hair \ngoes up every time somebody calls it amnesty, because there are all \nkinds of hoops they must jump through, and they must show a dedication \nto the country, and they must work and they must pay a fine, and they \nmust learn the language, and they have to do this over a substantial \nperiod of time. They have to work to hold their visa. There is a \nprobationary period. They have to submit documents. Some people thought \nit was too strong, but the fact is, we had a workable program. The \nexchange for the Republicans for doing that was two things: the guest \nworker program, and 8 years down the pike, 8 years down, changing the \nfamily basis to a nuclear family for green cards--a nuclear family \nbeing a mother, a father, and minor children, with additional green \ncards to move people faster through, with hardship green cards where \nthere was a hardship. I wish to share this with the Senator from \nFlorida, and other Senators who are here, that with every amendment put \non the floor, it drove the sides not closer together but further apart. \nI watched as we sat here late last night. I saw that as the discussion \nof amendments went on, we lost Members. It was unfortunate because much \nof it was not on correct information.\n\n  I hope people will take a look at this bill. There may be some \ndecision made that comprehensive, all inclusive is too much to tackle \nin one bill, that perhaps we should do parts of this bill at a time. \nThis has been a very hard time for those of us who believe we had a \nproduct that had a chance to stand the test of time. We have a failing \nsystem out there today. Even if we got 25 percent better, it would be \nbetter than it is today. We could offer hope for people. We could see \nthey are put in a constructive venue. We could see that enforcement is \nwhat it should be. We would put the money into the guarantee of the \nenforcement. We would use modern electronics to improve employer \nsanctions. Everybody would have an identification card. We have all \nthese people in this country and we don't know who they are. What kind \nof a national security risk is that? Answer: It is a big one. We have \npeople coming across all the time. This is a way to know who everybody \nis in the United States.\n  So there were so many things in this bill that were good. Sure, there \nare things I don't like and that Senator Durbin didn't like and that \nMel Martinez didn't like and Senator Salazar didn't like and a lot Jeff \nSessions didn't like. There were even things Ted Kennedy didn't like. \nBut the point is we have a system that is not functional and that is \nserving no purpose and is using taxpayer dollars without producing the \nkinds of efficiencies it should. This is what we tried to solve in this \nbill.\n  I thought it was a good bill. I thought we could, in conference, work \nout some of the problems. I guess my observation of the evening is: Is \ncomprehensive too much? Secondly, do people not want a bill so much \nthat they are going to put amendments on this floor that don't bring \npeople together, only divide them further?\n  In terms of deal breakers--my last point--there was one on each side. \nWe survived that. There was one for each side. Yet there was nothing \nthat could not be remedied in a conference. The achievements, I \nthought, would have been so strong and our situation so much improved. \nI hope people will read the bill, look at it, understand how these visa \nprograms would work, understand how the security in this country would \nbe improved by passing it, understand how we can--I have always \nbelieved we could control our borders. If we have the will, there will \nbe a way. This was the will and the way to do that.\n  So it is a dark day for me and a dark evening because a lot of work \nwent into this. I don't think we should give up. I think we should come \nback to fight another day. I know we will. To everybody, beginning with \nTed, Ken, Mel, Dick, and for those Republicans who had the courage in \nparticular to vote yes on cloture, I am very grateful. I think if there \nwere a few more of you, we may have been able to do this tonight. We \nwill come back. I thank everybody.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, I share in the disappointment of the \nevening with the Senator from California. I have been a part of this \nprocess, and I never thought in my first days as a Senator that \nimmigration would be one of the signature issues I would deal with. \nHowever, it is one I will not shrink from and one I will continue to do \nall I can to see that we tackle this difficult problem our Nation faces \nand do something about it.\n  It would be incredibly easy to walk away from this. In fact, we have \nseen how easy it is to say ``amnesty'' and with that, satisfy one \nresponsibility toward solving a problem our country faces today. It is \neasy to say this would not work, this is wrong, this isn't the right \nbill, this is the wrong bill, this is a mistake, we should not do this. \nWhat has been so ever-present to me is the lack of any constructive \nsolutions. I know now we are going to be in a hiatus, and those who \ncriticized this effort, I hope, will take the time and undertake the \nresponsibility of putting forth a proposal, advancing an idea, doing \nsomething other than tearing down those who have put this together.\n  I don't believe we would have been hurt by one more day of debate. If \nthe bill is going to be brought back, it would have been easier to have \ngiven it another day. I can also understand the exasperation and \nanxiety by one who waited all day for amendments that didn't come. In \nthe blame game of Washington, there is plenty of blame to go around.\n  I remain committed to this because I believe we owe it to the \nAmerican people to tackle this very important problem. As I look at \nwhat we must do and what is ahead, I am disappointed tonight not so \nmuch for me but for those Americans who believe our borders need to be \nsafer. I am disappointed for those who have employees who may be \nillegal and are looking for a tamperproof ID system that will help them \nto know their workforce is a legal one. I am disappointed for those who \nsee the opportunity for the economy of our country to be improved and \nmade better by bringing in the best and the brightest under a points \nsystem that would reward opportunity for companies to bring in people \nwe are not producing ourselves, but I hope we will produce in the \nfuture. But today it is advantageous to us in this global\n\n[[Page S7319]]\n\neconomy to bring people in from another part of the world to be a part \nof this thriving, high-tech economy.\n  I am more disappointed for the families out there who are wondering \nwhat is going to happen to them, how will this affect them--the people \nwho fix the cars, mow the lawns at a golf club, make the hotel beds in \ncentral Florida, the people who clean the parks so that the next day \npeople can go in and enjoy a summer vacation day, the people who pump \nthe gas for them as they are leaving the park, the people who do \ndifficult construction and hot construction work that takes place in \nthe hot summer in Florida, the people who harvest the citrus crops, and \nall those people who do all those services and jobs, who also have the \nanxiety of wondering what is going to happen to them. Those are the \npeople who come to me and ask: Are you doing something about \nimmigration? What are you doing to help? Can you do something? Is it \ngoing to happen? When? The Senate, with its long and storied history \ntoday, bipartisanly, failed the American people. That is, plain and \nsimply, the way I see it. We have a chance to recover and recoup and \ncome back together to try again to bring this issue to a close and to \ndo something for the American people in a way that will bring honor to \nthis institution. I believe we need to lead because it is time to lead.\n\n  It is easy to lead on that which is easy; it is much harder to lead \non that which is difficult. I wish to say to the Senator from \nMassachusetts how much I appreciated working with him. He has worked \nhard. I also thank the diligent members of our staffs who have given \nnight and day to this effort. So I thank Senator Kennedy for his \nparticipation in this effort. We have all learned from one another. I \ncertainly have been on the learning side of the curve from Senator Kyl, \nwho has now gone but who has been an inspiration to me through the way \nin which he has handled this. I wish to simply say there was another \nquote from Teddy Roosevelt about the man in the arena, but I will not \ngo through the quote. Those of us who are trial lawyers and have tasted \nthe verdict coming back the wrong way, we understand there are days \nthat don't go the way you want them to go. This was one of them. But \nthere is no statute of limitations and there is no final judgment.\n  We have an opportunity to come back another day and try again. I hope \nit will not be long because I think the chances of this matter being \nbrought to a satisfactory conclusion are enhanced if we get back at it \nsooner rather than later. The American people expect us to solve \nproblems. That is why they sent us here.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle so we can, at some point, do the work the American people \nexpect us to do on this very difficult issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, a number of us stayed on the floor this \nevening long after the Senate finished its business on the immigration \nbill. It is bittersweet to be here after all this effort and time, with \nso little to show for it. I think the comments made since the decision \non the motion to end the debate was voted on have been constructive and \npositive. I join in that spirit.\n  First, I acknowledge we learned an important lesson about the Senate, \na lesson that bears repeating so those who follow these proceedings \nwill understand what happened. The Senate is a different institution, \ndifferent than most city councils, different than the House of \nRepresentatives, where I proudly served for 14 years. It is an \ninstitution designed to protect the minority's points of view. It is an \ninstitution that guarantees to every State, large and small, the same \nnumber of Senators, and an institution which has honored and protected \nthe rights of the minority since its conception.\n  It was in 1916, if I am not mistaken, when President Woodrow Wilson \nasked the Congress to pass a law to arm the Merchant Marine; with the \ngreat world war about to begin, German U-boats were sinking American \nmerchant vessels. President Wilson wanted to stay out of the war, but \nhe wanted to protect our fleet. He asked the Congress for the authority \nto arm the Merchant Marine, and it passed the House. It was stopped \ncold in the Senate by one Senator, who in those days had the power to \nstand and filibuster and, by that filibuster or debate, end the \npossibility of enacting a bill into law. The American people responded \nwith outrage. The Senate was forced, for the first time in its history, \nto create a way to stop this power of one Senator; so they invented the \nmotion known as the cloture motion, which we had tonight. They said it \nwould take 67, two-thirds of the Senate, to stop one Senator from \nending debate and stopping progress on a bill--67 votes.\n  It wasn't until many years later--almost 50 years--that the Senate \namended that and said it would only take 60 votes. This came up during \nthe civil rights debate. It was considered a great reform during that \nera, and 60 votes became the standard for cloture. In other words, \nthree-fifths of the Senate would have to vote so any single Senator who \ntried to stop a bill from progressing would be foreclosed, or closed \noff with the cloture motion. That is the rule that applies today, some \n40 years later. It is a rule we have lived under, and it is a rule we \ntried to apply to this debate.\n  It was the belief of many that we had enough votes to pass this bill. \nThere were some who wanted to extend debate with more amendments and \nmore amendments, and many of us felt most of these amendments had run \ntheir course and were repetitive, and the real ambition of those \noffering amendments was not to improve the bill, or even challenge the \nbill, but to stop the bill. So we tried, under the Senate rules, with \nthe cloture motion, to close off that debate and bring this matter to a \nclose. We fell short of that, despite our best efforts. The rollcall \nthis evening fell short, with a vote of 45 to 50. We needed 15 more \nvotes.\n  So what those who followed the debate saw this evening was an example \nof what the Senate is about, why it was created, why it functions, and \nthe frustrating role it sometimes plays. The second thing those who \nfollowed the debate saw was the continuing saga of immigration in \nAmerica. Almost from the first boat that landed in America, immigration \nhas been an issue. How many more people can this great Nation absorb? \nWhat kind of people do we want to be our neighbors and future leaders \nin this country? What kind of people can come here and make this a \nbetter place? What kind of people would come here and perhaps make it \nworse?\n  We have been engaged in this debate from the earliest days of this \ncountry. There have been bitter chapters in this debate--chapters of \ndiscrimination and prejudice against those who arrived, glorious \nchapters when immigrants came and literally gave life to a country in \nits infancy.\n  I said on the floor before, and I think at this moment it bears \nrepeating, I am one of those fortunate few. My grandmother and \ngrandfather immigrated to this country. They brought my mother, a 2-\nyear-old infant, from Lithuania and settled in East St. Louis, IL. They \nlived an immigrant life, a spartan existence. They managed to survive. \nThey managed to prosper and raise a family. And the son of an immigrant \nmother now stands as the 47th Senator in the history of the State of \nIllinois. I am so proud of that, not for myself but for the fact that \nit says a lot of good things about America and about immigration.\n  This debate evoked a lot of emotional responses. I say to my friend \nSenator Salazar from Colorado, who is truly one of the most \nextraordinary Senators--he brings his heart to this debate--when he \nstands before us on issues such as the official language of America and \ntells what it was like to be raised in a family that spoke Spanish and \nto be faced with discrimination because of that heritage, it touches my \nheart.\n  Of course, Senator Salazar and his family are not newcomers to the \nUnited States. They were here centuries before my family arrived. I \nthink 500 years ago, if I am not mistaken, the Salazar family started \ncoming into this country, long before any settlers.\n  When I listen to Senator Salazar speak on these issues, I listen very \ncarefully because I know his voice is so important in this debate.\n  I listen to Senator Bob Menendez from New Jersey, a relative newcomer \nto the Senate as well, but the man has made a real mark as a child of \nimmigrants to this country.\n\n[[Page S7320]]\n\n  Senator Martinez, who spoke a moment ago, from the Republican side of \nthe aisle, is an immigrant to this country from Cuba.\n  America is a better place because of these three people and their \nfamilies. We know that. Immigration is why we are such a powerful and \ngreat Nation. Our diversity is our strength. Those who cannot \nunderstand that do not understand this country. Those who think the \nnature of America is ``I am up, let's pull up the ladder,'' have lost \nsight of why we are truly unique in this world's history, why many of \nthe things that divide other countries do not divide America, because \nwe have said to people: You are welcome in this country as long as you \nare tolerant--tolerant of people of different colored skin, different \nethnic background, different accents, different religions. These are \nwhat make us different. But in that difference is our strength. \nImmigration is the reason America is as great as it is today, and the \ndetractors and critics have forgotten that.\n  I listened to Senator Reid, Senator Feinstein, and so many others as \nthey talked about this bill. There is one section in this bill that is \nas close to my heart as any other section. It is the DREAM Act. I \ndecided to introduce the DREAM Act over 5 years ago. At the time I did, \na few members of my staff said: This is a serious mistake, Senator \nDurbin. People will not like it, they will not understand it, they are \ngoing to use it against you.\n  I disagreed. I believe the DREAM Act tells the story of America in \nits proper form. The DREAM Act says if you are a child who came to \nAmerica before the age of 16, brought here by parents, and you are \nundocumented, if you have lived in this country for 5 years, if you \ngraduate from high school, if you are prepared to either serve our \ncountry in the military or to finish 2 years of college, we will give \nyou a chance to be an American citizen.\n  Why did I introduce this bill? Because, frankly, in my office in \nChicago and Springfield and all across the State of Illinois, most of \nour work is on immigration. I introduced it because I met a young \nwoman, a Korean American who came here at the age of 2, whose family \ndid not file the papers, who learned much later in life when she \nthought her star was going to soar that she had no country. Her mother \ncame to my office and said: What are we going to do about this little \ngirl? We never filed papers, Senator. Everybody in the house with her \nis a citizen, but she is not. What can we do?\n  We went to our agencies of Government and said: What can we do for \nthis 18-year-old girl who has such a bright future, who has been \noffered a music scholarship because of her skills on the piano? The \nimmigration office said: The answer is obvious: Send her back to Korea.\n  Send her back to Korea after 16 years of living in this country? \nAfter 16 years of American dreams she was to be sent away? That is when \nI wrote the DREAM Act. I said it isn't fair. It isn't fair for us to \ntalk about bringing any new people into America until we at least give \nthese children who should not be faulted for any shortcomings of their \nparents a chance.\n  I salute all those involved in writing the bill we considered, S. \n1348, because from the beginning, I was so honored that they came to me \nand said this bill will not go forward unless the DREAM Act is \nincluded. They worked hard on both sides of the aisle--Democrats and \nRepublicans--and the White House to include in this bill the DREAM Act.\n  I want to make a promise to those young men and women I still see \nalmost every time I return to my home State of Illinois: I won't quit \non you. I promise you I will continue this fight. We are going to pass \nthis law. You are going to get your chance, and you are going to make \nthis a better country. I made you that promise, and I am going to keep \nit. It wasn't today, but it will be tomorrow. I want to keep that \npromise. The DREAM Act will become the law of the land. Tens of \nthousands of kids who are going to school now and are wondering what \nthe future could possibly hold, if you are undocumented and educated in \nAmerica, those kids are going to get a chance. That is what this \ncountry has always been about.\n  I wish to say a word of praise to a handful of Senators on both sides \nof the aisle.\n  On the Republican side of the aisle, there were some true profiles in \ncourage, as Senator Reid said. Arlen Specter stepped up and became a \nreal leader on this issue. I have disagreed with him in the past, and I \nhave agreed with him. But I have always respected this man. I watched \nhim day to day battling cancer, never missing a bell, coming to the \nSenate Judiciary Committee and to the floor of the Senate, keeping up a \nbreakneck schedule, running his staff into the ground while he was \nundergoing chemotherapy on the weekends. He is truly a man dedicated to \npublic service and brings a special talent to the job.\n  Jon Kyl of Arizona. The last time we considered immigration reform, \nJon Kyl was the harshest critic of immigration reform. When I heard he \nwas in on the negotiations, I thought: What is this all about? I \nquickly learned. It was genuine. He was committed to trying to find a \nbill. I didn't agree with Jon Kyl's approach in many areas, but I \nrespect the fact that his commitment was genuine and he tried up until \nthe very last minute to pass this bill.\n\n  Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. I watched the rollcall votes for \nLindsey Graham and thought many times how can he possibly do this? How \ncan he go home, maybe even face a Republican primary, and have the \ncourage to take these votes and cast them the way he has? But he did it \nover and over again.\n  Mel Martinez of Florida, I mentioned earlier, from Cuba, wears two \nhats, not only a Senator from the great State of Florida, but is \nchairman of the Republican National Committee--chairman of the National \nRepublican Committee. He has been a true leader on this issue. I have \ncome to know Mel and respect him so much. He has told us in private \nmeetings with Senators the story of his life. I understand why the \nissue means so much to him personally.\n  John McCain. John McCain has been kicked around for a lot of reasons. \nHe can take it. He is tough--a POW for over 5 years, a veteran of war. \nHe has been through a lot in his life. He stood up for this bill when \npeople wouldn't have had the courage to do so. I respect him for doing \nthat.\n  On the Democratic side, what can I say about Ted Kennedy? I am sorry \nhe has left. Maybe his staff or somebody watching will share my \nfeelings about him. It was 40 years ago I sat right up there as a \ncollege student. It was 1968. I had heard Senator Bobby Kennedy, a \nSenator from New York, was coming to the floor and was going to speak \nout against the war in Vietnam. I waited for a long time until early \nevening, and through those doors came Bobby Kennedy with his brother \nTeddy Kennedy. He walked over and gave a speech on the Vietnam war. I \nsat up there in awe of these two great men, Bobby Kennedy and Teddy \nKennedy. I looked down on them and said: I can't believe I am seeing \nthese giants in American history. I never thought I would see the day \nwhen I would serve with Teddy Kennedy. He and I disagree from time to \ntime; that is expected in the Senate. But I never had but the greatest \nadmiration for his courage and leadership. This is a man who struggles \neach day with a disability that might stop others but never stops him, \noften in pain, often in discomfort. He comes to the floor every day. He \ncomes to the committee every day and fights with all of his heart for \nwhat he believes in, and we saw it in this immigration battle.\n  Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was here a few moments ago, is a \nterrific ally on these issues. She is truly looking for bipartisan \nresponses every step of the way, a practical solution, and never gives \nup. Down in the well as we voted on the cloture motion, she didn't give \nup the hope we might put together 60 votes. She walked around begging \nSenators to vote. She is that kind of committed person.\n  I said a word about Senator Salazar, and I won't return to that \nchapter other than to say he has been a major part of this debate. A \nnewcomer to the Senate, he has made his presence felt. I know he has \nmany years of contribution to this country and the State of Colorado he \nrepresents so well.\n  Bob Menendez I mentioned earlier, Cuban background, another newcomer \nto the Senate. Both he and Senator Salazar on the Democratic side of \nthe aisle are important voices in this debate from the Hispanic \ncommunity.\n  And finally, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, brand new to the Senate,\n\n[[Page S7321]]\n\nwho is gaining in stature every single day, has been an important part \nof this effort.\n  Those are the 10 who come to my mind who deserve special credit and \npraise.\n  Let me say in closing, for those who may stand and argue we didn't \ngive them a chance to debate this bill, I think we did. I think we were \nmore than fair. Last year before cloture was invoked on the last \nimmigration bill, the Senate disposed of 30 amendments, 23 rollcall \nvotes. This year the Senate disposed of 42 amendments, not 30, 42 \namendments, 28 rollcall votes. In the entire consideration of the \nimmigration bill last year, the Senate disposed of 44 amendments, only \n2 more than we have already considered at this point in the debate.\n  I believe we did everything in our power to offer even more amendment \nopportunities. I was here with Senator Reid today when he repeatedly \noffered on the floor a chance to bring forward amendments, let's debate \nthem, let's vote on them, let's move forward. And every time he tried, \na Senator from the other side of the aisle, the side of the aisle that \nwas begging for amendments, stood up and objected. They objected to \ncalling up the very same amendments they argued were the obstacle to \nbringing this bill to finality.\n  Let me say this: It is very difficult and rare to revive and \nresuscitate a bill that doesn't get cloture once we have moved beyond \nit. I hope this is an exception. To paraphrase what Senator Martinez \nand Senator Salazar said, there are so many people counting on us when \nit comes to this vote, thousands and thousands of young people who are \nbegging for this DREAM Act, praying it will pass and give them a \nchance, millions of people living in shadows, in fear, working hard \nevery day, loving their families, going to the church of their choice, \ntrying to be part of their community, and realizing they are just one \nknock on the door away from deportation and the destruction of their \nfamily and their life as they know it. I cannot imagine living with \nthat shadow over one's life, and so many do. We owe it to them to do \nsomething that is honorable in response to this need. And we owe it to \nour country to repair our broken borders, to slow this flow of illegal \nimmigration, to make sure there is enforcement in the workplace, and to \nmake sure America's doors are still open for those who bring their \ndreams to America and make it the great Nation we love so much.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I want to say a few words. I heard \ncolleagues who have spoken. I have listened at length to some very \neloquent remarks evoking sincere feelings and emotions. I certainly \nrespect that. We all in this body are great advocates. We disagree \nsometimes.\n  I suggest that we had a couple of problems with the bill, and that is \nwhy the bill failed. There are a lot of problems with the legislation \nitself, and there are a lot of problems that the American people had \nwith it.\n  The bottom line is, the American people did not have confidence that \nwe were moving legislation that would effectively accomplish what all \nthese great remarks we heard earlier promised it would do. I don't \nthink there is any other person in this body who has personally \nprosecuted an immigration case. But this Senator has. I did that years \nago. I am familiar with the process. I am familiar with the system and \nthe difficulties, including how overwhelmed it has been and why it is \nnot working. The American people were expecting us to fix it.\n  In my opinion, after studying the bill at great length, analyzing it \nin detail, I don't believe it would have worked any better than the \nbill in 1986. So I made up my mind last year and I made up my mind this \nyear that I was not going to support legislation that is not going to \nwork. I was not going to support the 1986 bill. I was not going to vote \nfor a bill that promises amnesty today and law enforcement in the \nfuture, and the amnesty occurs but the law enforcement does not. That \nis the fundamental thing.\n\n  Today, somebody handed me some polling data that sheds a little light \non this weeks events. The article, posted on the Rasmussen Reports \nwebsite is titled ``Support for an immigration bill falls.'' A poll \nconducted Monday and Tuesday night found that 23 percent of voters now \nsupport the bill, while 50 percent are opposed. Two-to-one opposed to \nthe bill.\n  We have heard people say we need to do something, even if it is the \nwrong something or even if it will not work. We have heard the claim \nthat the American people just want us to do something over and over \nagain. That sounds good, I will admit. We certainly do have serious \nproblems with our immigration system.\n  The Rasmussen Report says, however, that ``in the face of public \nopposition, some supporters of the legislation have argued that the \ncompromise may not be perfect, but doing something is better than \nnothing. Voters have a different view--a solid plurality believes it \nwould be better for the country to pass no bill at this time rather \nthan letting the Senate compromise become law.'' And that is why \npeople's phones have been ringing off the hook, because we are given a \nresponsibility to deal with an important issue.\n  I love my colleagues. I tease them a lot. I call the group of them \nthat wrote this bill the masters of the universe. They all met in some \nsecret room somewhere, and they started plotting, working, and trying \nto do the right thing. They met and met and worked and worked, and they \ndecided that they were going to tell America what we needed. They were \ngoing to figure it all out, and just explain to us what the real facts \nwere and how this thing ought to be handled.\n  But, they are a bunch of politicians--good people but still they are \npoliticians. They didn't invite anybody from the Border Patrol into \ntheir meetings to give them advice as to what is actually working on \nthe borders. They didn't invite interior agents from Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement to tell them how to fix the interior immigration \nproblems. They did have, of course, direct and regular contact with big \nbusiness. They had direct and regular contact with special advocacy \ngroups, who had their list of demands. They were actively seeking out \nways to gain the political support of this group and that group because \nthat is what they think legislation is sometimes. But they forgot about \nthe American people.\n  I just want to say that on this bill, the American people watched \nthis process closely. On this bill, the American people kept up with \nit. On this bill, the American people were expecting this Congress to \npass legislation that would significantly and dramatically improve the \ncolossally broken system we have.\n  They didn't expect them to pass a bill that would double illegal \nimmigration. They didn't expect them to be offering to pass a bill that \nwould, according to the Congressional Budget Office just a few days \nago, only reduce illegal immigration by 25 percent. After all of the \nthings they were asking us to accept in this bill, we were only going \nto get a 25-percent reduction in illegal immigration? The American \npeople didn't expect that the deal makers would offer a bill up that \nwould say that after President Bush put the National Guard on the \nborder, somebody who came across the border and ran past the National \nGuard and got into our country before January 1 of this year would be \ngiven amnesty and put on a path to citizenship in this country. That is \nnot principled.\n  How can we ever assert the rule of law in America if we make a \nstatement to the world that the border is closed, we call out the \nNational Guard, and then anybody who runs by there and gets in, we say: \nOK, home free, home free, now you are on a path to citizenship. That is \nnot good.\n  Last year, the bill said that anybody who got in after January 7, \n2004, was not eligible for amnesty. This year, they moved the \nqualifying date to January 1, 2007. Why? I guess it was a political \ndeal. I guess they didn't ask the American people what they thought was \nmoral and just and fair and responsible and compassionate. The deal \nmakers decided that on a political basis it made sense, I suppose. I am \ntold that this is what it was--give here and give there and before you \nknow it you have a bill.\n  I suggested last year that we have a legitimate guest worker program, \nand I was so happy to hear that promises were made this year that we \nwould\n\n[[Page S7322]]\n\nhave one that could actually work. I was excited about that. But as I \nbegan to examine it I didn't believe it would be a practical solution \nthe way it was written.\n  I emphasized last year that people in a temporary worker program \nshould not come for 3 years, as last year's bill did, with their \nfamily, and be able to extend again and again and then be expected to \nleave the country sometime in the future. So this bill was better in \nthat regard, but it still allowed families to come with the person--20 \npercent--and others to come and visit, creating all kinds of \npossibilities for overstays in that regard. That is why the \nCongressional Budget Office projected a very large increase in visa \noverstays as a result of the way this bill was written in that regard.\n  I was very intrigued and excited that my suggestion last year--that \nwe model our legislation on the Canadian system--was being considered. \nThe administration said they liked this merit-based system. They liked \nthe point system. They thought we ought to go more in that direction. \nCanada admits 60 percent of its people through immigration under a \ncompetitive, skill-based system because the Canadians have learned and \nhave proven, if you talk to them, as I have, that persons who come in \nwith any college, with a skill, and with a good work history--and if \nthey speak English or French, they give extra points for that--very \nseldom go on welfare, very seldom take benefits from the government, \nand become properly productive citizens who pay taxes and become good \ncitizens for Canada.\n\n  We have, at this time, only a mere 13 percent of our people coming in \non the basis of their skills. Today, the overwhelming majority come in \nbased on chain migration and family connections. I thought we were \ngoing to make a real move toward the Canadian system with this bill. I \nknow Senator Kyl worked his heart out to try to do that, but when the \nfinal compromise was reached, he couldn't get a better deal than this, \nthat this merit system would really not take effect for 8 years, and \nduring the interim period, there would be a surge of chain migration \nnumbers for 8 years, perhaps triple the current rate. To me, that was a \npolitical compromise too great. That is something I couldn't support.\n  Let me just speak briefly about how we came to the final vote \ntonight. I think the majority leader, Harry Reid, maybe wanted to get \nrid of this bill from the start. He has now begun to say it is \nPresident Bush's bill, but it was the Senate's bill. He called it up \nwithout a committee hearing. It is Senator Reid's bill, if you want to \nknow the truth. He brought it up under rule XIV. It didn't even go to \ncommittee. The majority leader has that power. He called it up directly \nto the floor.\n  Yes, it had bipartisan support, but he was the one who enabled that \nto occur. The new bill was introduced after they called up the old \nbill. Then Reid tried to substitute a completely new bill, and then we \ndebated that with not a great deal of time. For example, I had 20, 30 \namendments filed. I got one amendment up for a vote. I tried to bring \nup a number of other amendments, and every time I have tried to bring \none up, it was objected to. Senator Cornyn, one of the finest, most \ncapable lawyers in the Senate, a former attorney general of Texas and \njustice on the Texas Supreme Court, got one amendment up for a vote. \nSenator Elizabeth Dole, from North Carolina, had an amendment dealing \nwith drunk drivers--an important amendment. She tried to bring hers up, \nand it was objected to. This afternoon, there was only one amendment \npending that actually had been called up and had been introduced, \nfiled, and made pending.\n  So we had this discussion about having some votes this afternoon, and \nthen we were told that we were going to re-vote on cloture tonight. \nWhat I want to say to my colleagues and anybody who is listening is \nthat if cloture had been obtained tonight, after a half dozen more \nvotes, no other amendments would have been pending.\n  So we simply had a little disagreement this afternoon. We said that \nwe wanted to have other amendments pending so that if cloture were \ninvoked, we would have amendments that could be voted on post cloture. \nIn fact, we were working to pare down over 200 amendments that had been \nfiled, to bring in those amendments to under 20 amendments, maybe even \nlower. That is when the majority leader decided to call another cloture \nvote, and that is the vote that failed, I would note, on a bipartisan \nbasis. While 7 Republicans voted for cloture, 12 Democrats voted \nagainst the majority leader and against cloture.\n  We had not had sufficient time to debate this bill. We had not had \nsufficient time to have amendments. It will be almost a thousand pages \nwhen put in bill language. That is not a bill that can be passed in a \ncouple of weeks. It needs more debate than that, and it was never taken \nto committee. The committee did not hear it, and no amendments were \noffered there. It was brought directly to the floor.\n  So I would just say that I think we do have a responsibility to treat \npeople who come to our country, even those who come illegally, \ncompassionately, fairly, justly, and according to good principles. We \nhave a responsibility to create a legal system that works in America. I \nam afraid this bill didn't do it. That is my problem with the bill. I \nthink that the American people agreed. If we come back again, the bill \nneeds to be a vastly improved product. I would be glad to suggest some \nways to make it better. In fact, I have before, and I will again.\n  Madam President, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/07/senate-section/article/S7322-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7322-S7323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING SENATOR CRAIG THOMAS\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise \ntoday to honor the service and memory of my friend, Senator Craig \nThomas of Wyoming. His exemplary service in the Congress over the past \n18 years is a shining example of the good that can be accomplished for \nthe public benefit. A 1955 graduate of the University of Wyoming, \nSenator Craig demonstrated considerable leadership early in his life; \nhe entered the Marine Corps soon after graduation and rose in rank from \nprivate to captain in just 4 years. Following his service, Senator \nThomas returned to Wyoming to make a difference in his native State, \nserving as executive vice president of the Wyoming Farm Bureau and \nlater as general manager of the Wyoming Rural Electric Association. In \n1984, Senator Thomas first entered public service as a State \nrepresentative, was elected to the House of Representatives in 1989, \nand finally ascended to the Senate in 1995.\n  It was my honor to work with Senator Thomas during his Senate career. \nHe was a firm believer in compromise and bipartisanship. This was no \nmore evident than when he and I introduced legislation to protect \ntaxpayer privacy. We worked together on a broad range of issues from \nprotecting consumers to stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons \nto Iran. Senator Thomas and I shared a belief in this body and what it \ncan achieve. I am very saddened by this tremendous loss, but the memory \nof Senator Thomas and his good deeds remind us all of a long, rich life \nthat should be celebrated, and I respectfully request that this \nstatement be entered into the Record.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, Senator Craig Thomas was a wonderful friend \nto all of us. He was an accomplished Senator, and he was a true cowboy. \nIt is that spirit that won't be replaced in the Senate, and it is that \nspirit that I would like to remember today. Craig's record in the \nSenate will reflect his significant accomplishments, and I wish to \nhonor the quality of the man who achieved them.\n  I had a special affinity for Craig. Not only did he and I come to the \nSenate at the same time, we had also served in the House of \nRepresentatives together. Craig came to the House in 1989, 2 years \nafter I did, when he won a special election to replace our current Vice \nPresident, Dick Cheney, who had been made Secretary of Defense.\n  We, of course, were also fellow westerners, and I admired the manner \nin which he embodied the values of the West: the self-reliance, grit, \nand quiet determination of pioneers that shape Americans still today.\n  These values were impressed into Craig as he grew up on a ranch near \nCody, WY. Those values of the American West, instilled by the rugged \nlandscape of Wyoming, would serve him well in the Marine Corps and in \nthe Senate.\n\n[[Page S7323]]\n\n  Craig did not talk a whole lot, but he always meant what he said. He \ncommunicated in a way that didn't require a whole lot of ``jibber-\njabber,'' as he would say. Everyone appreciated this quality in him. \nYou never had any doubt about where Craig stood, something our public \nofficials could learn from today.\n  Craig understood that words and rhetoric easily vanish from our \nmemories. He recognized that honor is not won by keeping up appearances \nbut by working hard and accomplishing what you set out to do. He \nunderstood that the best way to accomplish difficult things was to get \nbusy doing them. To Craig, this was common sense, but oftentimes common \nsense is all too uncommon.\n  In his commonsense manner, he served the people of Wyoming who \noverwhelming elected him to the Senate on three occasions. Craig let \nthe interests of the State guide his work in the Senate. He never let \nhis ego get in the way of doing what was best for Wyoming and the \ncountry.\n  My wife Caryll and I grieve with Craig's wife Susan and their family. \nBut, in our grief, we also celebrate his life. There is much to \ncelebrate not only in Craig's accomplishments--whether on behalf of our \nnational parks, farmers, or rural families, to name only a few of his \nlegislative priorities--but also in his character. He was a humble \nservant for Wyoming who stood up for the people of his State. Even in \nhis illness, he never wavered from his duties as a legislator.\n  The values of the American West are the commonsense values that make \nself-government possible. Craig Thomas, the cowboy and statesman, \nembodied these values that made this country what it is and are needed \nto sustain it in years to come.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I join with my fellow Senators and so many \nin Wyoming and throughout the country in expressing my profound sadness \non the passing of my colleague and good friend, Senator Craig Thomas. I \nalso want to offer my most sincere condolences to his wife Susan, their \nfour children, and the entire Thomas family at this most difficult of \ntimes.\n  Today, we mourn the loss of a true patriot whose love of country and \nloyalty to its principles were always an inspiration and example to us \nall. A U.S. Marine captain, an advocate for rural concerns with the \nWyoming Farm Bureau, American Farm Bureau, and the Wyoming Rural \nElectric Association, and an indefatigable public servant as a Member \nof the Wyoming House of Representatives, the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, and the U.S. Senate--Senator Thomas always placed a \npremium on bettering the lives of the citizens of his state, ensuring \nthat their concerns were not only heard--but were addressed vigorously, \neffectively, and with results.\n  I recall the distinct honor and privilege of serving with Craig for \nmore than 17 years both in the U.S. House and U.S. Senate. Indeed, we \nentered the Senate in the same class of 1994, and I remember with \ntremendous regard our service together on the Senate Foreign Relations \nand Senate Finance Committees. Time and again, regardless of the issue, \nCraig exhibited a stalwart dedication to his country and his \nconstituents--with a steadfast devotion that was ever mindful of the \npublic trust placed in his hands.\n  Senator Thomas was unwavering in his allegiance to the tenets that \nguided his life. True to his core beliefs and unshakable in the values \nhe drew from his beloved Wyoming, Senator Thomas held fast to his \nphilosophy of fiscal conservatism. And yet when he advanced his \narguments, he did so without rancor and with the utmost respect and \ncordiality. He possessed an unyielding decorum that contributed to his \nesteemed presence in the Senate, and he had at his disposal that \nindispensable tool of politics--humor, which he used to great effect \nand at times with incredibly disarming outcomes. Even when we \ndisagreed, he was never disagreeable, rather choosing to give no more \nthan an occasional good-natured ribbing--always with a smile on his \nface.\n  As my colleague Mike Enzi stated in his tribute, Craig Thomas was not \none who necessarily sought the limelight. He lived his life and \ncomported himself in a manner that exemplified the words President \nRonald Reagan displayed on his desk in the Oval Office: ``There's no \nlimit to what a man can do or where he can go if he doesn't mind who \ngets the credit.''

Madam President, on June 8, 1917, the U.S. Army \nofficially organized the First Expeditionary Division. That means \ntomorrow is the 90th anniversary of what is now known as the 1st \nInfantry Division or the ``Big Red One,'' headquartered at Fort Riley, \nKS. The Big Red One has an unsurpassed history of answering the call to \nduty, and it is vital to our Nation's fight against determined enemies. \nWe are fortunate to have these fine soldiers defending our freedom.\n  As the oldest, continuously serving division in the history of the \nU.S. Army, the Big Red One enjoys a long\n\n[[Page S7324]]\n\nand proud tradition of defending America. It also has a tradition of \nbeing the first. During World War II, Big Red One was the first to \nreach England, the first to capture a German city, the first to fight \nin North Africa, and the first on the beaches of Normandy on D-day. It \nwas the first division to deploy to Vietnam and spearheaded the armored \nattack into Iraq at the start of Desert Storm. The Big Red One has a \nlong and proud heritage that we should honor and celebrate.\n  On August 1, 2006, I was proud to welcome the Big Red One's \nheadquarters back to Fort Riley, KS. The division has a vital, new \nmission of training military transition teams for both Iraq and \nAfghanistan. This intense training is meant to prepare our finest \nmilitary members to train their counterparts in the Iraqi and Afghani \nmilitaries. We honor those soldiers who have committed to this mission. \nI also want to recognize the 1st Division soldiers operating today in \nsome of Baghdad's toughest neighborhoods. They too take their place in \nthe Big Red One's proud history.\n  On this 90th anniversary, June 8, 2007, I salute the men and women of \nthe U.S. Army 1st Infantry Division, the Big Red One. The enormous \nsacrifice and dedication of these heroic men and women should make all \nAmericans proud. As they say in the 1st Division: ``No mission too \ndifficult, no sacrifice too great. Duty first.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/07/senate-section/article/S7324-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         U.S.-RUSSIA RELATIONS\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I rise today to acknowledge \nthe United States' crucial relationship with Russia. The fate of U.S.-\nRussia relations rests on key agreements regarding security, trade, and \nenergy policies.\n  The annual G8 Summit taking place this week in Germany comes at a \ncrucial time in our relationship with Russia, a key international \ntrade, military, and security partner to the United States.\n  For decades after World War II, our military and national security \npolicies focused mostly on the Soviet Union. At that time, both nations \npursued a foreign policy dubbed ``Mutually Assured Destruction.''\n  In the early 1990s, with the support of the United States, new \nRussian leaders began instituting democratic reforms. As the political \nlandscape in the Soviet Union improved, so did our relationship with \nRussia. Instead of destruction, our countries have pursued cooperation, \nthough the Russians still have work to do on human rights. Certainly, \nrecent actions by the Russian Government to limit freedoms, crack down \non journalists, and inflict economic damage on its neighbors are cause \nfor concern for the United States. Some of these concerns can and \nshould be addressed through engagement and diplomacy with Russia.\n  Recently, relations between the United States and Russia have become \nstrained, with the rhetoric between the nations exacerbating the \nproblem. As the G8 meetings commence, it is imperative that the U.S. \nGovernment engage Russia on the vital security, trade, and energy \npolicies important to both nations.\n  Last week, as cochairman of the U.S. Senate-Russia interparliamentary \nworking group, I held 3 days of meetings in Moscow with legislators and \ntop Russian officials, including Russian Foreign Minister Sergey \nLavrov, to discuss our mutual economic and security interests.\n  The Russians were united on key matters. First, they question U.S. \nintent with regard to deployment of missile and radar systems in Poland \nand the Czech Republic. Second, they would prefer an extended timetable \non independence for Kosovo. They also identified vital security matters \nwhere they and we Americans can work together, specifically, halting \nIran's nuclear program and the spread of global terrorism. While we may \nhave disagreed on the appropriate manner in which to address the \nemerging threat of Iran's nuclear program and the amount of time in \nwhich we have to do so, Russian officials were clear that, like me, \nthey believe Iran's ultimate goal in developing nuclear power is to \nproduce a nuclear weapon.\n  Our delegation's message to the Russians was clear as well: we can \nwork out differences over missile defense, Kosovo and other issues, but \nthe Russians need to step up and assist the global community with Iran \nand terrorism in Iraq. Cooperation is critical to the success of our \nrelationship.\n  In addition, Russia has tremendous economic potential. They have \nregistered 5 percent or better economic growth in each year since 1999 \nand 6.7 percent in 2006. Personal income grew 10 percent in 2006. \nHowever, this growth has impacted mostly urban areas such as Moscow or \nSt. Petersburg, and more needs to be done to improve economic \nconditions in rural areas.\n  U.S. exports to Russia for the first 11 months of 2006 totaled $7.8 \nbillion. U.S. foreign direct investment in Russia in 2005 was $5.5 \nbillion, up from $3.8 billion in 2004. Russians are buying American \nproducts and services--it seemed that every fifth car in Moscow was a \nFord. But we can do better by helping to raise the standard of living \nin Russia to advance democratic reforms.\n  Russia is now working to join the World Trade Organization, WTO. The \nUnited States maintains an obscure trade law, known in Washington-speak \nas ``Jackson-Vanik,'' that would limit U.S. business trade and \ninvestment in WTO-member Russia because the law prevents normalized \ntrade relations between the two countries. While the original intent of \nthis trade law was admirable, it is now widely believed to be \nantiquated and remains only as yet another Cold War relic, this time \nhindering future progress in opening permanent normal trade relations \nbetween Russia and the United States. If Jackson-Vanik remains in \nplace, Russian businesses would not suffer alone upon Russia's \naccession to the WTO; U.S. businesses would also suffer while \nbusinesses from around the globe prosper in Russia's increasingly \nvaluable markets. Congress needs to ``graduate'' Russia from this trade \nprovision so U.S. firms can compete with foreign firms on the \neconomically fertile ground in Russia.\n  Finally, as with other allies, important and controversial matters \nbetween the United States and Russia will continue to arise. Energy \nproduction and supply, for example, is an important national security \nmatter for the United States and its allies. Russia's state-controlled \nenergy company, Gazprom, is building an intricate pipeline system which \nwill control natural gas flow to European countries. It currently \nsupplies about 25 percent of Europe's natural gas, with higher \npercentages to some former Soviet European states. About 40 percent of \ncrude oil exports move to Europe through a pipeline system. They plan \nto expand to North America. Russia has already exploited the dependence \nof Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus, and Georgia on its energy resources. \nWithout cooperation and understanding between our countries, this \nsystem could leave the United States vulnerable in the future to gas \nsupplies controlled by the Russians.\n  Mikhail Margelov, my Russian counterpart in the working group, said \nthat the U.S.-Russia alliance must be strong for the future of both \ncountries. He is right. Collaboration can bring about change for the \ngood. Negotiation can resolve conflicts. Strong relations can solidify \nRussia's democracy.\n  The administration should use the G8 Summit as an opportunity to \nengage Russia on these key security, trade and energy policy matters. \nIt is in the national security interests of the United States to have a \nstrong relationship with a democratic Russia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/07/senate-section/article/S7324-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7324-S7325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       TRIBUTE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN SURVIVAL FLIGHT TEAM\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I wish today to pay tribute to the six \nmembers of the University of Michigan Survival Flight team who perished \nthis past Monday when their plane tragically crashed into Lake Michigan \nduring an organ transplant mission. On behalf of the people of \nMichigan, I would like to extend my deepest condolences to the victims' \nfamilies. These brave men put their lives on the line to save the lives \nof those in need of urgent medical care. They touched countless \nfamilies through their work and the goodness of their hearts and stand \nas examples to all of us as modern-day Good Samaritans.\n  Richard Chenault II, 44, from Ann Arbor, was hoping to get back to \nMichigan on time Monday to attend\n\n[[Page S7325]]\n\nthe Father Gabriel Richard High School sports banquet. He was being \nhonored for coach of the year in both girls track and girls cross-\ncountry. He never made it but is remembered by the students and faculty \nat the school as a mentor, teacher, and friend.\n  Richard LaPensee, of Ypsilanti, fought fires for 18 years while \nserving as an emergency medical technician. He immediately jumped at \nthe chance to work as a University of Michigan life flight medical \ntechnician 3 years ago. On Monday morning, Richard had just finished a \n24-hour firefighter shift before embarking on the transplant flight.\n  Dr. David Ashburn, 35, of Dexter, was a cardiac surgery resident at \nthe University of Michigan. He was looking to begin his pediatric \ncardiac surgery fellowship in July. Dr. Ashburn was a dedicated family \nman who enjoyed turkey hunting in the wilderness of Michigan.\n  Dr. Martinus Spoor, 37, of Ann Arbor, was a regular when it came to \nthe air transplant business, making roughly 10 flights a year. Dr. \nSpoor was known by his friends and family as a ``gentle and kind human \nbeing'' and taught heart valve repair techniques to medical students.\n  Dennis Hoyes, 65, of Blackman Township, was a man who loved to fly. A \nretired small business owner, Dennis would often spend his days at the \nJackson County Airport and worked as an adjunct flight instructor for \nJackson Community College's aviation program. Dennis would always give \na free lesson to anyone who asked.\n  Bill Serra, 59, of Macomb Township, had over 12,000 hours of flight \ntime from small planes to 747s. During the Persian Gulf war, Bill \nworked as a civilian pilot delivering material and ammunition to U.S. \nforces. The Air Force honored Bill in 1993 for his dedicated service.\n  Our State of Michigan lost real heroes Monday--heroes who gave back \nto their communities without fanfare or personal gain, heroes who did \ntheir dangerous work out of passion, dedication, and a desire to make \nthe world a better place.\n  Unfortunately, we often take these heroes for granted, forgetting \nthat their dedication to service comes at life-threatening risk.\n  The stories of these six men serve as a proud reminder that all of us \ncan give back, that all of us can contribute, and that there are heroes \nall around us in our communities, our families, and our States. \nMichigan can never express how proud we are of these individuals' \nservice, and the Michigan family joins the Chenaults, the LaPensees, \nthe Ashburns, the Spoors, the Hoyes, and the Serras in mourning the \npassing of these brave men.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/07/senate-section/article/S7325-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   2007 WE THE PEOPLE NATIONAL FINALS\n\n Mr. DODD. Madam President, this April, more than 1,200 \nstudents from across the country visited Washington, DC, to take part \nin the national finals of We the People: The Citizen and the \nConstitution, an educational program developed to educate young people \nabout the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights. Administered by the \nCenter for Civic Education, the We the People program is funded by the \nU.S. Department of Education by act of Congress.\n  I am proud to announce that a class from Trumbull High School of \nTrumbull, CT, received an Honorable Mention Award at this prestigious \nnational event. Seven Honorable Mention Awards were presented to \nschools placing 4th through 10th on the final day of competition. These \noutstanding students, through their knowledge of the U.S. Constitution, \nwon their statewide competition and earned the chance to come to our \nNation's Capitol and compete at the national level.\n  While in Washington, the students participated in a 3-day academic \ncompetition that simulates a congressional hearing in which they \n``testify'' before a panel of judges. Students demonstrate their \nknowledge and understanding of constitutional principles as they \nevaluate, take, and defend positions on relevant historical and \ncontemporary issues.\n  I am also pleased to note that the We the People curriculum is \naligned with the National Standards for Civics and Government and \ncorrelates with the social studies standards of many states.\n  The names of these outstanding students from Trumbull High School \nare: Alexa Alexander, Akanksha Bajaj, Rebecca Chadwick, Chelsea Clyde, \nAshley Cohen, Shane Connolly, Victoria Costello, Mulan Cui, Megan \nDenstedt, Jackson Dolan, Adam Drenkard, Mike Finik, George Fitzpatrick, \nCasey Gardiner, Blake Ludwig, Alex Mosello, Elisa Odoardi, Alison \nOrnitz, Matt Pankracij, Mary Santella, Jaclyn Siegel, Matt Socha, \nEdward Tillistrand, and Stephen Wagner.\n  I also wish to commend the teacher of the class, Mike Margonis, who \nis responsible for preparing these young constitutional experts for the \nnational finals.

Mr. President, today I would like to express my \ndeep appreciation to Peggy Whitworth, executive director of Iowa's only \nnational trust property, Brucemore. Brucemore, located in Cedar Rapids, \nIA, is celebrating its 25th anniversary, and Peggy has been Brucemore's \nonly executive director during that quarter century. During this time, \nher leadership, creativity, and ``can-do'' attitude have made Brucemore \na model nonprofit organization and an eastern Iowa landmark.\n  This past December, Peggy was awarded the National Trust President's \nAward for her years of dedicated service to Brucemore, as well as for \nher advocacy of preservation. I would like to add my voice to those \nhonoring Peggy and her work. She is respected not just in Iowa but \nacross the country as a champion for preservation and the promotion of \ncultural attractions. Her labors on behalf of historical preservation \nhave helped inspire people in other communities to preserve and honor \nthe important architectural, cultural and historic contributions from \nour past.\n  Twenty five years ago, when Brucemore was bequeathed to the National \nTrust for Historic Preservation, the idea was to use the mansion for \ncommunity meetings and activities. That limited perspective did not \nlast long. Under Peggy's leadership, Brucemore has come to offer a full \nschedule of events, including Bluesmore, Classics at Brucemore, Cabaret \nin the Courtyard, as well as tours of the mansion which draw nearly \n30,000 people annually.\n  Peggy has also been active in promoting culture and tourism \nattractions as an economic development tool. In addition to her work at \nBrucemore, Peggy has served five terms on the Iowa State Historical \nSociety board, including chairing the board. She serves on the Terrace \nHill Foundation. And she was recently appointed to the Board of \nPharmacy Examiners by Iowa Governor Chet Culver.\n  Peggy Whitworth is planning to retire later this year. Her leadership \nand vision will be greatly missed.

Madam President, today I wish to \nrecognize a man who died in the service of his country 64 years ago but \nnever received the proper recognition he was due.\n  Harold George Danley was one of four brothers from Lincoln, NE, who \njoined the armed services during World War II. Three of those brothers \nreturned home to their families; Sergeant Danley, who was 22 years old, \ndid not.\n  Sergeant Danley was serving in the 18th Army/Air Force Anti-Submarine \nSquadron aboard a B-24D Bomber, which crashed while patrolling the east \ncoast of the United States somewhere\n\n[[Page S7326]]\n\nnear the Virginia/North Carolina shoreline on April 21, 1943. Despite \nthe efforts of search parties, his body was never recovered; therefore, \nno memorial service was ever performed on his behalf. It was some time \nlater that the family was notified that Sergeant Danley was officially \nlisted as FOD, ``Finding of Death.''\n  Sergeant Danley left behind his wife Thelma; his daughter Merriam, \nwho was born several months after her father's death; his father \nHarrison, and stepmother Anna; three brothers, Lieutenant Colonel Earl \nE. Danley, Sergeant Bob E. Danley and Sergeant Lloyd K. Danley, now \ndeceased; and three half-siblings, Marvin, Delores and Betty. His \nmother Ella preceded him in death.\n  On May 18, 2007, a memorial service was held at Arlington National \nCemetery to honor Harold G. Danley as a son, brother, husband, and \nfather, as well as a man who made the ultimate sacrifice in the service \nof his country.

SMITH\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I wish to remember the life of \nMark C. Smith, who was one of the most resourceful and brilliant \nentrepreneurs in the history of the State of Alabama. His departing \nthis life on March 27, 2007, leaves an irreplaceable loss for his \nfamily, his home town of Huntsville, the State of Alabama, and the \nNation. Few men in the history of America's free enterprise system have \nattained such lofty heights in business as Mark Smith. Starting with \nvery little and coming from humble family beginnings, Smith invented, \ndesigned, and managed companies under his ownership and tutelage to \nheights that draw the envy of the corporate world.\n  Mark was raised in Birmingham, graduating in 1958 from Woodlawn High \nSchool. He was the son of parents who were both teachers. During high \nschool, Smith became a ham radio buff and developed an interest in \nscience. Upon winning first place in a science fair at Woodlawn, \nSmith's prize was a handshake from Dr. Von Braun. The young high school \ngraduate saw this as a grand opportunity and boldly asked Dr. Von Braun \nfor a summer job. Smith went on to attend the Georgia Institute of \nTechnology, and over the next three summers he worked at NASA in \nHuntsville and Cape Canaveral.\n  During the summer preceding his last year of college, he was employed \nwith SCI Systems, Inc., and upon earning an electrical engineering \ndegree from Georgia Tech in 1962, he began full-time employment with \nSCI as an engineering manager. In 1969 his entrepreneurial spirit took \nhold, and he left SCI to cofound Universal Data Systems, UDS--out of \nhis home garage and with $30,000 in savings. UDS, the first data \ncommunications company in Alabama, was quite successful and in 1979, \nwith annual revenues of about $20 million, was sold to Motorola. At \nthat time, Smith became president of the UDS-Motorola Division. In \n1985, the proven visionary was ready to take on yet another challenge; \nhe left UDS and cofounded ADTRAN, Inc. As CEO and chairman, Smith led \nthe startup company of seven employees to become a publicly traded \ncompany in 1994, the same year ADTRAN announced a $50 million expansion \nof its facility. Today, with more than 1,600 employees and annual \nrevenues approaching $500 million, the company is a worldwide leader in \nproviding high-speed network access products to the telecommunications \nequipment industry.\n  Mark did not live to see the ultimate heights that the electronic \ncommunication industry will attain in the future. Entrepreneurs and \nengineers will someday produce faster and better equipment, but when \nthey do they will use as a pattern some of Mark Smith's ideas, \ninventions, and procedures.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/07/senate-section/article/S7326-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:58 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 361.

and\n       Whereas, it has been twenty months since the hurricanes \n     passed through the area; and\n       Whereas, much-needed repairs to the flood protection \n     systems include the need for temporary pumping capacity, \n     sediment removal from all canals, storm-proofing pump \n     stations, raising the Caernarvon to Verret levee to its \n     authorized height, raising the Bayou Bienvenue to the Inner \n     Harbor Navigation Canal levee and floodwall, and completion \n     of the design and construction of permanent pump stations to \n     replace those ruined by the hurricanes; and\n       Whereas, the Lake Borgne Levee District cannot provide \n     adequate flood protection to the citizens of St. Bernard \n     Parish until repairs to the levee system are complete; and\n       Whereas, delays have been caused by a lack of cooperation \n     between several key federal agencies, including the United \n     States Army Corps of Engineers, National Resources \n     Conservation Service, Federal Emergency Management Agency, \n     and the Department of Homeland Security; and\n       Whereas, congress must intervene on behalf of the citizens \n     of Louisiana to finish these key hurricane flood protection \n     projects; and\n       Whereas, the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet (MRGO) is a \n     seventy-six-mile-long, man-made navigational channel which \n     connects the Gulf of Mexico to the Port of New Orleans; and\n       Whereas, since MRGO was completed, the United States Army \n     Corps of Engineers estimates that the area has lost nearly \n     three thousand two hundred acres of fresh and intermediate \n     marsh, more than ten thousand three hundred acres of brackish \n     marsh, four thousand two hundred acres of saline marsh, and \n     one thousand five hundred acres of cypress swamp and levee \n     forest in addition to major habitat alterations due to \n     saltwater intrusion; and\n       Whereas, the dramatic loss of coastal wetlands and marshes \n     caused by MRGO exposed St. Bernard Parish to much more severe \n     impacts from the hurricanes and tropical storms that \n     regularly occur in the Gulf of Mexico; and\n       Whereas, those concerns proved true in an extremely \n     dramatic fashion on August 29, 2005, when Hurricane Katrina \n     struck Louisiana's coast with a tidal surge well in excess of \n     twenty feet; and\n       Whereas, there is a growing consensus that the flooding \n     that occurred in St. Bernard Parish, New Orleans East, and \n     the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans was a result of storm \n     surge that flowed up MRGO to the point where it converges \n     with the Intracoastal Waterway and that the confluence \n     created a funnel that directed the storm surge into the New \n     Orleans Industrial Canal, where it overtopped the levees \n     along MRGO and the Industrial Canal and eventually breached \n     the levees and flooded into the neighborhoods that lie close \n     to those three waterways, resulting in more than eleven \n     hundred deaths in the Greater New Orleans area, including one \n     hundred twenty-eight deaths in St. Bernard Parish, destroying \n     over twenty-four thousand homes, and rendering more than \n     sixty-seven thousand residents of St. Bernard Parish and \n     uncounted numbers in New Orleans East and the Lower Ninth \n     Ward of New Orleans homeless, without possessions, and \n     unemployed; and\n       Whereas, in addition to destroying homes, the floodwaters \n     washed away churches and other places of worship, schools, \n     businesses, community centers, recreational facilities,\n\n[[Page S7329]]\n\n     and utility and transportation infrastructure; and\n       Whereas, as the only entity which can authorize the \n     waterway to be closed and which can enable the \n     reestablishment of our essential coastal wetlands, the United \n     States Congress must come to the aid of the citizens of \n     Louisiana, particularly those of St. Bernard Parish by \n     authorizing the immediate closure of MRGO: Therefore, be it,\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to expedite the repair and rebuilding of the \n     St. Bernard Parish levee system by all appropriate federal \n     agencies and to immediately close the Mississippi River Gulf \n     Outlet; and Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-103. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Montana opposing, among other things, any effort \n     to implement a trinational political, governmental entity \n     among the United States, Canada, and Mexico; to the Committee \n     on Foreign Relations.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution No. 25\n\n       Whereas, the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North \n     America was launched in March of 2005 as a trilateral effort \n     among the United States, Canada, and Mexico to share \n     information and streamline traffic across shared borders; and\n       Whereas, in meeting Security and Prosperity Partnership \n     initiatives, the security and prosperity ministers are \n     examining opportunities to open the borders between the \n     United States, Canada, and Mexico; and\n       Whereas, the gradual creation of such a North American \n     Union from a merger of the United States, Mexico, and Canada \n     would be a direct threat to the Constitution and national \n     independence of the United States and imply an eventual end \n     to national borders within North America; and\n       Whereas, according to the Department of Commerce, United \n     States trade deficits with Mexico and, Canada have \n     significantly widened since the implementation of the North \n     American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA); and\n       Whereas, the economic and physical security of the United \n     States is impaired by the potential loss of control of its \n     borders attendant to the full operation of NAFTA; and\n       Whereas, a NAFTA Superhighway System from the west coast of \n     Mexico through the United States and into Canada has been \n     suggested as part of a North American Union and the broader \n     plan to advance the Security and Prosperity Partnership; and\n       Whereas, it would be particularly difficult for Americans \n     to collect insurance from Mexican companies that employ \n     Mexican drivers involved in accidents in the United States, \n     which would increase the insurance rates for American \n     drivers; and\n       Whereas, future unrestricted foreign trucking into the \n     United States can pose a safety hazard due to inadequate \n     maintenance and inspection and can act collaterally as a \n     conduit for the entry into the United States of illegal \n     drugs, illegal human smuggling, and terrorist activities; and\n       Whereas, a NAFTA Superhighway System would be funded by \n     foreign consortiums and controlled by foreign management, \n     which threatens the sovereignty of the United States; and\n       Whereas, the Security and Prosperity Partnership aims to \n     integrate United States laws with Mexico and Canada on a \n     broad range of issues such as e-commerce, transportation, \n     environment, health, agriculture, financial services, and \n     national security, which may lead to negative changes in \n     United States administrative laws; and\n       Whereas, state and local governments throughout the United \n     States would be negatively impacted by the Security and \n     Prosperity Partnership or a North American Union process, \n     such as an open borders vision, eminent domain takings of \n     private property along potential superhighways, and increased \n     law enforcement problems along such superhighways; and\n       Whereas, this trilateral partnership to develop a North \n     American Union has never been presented to Congress as an \n     agreement or treaty and has had virtually no congressional \n     oversight; and\n       Whereas, initiatives advancing the Security and Prosperity \n     Partnership will lead to the erosion of United States \n     sovereignty and could lead to integrated continental court \n     systems and currency; and\n       Whereas, United States policy, not foreign consortiums, \n     should be used to control our national borders and to ensure \n     that national security is not compromised; Now, Therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, by the Senate and the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Montana:\n       That the Montana Legislature urge the President and the \n     Congress of the United States to withdraw the United States \n     from any further participation in the Security and Prosperity \n     Partnership, any efforts to implement a trinational \n     political, governmental entity among the United States, \n     Canada, and Mexico, or any other efforts used to accomplish \n     any form of a North American Union System; and be it further\n       Resolved, that copies of this resolution be sent by the \n     Secretary of State to the Honorable George W. Bush, President \n     of the United States, the Vice President of the United \n     States, the United States Secretary of Commerce, and each \n     member of the United States Congress.\n       POM-104. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Hawaii urging Congress to support legislation \n     authorizing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \n     negotiate lower drug prices on behalf of Medicare \n     beneficiaries; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \n     and Pensions.\n       Whereas, data provided by AARP Hawaii shows that half of \n     all people in Hawaii, particularly those ages 50 and older \n     and those with lower incomes, are concerned about being able \n     to afford prescription drugs; and\n       Whereas, slightly over half of Hawaii's residents who are \n     taking prescription medication on a regular basis say that \n     paying for their drugs presents a financial burden; and\n       Whereas, nearly one-third of our residents who regularly \n     take prescription drugs report taking at least one \n     significant cost-reducing measure to pay for their \n     medication; and\n       Whereas, the United States Congress has the opportunity to \n     help reduce the cost of prescription drugs for Hawaii's \n     155,000 enrolled Medicare Part D beneficiaries by \n     strengthening the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) \n     through supporting legislation to give the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services the authority to use the bargaining \n     power of 43 million Medicare beneficiaries to help make \n     prescription drugs more affordable; and\n       Whereas, Hawaii families are counting on Congress to do \n     everything possible to help make prescription drugs more \n     affordable and accessible to beneficiaries under the MMA; \n     now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     fourth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of \n     2007, the Senate concurring, that the Legislature urges the \n     United States Congress to support legislation authorizing the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate lower \n     drug prices on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, that certified copies of this Concurrent \n     Resolution be transmitted to the President of the United \n     States, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and \n     the members of Hawaii's Congressional Delegation.\n       POM-105. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Hawaii urging Congress to propose amendments \n     to the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001; to the Committee on \n     Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 57\n\n       Whereas, the United States Congress must decide in 2007 \n     whether to reauthorize the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 \n     or let it die and replace it with a new law; and\n       Whereas, the No Child Left Behind Act, unprecedented in the \n     history of federal and state roles in public education by the \n     mandated imposition of a federally prescribed, single \n     accountability model for all public schools, undermines the \n     established constitutional role of state and local public \n     education governance; and\n       Whereas, the No Child Left Behind Act, while purporting to \n     create an accountability system for public schools, has in \n     reality, been an enormous financial and programmatic burden \n     on schools and taxpayers; and\n       Whereas, even if states and schools are satisfied with \n     their educational programs and outcomes, they are forced to \n     participate in this top-down system in order to continue to \n     receive federal funds for education, such as Title I funds; \n     and\n       Whereas, the No Child Left Behind Act mandates consequences \n     to schools if just one of thirty-seven possible adequate \n     yearly progress calculation outcomes are not met, and makes \n     no distinction in the consequences imposed on schools that \n     did not meet one or did not meet all thirty-seven, resulting \n     in dilution of energy, time, and money by mandating the \n     treatment of all such schools to include identical sanctions; \n     and\n       Whereas, the No Child Left Behind Act employs a view of \n     motivation that is misguided and objectionable, using \n     threats, punishments, and pernicious comparisons to \n     ``motivate'' teachers, students, and schools; and\n       Whereas, private K-12 schools have chosen not to spend \n     their time or money adopting key elements of the, No Child \n     Left Behind Act's intensive testing and accountability \n     regimen; and\n       Whereas, the No Child Left Behind Act's narrow focus on the \n     ``basics'' has discouraged the implementation of best \n     practices cutting edge educational research in order to \n     achieve higher test scores; and\n       Whereas, the No Child Left Behind Act has driven many \n     schools and school systems into a narrowing of curriculum, \n     often focused on only tested subjects, to the detriment of \n     subjects and rich educational experiences, such as the arts; \n     and\n       Whereas, the goal of achieving percent proficiency, \n     including special education students, is unrealistic, and the \n     pursuit of which channels millions of dollars into tactically \n     targeted programs that divert limited resources from other \n     critical school programs, professional, training, as well as \n     the educational and physical environment of schools; and\n       Whereas, the requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act \n     penalize schools who enroll\n\n[[Page S7330]]\n\n     students who have inherent educational deficiencies and, who \n     as a group, will continue to remain below ever increasing No \n     Child Left Behind ``annual measurable objectives''; and\n       Whereas, while there has recently been some interest in the \n     development of so-called ``growth models'' to recognize the \n     contributions of a school to individual students over time, \n     the lack of adequate funding and the prohibition against \n     states developing their own growth models has rendered this \n     initiative almost meaningless; and\n       Whereas, the No Child Left Behind Act does not provide \n     additional funds for teacher education or training, if school \n     is in ``status'' or under, restructuring, which creates a \n     punitive environment with little commitment on the part of \n     the federal government for improving teaching and learning, \n     or for supporting increased school success; and\n       Whereas, Adequate Yearly Progress does not take into \n     account a school's adoption of meaningful educational \n     innovation or judicious use of research; and\n       Whereas, the No Child Left Behind Act has channeled \n     countless dollars into high-stake testing, which has largely \n     benefited national private testing companies, but at the \n     expense of ignoring genuine student accomplishments; and\n       Whereas, the No Child Left Behind Act appears biased \n     towards a one-size fits all multiple choice testing system, \n     and tends to ignore other means of engaging and assessing \n     students such as project-based, hands-on, or problem-solving \n     demonstrations of competency: and\n       Whereas, the United States Department of Education has \n     shown little or no interest in creating incentives among \n     colleges and universities to incorporate innovative \n     portfolios or project-based competencies into their \n     admissions decisions, thus reinforcing the use of high-stake, \n     multiple-choice private contractors; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Twenty-fourth Legislature of \n     the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2007, the House of \n     Representatives concurring, that the United States Congress \n     is strongly urged to proposed specific amendments to, or \n     recommend the repeal of, the federal No Child Left Behind Act \n     of 2001; and be it further\n       Resolved, that among the issues and amendments the United \n     States Congress should address are the following:\n       (1) Improving teacher quality, preparation, and training \n     by:\n       (A) Building support for a comprehensive incentive program \n     to recruit, place, and retain experienced, well-qualified \n     teachers in high-need schools (e.g., high poverty, or \n     geographically-isolated communities);\n       (B) Providing significant support for teacher education, \n     professional development, in-service training, and career \n     opportunities;\n       (C) Improving the occupational status and compensation of \n     teaching as a career;\n       (D) Improving qualifications of teacher candidates at \n     colleges of education;\n       (E) Providing financial incentives for institutions of \n     higher learning to incorporate portfolios and demonstrations \n     of competency into their admissions decisions;\n       (F) Strengthening teacher education preparation programs in \n     areas such as science, mathematics, technology, measurement, \n     data analysis, and evaluation;\n       (G) Recognizing teachers having achieved certification by \n     the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards as \n     ``highly qualified'' in their respective fields; and\n       (H) Providing flexibility in recognizing certified \n     secondary level special education teachers as qualified \n     teachers in their own right, and removing the unrealistic \n     expectation that such teachers be additionally certified in \n     every single core subject area;\n       (2) Improving assessment measures and systems by:\n       (A) Refining student assessment instruments designed \n     specifically for use in improving instruction as well as \n     school accountability;\n       (B) Encouraging states and school districts to utilize a \n     wider range of useful assessments, including project-based \n     competency and portfolios;\n       (C) Developing more appropriate means of assessing the \n     academic progress of English Language Learners, special \n     education students; and those with behavioral health issues; \n     and\n       (D) Supporting the development and implementation of \n     comprehensive statewide data collection and exchange systems \n     that allow for more efficient support for student record \n     keeping and informed educational policy decision making \n     (e.g., electronic student transcript systems, and \n     longitudinal analyses of growth in academic achievement);\n       (3) Improving accountability models, indicators of \n     performance, and consequences by:\n       (A) Supporting states and the educational research \n     community in research and development efforts to further the \n     pioneering work required in refining the technology \n     underlying growth (toward standards) analysis models;\n       (B) Permitting each state to adopt and pilot its own growth \n     model to calculate adequate yearly progress under the No \n     Child Left Behind Act to take advantage of inherent benefits \n     that motivate students at all levels of proficiency;\n       (C) Supporting wholesale changes to the ``adequate yearly \n     progress'' model for educational accountability that would \n     provide for a fairer and more balanced appraisal of school \n     performance and quality;\n       (D) Replacing punitive, conjunctive ``miss one miss all'' \n     criteria;\n       (E) Expanding accountability indicators to reflect \n     performance on standards in other important disciplines and \n     countering unintended consequences such as a narrowing of \n     curriculum;\n       (F) Allowing for current limitations in reliable and valid \n     assessments of students within a wide range of disability \n     classifications; and\n       (G) Allowing for deferrals to test new immigrant students \n     with limited English proficiency for up to three years of \n     entering the country;\n       (4) Augmenting resources to assist states in efforts to \n     accomplish challenging educational initiatives by:\n       (A) Requiring schools to maintain a broad and comprehensive \n     curriculum to support adopted content and performance \n     standards, including the arts and physical education;\n       (B) Fully funding special education programs, as once \n     promised;\n       (C) Providing adequate funding to research and develop \n     multiple and more valid means of assessing student \n     competence, skills and knowledge for use in both improvement \n     and educational accountability; and\n       (D) Providing funding and training support for data and \n     technology infrastructure requirements;\n       (5) Supporting innovation, capacity building, and \n     flexibility to address state and local education needs by:\n       (A) Recognizing schools that demonstrate successful \n     strategies using innovative curriculum and methodologies;\n       (B) Developing new initiatives for school facilities that \n     do not push educational funding toward ever larger schools \n     and economy-of-scale construction mentality;\n       (C) Avoiding simplistic ``one size fits all'' solutions for \n     assessment, accountability, and intervention;\n       (D) Addressing unique needs of ``high-need'' schools (e.g:, \n     high poverty, high immigration, extreme geographic \n     isolation); and\n       (E) Allowing states to determine which and how many grade \n     levels are best to test; and\n       (6) Returning to the original intent and purpose of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) by:\n       (A) Restoring the foundational precepts of ESEA and its \n     focus on equity in educational attainment despite \n     disadvantages stemming from socio-economic background;\n       (B) Allowing states to ``opt out'' of requirements that \n     impact schools that do not receive ESEA entitlements, without \n     loss of Federal funds;\n       (C) Promoting strategies that directly reduce achievement \n     gaps through better instruction, such as incentives for \n     experienced, well-qualified teachers to accept positions in \n     high-need schools and for reducing class size;\n       (D) Resolving to build the best public education system and \n     teacher work force in the world, rather than promoting lofty \n     rhetoric and ploys that undermine and divert public funds to \n     private schools; and\n       (E) Returning policy setting and curriculum and teaching \n     decision making control back to states, school districts and \n     local communities; and be it further\n       Resolved that certified copies of this Concurrent \n     Resolution be transmitted to the President of the United \n     States, the Vice President of the United States, the \n     President pro tempore of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and the \n     members of Hawaii's Congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-106. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Pennsylvania urging Congress to enact legislation to provide \n     additional funding for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis \n     research; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n     Pensions.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 115\n\n       Whereas, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is better \n     known as Lou Gehrig's disease; and\n       Whereas, ALS is a fatal neurodegenerative disease \n     characterized by degeneration of cell bodies of the lower \n     motor neurons in the gray matter of the anterior horns of the \n     spinal cord; and\n       Whereas, The initial symptom of ALS is weakness of the \n     skeletal muscles, especially those of the extremities; and\n       Whereas, As ALS progresses, the patient experiences \n     difficulty in swallowing, talking and breathing; and\n       Whereas, ALS eventually causes muscles to atrophy, and the \n     patient becomes a functional quadriplegic; and\n       Whereas, Because ALS does not affect mental capacity, \n     persons with ALS remain alert and aware of the loss of motor \n     function and the inevitable outcome of continued \n     deterioration and death; and\n       Whereas, ALS occurs in adulthood, most commonly between the \n     ages of 40 and 70, with the peak age about 55; and\n       Whereas, ALS affects men two to three times more often than \n     women; and\n       Whereas, More than 5,000 new ALS patients are diagnosed \n     annually; and\n       Whereas, On average, patients diagnosed with ALS survive \n     only two to five years from the time of diagnosis; and\n       Whereas, Research indicates that military veterans are at a \n     50% or greater risk of developing ALS than other persons; and\n       Whereas, ALS has no known cause, means of prevention or \n     cure; and\n       Whereas, ``Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Awareness Month'' \n     increases public awareness of ALS patients' circumstances, \n     acknowledges the terrible impact of ALS on patients and their \n     families and recognizes ongoing research to eradicate ALS; \n     therefore be it\n\n[[Page S7331]]\n\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania recognize the month of May 2007 as ``Amyotrophic \n     Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Awareness Month'' in the Commonwealth \n     of Pennsylvania; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Senate urge the President and Congress \n     of the United States to enact legislation to provide \n     additional funding for ALS research; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, to the Vice President of \n     the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the members of Congress from Pennsylvania \n     and to the United States Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-107.

Sec. 1400 et seq.) \n     encroached upon the states' traditional domain over education \n     and established certain mandates that all state and local \n     governments must observe in the education of children with \n     special needs; and\n       Whereas, In recognition of the high cost of these Federal \n     mandates, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n     allows the Congress to provide each state with a maximum \n     Federal grant equal to the number of children with \n     disabilities in the state multiplied by 40% of the average \n     per pupil expenditure for all special education students in \n     the United States; and\n       Whereas, Although the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has \n     endeavored to serve its students with special needs by \n     implementing the costly mandates imposed by the Individuals \n     with Disabilities Education Act, the Federal Government has \n     not provided sufficient funding to pay for these mandates; \n     and\n       Whereas, The Federal funding the Commonwealth receives for \n     each student with special needs is only the equivalent of \n     14.8% of the national average per pupil expenditure; and\n       Whereas, By this measure, the Federal Government \n     contributes only 37% of the total cost of special education \n     in this Commonwealth even though the Commonwealth and its \n     school districts must comply with 100% of the costly mandates \n     imposed by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act; \n     and\n       Whereas, These costs have been increasing rapidly in recent \n     years; and\n       Whereas, In this Commonwealth, the population of students \n     with special needs has increased by less than 1% since 2000; \n     and\n       Whereas, In the same period, the Commonwealth's \n     appropriations for special education have increased by 25% in \n     order to keep pace; and\n       Whereas, Because the Federal Government has failed to \n     provide the level of funding that the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act allows, it has placed a \n     disproportionate financial burden on the Commonwealth and its \n     school districts; and\n       Whereas, If the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n     is to fully accomplish its mission to provide a free \n     appropriate public education to children with disabilities, \n     the Federal Government must provide State and local \n     governments with the funding they need to successfully \n     implement the act's mandates; therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of Pennsylvania urge Congress and \n     the President of the United States to fulfill the commitment \n     of the Individuals with Disabilities Education act to provide \n     resources equal to 40% of the national average per pupil \n     expenditure for special education students for each \n     Pennsylvania student with special needs; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be sent to the \n     President and Vice President of the United States, to the \n     presiding officers of each house of Congress from \n     Pennsylvania, to the National Conference of State \n     Legislatures, to the State Board of Education and to the \n     Secretary of Education.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-108. A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Arizona urging Congress to continue the funding and \n     completion of the Secure Border Initiative Network program by \n     the target date of December 31, 2008; to the Committee on \n     Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n\n                          Senate Memorial 1004\n\n       To the Congress of the United States of America:\n       Your memorialist respectfully represents:\n       Whereas, the safety and security of Arizona's southern \n     border are critical to the economy and the health and welfare \n     of all Arizona citizens; and\n       Whereas, the Federal government, through the United States \n     Customs and Border Protection's Secure Border Initiative \n     Network program (SBInet), is allocating millions of dollars \n     and significant resources to developing and deploying \n     personnel, infrastructure, technologies and rapid response \n     platforms to prohibit the illegal entry of people and \n     contraband across the entire southern border of Arizona; and\n       Whereas, SBinet is a program of intense national interest \n     with a challenge to accomplish something that has never \n     before been done and is committed to delivering a system to \n     the United States government that will support the United \n     States Customs and Border Protection in detecting, \n     apprehending and processing people who cross Arizona's border \n     illegally; facilitate legitimate cross-border travel and \n     commerce; and most importantly, provide taxpayers with the \n     best value solution over the life of the program; and\n       Whereas, SBInet will deliver the ability to detect entries \n     into the United States when they occur, to identify what the \n     entry is and to classify its level of threat, thereby \n     allowing the border patrol to effectively and efficiently \n     respond to the entry, and to resolve the situation with \n     appropriate law enforcement; and\n       Whereas, Arizona, takes pride in being the first state to \n     receive the benefits of SBInet: and\n       Whereas, by the end of calendar year 2008, the SBInet \n     program will deploy fencing, vehicle barriers and proven \n     current and next-generation technology, including radars, \n     sensors, communications enhancements and the requisite number \n     of United States Customs and Border Protection Border Patrol \n     agents to secure Arizona's southern border.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of the State of \n     Arizona, prays:\n       1. That the United States Congress continue the funding and \n     completion of SBInet by the target date of December 31, 2008.\n       2. That the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona \n     transmit copies of this Memorial to the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives and each Member of Congress from the State \n     of Arizona.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-109. A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Arizona urging Congress to use its powers as \n     delegated by the Indian Commerce Clause to acknowledge and \n     protect the public interest of Indian country from competing \n     public interests and regulatory jurisdictions; to the \n     Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n                     House Concurrent Memorial 2007\n\n       To the Congress of the United States of America:\n       Your memorialist respectfully represents:\n       Whereas, it is crucial for Native Americans to establish \n     equitable, affordable and universal access to \n     telecommunications services, allowing placement of \n     infrastructure and information technology equipment to \n     deliver broadband services and other evolving and emerging \n     technologies on tribal lands to American Indian communities \n     by the year 2010; and\n       Whereas, it is vital to ensure that the universal service \n     concepts of the 1996 Telecommunications Act allow for \n     telecommunications infrastructure and information technology \n     to be developed and used in a manner that meets the social, \n     civic, economic, educational and cultural needs of American \n     Indian tribes and communities; and\n       Whereas, it is essential to protect, strengthen and assert \n     tribal government sovereignty and regulatory jurisdiction, in \n     the areas of telecommunications and information technology; \n     and\n       Whereas, it is vital to create a framework and guidelines \n     for tribal governments and communities, intertribal \n     organizations and American Indian organizations to prepare, \n     plan and make recommendations for telecommunications and \n     information technology policy, legislation, appropriations, \n     program development and self-determination.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Arizona, the Senate concurring, prays:\n       1. That the United States Congress recognize the rights of \n     tribal governments and communities to exercise and assert \n     regulatory jurisdiction over telecommunications activities in \n     the boundaries of reservations and communities.\n       2. That the United States Congress encourage states, \n     counties and municipalities to provide partnership \n     opportunities that promote telecommunication services and \n     that are mutually beneficial for the economic, social and \n     general welfare for all state citizens.\n       3. That the United States Congress provide a sufficient \n     set-aside of Homeland Security monies to ensure equitable and \n     sufficient distribution of monies among tribal governments \n     and American Indian communities for the development of \n     telecommunications build-out necessary to mitigate \n     emergencies and crisis brought about by acts of terrorism, \n     drug trafficking, human smuggling and other deplorable acts \n     that threaten national and local security.\n       4. That the United States Congress promote and support \n     tribal government and community efforts to establish \n     telecommunications regulatory authorities and codes.\n       5. That the United States Congress support and advance \n     public safety implementation among tribes and communities \n     through the provision of grants for the development of \n     telecommunications and information technology capacities \n     among law enforcement agencies, emergency medical service \n     providers, fire departments, courts and justice departments \n     and other emergency responder agencies.\n\n[[Page S7332]]\n\n       6. That the United States Congress support and advance \n     tribal government and ownership of spectrum above tribal \n     lands and communities by granting, rather than auctioning, \n     partitioned spectrum licenses to tribal entities.\n       7. That the United States Congress encourage and support \n     tribal government and community efforts to establish and \n     operate telephone companies and other telecommunication \n     businesses, such as internet service providers, especially in \n     unserved and underserved areas.\n       8. That the United States Congress support and advance the \n     efforts of tribal governments and American Indian communities \n     to bridge their respective digital divides through the \n     provision of grants, loans and contracts, tax incentives and \n     infrastructure build-out services.\n       9. That the United States Congress use its powers as \n     delegated by the Indian Commerce Clause to acknowledge, and \n     protect the public interest of Indian country from competing \n     public interests and regulatory jurisdictions and perform the \n     following:\n       (a) Amend section 214(e) of the Telecommunications Act to \n     include the following definition of unserved areas:\n       An unserved area is defined as service penetration 15% \n     below the nationwide penetration rate for any communications \n     service; or 5% below national rural penetration rate for any \n     communications service, whichever rate is higher.\n       (b) Amend section 214(e) 6 of the Telecommunications Act to \n     include tribes and acknowledge tribal regulatory authority.\n       (c) Provide mechanisms, with enforcement powers, for \n     ensuring equitable, affordable and sustainable access to \n     communications services, including broadband, broadcast and \n     emerging technologies, in Indian country.\n       (d) Support tribal access and options for ownership and \n     management of spectrum on tribal lands for both wireless and \n     broadcast applications.\n       (e) Provide mechanisms to promote cooperation among tribes, \n     state public utility commissions and the federal \n     communications commission and remedies for resolving \n     unforeseen conflicts.\n       (f) Provide public financing to tribal communities that \n     fall under the definition of an unserved area to close any \n     service gap.\n       (g) Permit the bureau of Indian affairs to allow for \n     telecommunication entities to colocate on existing linear \n     rights of way, such as power and water routes, so that rapid \n     expansion of telecom services, including categorical \n     exclusion of clearance requirements, can proceed.\n       10.

A bill to amend title 11, United States Code, with respect \nto exceptions to discharge in bankruptcy for certain qualified \neducational loans; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to tell you about Connie \nMartin from Sycamore, IL. Connie's son decided to go to culinary school \nin Chicago 5 years ago at the age of 25. To pay for tuition, he \nborrowed $58,000 in private loans from Sallie Mae at 18 percent \ninterest. His first payment was $1,100 a month--his entire monthly \nsalary at a downtown eatery where he worked after graduation. His loan \nbalance, including government-backed loans, is now $100,000. Connie's \nson has been working hard, and she and her husband have been trying to \nhelp him make the payments. I worry for borrowers like Connie's son who \ncan't start over and will have debt that will likely haunt him for the \nrest of his life.\n  The Chicago Sun-Times recently ran a story that described the \ndevastating effect large student loan debt has on the lives of \nborrowers. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \narticle from the Chicago Sun-Times be inserted for the Record.\n  Private student loans are the fastest growing and most profitable \nsector of the student loan industry. As college tuition continues to \nrise, the private loan market flourishes. According to the College \nBoard, tuition, fees, room and board at public 4-year schools have \nrisen by 42 percent over the past 5 years from $9,032 to $12,796. Add \nbooks, supplies, transportation and other living expenses, and the \ntotal increases to $16,357 for those paying instate tuition and $26,304 \nfor those paying out-of-state tuition. Students rely on private loans \nto pay for any unmet need that Federal loans and grants fail to cover. \nAccording to the College Board, since 2001 the market for private \nstudent loans has grown at an annual rate of 27 percent to $17.3 \nbillion in 2006--roughly 20 percent of total student borrowing. Ten \nyears ago, only 5 percent of total education loan volume was in private \nloans.\n  Private student loans are more profitable than Federal student loans \nbecause lenders can charge whatever interest rate students will pay, \nbarring State usury laws. The interest rates and fees on private loans \ncan be as onerous as credit cards. There are reports of private loans \nwith interest rates of at least 15 percent and often much higher. \nUnlike Federal student loans, there is no government-imposed loan limit \non private loans and no regulation over the terms and cost of these \nloans.\n  Today, I am pleased to introduce a bill that will give students, who \nfind themselves in dire financial straits, a chance at a new beginning. \nMy bill takes the bankruptcy law, as it pertains to private student \nloans, back to where it was before the law was amended in 2005. Under \nthis legislation, privately issued student loans will once again be \ndischargeable in bankruptcy. My bill also clarifies that existing \nprotections are specific to loans that were issued by or are guaranteed \nby State and Federal Government.\n  Federally issued or guaranteed student loans have been protected \nduring personal bankruptcy since 1978. This provision protects Federal \ninvestments in higher education. In 2005, a provision was added to law \nto protect the investments of private lenders participating in the \nstudent loan industry. This change in the law creates a couple of \nproblems. First, extending protections to private lenders of student \nloans but not to other potential creditors who are at risk in a \nbankruptcy disposition is inherently unfair. Second, such protections \nare unfair to the debtor. Repayment schedules--with accumulating \ninterest--can extend for decades.\n  With the 2005 protections in place, there is essentially no risk to \nlenders making high-cost private loans to people who may not be able to \nafford them. There is no risk to private lenders extending credit to \nstudents at schools with low graduation rates and even lower job \nplacement rates.\n  Giving private loans such high status in bankruptcy also puts other \ncreditors at a significant disadvantage. No one seems to know how or \nwhy private student loans gained this status in 2005. There is nothing \nin the Congressional Record explaining the reasons behind the change. \nWhy should a private student loan lender be able to jump to the front \nof the creditor line--in front of the local furniture store or the \nneighborhood plumber? This bill seeks to restore treatment of privately \nissued student loans in bankruptcy to the same treatment as any other \ndebt.\n  There is justification for making Federal loans hard to discharge: \nthey are backed by taxpayer dollars, and they come with some borrower \nprotections in cases of economic hardship, unemployment, death and \ndisability. However, private loans involve only private profit and do \nnot have the protections that government borrowers enjoy, including \ncaps on interest rates, flexible repayment options, and limited\n\n[[Page S7336]]\n\ncancellation rights. Why should student borrowers, who are trying to \nbetter themselves and our country, be treated in the same manner as \npeople trying to escape child support payments, alimony, overdue taxes, \nand criminal fines?\n  The 1950s and 1960s saw the democratization of higher education. The \nGI Bill provided money for returning WWII veterans to attend college. \nThe National Defense Education Act made college a possibility by making \nlow-interest education loans available for countless students all \nacross the country. Talented kids from working families began realizing \nthe possibility of college, and enrollment at colleges swelled. But \nsince then, college costs have gone through the roof. And students--\nheeding the call to obtain a good education--are also earning \nthemselves years of debt. The average student is graduating with nearly \n$20,000 in debt and in many cases--much, much more--just look at Connie \nMartin's son. Our country has made great strides in making college a \nreality for countless students. Let's not reverse the positive trend we \nstarted over 50 years ago. That is why I am introducing this bill--to \ngive students a chance at a fresh start.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nan article of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1561\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DISCHARGE IN BANKRUPTCY FOR CERTAIN EDUCATIONAL \n                   LOANS.\n\n       Section 523(a)(8) of title 11, United States Code, is \n     amended by striking ``dependents, for'' and all that follows \n     through subparagraph (B) and inserting ``dependents, for an \n     educational benefit overpayment or loan made, insured, or \n     guaranteed by a governmental unit, or an obligation to repay \n     funds received from a governmental unit as an educational \n     benefit, scholarship, or stipend.''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   [From the Sun Times, May 6, 2007]\n\n               Students and Loans: 'Til Death Do Us Part\n\n                           (By Dave Newbart)\n\n       They liken it to a financial death sentence.\n       They can't get a car loan, a home mortgage or any other \n     type of loan. They've lost jobs and even spouses over it.\n       They are so humiliated they don't want any of their friends \n     or family to know.\n       And for most, there is no way out.\n       They are former students trapped under the weight of \n     student loans. The same vehicle that allowed them to get a \n     college education has left many graduates buried in debt with \n     no reasonable way to climb out.\n       Some students who never graduate are stuck paying off loans \n     without the earning power of a degree--an estimated \n     additional $1 million in lifetime earnings.\n       And some students who finish can't afford the monthly \n     payments. Others lose jobs and can't catch back up. Then they \n     get turned down by employers who increasingly check credit \n     records before hiring.\n       Some say they would make small monthly payments to show \n     good faith--only to see their balances continue to grow and \n     to receive harassing phone calls from collectors.\n       To be sure, most borrowers pay on time; default rates are \n     at an all-time low.\n       But for those who run into trouble, changes in federal \n     laws--including many in the last decade--have made student \n     loans among the hardest debts to discharge. They've also made \n     the loans among the most lucrative for private lenders, who \n     face little risk--because the government backs the loans--but \n     reap the benefits when balances balloon.\n       Some borrowers say they accept reasonable interest, but \n     they believe the fees and penalties--which over time can \n     double or triple the loan balances--are unfair.\n\n\n                     Interest rate over 18 percent\n\n       Many of the students awash in debt say that they were \n     blinded by the promise a college degree holds and unprepared \n     to take on high levels of debt at such a young age.\n       Connie Martin's son signed up for cooking school in Chicago \n     in 2002 at age 25. To pay for it, he borrowed $73,000, mostly \n     in private loans from Sallie Mae, the largest student lender, \n     at 18 percent interest.\n       ``He didn't know what the interest rate was. . . . He just \n     wanted to go to school,'' said Martin, of Sycamore.\n       His first payment was $1,100 a month, his entire monthly \n     salary at a downtown eatery where he went to work after \n     graduation.\n       ``I don't understand how they can lend a kid that kind of \n     money with no credit history, who never owned anything, with \n     no co-signers,'' said his mother, who only learned of the \n     situation after the bills started to pile up.\n       Sallie Mae officials said they no longer offer such high-\n     interest loans, and have offered students a chance to \n     refinance at a lower rate if certain conditions are met. ``We \n     recognize it's high,'' spokeswoman Martha Holler said.\n       Martin's son declined to comment. His balance has since \n     grown to $98,000.\n\n\n                     It's like indentured servitude\n\n       Greg Treece, of Downstate Mattoon, now wishes he never \n     enrolled in Washington University's Occupational Therapy \n     program. ``Choosing an expensive private school and borrowing \n     the money to go there is the single greatest mistake I have \n     ever made,'' he said.\n       Treece took out $84,000 in loans. Six months after he got \n     out of the St. Louis school, his monthly payment was more \n     than half his take-home pay for his first job in Chicago. He \n     later lost his job. With compounding interest, his loan \n     quickly skyrocketed. At times he seriously wished he could go \n     to jail in exchange for wiping out the debt.\n       With a new job, he's managed to pay $60,000, but his \n     balance remains at $111,000 because of fees, penalties and \n     interest. ``It's like indentured servitude,'' he said.\n       For those who default, lenders can truly play hardball, \n     often employing no-scruples private collection firms that \n     call borrowers as often as 10 times a day.\n       Shirley, an Ivy League-educated lawyer, lost her job in \n     Chicago in the late 1980s. She pleaded for reduced payments \n     from a collector working for the Illinois Student Assistance \n     Commission--but was denied.\n       ``I said you are driving me to bankruptcy,'' she recalled. \n     ``They wouldn't budge.''\n       In bankruptcy court ISAC claimed she owed $78,000, which \n     included $13,000 for collection costs, 20 percent of the \n     total debt. Nearly all of the debt was eventually erased, \n     according to court records.\n       Because that was before the recent law changes, she should \n     have been clear.\n\n\n                     Loan chief admits ``mistakes''\n\n       But several years later, the collectors began calling \n     again--first from ISAC and then from the U.S. Education \n     Department. They claimed the bill was now over $100,000.\n       ``It was as though they were above the law,'' she said. She \n     eventually went to court again and proved she no longer owed \n     the money, but her husband left her in the process. She asked \n     that her real name not be used out of fear of retaliation.\n       ISAC and the Education Department say they have several \n     programs that allow students to delay payments in hard times \n     or make lower ones based on income. Officials say they try to \n     help borrowers in default get back into good standing, a \n     process known as rehabilitation. Last year, ISAC rehabbed $30 \n     million in defaulted loans, up from $4.4 million in 2002.\n       Agency director Andy Davis says the agency has to strike a \n     balance between helping borrowers repay and making sure \n     taxpayers aren't left in the lurch.\n       But he acknowledges his workers ``make mistakes'' and said \n     he is looking to make changes in some of the outsourcing of \n     collections.\n       Then there are those with hard luck, who make bad decisions \n     or just simply can't get a break.\n       Richard and Sheila Friese both have degrees from Southern \n     Illinois University, financed in part on student loans. They \n     were also both discharged from the Navy after suffering \n     injuries while serving stateside. Richard is learning \n     disabled.\n       They have never been able to find high-paying jobs; now \n     they both use wheelchairs to get around and suffer from \n     ailments including arthritis, constant abdominal pain and \n     chronic fatigue. They're currently fighting with the Veterans \n     Administration over benefits; they also are wrangling with \n     the Social Security Administration.\n\n\n                  Collector: ``We will never go away''\n\n       They currently have no income to pay off their combined \n     $141,000 loan balance. ISAC has seized $3,200 in tax refunds \n     from Sheila, 37. Richard, 49, avoids the phone after \n     constantly being called by collectors for Sallie Mae--one of \n     whom he claims called him a ``low-life, S.O.B.'' Holler said \n     Sallie Mae's collectors are trained in fair debt collection \n     practices. ``That should not happen,'' she said.\n       If this were virtually any other debt, experts say, the \n     couple would be able to discharge some or all of it through \n     bankruptcy. But the Frieses, of Mundelein, are stuck. ``Our \n     life has hit a brick wall,'' Richard said.\n       Davis said it might make sense for the federal government \n     to ``write off'' debt if borrowers--particularly vets--have \n     no hope of paying.\n       Pam, 58, of Dolton, graduated from Downstate SIU-\n     Edwardsville in 1984, but spent time on welfare. She \n     eventually defaulted on her loan after a dispute over the \n     amount of the balance and monthly payments. Her $12,500 in \n     loans has grown to $28,000. Experts say borrowers should \n     continue to make payments during a dispute so the loan \n     doesn't get out of control.\n       She has gone underground, blocking collectors' calls and \n     running her own business so her wages can't be garnisheed. \n     But when collectors do get through, they have a harsh \n     message. ``When they call they say, `We will never go away \n     until you are dead.'''\n\n\n                            UP, UP AND AWAY\n\n       Percent of students with loans\n       1993: less than 50 percent\n       2004: 66 percent\n       Average debt for graduating seniors\n       1993: $9,250\n       2004: $19,200\n       Number of graduating seniors with debt over $40,000\n       1993: 7,000\n\n[[Page S7337]]\n\n       2004: 78,000\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN:\n  S. 1562. A bill to direct the Secretary of Energy to provide grants \nto States for the distribution of compact fluorescent lights; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fluorescent \nLight Implementation Program to Save Americans Value and Energy, or \nFLIP-to-SAVE. This bill does something very simple to save Americans \nmoney and make us more energy efficient. It distributes compact \nfluorescent light-bulbs. We can save green two ways by changing our \nlight-bulbs.\n  Compact fluorescent light-bulbs, or CFLs, are highly efficient light-\nbulbs that use less than a quarter of the energy of traditional \nincandescent bulbs. The FLIP-to-SAVE program will spend $50 million to \nincrease public awareness of how CFLs save money and the environment \nand to distribute them to households across the Nation. It is modeled \nafter a successful program in my home State of Delaware, which \ndistributed 140,000 CFLs through public libraries. The FLIP-to-SAVE \nprogram will give States grants, to allow each State to develop a \nprogram that suits it best, though I expect many will be modeled after \nDelaware's system.\n  Through this program, we can expect to replace 16 million inefficient \nincandescent bulbs with CFLs, reducing total residential energy bills \nby over $60 million each year. That means the program ought to pay for \nitself in terms of savings to families in just one year. And that's \nwithout considering the environmental benefits.\n  By reducing our energy consumption in the equivalent of 127,000 \nhomes, about the size of Buffalo, NY, we can help alleviate our energy \ndependence and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, one \nequivalent CFL replacing a 60 watt incandescent will prevent 1000 \npounds of carbon dioxide through reductions in coal-powered \nelectricity. That is 1.1 million tons of carbon dioxide each year.\n  Energy efficiency is a key to our efforts to address climate change. \nThere are many simple steps we can take to use less energy, and this is \none. The FLIP-to-SAVE program will not just reduce carbon emissions, \nbut also reduce electric bills for American families by more than its \nprice tag. I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1562\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the disclosure of certain activities \nrelating to the petroleum industry of Sudan, to increase the penalties \nfor violations of sanctions provisions, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the suffering in Darfur and Sudan on the \ncontinent of Africa continues today as it has every day for too many \nyears. I rise again to urge my colleagues that we must do more to end \nthis crisis in Sudan. Two weeks ago, before the Memorial Day recess, I \ncame to the floor to highlight some of the positive steps taken thus \nfar by Congress, the Bush administration, the business community, and \nnonprofits to pressure the Sudanese regime to end this genocide. I said \nthen and I will repeat today: We must do more.\n  In that speech I urged the President to follow through on what he \npromised to do in April at the Holocaust museum just down the street in \nWashington. To the President's credit, last week he took steps forward. \nHe tightened United States economic sanctions on Sudan. He targeted \nsanctions against more individuals responsible for the violence, and he \nvowed to push for a strong new United Nations Security Council \nresolution that would further pressure the Sudanese regime. I applaud \nthe President for his leadership. But I repeat, we must do more.\n  On March 28, as Treasury Secretary Paulson testified in front of the \nAppropriations subcommittee I chair, I asked the Secretary: What \nresources does the Treasury Department need to put more pressure on the \nSudanese Government to end the genocide? His answer:\n\n       . . . We'd like the flexibility to charge a larger fine, \n     because $50,000 may not be enough.\n\n  He was talking about civil and criminal penalties that violators of \nAmerican sanctions on Sudan should face and the fact that the current \npenalties are not much of a deterrent. It was a concrete suggestion \nfrom the administration, and I agreed to accept his challenge. Based on \nthat testimony, more discussions with the Treasury Department, the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, the State Department, and other \nagencies, we created the Sudan Disclosure and Enforcement Act which I \nintroduce today. This act provides the administration and all Americans \nwith more resources and tools and information so we can each do our \npart to end the genocide and bring peace to Darfur. It creates real \nconsequences for those who support the Sudanese regime and, perhaps \nmost importantly, it requires the administration and Congress to meet \nin 90 days to reassess the steps that need to be taken to help to end \nthe crisis.\n  For my colleagues who are considering supporting this legislation, \nhere is what the bill will do in specifics: first, express the sense of \nCongress that the international community should continue to bring \npressure against the Government of Sudan to convince that regime that \nthe world would not allow this crisis to continue; second, authorize \ngreater resources for the Office of\n\n[[Page S7338]]\n\nForeign Assets Control within the Department of the Treasury to \nstrengthen its capabilities in tracking Sudanese economic activity and \npursuing sanctions violators; third, require more detailed SEC \ndisclosures by United States listed companies that operate in the \nSudanese petroleum sector so investors can make informed decisions \nregarding divestment from these companies; fourth, dramatically \nincrease civil and criminal penalties for violating American economic \nsanctions to create a true deterrent against transacting with barred \nSudanese companies; fifth, require the administration to report on the \neffectiveness of the current sanctions regime and recommend other steps \nCongress could take to help end the crisis.\n  I am proud to introduce this legislation with bipartisan support. I \nparticularly thank the ranking member of the Financial Services and \nGeneral Government Appropriations Subcommittee, my friend and colleague \nSenator Sam Brownback of Kansas, for all of his great work on this \nissue. I am pleased to be joined by all of the other original \ncosponsors as well: Senators Dodd, who also chairs the Banking \nCommittee and is a great ally; Senators Klobuchar, Mikulski, Bill \nNelson, Obama, and Wyden.\n  I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join this \neffort. As we move around our States and visit parts of the country, \noccasionally a person will come up after a meeting and say to me: \nSenator, what are you doing about Darfur? Didn't your country, America, \ndeclare a genocide? What are you doing?\n  Frankly, aside from speeches on the floor and an occasional \nresolution, bills of very little consequence, there hasn't been much to \npoint to. I hope my colleagues who face that same question and worry \nthat the response is so inadequate will take a good look at this \nlegislation. I hope they will join me in cosponsoring this effort. We \nshould pass this measure, work with our House colleagues and do the \nsame, send this bill to the President. The President said in April:\n\n       You who have survived evil know that the only way to defeat \n     it is to look it in the face and not back down. It is evil \n     that we are now seeing in Sudan, and we're not going to back \n     down.\n\n  The President went on to say:\n\n       No one who sees these pictures can doubt that genocide is \n     the only word for what is happening in Darfur and that we \n     have a moral obligation to stop it.\n\n  I completely agree with the President. It has been more than 2\\1/2\\ \nyears since the President called what is taking place in Darfur, Sudan \nby its rightful name--genocide. Yet even as an estimated 200,000 to \n400,000 people have been killed, even as over 2 million men, women, and \ntiny children have been forced from their homes by violence and \nkilling, even as the violence continues as we meet in the safety and \ncomfort of this great Nation, America and the entire international \ncommunity have not done enough to help. We must do more. This bill \nmoves in the right direction. It gives our Government the tools and the \nencouragement to act and act quickly.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1563\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Sudan Disclosure and \n     Enforcement Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) On July 22, 2004, the Senate passed Senate Concurrent \n     Resolution 133, 108th Congress, and the House of \n     Representatives passed House Concurrent Resolution 467, 108th \n     Congress, both resolutions declaring that ``the atrocities \n     unfolding in Darfur, Sudan, are genocide''.\n       (2) On September 9, 2004, President Bush declared that ``we \n     have concluded that genocide has taken place in Darfur''.\n       (3) On June 30, 2005, President Bush affirmed that ``the \n     violence in Darfur region is clearly genocide [and t]he human \n     cost is beyond calculation''.\n       (4) On May 8, 2006, President Bush reaffirmed, ``We will \n     call genocide by its rightful name, and we will stand up for \n     the innocent until the peace of Darfur is secured.''.\n       (5) On November 20, 2006, the Presidential Special Envoy to \n     Sudan, Andrew S. Natsios, stated in a briefing to members of \n     the press, ``And there's a point--January 1st is either we \n     see a change or we go to Plan B.''.\n       (6) On February 20, 2007, Special Envoy Natsios stated in \n     an interview with the Council on Foreign Relations, ``We \n     needed to send a message to the Sudanese government that we \n     were no longer simply going to continue with the situation \n     the way it's been the last four years, that there was a \n     change. We are considering more aggressive measures should we \n     make no progress in the humanitarian area, in the political \n     negotiations, and in the implementation of Kofi Annan and Ban \n     Ki-moon's plan to introduce . . . additional forces.''.\n       (7) On April 18, 2007, President Bush stated, ``It is evil \n     we are now seeing in Sudan--and we're not going to back \n     down.''.\n       (8) The Government of Sudan, as of the date of the \n     introduction of this Act, has announced its willingness to \n     accept 3,000 United Nations peacekeepers and their equipment, \n     but has continued to obstruct the full-scale joint United \n     Nations-African Union peacekeeping mission authorized under \n     United Nations Security Council Resolution 1706 (2006) and to \n     prevent sufficient humanitarian access to meet the urgent \n     needs of the people of Darfur.\n       (9) Congress supports the objectives of a ``Plan B'' as \n     outlined in the press and elsewhere to increase pressure on \n     the Government of Sudan to accept a greatly expanded \n     peacekeeping mission with a mandate to protect the people of \n     Darfur.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the President should--\n       (1) continue to work with other members of the \n     international community, including the Permanent Members of \n     the United Nations Security Council, the African Union, the \n     European Union, the Arab League, and the Government of Sudan \n     to facilitate the urgent deployment of a peacekeeping force \n     as called for by United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     1706 (2006); and\n       (2) bring before the United Nations Security Council, and \n     call for a vote on, a resolution requiring meaningful \n     multilateral sanctions against the Government of Sudan in \n     response to its acts of genocide against the people of Darfur \n     and its continued refusal to allow the implementation of a \n     peacekeeping force as called for by Resolution 1706.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to provide for the transfer of naval vessels to \ncertain foreign recipients; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today, Senator Lugar and I are introducing \nthe Naval Vessel Transfer Act of 2007, a bill to permit the transfer of \ncertain U.S. Navy vessels to particular foreign countries. All of the \nproposed ship transfer authorizations have been requested by the U.S. \nNavy, with the approval of the Office of Management and Budget.\n  Pursuant to section 824(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act \nfor Fiscal Year 1994, as amended, 10 U.S.C. 7307(a), a naval vessel \nthat is in excess of 3,000 tons or that is less than 20 years of age \nmay not be disposed of to another nation unless the disposition of that \nvessel is approved by law enacted after August 5, 1974. The bill we are \nintroducing today would provide that required approval for eight \ntransfers: two guided missile frigates and two minehunter coastal ships \nfor Turkey; two minehunter coastal ships for Lithuania; and two \nminehunter coastal ships for Taiwan.\n  The bill also contains provisions that are traditionally included in \nship transfer bills, relating to transfer costs and repair and \nrefurbishment of the ships, and exempting the value of a vessel \ntransferred on a grant basis from the aggregate value of excess defense \narticles in a given fiscal year.\n  The authority provided by this bill would expire 2 years after the \ndate of enactment of the bill.\n  Similar legislation was passed by the Senate last year, but was \nobjected to in the House of Representatives because of concern \nregarding the proposal to transfer minehunter coastal ships. That issue \nwas also raised by Members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, but \nmembers of that committee were persuaded by the Executive branch that \nthe transfers would not degrade U.S. Navy capabilities. We invite \ninterested colleagues to let us know if there is any residual concern \namong Members of the Senate, so that we can arrange for the Executive \nbranch to brief members and determine if there is any objection to \nexpeditious passage of this bill.\n  Finally, the Department of Defense has provided the following \ninformation on this bill:\n\n       This bill would authorize the President to grant transfer \n     five excess naval vessels to Turkey and Lithuania and to sell \n     three excess naval vessels to Taiwan and Turkey.\n       These proposed transfers would improve the United States' \n     political and military relationships with close allies. They \n     would support strategic engagement goals and regional \n     security cooperation objectives. Active use of former naval \n     vessels by coalition forces in support of regional priorities \n     is more advantageous than retaining vessels in the Navy's \n     inactive fleet and disposing of them by scrapping or another \n     method.\n       The United States would incur no costs in transferring \n     these naval vessels. The recipients would be responsible for \n     all costs associated with the transfers, including \n     maintenance, repairs, training, and fleet turnover costs.\n       This bill does not alter the effect of the Toxic Substances \n     Control Act, or any other law, with regard to their \n     applicability to the transfer of ships by the United States \n     to foreign countries for military or humanitarian use. The \n     laws and regulations that apply today would apply in the same \n     manner if this bill were enacted.\n       The Department of Defense estimates that the sale of these \n     vessels may net the United States $52.7 million in fiscal \n     year 2008.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no ojection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1565\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Naval Vessel Transfer Act of \n     2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. TRANSFER OF NAVAL VESSELS TO CERTAIN FOREIGN \n                   RECIPIENTS.\n\n       (a) Transfers by Grant.--The President is authorized to \n     transfer vessels to foreign recipients on a grant basis under \n     section 516 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. \n     2321j), as follows:\n       (1) Turkey.--To the Government of Turkey--\n       (A) the OLIVER HAZARD PERRY class guided missile frigates \n     GEORGE PHILIP (FFG-12) and SIDES (FFG-14); and\n       (B) the OSPREY class minehunter coastal ship BLACKHAWK \n     (MHC-58).\n       (2) Lithuania.--To the Government of Lithuania, the OSPREY \n     class minehunter coastal ships CORMORANT (MHC-57) and \n     KINGFISHER (MHC-56).\n       (b) Transfers by Sale.--The President is authorized to \n     transfer vessels to foreign recipients on a sale basis under \n     section 21 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2761), \n     as follows:\n       (1) Taiwan.--To the Taipei Economic and Cultural \n     Representative Office of the United States (which is the \n     Taiwan instrumentality designated pursuant to section 10(a) \n     of the Taiwan Relations Act (22 U.S.C. 3309(a))), the OSPREY \n     class minehunter coastal ships ORIOLE (MHC-55) and FALCON \n     (MHC-59).\n       (2) Turkey.--To the Government of Turkey, the OSPREY class \n     minehunter coastal ship SHRIKE (MHC-62).\n       (c) Grants Not Counted in Annual Total of Transferred \n     Excess Defense Articles.--The value of a vessel transferred \n     to a recipient on a grant basis pursuant to authority \n     provided by subsection (a) or (c) shall not be counted \n     against the aggregate value of excess defense articles \n     transferred in any fiscal year under section 516 of the \n     Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.\n       (d) Costs of Transfers.--Any expense incurred by the United \n     States in connection with a transfer authorized by this \n     section shall be charged to the recipient.\n       (e) Repair and Refurbishment in United States Shipyards.--\n     To the maximum extent practicable, the President shall \n     require, as a condition of the transfer of a vessel under \n     this section, that the recipient to which the vessel is \n     transferred have such repair or refurbishment of the vessel \n     as is needed before the vessel joins the naval forces of the \n     recipient performed at a shipyard located in the United \n     States, including a United States Navy shipyard.\n       (f) Expiration of Authority.--The authority to transfer a \n     vessel under this section shall expire at the end of the 2-\n     year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this \n     Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 1569. A bill to establish a pilot program on the provision of \nlegal services to assist veterans and members of the Armed Forces \nreceive health care, benefits and services, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Veterans \nAdvocacy Act of 2007. This bill would create a grant program for \norganizations providing pro bono legal representation to servicemembers \nand veterans to ensure that they receive the health care and benefits \nto which they are entitled.\n  The men and women of the Armed Services have served this Nation \nhonorably and deserve the best health care and benefits available. \nHowever, as recent revelations about the extent of bureaucratic delays \nat the Walter Reed Army Medical Center demonstrate, these brave \nindividuals face a series of hurdles as they navigate the health care \nand disability compensation processes. Many of them are forced to turn \nto their representatives in Congress for help cutting through the red \ntape. I have heard from many military personnel and veterans who are \nfrustrated with the system or unaware of Federal health care and other \nbenefits for which they may be eligible. I regret that the system too \noften makes the burden of proving that a condition is related to \nmilitary service nearly insurmountable. Our men and women in uniform \ndeserve the benefit of the doubt, and should not have to fight the \nDepartment of Defense or the Department of Veterans Affairs for \nbenefits that they have earned through their service to our Nation.\n  Numerous reports have detailed the range of administrative and legal \nhurdles injured servicemembers will face when they return home. Service \nmembers returning with unprecedented rates of post traumatic stress \ndisorder, PTSD, and traumatic brain injury, TBI, will struggle to get \nthe medical records they need to file benefits claims. Those with \nsevere TBI that does not show up on brain scans will have an even \nharder time establishing that they need compensation. Those with \nprofound TBI may be prematurely relegated to care in a nursing home \nwhen, with proper assistance, they may be fully capable of living \nindependent lives in the community. The Government Accountability \nOffice reported\n\n[[Page S7341]]\n\nthat over 75 percent of servicemembers who screen positive for PTSD \nwill not be referred to a mental health professional. Members of the \nGuard and Reserves face additional hurdles to gain access to military \ndoctors. This is unacceptable.\n  I commend my colleagues for their support of increased funding for \nthe military and veterans' health care systems in the 2007 emergency \nsupplemental. However, I am concerned that unless veterans have \nindependent advocates to ensure that they are receiving top notch care \nand that they are aware of the benefits to which they are entitled, \nthese additional funds may be mismanaged. Last November, the Government \nAccountability Office reported that for the last two years the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs has not expended all the funds allocated \nfor mental health initiatives. My bill would ensure that service \nmembers and veterans who have trouble accessing the care to which they \nare entitled will have an advocate outside the chain of command who can \nnegotiate with the Departments to ensure proper care.\n  In addition to helping ensure that service members and veterans \nreceive top notch care, my bill would help service members and veterans \novercome legal barriers to obtaining benefits. During the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee's hearing on benefits legislation, Meredith Beck of \nthe Wounded Warrior Project summarized the problem as follows: ``In \nmany of the cases we have seen, the creation of new benefits wasn't \nneeded to aid the service member, rather, the wounded warrior just \nneeded to have the existing benefits systems better explained and \nuntangled in order to understand what was available to them.''\n  Fortunately, service members and veterans benefit from the services \nof a nationwide system of veterans and military service organizations. \nHowever, the system is simply overwhelmed. It will be further inundated \nwhen the over 170,000 servicemembers deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan \nreturn home. I want to be clear that the purpose of this legislation is \nto supplement the existing network of advocates to ease the caseload of \noverburdened service officers and allow them to spend more time per \ncase helping veterans and service members.\n  Congress has a responsibility to simplify the system and ensure that \nit gives service members and veterans the benefit of the doubt when \nthey seek assistance for service-connected disabilities. It is my hope \nthat the majority of veterans will not need legal representation. But \nthe reality is that many veterans face unnecessary delays and appeals \nof legitimate compensation claims that could be avoided if there were \nenough advocates to ensure that every veteran's case is carefully \ndeveloped from the beginning. Several judges of the Court of Appeals \nfor Veterans Claims have described the importance of ensuring that \nveterans have legal representation throughout the claim process. Judge \nHoldaway summarized the need as follows:\n\n       If you get lawyers involved at the beginning, you can focus \n     in on what is this case about. I think you would get better \n     records, you would narrow the issue, there would be screening \n     . . . I think if we had lawyers involved at the beginning of \n     these cases, it would be the single most fundamental change \n     for the better that this system could have.\n\n  While the need for legal representation in complicated cases is \nclear, I do not believe that veterans should have to pay for legal \nrepresentation just to get the benefits they earned through their \nservice. I have been troubled when I have heard that service members \nare seeking expensive legal assistance to help them overcome daunting \nadministrative and legal hurdles. Fortunately, there are legal service \norganizations and attorneys who are willing to provide assistance to \nthese service members and veterans free of charge. The purpose of this \nbill is to help these organizations get the training they need to help \nveterans and service members.\n  The bill would establish a pilot program of one-year grants to \norganizations that have experience serving veterans or persons with \ndisabilities. The Veterans Administration will be charged with \nappointing a committee to disburse the grants. The committee shall be \ncomposed of veterans and military service officers, veterans and \ndisability legal service attorneys, and representatives of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs employees and the Department of Defense. \nThe Secretary of Veterans Affairs will be required to submit a report \nto Congress on the number of individuals served and the kinds of \nassistance they received as a result of the pilot program.\n  In order to avoid adding to our country's sizable debt, the $1 \nmillion cost of this program is taken from the $3 billion appropriated \nto the defense health program by the 2008 supplemental spending bill. \nThe grant program will help ensure that these funds are spent wisely.\n  Veterans and military service organizations that currently employ \nattorneys will be eligible to receive the grants either to provide \nlegal services at no charge or to provide training to other pro bono \nattorneys. The bill will also help servicemembers and veterans access \nthe services of the federally funded and mandated protection and \nadvocacy system for persons with disabilities. This system has lawyers \nin every state who are trained to help people with disabilities obtain \nthe benefits, health care and services they need to live independent \nlives. These attorneys are uniquely qualified to, for example, ensure \nthat veterans with PTSD are properly diagnosed and treated and to \nprevent those with TBI from being placed in nursing homes when they are \ncapable of living in the community. Many veterans have been seeking out \ntheir assistance but the system is currently overwhelmed. I have \nincluded a description of the assistance that the protection and \nadvocacy systems have been providing veterans. This bill would help \nfoster collaboration between lawyers with expertise in veterans' law \nand those with expertise in disability law.\n  I commend my colleagues who have offered bills to increase funding \nfor the care of service members and veterans, to expand necessary \nbenefits and to ensure that our military and veterans health care \nsystems offer the best care available. In order to ensure that service \nmembers and veterans are able to capitalize on these important reforms, \nthey need independent advocates who can help them cut through the red \ntape. My bill would help expand the cadre of experienced advocates who \nwill do just that. The bill has been endorsed by the National \nOrganization of Veterans Advocates, the Vietnam Veterans of America and \nthe Protection and Advocacy System's National Disability Rights \nNetwork.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and supporting \nmaterial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, material was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1569\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

They have been \n     averaging 15-20 appointments at the facility a month. The \n     advocacy assistance the Alaska P provided has encompassed \n     activities directed at obtaining and/or maintaining housing, \n     securing government benefits, SSI, Medicaid, and working with \n     individuals seeking employment accommodations.\n       The Alaska P has also developed and disseminated a \n     resource guide about educational supports for people with \n     Traumatic Brain Injury, TBI.\n\n\n                                arizona\n\n       The Arizona P has partnered with a case manager in a \n     veterans group to work with returning veterans with \n     disabilities and help them obtain the services and benefits \n     they deserve. The Arizona P has worked to ensure voting \n     access for veterans with disabilities in Arizona.\n       The Arizona P also cosponsored a day-long conference in \n     collaboration with the Governor's Council on Spinal Cord and \n     Head Injuries on TBI to provide information on benefits and \n     services individuals, including veterans, who have suffered a \n     TBI are eligible to receive.\n\n\n                               california\n\n       A peer/self advocacy coordinator in the San Diego P \n     office holds weekly training and information sessions with \n     veterans. One of the sessions occurs at the P's office \n     while the other takes place at the VA facility.\n       The California P represented residents of a veteran's \n     hospital who had been denied access to voter registration \n     services. The issue arose after it was learned that a VA \n     Medical Center was refusing to allow advocates for people \n     with disabilities to conduct voter registration on the \n     campus. In addition, some residents were not being permitted \n     to register, regardless of their competence. Ultimately, the \n     VA reversed its position and allowed voter registration on \n     the medical campus.\n\n\n                                colorado\n\n       The Colorado P is coordinating with an Army caseworker to \n     help veterans with disabilities make the transition back into \n     the community. They also offered voter registration at the \n     Denver Veterans Affairs Medical Center to help ensure \n     returning veterans maintain their right to vote.\n\n\n                                georgia\n\n       The Georgia P has been working with veterans with \n     disabilities who are encountering problems returning to work. \n     They have also reached out to the people running a program \n     demonstrating how veterans with poly-trauma, TBI, Post \n     Traumatic Stress Disorder, PTSD, and other mental health \n     issues can return to work and how the P system could be a \n     great resource for these veterans.\n\n\n                                 hawaii\n\n       The Hawaii P has been a featured speaker at the military \n     families Children's Community Council on Oahu and continues \n     to assist an ever growing number of military families who \n     have children with special education needs. The Hawaii P \n     has also done outreach to a wide group of military service \n     programs on the island regarding benefits and services they \n     can provide to veterans who have suffered a TBI. They have \n     also formed a collaboration with the Christopher Reeves \n     Foundation to help with the Foundation's work with returning \n     veterans from Iraq that have been diagnosed with a TBI.\n\n\n                                illinois\n\n       The Illinois P has provided training and information to \n     VA staff and also met with VA hospital social workers and \n     administrative staff to provide training and information to \n     help veterans with disabilities make the transition from VA \n     care to the community.\n       The Illinois P has also helped a veteran who was in a \n     Veteran's Home integrate into the community following a \n     stroke. The Illinois P worked in conjunction with the local \n     center for independent living to assist the client in finding \n     his own apartment and getting a personal care attendant to \n     address his support needs.\n\n\n                                  iowa\n\n       The Iowa P has received a number of individual contacts \n     from veterans in Iowa's VA Hospitals seeking help accessing \n     veterans' benefits and services as well as community \n     programs. Their staff has encountered a variety of challenges \n     while attempting to meet directly with a client in a VA \n     hospital.\n       The Iowa P also worked with an individual who had \n     concerns that if he returned to work that he would lose his \n     Social Security benefits. The Protection and Advocacy for \n     Beneficiaries of Social Security, PABSS, advocate explained \n     that he had options available without immeadiately losing his \n     benefits and he was eventually able to reenter the workforce \n     in a situation he was comfortable with.\n\n\n                                 kansas\n\n       The Kansas P has been providing information and training \n     to the staff and veterans at the Kansas VA facilities and is \n     working on outreach to the Kansas veterans\n\n[[Page S7343]]\n\n     groups to provide information and assistance to help veterans \n     with disabilities make the transition back to the \n     community.\n       The Kansas P also worked to help a veteran successfully \n     move from a VA nursing facility back into the community. \n     Additionally, they are helping a veteran who was authorized \n     by the VA to have a surgery at a university medical center. \n     He suffered complications from the surgery which required \n     additional hospitalization and the P is working to get the \n     VA to pay for the followup treatments related to the \n     complications.\n\n\n                                kentucky\n\n       The Kentucky P has done outreach to the Kentucky Veterans \n     Affairs Office, the Joint Executive Council of Veterans, as \n     well as to all the state's Veterans Centers, and all the \n     state chapters of the Disabled American Veterans.\n\n\n                               louisiana\n\n       The Louisiana P helped a client successfully appeal a \n     denial from the VA to pay a private hospital for in-patient \n     mental health treatment. They then had to represent the same \n     client when the hospital tried to collect the remaining \n     balance. The Louisiana P was able to show that the hospital \n     is barred from collecting additional funds from a patient \n     whose care was paid for under a VA contract. With the help of \n     the Louisiana P, the veteran was able to receive \n     appropriate mental health services and afforded protection \n     from the hospital's illegal collection efforts.\n\n\n                                 maine\n\n       The Maine P has had meetings with the Director of the \n     State VA Services in order to identify benefits and services \n     available to veterans with disabilities and their families \n     after the veteran is discharged from the VA. They have also \n     provided trainings and information to National Guard units in \n     the State about the resources that are available for veterans \n     with disabilities.\n\n\n                             massachusetts\n\n       The Massachusetts P had a case of a former marine \n     sergeant who had suffered partial hemiparesis and a TBI. This \n     affected his ability to speak and forced him to communicate \n     with gestures and a special set of picture cards. This type \n     of communication created problems and misunderstanding at his \n     job, and his eventual termination. The Massachusetts P was \n     able to work with his employer to find him another job within \n     the company.\n\n\n                                michigan\n\n       The Michigan P has been working on a variety of issues \n     involving veterans, including access to polling facilities \n     and voting booths, public transportation systems, and \n     community projects. They also worked to address community \n     reintegration issues faced by a veteran in a VA facility far \n     from his home when he became eligible for discharge. The \n     P's work allowed the veteran to return to his home \n     community.\n\n\n                               Minnesota\n\n       The Minnesota P has held trainings with the National \n     Alliance on Mental Illness, NAMI, at VA hospitals in the \n     State concerning benefits and services for veterans with \n     disabilities. They have also been contacted by some veterans \n     with disabilities to help get the benefits and services they \n     require. For example, the Minnesota P assisted a veteran \n     with a TBI move from a State hospital back to her home with \n     needed community supports.\n\n\n                                Missouri\n\n       The Missouri P worked with a man who had spent much of \n     his adult life in the military, but was discharged after \n     suffering a TBI. This veteran needed help obtaining services \n     in order to build a new career. The Missouri P helped him \n     identify affordable, accessible housing and arranged \n     accommodations from the school, VA and vocational \n     rehabilitation as he embarks on training for his new career.\n\n\n                                Montana\n\n       The Montana P had a veteran with a TBI who needed \n     assistance getting the schools he was attending for his \n     degree to better coordinate the Montana Vocational \n     Rehabilitation and VA benefits he was receiving in order to \n     afford his education. The Montana P was able to work out an \n     agreement so that the institutions accepted payments from \n     both sources so the veteran did not have any out-of-pocket \n     cost for his tuition.\n\n\n                                Nebraska\n\n       The Nebraska P has initiated contact with the County \n     Veteran Service Officers group in Nebraska and the local VFW \n     and American Legion representatives. They recently made a \n     presentation at the County Veteran Service Officers group's \n     annual meeting about the P system. Their goal is to not \n     supplant their work assisting veterans within the VA system \n     but to be a resource for veterans with disabilities who are \n     returning to their communities and their families.\n\n\n                                 Nevada\n\n       The Nevada P has been providing information and training \n     to veterans family support groups and an organization working \n     with homeless veterans on the services and benefits available \n     for veterans with disabilities.\n\n\n                             New Hampshire\n\n       The New Hampshire P has attempted to carry out the \n     external advocacy activities as set forth in the VA handbook, \n     but so far has been unable to do so because of resistance of \n     the VA staff.\n\n\n                               New Jersey\n\n       The New Jersey P has been working with two veterans on \n     employment related issues. One is an employment \n     discrimination complaint, and the other one is a complaint \n     against the Division of Vocational Rehabilitative Services \n     within the New Jersey Department of Labor for services \n     needed. The New Jersey P has also been holding trainings \n     and providing information to VA hospitals in the State as \n     well as family support groups and the National Guard.\n\n\n                                New York\n\n       The New York P has been working with the New York State \n     Department of Health to identify and address the needs of \n     veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan who have brain \n     injuries and their families. They have also been working to \n     create a primary advisory board comprised of veterans groups \n     and health groups to help address the needs of veterans with \n     disabilities. Finally, the New York P has taken calls and \n     emails from veterans and their families to provide them \n     assistance through every P program.\n       For example, the New York P represented a veteran in a \n     disability claim on referral from the Clinton County Veteran \n     Services office. Among other things, this veteran had \n     cognitive problems caused by a buildup of fluid on his brain. \n     Through the New York P's work, his claim was allowed after \n     a hearing.\n\n\n                              North Dakota\n\n       The North Dakota P has worked with the North Dakota \n     Legislature on state legislation to help veterans with \n     disabilities, and has held a Statewide training session to \n     learn more about the VA system as well as provide information \n     on community services available to returning veterans with \n     disabilities.\n\n\n                           Northern Marianas\n\n       The Northern Marianas P has been working closely with the \n     Office of Military Liaison on training and technical \n     assistance to help address the needs of returning veterans \n     with disabilities.\n\n\n                                  Ohio\n\n       The Ohio P represented a 44-year-old veteran who, while \n     in treatment for mental illness, was threatened with eviction \n     by his HUD-subsidized landlord. Compounding the problem, the \n     VA withdrew the client's community services funding for a \n     home health aide, which the client required. The Ohio P \n     worked with the client's HUD landlord, multiple provider \n     agencies, the VA community services nurse, VA case workers, \n     the VA ombudsman, the VA psychologist, and the VA attorney \n     regarding client's service needs and his legal rights related \n     to his disability. Ultimately, the client's landlord agreed \n     to withdraw eviction threat and the VA restored funding for a \n     home health aide.\n\n\n                              pennsylvania\n\n       The Pennsylvania Protection and Advocacy system organized a \n     Brain Injury Awareness Day at the Lebanon and Coatesville \n     Veterans Administration Medical Centers for staff and \n     veterans. Following the success of this event, the \n     Pennsylvania P was invited back for a day of in-service \n     staff training and technical assistance at the Lebanon \n     facility.\n       At that time, the Pennsylvania P hopes to meet the \n     veterans and see who would like advocacy assistance. They \n     feel this is especially needed because VA staff and the \n     veterans need to be connected with and aware of the \n     community-based services they can access and use.\n       The Pennsylvania P has also successfully worked for a \n     veteran who had suffered a service-connected brain injury \n     which left him unable to walk or perform activities of daily \n     living on his own. The VA ratings board contested that he is \n     100 percent disabled, and refused to offer special \n     compensation. The Pennsylvania P helped the veteran obtain \n     the necessary documentation to connect the brain injury to \n     his physical disabilities so that special compensation could \n     be provided.\n\n\n                              rhode island\n\n       The Rhode Island P has formed an internal veterans' \n     outreach work group which has met with individual veterans \n     organizations in the State and has participated in the \n     State's ``Veterans Task Force of Rhode Island'', providing \n     information and training on the benefits and services \n     available to veterans with disabilities.\n\n\n                             south carolina\n\n       The South Carolina P has provided training and technical \n     assistance to administrative staff at the Richard M. Campbell \n     Veterans Nursing Home in Anderson, SC. The training focused \n     on the legal rights of people with disabilities, including \n     veterans.\n\n\n                              south dakota\n\n       The South Dakota P has been establishing contact with VA \n     medical centers, outpatient clinics, and a VA sponsored \n     support group for veterans to provide information about \n     available resources. They also participate in the Veterans' \n     Services Officers' Congressional Forum. The South Dakota P \n     shares the same concern that the Pennsylvania P has that \n     beyond its health care services the VA does not provide a lot \n     of community-based services other than vocational. As a \n     result, they have been working with the patient advocate at \n     the VA hospital to help veterans with disabilities make\n\n[[Page S7344]]\n\n     the transition into long-term care and housing following \n     discharge from the VA hospital.\n\n\n                                 texas\n\n       The Texas P has been working on several cases for \n     veterans with disabilities to access VA services. One of the \n     cases was a veteran living in a State hospital that had her \n     lump-sum VA benefits unlawfully taken by the hospital without \n     her knowledge or consent and applied retroactively to pay \n     for her support, maintenance, and treatment while she was \n     at the state hospital.

A bill to reform the essential air service program, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, \nSenators Bingaman, Hagel, and Nelson of Nebraska to introduce the \nbipartisan Rural Aviation Improvement Act. I am proud to join my \ncolleagues, each one a steadfast and resolute guardian of commercial \naviation service to all communities, particularly rural areas that \nwould otherwise be deprived of any air service.\n  I have always believed that reliable air service in our Nation's \nrural areas is not simply a luxury or a convenience. It is an \nimperative. All of us who come from rural States know how critical \naviation is to economic development, vital to move people and goods to \nand from areas that may otherwise have dramatically limited \ntransportation options. Quite frankly, I have long held serious \nconcerns about the impact deregulation of the airline industry has had \non small and medium size cities in rural areas, like Maine. That fact \nis, since deregulation, many small and medium-size communities, in \nMaine and elsewhere, have experienced a decrease in flights and size of \naircraft while seeing an increase in fares. More than 300 have lost air \nservice altogether.\n  This legislation will serve to improve the Essential Air Service \nprogram. Additional resources will augment the resources available to \nthe program, reducing the impact on the general fund while providing \nsmall communities with a greater degree of certainty when planning \nfuture improvements to their airports. The bill also gives those same \ncommunities a greater role in retaining and determining the sort of air \nservice which they receive.\n  Increasingly, the Essential Air Service program has been plagued with \na decline in the number of airlines willing to provide this critical \nlink to the national transportation network. A few ``bad actors'' have \njeopardized commercial aviation for entire regions by submitting low-\nball contracts to the Department of Transportation and then reneging on \ntheir commitment to the extent and quality of their service. Our bill \nwill not only establish a system of minimum requirements for contracts \nto protect these small cities that rely on EAS, but it will also extend \nthose contracts to 4 years from the current 2. This gives a heightened \ndegree of stability in terms of air service, rather than having \ncommunities negotiating new contracts or receiving service from \nentirely new carriers every 18 months.\n  In closing, the truth is, everyone benefits when our Nation is at its \nstrongest economically. Most importantly in this case, greater \nprosperity everywhere, including in rural America, will, in the long \nrun, mean more passengers for the airlines. Therefore, it is very much \nin our national interests to ensure that every region has reasonable \naccess to air service. That is why I strongly believe the Federal \nGovernment has an obligation to fulfill the commitment it made to these \ncommunities in 1978; to safeguard their ability to continue commercial \nair service.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wish today to join with my colleague, \nSenator Snowe to introduce the bipartisan Rural Aviation Improvement \nAct. Senator Snowe has been a longtime champion of commercial air \nservice in rural areas, and I applaud her continued leadership on this \nimportant legislation.\n  One of the goals of our bill is to preserve and improve the Essential \nAir Service Program. Congress established the Essential Air Service \nProgram in 1978 to ensure that communities that had commercial air \nservice before airline deregulation would continue to receive scheduled \nservice. The Essential Air Service Program currently ensures commercial \nair service to over 100 communities in 35 States. EAS supports an \nadditional 39 communities in Alaska. Without EAS, many rural \ncommunities would have no commercial air service at all. I believe our \nbill makes a number of important improvements to EAS to ensure rural \ncommunities continue to have the commercial air service that is so \nvital to their futures.\n  Our bill also extends through 2011 the Department of Transportation's \nauthority to provide grants to cities under the Small Community Air \nService Development Program, which was first established in 2000. The \nprogram helps rural communities establish new air service or to promote \nand improve their existing air service. Since it was first enacted, a \nnumber of New Mexico communities have won grants, including most \nrecently Gallup in 2006.\n  All across America, small communities face ever-increasing hurdles to \npromoting their economic growth and development. Today, many rural \nareas lack access to interstate or even four-lane highways, railroads, \nor broadband\n\n[[Page S7345]]\n\ntelecommunications. Business development in rural areas frequently \nhinges on the availability of scheduled air service. For small \ncommunities, commercial air service provides a critical link to the \nnational and international transportation system. I do believe Congress \nmust help ensure that affordable, reliable, and safe air service \nremains available in rural America.\n  The Senate Commerce Committee and its Aviation Subcommittee are well \nalong in developing a reauthorization of aviation programs this year. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues Chairmen Inouye and \nRockefeller and Ranking Members Stevens and Lott to improve commercial \nair service programs for rural areas. I believe our bill is one \nimportant step in that process.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Durbin, \n        Mr. Reed, Mr. Harkin, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Sanders):\n  S. 1572. A bill to increase the number of well-trained mental health \nservice professionals (including those based in schools) providing \nclinical mental health care to children and adolescents, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the landmark 1999 Surgeon General's \nreport on mental health brought a hidden mental health crisis to the \nattention of the U.S. public. According to that report, 13.7 million \nchildren in our country--about one in five--suffer from a diagnosable \nemotional or behavioral disorder. Such disorders as Anxiety Disorders, \nAttention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, and Depression are among the \nmost common in this age group. Yet more than two-thirds of these \nchildren do not receive any treatment. Long waiting lists for children \nseeking services, including those in crisis, are not uncommon. The \nprimary reason is that severe shortages exist in qualified mental \nhealth professionals, including child psychiatrists, psychologists, \nsocial workers, and counselors. The President's New Freedom Commission \non Mental Health also found that ``the supply of well-trained mental \nhealth professionals is inadequate in most areas of the country . . . \nparticular shortages exist for mental health providers who serve \nchildren, adolescents, and older Americans.'' The situation is no \nbetter in our public schools, where children's mental health needs are \noften first identified. According to the National Center for Education \nStatistics within the Department of Education, there are approximately \n479 students for each school counselor in U.S. schools, nearly twice \nthe recommended ratio of 250 students for each counselor.\n  The situation in my home State of New Mexico is a case in point. \nEstimates suggest that 56,000 children and adolescents in New Mexico \nhave an emotional or behavioral disorder. Of these, roughly 20,000 have \nserious disturbances that impair their ability to fulfill the demands \nof everyday life. In 2001, there were a total of 44 child and \nadolescent psychiatrists in the entire State of New Mexico. The impact \nof this shortage on the affected children and their communities is \ndisconcerting. Research shows that children with untreated emotional \nand behavioral disorders are at higher risk for school failure and \ndropping out of school, violence, drug abuse, suicide, and criminal \nactivity. For New Mexico youth, the suicide rate is twice the national \naverage, the fourth highest in the nation, and the third leading cause \nof death. By one estimate, roughly one in seven youth in New Mexico \ndetention centers are in need of mental health treatment that is just \nnot available.\n  New Mexico is not alone in its struggle to address the needs of these \nchildren. Nationwide, over 1600 urban, suburban, and rural communities \nhave been designated Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas by the \nFederal Government due to their severe lack of psychiatrists, \npsychologists, social workers, and other professionals to serve \nchildren and adults. Rural areas are especially hard hit. For example, \nin New Mexico there is one psychiatrist per 20,000 residents in rural \nareas, whereas in urban areas there is one per 3000 residents. In rural \nand frontier counties, it is not unusual for the parents of a child in \nneed of services to travel 60 to 90 miles to reach the nearest \npsychiatrist, psychologist, or other mental health provider. In States \nlike Alaska and Wyoming, the distance may be even farther.\n  Finally, graduate programs providing the vital pipeline for the child \nmental health workforce have not sufficiently increased their funding, \nclass sizes, and training programs to meet the ever growing need for \nthese specialists. In the U.S., only 300 new child and adolescent \npsychiatrists are trained each year, despite projections by the Bureau \nof Health Professions that the shortage of child and adolescent \npsychiatrist will grow to 4,000 by the year 2020. Federal grant funding \nfor graduate psychology education has also been significantly reduced \nin the past two years, which could reduce the numbers of child and \nadolescent psychologists entering the profession.\n  Clearly something needs to be done to address this serious shortage \nin mental health professionals to meet the growing needs of our \nNation's youth. It is for this reason that I rise today with my \ncolleagues Senator Collins of Maine, Senator Leahy of Vermont, Senator \nDurbin of Illinois, Senator Reed of Rhode Island, Senator Harkin of \nIowa, Senator Stabenow of Michigan, Senator Dodd of Connecticut, and \nSenator Sanders of Vermont to offer The Child Health Care Crisis Relief \nAct of 2007. This bill creates incentives to help recruit and retain \nmental health professionals providing direct clinical care, and to help \ncreate, expand, and improve programs to train child mental health \nprofessionals. It provides loan repayments and scholarships for child \nmental health and school-based service professionals as well as \ninternships and field placements in child mental health services and \ntraining for paraprofessionals who work in children's mental health \nclinical settings. The bill also provides grants to graduate schools to \nhelp develop and expand child and adolescent mental health programs. It \nrestores the Medicare Graduate Medical Education Program for child and \nadolescent psychiatrists and extends the board eligibility period for \nresidents and fellows from 4 years to 6 years. Across all mental health \nprofessions, priority for loan repayments, scholarships, and grants is \ngiven to individuals and programs serving children and adolescents in \nhigh-need areas.\n  Finally, The Child Health Care Crisis Relief Act of 2007 requires the \nSecretary to prepare a report on the distribution and need for child \nmental health and school-based professionals, including disparities in \nthe availability of services, on a State-by-State basis. This report \nwill help Congress more clearly ascertain the mental health workforce \nneeds that are facing our Nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and my statement be \nprinted in the Record. I also ask unanimous consent that the appended \nletter from the Mental Health Liaison Group, representing 40 national \nprofessional and mental health advocacy organizations in support of The \nChild Health Care Crisis Relief Act of 2007, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, material was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1572\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Health Care Crisis \n     Relief Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Center for Mental Health Services estimates that 20 \n     percent or 13,700,000 of the Nation's children and \n     adolescents have a diagnosable mental disorder, and about \\2/\n     3\\ of these children and adolescents do not receive mental \n     health care.\n       (2) According to ``Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon \n     General'' in 1999, there are approximately 6,000,000 to \n     9,000,000 children and adolescents in the United States \n     (accounting for 9 to 13 percent of all children and \n     adolescents in the United States) who meet the definition for \n     having a serious emotional disturbance.\n       (3) According to the Center for Mental Health Services, \n     approximately 5 to 9 percent of United States children and \n     adolescents meet the definition for extreme functional \n     impairment.\n       (4) According to the Surgeon General's Report, there are \n     particularly acute shortages in the numbers of mental health \n     service professionals serving children and adolescents with \n     serious emotional disorders.\n\n[[Page S7346]]\n\n       (5) According to the National Center for Education \n     Statistics in the Department of Education, there are \n     approximately 479 students for each school counselor in \n     United States schools, which ratio is almost double the \n     recommended ratio of 250 students for each school counselor.\n       (6) According to the Bureau of Health Professions in 2000, \n     the demand for the services of child and adolescent \n     psychiatry is projected to increase by 100 percent by 2020.\n       (7) The development and application of knowledge about the \n     impact of disasters on children, adolescents, and their \n     families has been impeded by critical shortages of qualified \n     researchers and practitioners specializing in this work.\n       (8) According to the Bureau of the Census, the population \n     of children and adolescents in the United States under the \n     age of 18 is projected to grow by more than 40 percent in the \n     next 50 years from 70 million to more than 100 million by \n     2050.\n       (9) There are approximately 7,000 child and adolescent \n     psychiatrists in the United States. Only 300 child and \n     adolescent psychiatrists complete training each year.\n       (10) According to the Department of Health and Human \n     Services, minority representation is lacking in the mental \n     health workforce. Although 12 percent of the United States \n     population is African-American, only 2 percent of \n     psychologists, 2 percent of psychiatrists, and 4 percent of \n     social workers are African-American providers. Moreover, \n     there are only 29 Hispanic mental health professionals for \n     every 100,000 Hispanics in the United States, compared with \n     173 non-Hispanic white providers per 100,000.\n       (11) According to a 2006 study in the Journal of the \n     American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the \n     national shortage of child and adolescent psychiatrists \n     affects poor children and adolescents living in rural areas \n     the hardest.\n       (12) According to the National Center for Mental Health and \n     Juvenile Justice, 70 percent of youth involved in State and \n     local juvenile justice systems throughout the country suffer \n     from mental disorders, with at least 20 percent experiencing \n     symptoms so severe that their ability to function is \n     significantly impaired.\n\n     SEC. 3.

This important legislation will \n     address the national shortage of children's mental health \n     professionals, including school-based professionals, by \n     encouraging more individuals to enter these critical fields.\n       The Surgeon General estimates that over 13.7 million \n     children and adolescents are in need of treatment for \n     emotional and behavioral disorders but less than 20% ever \n     receive it. After the option of early intervention is lost, \n     the possibilities for a lifetime cycle of difficulties from \n     unresolved mental health issues looms ahead: school failure, \n     substance abuse, job and relationship instability, and even \n     the possibility of entering the criminal justice system.\n       One of the key barriers to treatment is the shortage of \n     available specialists trained in the identification, \n     diagnosis and treatment of children and adolescents with \n     emotional and behavioral disorders. Primary care providers \n     report seeing a large number of children and youth with \n     mental health problems, but have difficulty finding available \n     clinicians to take referrals. The Surgeon General reported in \n     1999 that ``there is a dearth of child psychiatrists, \n     appropriately trained clinical child psychologists, or social \n     workers.'' The shortage of children's mental health \n     professionals has also been recognized by the President's New \n     Freedom Commission on Mental Health, the Council on Graduate \n     Medical Education and the state mental health commissioners.\n       Enactment of the Child Health Care Crisis Relief Act will \n     spur the creation of educational incentives and federal \n     support for children's mental health training programs. It \n     will authorize scholarships, loan repayment programs, \n     training grants, and specialty training program support. \n     Children's mental health professionals covered under the bill \n     include child and adolescent psychiatrists, behavioral \n     pediatricians, psychologists, school psychologists, school \n     social workers, school counselors, psychiatric nurses, social \n     workers, marriage and family therapists and professional \n     counselors.\n       National organizations representing consumers, family \n     members, advocates, professionals and providers thank you for \n     your continued leadership on mental health issues.

A bill to promote public-private partnerships to strengthen \ninvestment in early childhood development for children from birth to \nentry into kindergarten in order to ensure healthy development and \nschool readiness for all children; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today, to introduce The Early \nChildhood Investment Act of 2007 to create and enhance public-private \npartnerships to strengthen investment in early childhood development \nprograms, considering the needs of all children from birth to their \nentry in kindergarten. Investing in our youngest children is essential \nto promote their healthy development and school readiness. I pleased \nthat two of my colleagues from Connecticut in the House of \nRepresentatives--Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro and Congressman Joe \nCourtney--will introduce companion legislation today.\n  We have a body of knowledge on early childhood development that must \nbe put into practice through policies that aid the crucial emotional, \nsocial and intellectual development that occurs in the first 3 years of \nlife. Research indicates that investments in the early years of a \nchild's life pay dividends later through improved health, readiness for \nschool, and economic well-being. The return on investment also includes \nmore successful transition to kindergarten; reduced special education \nand remedial education placements; better employment opportunities and \nhigher earnings; and lower incidence of crime and dependence on public \nwelfare. Our Nation's economy benefits from early childhood investments \nthrough a better prepared workforce, stronger growth, and a rising \nstandard of living. Additionally, society will benefit from less crime, \nenhanced schools, and children who are better prepared to participate \nas citizens in a democratic society, as a result of increased \ninvestments in early childhood development.\n  Many States have an Early Learning Council or an advisory council \nthat coordinates and aligns various programs serving children from \nbirth to kindergarten entry. These entities facilitate collaboration \namong early childhood development activities in each State, but do not \nnecessarily provide additional funding. Resources from Federal and \nState governments alone are not adequate to provide access to quality\n\n[[Page S7349]]\n\nearly childhood development programs for all children.\n  Currently the Federal Government provides funding for a variety of \nearly childhood development programs including the Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant, and Head Start, which have been essentially \nflat funded in recent years. States supplement this funding and also \nprovide funding for State and local prekindergarten programs and parent \ndevelopment and support programs, such as home visiting. However, the \nFederal and State resources alone are not enough to reach all of our \nNation's young children. In order to get closer to the goal of \nproviding access to quality programs for all children before they enter \nkindergarten, the private sector also plays an important role. In \naddition, the Federal Government should provide resources to reward \ninnovation at the state and community level and to leverage additional \nresources for continued innovation.\n  In States such as Washington, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Oklahoma, \nNorth Carolina, Arizona, Nebraska, Illinois, Vermont, and Virginia, \npublic-private partnerships leverage resources to provide for the \nvaried health and learning needs of children from birth to kindergarten \nentry and their families. Public-private partnerships have the ability \nto leverage the assets of public and private entities in terms of \nfinancial resources, expertise, and infrastructure in order to maximize \nand align investments in early childhood development. Federal funding \nauthorized by this legislation will create incentives for more States \nto develop such partnerships and leverage further investment in young \nchildren and enhance existing partnerships in states.\n  The purpose of the Early Childhood Investment Act of 2007 is to \nestablish or enhance existing public-private partnerships that will \nstrengthen investment in early childhood development by awarding grants \nto local community initiatives and programs that serve young children \nand their families.\n  The bill is fairly straightforward. It requires the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to establish a competitive grant program to \naward grants to a public-private partnership, in each State that \napplies, which will leverage resources to supplement existing State and \nFederal funds. The partnership will then award subgrants to State and \nlocal community initiatives to improve access to and quality of early \nchildhood development for children from birth through age five and \ntheir families. The partnerships will leverage funding from nonprofit \nor for-profit organizations, private entities and State government to \ninvest in high quality early childhood development programs.\n  The Early Childhood Investment Act of 2007 authorizes $8 billion for \nfiscal year 2008, $10 billion for fiscal year 2009 and such sums as \nnecessary in the following years. The Federal share represents 50 \npercent of total expenditures by a partnership in the first year, 40 \npercent in the second year and 30 percent in the outyears. I know I \nwill hear that this cost is too large for the government to bear, but I \nwould argue that the cost of not investing would be even greater. \nChildren represent only a quarter of our population, but they are 100 \npercent of our future and each of our children deserves an opportunity \nto reach his or her potential.\n  The bill has been endorsed by America's Promise Alliance, First \nFocus, National Association for the Education of Young Children, \nNational Association of Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies, and \nthe National Women's Law Center. I hope that my colleagues will join me \nin supporting this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. OBAMA:\n  S. 1574. A bill to establish Teaching Residency Programs for \npreparation and induction of teachers; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, we will soon begin consideration of \nlegislation to educate America's students, with Head Start, the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, and the Higher Education Act \nall slated for reauthorization. One of the most important aspects of No \nChild Left Behind is its provision for a highly qualified teacher for \nevery child, in every classroom in America.\n  Expert teachers are the most important educational resource in our \nschools, and also the most inequitably distributed. In the United \nStates, too many students in high-need schools are taught by \ninadequately prepared teachers, who are often not ready for the \nchallenges they face, and thus leave the classroom too soon. High-\npoverty schools lose one-fifth of their teaching staff each year. This \nconstant turnover of inexperienced, inadequately prepared teachers \nundermines efforts to create stable learning cultures and to sustain \nschool improvement, especially in schools with greatest need.\n  Many schools are being identified as in need of improvement, and many \nstudents are asked to be successful in schools where success is a rare \ncommodity. Rather than being a leader in a competitive world where \neducational attainment is precious, America has one of the lowest high \nschool graduation rates in the industrialized world. Three out of every \n10 ninth-grade students will not graduate on time, and about half of \nall African American and Hispanic ninth graders will not earn a diploma \nin four years. Less than 2 out of every 10 students who begin high \nschool will receive a postsecondary degree within a reasonable time. \nStudents of color, new immigrants, and children living in poverty are \nall being left behind. A good education is granted to some, but denied \nto others, denied not only to children of color in our cities, but also \nto children living in poverty in our rural areas. We must end this.\n  We must recruit the best and the brightest Americans to become \nteachers and we must transform teaching, restoring its luster as a \nprofession, so that when new teachers join it, they are successful, and \nwant to stay. As teachers and principals are increasingly being held \nindividually responsible for student success, it is increasingly \nimportant that we adequately prepare teachers to become successful.\n  Research shows that inexperienced teachers are less effective than \nteachers with several years of experience, but good preparation \nprograms can make novice teachers effective more rapidly. We must help \nnovice teachers get the training and coaching they need. Teacher \npreparation seldom provides the opportunity to learn under the \nsupervision of expert teachers working in schools that effectively \nserve high-need students. Most new teachers lack such support, and so \nleave the profession before achieving success.\n  Today I am proud to introduce the Teaching Residency Act, which \nbuilds on a successful model of teacher preparation similar to medical \nresidencies. Teaching Residency Programs are school-based teacher \npreparation programs in which prospective teachers teach alongside a \nmentor teacher for one academic year, receive master's level coursework \nin teaching the content area in which they will become certified, and \nattain certification prior to completion of the program. Once \ncertified, graduates of the program are placed in high-needs schools, \nand continue to receive strong mentoring and coaching for their first \nyears of teaching. This bill proposes establishing Teaching Residency \nPrograms as a provision of Title II of the Higher Education Act.\n  I am particularly proud to introduce this legislation today, because \nit is a model of effective teacher preparation that I have supported \nsince before I was elected to the Senate in 2004. I have seen the power \nof teacher residencies through the very successful Academy for Urban \nSchool Leadership in my home State of Illinois. And I am pleased to be \nsupported in this effort by the introduction of legislation in the \nHouse by my good friend, Congressman Rahm Emanuel.\n  It is critical to develop programs that increase the probability that \nrecruits will succeed and stay in those classrooms where they are most \nneeded. Teaching Residency Programs are based on what we know works \nbest to improve teacher preparation. We know that mentoring is critical \nto help young teachers develop in the early years of their career and \nto retain many of new teachers who would otherwise leave the profession \nin their first years. We cannot afford to lose any more high quality \nteachers because they do not feel supported or do not feel that they \nare progressing professionally.\n\n[[Page S7350]]\n\n  I hope my colleagues will support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Obama, Mr. \n        Bingaman, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 1576. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to improve the \nhealth and healthcare of racial and ethnic minority groups; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, serious and unjustified health \ndisparities continue to exist in our Nation today. Forty five million \nAmericans have no health insurance and often don't get the health care \nthey need or get it too late. We know that the uninsured are more \nlikely to delay doctor visits and needed screenings like mammograms and \nother early detection tests which can help prevent serious illness and \ndeath. The Institute of Medicine estimates that at least 18,000 \nAmericans die prematurely each year because they lack health coverage.\n  Some of the most shameful health disparities involve racial and \nethnic minorities. African Americans have a lower life expectancy than \nWhites. They are much more likely to die from stroke, and their \nuninsurance rates are much higher than those of their White \ncounterparts.\n  Many Americans want to believe such disparities don't exist, but \nignoring them only contributes more to the widening gap between the \nhaves and have-nots.\n  It is a scandal that people of color have greater difficulty \nobtaining good health care than other Americans. Your health should not \ndepend on the color of your skin, the size of your bank account, or \nwhere you live. In a nation as advanced as ours, with its state-of-the-\nart medical technology for preventing illness and caring for the sick, \nit is appalling that so many health disparities continue to exist.\n  That is the reason why I am introducing the Minority Health and \nHealth Disparity Elimination Act, as part of our effort to reduce or \neliminate these unacceptable differences in the health and health care \nof racial and ethnic minorities.\n  The bill includes grants and demonstration projects that will help \ncommunities promote positive health behaviors and improve outreach, \nparticipation, and enrollment of racial and ethnic minorities in \navailable health care programs. The bill will also establish \ncollaborative partnerships led by community health centers. In \nparticular it will support the Delta Health Initiative Rural Health, \nEducation, and Workforce Infrastructure Demonstration Program to \naddress longstanding, unmet health and health care needs in the \nMississippi Delta\n  In addition, the bill codifies the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention's Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health Program, \nso that this successful program can continue to assist communities to \nmobilize and organize resources to support effective and sustainable \nprograms to help close the health and health care gap. It also \nestablishes Health Action Zones to support State, tribal or local \ninitiatives to improve minority health in communities that have been \nhistorically burdened by health disparities.\n  Greater diversity in the health care workforce is essential to \ncreating a healthy America. Studies demonstrate that minority health \nprofessionals are more likely to care for minority patients, including \nthose who are low-income and uninsured. African Americans, Hispanic \nAmericans, and Native Americans account for only 6 percent of the \nNation's doctors and 5 percent of nurses and dentists, even though they \nare almost one-quarter of the U.S. population. The disparity in the \nhealth workforce must be closed, not just to fulfill our commitment to \nequality and opportunity, but also because of the impact it has on the \nhealth of America.\n  The act reauthorizes the title VII health care workforce diversity \nprograms, including the Centers of Excellence at Historically Black \nColleges and Universities and institutions that educate Hispanic and \nNative American students.\n  A diverse health care workforce is essential for a healthy country. \nEmphasizing workforce diversity does not mean that health care workers \nshould not be prepared to work with diverse patients. We must also make \na more serious effort to train culturally competent health care \nprofessionals, and to create a health care system that is accessible \nfor the more than 48 million Americans who speak a language other than \nEnglish at home. The bill creates an Internet clearinghouse to increase \ncultural competency and improve communication between health care \nproviders and patients. It also supports the development of curricula \non cultural competence in health professions schools.\n  Language barriers in health care obviously contribute to reduced \naccess and poorer care for those who have limited English proficiency \nor low health literacy. The legislation recognizes the importance of \nthis issue for the quality of our health care system and provides funds \nfor activities to improve and encourage services for such patients.\n  The bill reauthorizes the National Center for Minority Health and \nHealth Disparities that was created as part of the Minority Health and \nHealth Disparities Research and Education Act of 2000. It strengthens \nthe center's role in coordinating and planning research that focuses on \nminority health and health disparities at the National Institutes of \nHealth. The bill also requires the Agency for Health care Research and \nQuality to establish a grant program to support private research \ninitiatives and a public-private partnership to evaluate and identify \nthe best practices in disease management strategies and interventions.\n  In addition, the bill ensures that research on genetic variation \nwithin and between populations includes a focus on racial and ethnic \nminorities. It also promotes the participation of racial and ethnic \nminorities in clinical trials and intensifies efforts throughout the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to increase and apply knowledge \nabout the interaction of racial, genetic, and environmental factors \nthat affect people's health.\n  Finally, the bill reinforces and clarifies the duties of the Office \nof Minority Health and instructs the office to develop and implement a \ncomprehensive department-wide plan to improve minority health and \neliminate health disparities. It also encourages greater cooperation \namong federal agencies and departments in meeting these serious \nchallenges.\n  We have worked diligently with a wide variety of organizations on \nthis bill that are eager for strong legislation to eliminate health \ndisparities. The following groups have expressed their support: Aetna, \nAmerican Association of Colleges of Pharmacy, American Heart \nAssociation/American Stroke Association, American Public Health \nAssociation, Asian American and Pacific Islander Health Forum, \nAssociation for Community Affiliated Plans, Association of Minority \nHealth Professions Schools, California Pan-Ethnic Network, Charles R. \nDrew University of Medicine and Science, Families USA, Harvard Medical \nSchool, Massachusetts General Hospital, Meharry Medical College, \nMorehouse School of Medicine, National Association of Community Health \nCenters, National Association of Public Hospitals and Health Systems, \nNational Coalition for Hispanic Health--Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, \nHispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, League of United \nLatin American Citizens, National Council of La Raza, National Hispanic \nCaucus of State Legislators, National Hispanic Medical Association, \nNational Puerto Rican Coalition--National Council of La Raza, National \nHealth Law Program, National Hispanic Medical Association, National \nMedical Association, Network Health, Racial and Ethnic Health \nDisparities, REHDC, and Summit Health Institute for Research and \nEducation.\n  I look forward to working with these dedicated groups as we work \ntowards final passage of this bill.\n  I greatly appreciate the cooperation of Senator Cochran, Senator \nObama, Senator Bingaman, Senator Clinton, Senator Brown, and Senator \nDurbin on this legislation, and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to enact this much needed legislation.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, this Nation has witnessed dramatic \nimprovements in public health and health care technology and practice \nover the last century. Diseases that were once life-threatening are now \ncurable; conditions that once devastated are now treatable. Our Federal \ninvestment in\n\n[[Page S7351]]\n\nmedical research has paid off handsomely, with new and more effective \ntests and treatments and near daily reports of new scientific \nbreakthroughs. Yet still today too many Americans have not and will not \nderive full benefit from these advances.\n  We know that minority Americans and other vulnerable populations \nneedlessly continue to experience higher rates of disease and lower \nrates of survival, and this is simply unacceptable. As we in the \nCongress work to combat the serious health issues that threaten the \nwell-being of all Americans, we must also remain vigilant and committed \nin our fight to address the persistent and pervasive health disparities \nthat affect millions of minorities, low-income individuals and other \nat-risk populations.\n  Congress has passed legislation before to address the health of \nminority populations and eliminate health disparities--the Minority \nHealth and Health Disparities Research and Education Act of 2000. That \nbill created the National Center for Minority Health and Health \nDisparities, supported the landmark IOM report Unequal Treatment, \nrequired annual reporting on health care disparities by AHRQ, and \nstrengthened the research base for many HBCU's, among many other \nprovisions.\n  Since that bill passed, our knowledge and understanding about the \nroot causes of these disparities has dramatically increased. Efforts to \nstrengthen the research infrastructure needed to investigate health \nconcerns among people of color have been quite effective. Momentum has \nalso accelerated in the medical and public health communities as \nadvocates' voices are heard more and more, with new interventions being \nimplemented and evaluated. All of these positive steps and advances \nhave helped to raise minority health as a national priority. However, \ndespite this activity, much work remains to be done in order to close \nthe gap and eliminate health and health care disparities.\n  Study after study reveals the stark line of health disparity drawn \nbetween minorities and whites. In cancer alone, the numbers are hard to \noverlook. In 2004, African American men were 2.4 times as likely to die \nfrom prostate cancer, as compared to white men. For heart disease, the \nstatistics are equally compelling: 2004 data show that when compared to \nwhite men, African American men were 30 percent more likely to die from \nheart disease, and American Indian adults were 30 percent more likely \nto have high blood pressure.\n  The underlying factors for health disparities are multi-factorial. \nOur individual genetic makeup certainly contributes to differences in \nrates of disease and mortality in diverse populations. However, other \nfactors play an equal if not greater role. We know that minority and \nlow-income Americans are disproportionately less likely to live in \ncommunities that promote healthy behaviors and choices through access \nto wholesome foods and opportunities for physical activity, and that \nprotect from exposure to environmental toxins and violence. In \naddition, minority Americans are less likely to have health coverage \nand thus more likely to experience difficulties accessing the health \ncare system, which leads to delayed diagnoses and foregone care. And \nlast but not least, we know that minority Americans are less likely to \nreceive medical care that meets recommended or accepted standards of \npractice, when compared to White Americans. As an example, the American \nJournal of Public Health has reported that more than 886,000 deaths \ncould have been prevented from 1991 to 2000 if African Americans had \nreceived the same level of health care as Whites.\n  For all of these reasons, I am joining my colleagues Senator Kennedy \nand Senator Cochran in introducing the Minority Health Improvement and \nHealth Disparity Elimination Act of 2007. This critical legislation has \na number of important provisions to help us achieve our goal to improve \nthe health status of minority and other underserved populations. First, \nthis bill strengthens education and training in cultural competence and \ncommunication, which is the cornerstone of quality health care for all \npatients. It also reauthorizes the pipeline programs in title VII of \nthe Public Health Service Act, which seek to increase diversity in the \nhealth professions. We all know that the door to opportunity is only \nhalf open for minority students in the health professions. The \npercentage of minority health professionals is shockingly low--African \nAmericans, Hispanics and American Indians account for one-third of the \nNation's population but less than 10 percent of the Nation's doctors, \nless than 5 percent of dentists and only 12 percent of nurses. We can--\nand must--do better.\n  Lack of workforce diversity has serious implications for both access \nand quality of health care. Minority physicians are significantly more \nlikely to treat low-income patients, and their patients are \ndisproportionately minority. Studies have also shown that minority \nphysicians provide higher quality of care to minority patients, who are \nmore satisfied with their care and more likely to follow the doctor's \nrecommendations.\n  Second, this bill expands and supports a number of initiatives to \nincrease access to quality care. Specifically, the legislation \nauthorizes demonstration grants to improve access to healthcare, \npatient navigators, and health literacy education services. \nAdditionally, partnerships modeled after the Health Disparity \nCollaboratives at the Bureau of Primary Health Care are supported \nthrough established grants. The REACH program at Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention--designed to assist communities in mobilizing \nand organizing resources to support effective and sustainable programs \nto reduce health disparities--is established under this bill. And I am \npleased that the Health Action Zone Initiative has also been \nauthorized. This new environmental public health program was introduced \nas part of the Healthy Communities Act of 2007 that I introduced \nearlier this year, and guides and strengthens community efforts to \nimprove health in comprehensive and sustained fashion.\n  A third area of focus is expansion and acceleration of data \ncollection and research across the agencies, including the Agency for \nHealthcare Research and Quality and the National Institute of Health, \nwith special emphasis on translational research. The tremendous \nadvances in medical science and health technology, which have benefited \nmillions of Americans, have remained out of reach for too many \nminorities, and translational research will help to remedy this \nproblem. The National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities, \nwhich has a leadership role in establishing the disparities research \nstrategic plan at the National Institutes of Health, is reauthorized. \nAnd a new advisory committee has been established at the Food and Drug \nAdministration to focus on pharmacogenomics and its safe and \nappropriate use in minority populations, another issue area that I \nchampioned as part of my Genomics and Personalized Medicine Act of \n2006.\n  Last but not least, I want to highlight that the bill strengthens and \nclarifies the duties of the Office of Minority Health. This office has \nbeen critical in providing the leadership, expertise and guidance for \nhealth improvement activities across the agencies of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, and has helped to ensure coordination, \ncollaboration and integration of such efforts as well.\n  In conclusion, I want emphasize that it is past time to expand and \naccelerate our work in a of minority health beyond the initial \nbipartisan effort Congress achieved in 2000. We have got to translate \nthe knowledge we have gained into practical and effective interventions \nthat will improve minority health and eliminate disparities, and this \nbill will help us do just that.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring and passing this \ncritical legislation. Regardless of how you measure it, whether by \nneedless suffering, lost productivity, financial costs, or lives lost, \ndisparities in health and health care are a tremendous problem and a \nmoral imperative for our Nation, and one that is within our power to \naddress right now.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Kennedy, \nCochran, Bingaman, Obama, Durbin and Brown in introducing the Minority \nHealth Improvement and Health Disparity Elimination Act 2007.\n  As we debate health care issues, we often discuss what is wrong with \nour health care system: Costs are spiraling upward, the ranks of \nuninsured have\n\n[[Page S7352]]\n\nincreased, and the strains on our system and its ability to provide \nquality care have worsened. And while the impact of these situations \nare felt by all Americans, the problems with our health care system \noften disproportionately impact our racial and ethnic minority \npopulations.\n  We continue to have disparities in health care for our minority \npopulations--disparities in access, disparities in quality, and \ndisparities in outcomes. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality \n(AHRQ) tracks these in its annual National Healthcare Disparities \nReport, aggregating data from a variety of Federal health surveys and \ndatabases. And the findings from the report are staggering, inc1uding \nthe following: Minorities had worse access to care than whites; Blacks \nand Hispanics received poorer quality care than Whites on more than 70 \npercent of the measures used by AHRQ; and While gains were made on \napproximately one-quarter of the quality indicators, disparities \nactually got worse for all minority populations on one-third of the \nquality indicators.\n  These system wide disparities have translated into increased burden \nof disease for our racial and ethnic minority populations.\n  HIV/AIDS is devastating our African-American communities. Blacks \naccount for about half of all new HIV/AIDS diagnoses. In New York City, \nthe rate of new HIV diagnoses is six times higher among Blacks than \nWhites. In addition, the AIDS case rate among Hispanic populations is \nabout 3.5 times higher than that of Whites.\n  The incidence of asthma is highest among Puerto Rican populations, \nwith 22 percent of these individuals receiving a diagnosis of asthma, a \nrate roughly double that of White populations. Although African-\nAmericans have slightly higher rates of asthma than White populations, \nthey experience disparities in asthma management and access to care. \nThe emergency department visit rate for Blacks seeking asthma treatment \nwas 350 percent higher than that of the rates for Whites, while the \nhospitalization rate for Blacks with asthma was 240 percent higher than \nthat for Whites with asthma.\n  One out of every 10 Asian Americans will be diagnosed with diabetes. \nAmong all Americans with diabetes, Blacks are about two times more \nlikely to require amputations, two to five times more likely to have \nkidney disease, and twice as likely to suffer from diabetes-related \nblindness.\n  The impact of health disparities are experienced not only by racial \nand ethnic minority communities but by all of us. They are symptomatic \nof the underuse and misuse of health care. And the costs associated \nwith these disparities--such as delayed diagnoses and complications \nthat result from lack of access to primary care--add unnecessary costs \nto our health care system.\n  The Minority Health Improvement and Health Disparity Elimination Act \nof 2007 would allow us to address healthcare disparities through a \nvariety of mechanisms.\n  The bill will create a cultural competency clearinghouse, helping \nproviders to understand, first of all, the concept of cultural \ncompetence, and second, how to better tailor care to their patients of \ndiverse backgrounds. We cannot, for example, ask a person with diabetes \nto make changes to their diet if we do not understand what foods are \npart of their diet. Having a culturally competent health care system is \nespecially important in my home State of New York, where our residents \ncome from all over the world. With the information that will be \navailable in this clearinghouse, we will make it easier for both \npatients and providers to communicate and understand essential concepts \nof care.\n  The Minority Health Improvement and Health Disparity Elimination Act \nwill improve health professions programs that increase recruitment and \nretention of underrepresented minorities in the health professions. New \nYork's population is 15 percent Black and 15.6 percent Hispanic, yet \nthe percentage of Black physicians practicing in our State is 3.2 \npercent, and the percentage of Hispanic physicians practicing in our \nState is 2.3 percent. This bill will reauthorize the Centers of \nExcellence established by the Health Resources and Services \nAdministration, HRSA--a program that has benefited the Mt. Sinai School \nof Medicine--and establish new programs to train mid-career individuals \nin the health professions.\n  It will codify currently existing health promotion and disease \nprevention activities targeted toward racial and ethnic minorities, \nincluding the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Racial and \nEthnic Approaches to Community Health, REACH. REACH grantees working in \nnorthern Manhattan have managed to increase childhood immunization \nrates by 10 to 15 percent. It will also codify the Health Disparities \nCollaboratives program operated by HRSA, through which health centers \nacross the country focus on improving their treatments for specific \ndiseases, or implementing models to improve patient care. These centers \ninclude Whitney Young Health Center in Albany, NY, which, through this \ncollaborative, successfully helped more than 200 patients learn how to \nmanage their asthma.\n  The legislation will establish new programs to increase community \nhealth workers, address environmental health concerns, and improve \noutreach and enrollment, thus reducing barriers to accessing care. It \nwill increase support for the Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality's research into healthcare disparities and help to improve \noverall data collection.\n  The Minority Health Improvement and Health Disparity Elimination Act \nwill reauthorize the National Center for Minority Health and Health \nDisparities at the National Institutes of Health, which is designed to \nconduct and support health disparities research; disseminate \ninformation about disparities, and reach out to racial and ethnic \nminority disparity communities. Through the Center, New York University \nreceived support for its Center for the Study of Asian American Health, \na collaboration between researchers, health providers, and community \norganizations that is designed to reduce the disparities faced by Asian \nAmericans in New York City.\n  Finally, the legislation would reauthorize and strengthen the Office \nof Minority Health, OMH, at HHS, requiring it to develop a National \nAction Plan to address disparities in collaboration with other Federal \nhealth agencies. The OMH has provided support to New York's Office of \nMinority Health, as well as community-based organizations in Syracuse, \nBuffalo, and Lower Manhattan, and this reauthorization of the office \nwill allow them to support and sustain more programs at the State and \nlocal level.\n  I am excited about this legislation because I have seen what happens \nin communities when we come together--providers, researchers, and \nneighborhood leaders--to address these concerns. Last month, the \nUniversity of Rochester and the Monroe County Health Department \nannounced that an initiative to increase pneumococcal immunization \nrates in African-American seniors resulted in a more than 30-percent \ngain in immunization rates--protecting more New Yorkers against \npneumonia and reducing the vaccination disparity between Blacks and \nWhites.\n  I believe that the Minority Health Improvement and Health Disparity \nElimination Act will allow us to create, maintain, and support this \ntype of collaboration across the Nation. It will make a real change in \nthe health care for our minority communities and improve the quality of \ncare received by all Americans. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues in Congress to pass this legislation as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Abraham Lincoln once said, ``The \ndeclaration that `all men are created equal' is the great fundamental \nprinciple upon which our free institutions rest.''\n  As a Senator representing the distinguished land of Lincoln, I take \nseriously our Nation's promise for equality, particularly when it comes \nto health care.\n  I rise today as a strong and proud cosponsor of the Minority Health \nImprovement and Health Disparity Elimination Act of 2007--an important \npiece of legislation, long in the making, and long overdue.\n  Not since 2000 has our Congress made a concerted effort to address \nthe health of some of our most at-risk populations--people of color.\n\n[[Page S7353]]\n\n  In these 7 years, we have not seen a substantial improvement in the \nhealth status of people of color.\n  Cervical cancer, a disease that can be greatly reduced by effective \nhealth care, is five times more common among Vietnamese women in the \nUnited States than it is among Caucasian women.\n  African Americans with diabetes are seven times more likely to have \namputations and develop kidney failure than are Caucasians with \ndiabetes.\n  In Chicago's Latino community, you will likely find one in two Latino \nchildren who are obese, a condition that often leads to the onset of \ndiabetes.\n  In the hospitals of East St. Louis, it's likely that African-American \nbabies die at more than double the rate of White infants.\n  In the small town of Cairo, families have to travel hours to other \nparts of the State and sometimes even to other States to obtain the \nright care.\n  In general, we are making progress in prolonging life. Death rates \nfor Whites, African Americans, and Latinos from many of our most \ndebilitating diseases have declined during the last decade. But what \nprogress are we making on quality of life during those extra years? Is \nthe answer different depending on the racial or ethnic minority groups? \nSimply speaking, yes.\n  Even when controlling for insurance coverage and economic status, \nracial and ethnic minorities tend to have less access to health care \nand a lower quality of health care than their Caucasian counterparts.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that, \namong a wide range of health indicators, ``relatively little progress \nhas been made toward the goal of eliminating racial/ethnic \ndisparities.''\n  In general, yes, Americans are healthier, but the shameful gaps \nbetween minority groups and Caucasians remain nearly the same as a \ndecade ago.\n  When will we as a nation demand more and work harder to reach that \nideal of equality that is a pillar of our Nation's moral strength?\n  This legislation is a critical step toward achieving that notion of \nequality: the belief that we are all created equal and as such should \nhave equal access to quality care.\n  Why is it that this country spends so much more than any other \nindustrialized country on its health care, but has consistently lagged \nbehind other countries in delivering better health outcomes? Why is it \nthat one in six Americans, almost one in three African Americans, \nalmost one in two Latino Americans, are uninsured? Why do our health \noutcomes not reflect the $2 trillion investment we make in health care \neach year? There is a disconnect between the rhetoric around our \nNation's health crisis and where our resources are placed. It is a \nshame, and we can do better.\n  Our health workforce should reflect, understand, and respect the \nbackgrounds, experiences, and perspectives of the people it serves. We \nneed to recruit, train and retain health care professionals from \nunderrepresented groups and underserved areas.\n  In areas like downstate Illinois, small communities rely heavily on \nFederal incentives, such as loan repayment, the Health Careers \nOpportunity Program, and Centers of Excellence to create a critical \npipeline of professionals.\n  Graduates of title VII programs are more likely to serve in \nunderserved areas. That is the outcome we want, so we need to support \nsuccessful programs like these.\n  In addition to improving the diversity of our workforce, we need to \nredouble efforts to fight diseases that disproportionately affect \nracial and ethnic minorities--diseases like diabetes, heart disease, \nbreast cancer and so many others.\n  To accurately respond to the presence of health care disparities and \ntry to address them, we need better data on health care access and \nutilization that includes race, ethnicity, primary language, and socio-\neconomic status. To develop accurate solutions, we need accurate \ninformation on prevalence, contributing factors, and effects of health \ncare disparities.\n  The Minority Health Improvement and Health Disparity Elimination Act \nof 2007 is a critically important step toward improving the access, \nworkforce, research and information that will close the color gap that \nexists in health care today. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to improve the health of all Americans and, specifically, to \neliminate health disparities that hurt our communities of color, and \nall of us.\n  I did not always agree with the former majority leader, Senator \nWilliam H. Frist, but I couldn't agree more with his statement that, \n``Inequity is a cancer that can no longer be allowed to fester in \nhealth care.''\n  I urge my colleagues to support the health disparity legislation \nintroduced today.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself, Mr. Domenici, Mrs. McCaskill, Ms. \n        Stabenow, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Levin, and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 1577. A bill to amend titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security \nAct to require screening, including national criminal history \nbackground checks, of direct patient access employees of skilled \nnursing facilities, nursing facilities, and other long-term facilities \nand providers, and to provide for nationwide expansion of the pilot \nprogram for national and State background checks on direct patient \naccess employees of long-term care facilities or providers; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Patient Safety \nand Abuse Prevention Act with Senators Domenici, McCaskill, Stabenow, \nLincoln, Levin and Clinton.\n  This bill is supported by the Elder Justice Coalition, the National \nCitizens' Coalition for Nursing Home Reform, the American Association \nof Homes and Services for the Aging, AARP and many other organizations \ndedicated to protecting our Nation's vulnerable citizens. If enacted, \nthis legislation could help to prevent many of the tragic tales of \nphysical and financial elder abuse that we hear about from our \nconstituents and read about in our local newspapers. I strongly urge \nthis Congress to do what the States cannot: create a nationwide system \nof background checks for workers who care for our Nation's frail elders \nand those who are living with disabilities.\n  The vast majority of long-term care workers are selfless and \ndedicated. Yet there are a few with violent criminal histories who pose \na clear threat to the defenseless individuals needing long-term care \nservices. Under the disorganized, patchwork system of background checks \nthat exists today, employers trying to hire caregivers do not always \nknow which applicants have records of abuse or a history of committing \nviolent crimes. As a result, predators are sometimes hired to take care \nof our most vulnerable citizens, allowing them to work in situations \nwhere they can cause enormous harm. For example, in just the last 6 \nweeks, three stories of such elder abuse created headlines across the \ncountry:\n\n       Last year, Pat Torano, at the age of 89, was partially \n     paralyzed by a stroke. He realized he no longer could care \n     for his 95-year-old wife, who by then was blind and suffering \n     from dementia. Intent on staying at home, the Toranos \n     contracted with Visiting Angels, a network of private home-\n     care agencies that matches clients with caretakers. They \n     expected to find an honest professional to help them with \n     household chores and other non-medical needs. Instead they \n     got convicted felon Gina Treveno, who stole their house just \n     five months later by tricking the couple into placing the \n     deed in her name.\n       Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo today announced the \n     sentencing of William Morrison, a former aide at the Rome \n     Memorial Hospital Residential Health Care Facility, who was \n     convicted last month of raping and sexually assaulting a 90-\n     year-old resident of the nursing home. . . . The background \n     check would have revealed that Morrison was previously \n     convicted for one felony drug offense in 1992 and several \n     misdemeanors in the 1990s.\n       An 84-year-old man allegedly assaulted at a nursing home \n     last month is suing the facility, claiming it failed to \n     protect him from the employee accused of punching him in his \n     bed. Earl Gates of Bozeman claims Evergreen Bozeman Health \n     and Rehabilitation center didn't do a background check on his \n     accused attacker, Joshua Fowler, 23, who has a prior assault \n     conviction.\n\n  The bill that I am introducing today with Senators Domenici, \nStabenow, McCaskill, Lincoln, Levin, and Clinton proposes to take \naction to stop predators from working in all long-term care settings. \nIt would close gaping loopholes in our current system of background \nchecks through a nationwide expansion of a pilot program that Congress \nenacted as part of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003.\n\n[[Page S7354]]\n\n  Under the MMA, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has \nbeen conducting a pilot program in seven states to implement efficient, \nequitable systems that cost-effectively screen out certain applicants \nfor employment in long-term care facilities. Applicants excluded are \nthose whose backgrounds include findings of substantiated abuse and/or \na serious criminal history.\n  The seven pilot States are Alaska, Idaho, Illinois, Michigan, Nevada, \nNew Mexico and Wisconsin. These States have significant flexibility in \nseveral key areas under the grant. For example, each State establishes \nparameters for the definition of a ``direct patient access employee'' \nfor workers who must be checked, and defines specific criteria for \n``disqualifying'' crimes that prohibit a long-term care employer from \nhiring workers with such histories.\n  In other areas, the pilot States must meet Federal standards. They \nmust cover a broad range of long-term care providers, including nursing \nhomes, home health agencies and intermediate care facilities for the \nmentally retarded. States must require each applicant to submit a \nwritten statement disclosing any disqualifying information, and to \nauthorize a State and national criminal record check.\n  As is currently required under Federal law, providers must search any \navailable registry that is likely to contain disqualifying information \nabout an applicant. Forty-one States already require a criminal \nbackground check of some variety, mostly at the State level. The pilot \nStates have integrated their systems to coordinate these checks in a \nsingle streamlined process and added a Federal background check through \nthe FBI's Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System. \nApplicants who are subsequently found to have a record of substantiated \nabuse or a serious criminal history cannot be hired. But individuals \nwho are denied employment can appeal the background check results. \nFinally, facilities can use the results of the background checks only \nfor the purpose of determining suitability of employment.\n  That is the basic structure of the pilot program that Congress \nenacted 4 years ago. Since then, we have learned important lessons from \nthe pilot States' experiences. For example, federal funds have been \nused for a variety of purposes. States have used pilot funds to hire \nnew staff to administer background checks; to purchase mobile digital \nscanners; to pay for the cost of fingerprint checks; to provide \ntechnical assistance to facilities; and to build online systems that \napplicants and providers can readily access, and which serve to \nintegrate information from various registries and entities, and as \nstorage and retrieval systems.\n\n  States have passed legislation under the pilot program that treat \ndisqualifying crimes somewhat differently. For example, Michigan has \ncreated a tiered system, under which certain disqualifying crimes carry \ntime-limited prohibitions on working in long-term care facilities. By \ncomparison, Wisconsin has chosen to enact legislation defining \ndisqualifying crimes as those that carry a lifetime ban only. Alaska \nhas established a ``variance'' process to permit certain individuals to \nwork who have committed crimes but who have subsequently shown evidence \nof recovery. Similarly, in Idaho, some disqualifying crimes result in \nan ``unconditional'' denial that carries a lifetime ban on working in \nlong-term care settings, while others result in ``conditional'' denials \nthat apply to less serious crimes that may be waived under certain \ncircumstances, following an ``exemption review'' by the Department of \nHealth and Welfare.\n  The data on results from the pilot programs are impressive. Among the \nseven States, Michigan's information is the most complete. In the first \nyear of operation, Michigan excluded more than 3,000 people with \nrecords of abuse or a disqualifying criminal history. As of April 30, \n2007, 625 of these were excluded through a fingerprint check. Twenty-\nfive percent of these exclusions were identified through an FBI check \nonly, a fact that State officials believe indicates that these \nindividuals committed crimes in other States, or have been avoiding \nprosecution within the State. Information for Nevada, while less \ncomplete, suggests similar results. As of last December, Nevada was \nidentifying an even higher percentage of individuals with criminal \nhistories on the basis of an FBI check only.\n  The director of Michigan's workforce background check program, Orlene \nChristie, recently testified before the Special Committee on Aging \nabout the State's program. ``The applicants that have been excluded \nfrom employment are not the types of people Michigan could ever allow \nto work with our most vulnerable citizens,'' she said. ``We have \nprevented hardened criminals that otherwise would have access to our \nvulnerable population from employment.''\n  Ms. Christie also noted that ``of the criminal history reports \nexamined, fraudulent activity and controlled substance violations \naccount for 25 percent of all disqualifying crimes. Fraudulent activity \nincludes such things as embezzlement, identity theft, and credit card \nfraud. This is particularly alarming giving the projected increase in \nfinancial abuse of the elderly.''\n  Importantly, Michigan has implemented a ``rap back'' system where the \nMichigan State Police notifies the health agency of any subsequent \narrest, which in turn notifies the employer. This is a key component of \nthe bill we are introducing today. It will allow the States, as well as \nthe FBI, to ensure that an employer will be automatically notified as \nsoon as a worker's criminal history record is updated.\n  To find out what providers think of the pilot program, Idaho \nconducted a survey of participating facilities, which found 87 percent \nbelieved the background checks were successfully screening out workers \nwho shouldn't be hired. Additionally, 63 percent said that the quality \nof employees hired has improved since the pilot began.\n  The pilot program demonstrates that participating States are \nsuccessfully excluding individuals who have a history of abuse or a \ndisqualifying criminal background. If this model is expanded, the \nresulting nationwide system would greatly enhance the probability of \nidentifying individuals with criminal backgrounds who can now easily \nescape detection. If all States had parallel, multi-level, \ncomprehensive systems in place, very few potentially abusive workers \nwould be hired into positions of caring for the extremely vulnerable \nresidents of our Nation's long-term care facilities.\n  The MMA pilot program is scheduled to end this September. I urge the \nSenate not to let this initiative simply expire. Rather, I hope that we \nwill take the logical step of expanding on the success of this program, \nand provide limited federal funding for all other States to create \nsimilar programs. The Patient Safety and Abuse Prevention Act also lays \nout sensible standards for creating a nationwide system that will \nprevent predators, who now go undetected, from being hired into \npositions where they can harm society's most vulnerable people. I \nsincerely hope that all of my colleagues will join me in this effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill and supporting material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, material was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1577\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Frail elders are a highly vulnerable population who \n     often lack the ability to give consent or defend themselves. \n     Since the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior, \n     individuals with histories of abuse pose a definite risk to \n     patients and residents of long-term care facilities.\n       (2) Every month, there are stories in the media of health \n     care employees who commit criminal misconduct on the job and \n     are later found, through a background check conducted after \n     the fact, to have a history of convictions for similar \n     crimes.\n       (3) A 2006 study conducted by the Department of Health and \n     Human Services determined that--\n       (A) criminal background checks are a valuable tool for \n     employers during the hiring process;\n       (B) the use of criminal background checks during the hiring \n     process does not limit the pool of potential job applicants;\n       (C) ``a correlation exists between criminal history and \n     incidences of abuse''; and\n       (D) the long-term care industry supports the practice of \n     conducting background\n\n[[Page S7355]]\n\n     checks on potential employees in order to reduce the \n     likelihood of hiring someone who has potential to harm \n     residents.\n       (4) In 2005, the Michigan Attorney General found that 10 \n     percent of employees who were then providing services to \n     frail elders had criminal backgrounds.\n       (5) In 2004, the staffs of State Adult Protective Services \n     agencies received more than 500,000 reports of elder and \n     vulnerable adult abuse, and an ombudsman report concluded \n     that more than 15,000 nursing home complaints involved abuse, \n     including nearly 4,000 complaints of physical abuse, more \n     than 800 complaints of sexual abuse, and nearly 1,000 \n     complaints of financial exploitation;\n       (6) The Department of Health and Human Services has \n     determined that while 41 States now require criminal \n     background checks on certified nurse aides prior to \n     employment, only half of those (22) require criminal \n     background checks at the Federal level.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) create a coordinated, nationwide system of State \n     criminal background checks that would greatly enhance the \n     chances of identifying individuals with problematic \n     backgrounds who move across State lines;\n       (2) stop individuals who have a record of substantiated \n     abuse, or a serious criminal record, from preying on helpless \n     elders and individuals with disabilities; and\n       (3) provide assurance to long-term care employers and the \n     residents they care for that potentially abusive workers will \n     not be hired into positions of providing services to the \n     extremely vulnerable residents of our Nation's long-term care \n     facilities.\n\n     SEC. 3.

I oversee the Workforce \n     Background Check Program.\n       In 2004, Governor Jennifer Granholm and the Michigan \n     Department of Community Health (MDCH) Director Janet \n     Olszewski proposed strong requirements to assure the health \n     and safety of Michigan citizens in long-term care facilities. \n     This project is a priority for the Governor and the \n     Department Director. Working cooperatively with the Michigan \n     Legislature, the Office of Attorney General, and the Centers \n     for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS), Michigan \n     successfully implemented the Workforce Background Check \n     Program. Through a competitive process, Michigan secured from \n     CMS a $3.5 million grant to create an effective statewide \n     background check system.\n       Through the passage of Public Acts 27 and 28 of 2006, \n     Michigan laws were enhanced and\n\n[[Page S7359]]\n\n     improved to require all applicants for employment that would \n     have direct access to our most vulnerable populations--the \n     elderly and disabled--to undergo a background check. \n     Additionally, all employees who were hired before the \n     effective date of April 1, 2006, would need to be \n     fingerprinted within 24 months of the enactment of the laws.\n       Before the new laws were passed, only some employees in \n     nursing homes, county medical care facilities, homes for the \n     aged, and adult foster care facilities required some type of \n     background check. Prior to 2006, the background checks were \n     less comprehensive and primarily included a ``name-based'' \n     check of the Internet Criminal History Tool (ICHAT). The FBI \n     fingerprint check was only required for employees residing in \n     Michigan for less than three (3) years. The previous law also \n     did not require all employees with direct access to residents \n     in long-term care facilities to undergo a background check. \n     Further, for those persons who were subject to a background \n     check, there was no systematic process across the multiple \n     health and human service agencies to conduct the checks, to \n     disseminate findings, or to follow through on results.\n       With Michigan's expansion of the laws, all individuals with \n     direct access to residents' personal information, financial \n     information, medical records, treatment information or any \n     other identifying information are now also required to be \n     part of Michigan's Workforce Background Check Program in \n     addition to individuals providing direct services to \n     patients. The scope of the checks was also enhanced to \n     include hospice, psychiatric hospitals, and hospitals with \n     swing beds, home health, and intermediate care facility/\n     mental retardation (ICFs/MR).\n\n\n                      how our program/system works\n\n       Michigan created a Web based application that integrates \n     the databases for the available registries and provides a \n     convenient and effective mechanism for conducting criminal \n     history checks on prospective employees, current employees, \n     independent contractors and those granted clinical privileges \n     in facilities and agencies covered under the new laws.\n       Further, the online workforce background check system is \n     designed to eliminate unnecessary fingerprinting through a \n     screening process.\n       As of April 1, 2006, 98,625 applicants had been screened \n     through Michigan's Workforce Background Check Program. Of the \n     61,474 applicants that prompted the full background check, \n     3,262 were deemed unemployable and excluded from potential \n     hiring pools due to information found on state lists such as \n     ICHAT, (U.S. HHS Exclusion List) OIG exclusion list, the \n     nurse aid registry, the sex offender registry, the offender \n     tracking information system, and the FBI list.\n       The applicants that have been excluded from employment are \n     not the types of people Michigan could ever allow to work \n     with our most vulnerable citizens. We have prevented hardened \n     criminals that otherwise would have access to our vulnerable \n     population from employment.\n       As Michigan's demographic profile mirrors that of the \n     nation, the offenses that disqualify individuals from \n     employment in long-term care under the new laws are expected \n     to also be similar across the United States.\n       Of the criminal history reports examined, fraudulent \n     activity and controlled substance violations account for 25 \n     percent of all disqualifying crimes. Fraudulent activity \n     includes such things as embezzlement, identity theft, and \n     credit card fraud. This is particularly alarming giving the \n     projected increase in financial abuse of the elderly.\n       Accessible to long-term care providers through a secure ID \n     and password, a provider is easily able to log onto the \n     workforce background check online system to conduct a check \n     of a potential employee. If no matches are found on the \n     registries, the applicant goes to an independent vendor for a \n     digital live scan of their fingerprints. The prints are then \n     submitted to the Michigan State Police and then to the FBI. \n     If there is a ``hit'' on the state or national database \n     search, a notice is sent to either the Michigan Department of \n     Community Health or the Michigan Department of Human Services \n     for staff analysts to examine the applicant's criminal \n     history.\n       Michigan has also implemented a ``rap back'' system where \n     the Michigan State Police notifies one of the two state \n     agencies of a subsequent arrest and in turn the agency \n     notifies the employer. This way we can ensure that in real \n     time, as soon as the criminal history record is updated \n     (arrest, charge or conviction), the department and employer \n     are also notified.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       As a result of Michigan's Workforce Background Check \n     Program, the health and safety of Michigan's vulnerable \n     population is protected by ensuring that adequate safeguards \n     are in place for background screenings of direct care service \n     workers.\n       While the vast majority of health care workers are \n     outstanding individuals who do a wonderful job caring for \n     people in need, we are extremely pleased that Michigan's \n     Workforce Background Check Program has stopped more than \n     3,000 people with criminal histories from possibly preying on \n     our most vulnerable citizens. By building an appeals process, \n     we have also developed a fair system for reviewing inaccurate \n     criminal records or convictions.\n       As you can see, Michigan has been leading the way in the \n     area of employee background checks. As I indicated, this \n     project has been a priority of Governor Jennifer Granholm and \n     Michigan Department of Community Health Director Janet \n     Olszewski. We appreciate this opportunity to share this \n     information with you today and look forward to our continued \n     cooperation on this vital topic.\n       Thank you.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                       NCCNHR,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 16, 2007.\n     Hon. Herb Kohl,\n     Chairman, Special Committee on Aging,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kohl: NCCNHR, The National Consumer Voice for \n     Quality Long-Term Care, strongly endorses and supports the \n     Patient Safety and Abuse Prevention Act of 2007.\n       The Patient Safety and Abuse Prevention Act would close \n     critical loopholes in the protection of nursing home \n     residents and other long-term care recipients by requiring \n     national criminal background checks on all workers who have \n     direct access to residents. Today, in most states, long-term \n     care providers are not required to conduct interstate \n     criminal background checks on any workers, and where \n     background checks are carried out, they are usually confined \n     to nursing assistants. Enactment of your legislation will \n     ensure that both licensed and unlicensed workers with \n     histories of criminal abuse do not move from job to job and \n     state to state while continuing to injure and exploit their \n     vulnerable charges.\n       NCCNHR and its members across the United States wish to \n     thank you for pursuing this important legislation, and we \n     look forward to working with you to ensure its passage.\n           Sincerely,\n     Alice H. Hedt,\n       Executive Director.\n     Janet C. Wells,\n       Director of Public Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                         AARP,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 6, 2007.\n     Hon. Herbert H. Kohl,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kohl: AARP is very pleased to support the \n     bipartisan Patient Safety and Abuse Prevention Act of 2007 \n     that you are sponsoring with Senator Domenici. We truly \n     appreciate your leadership and applaud your advocacy for \n     national criminal background checks for long-term care \n     employees.\n       Individuals with criminal convictions or histories of abuse \n     can pose a significant risk to persons receiving long-term \n     care. A system of national criminal background checks is \n     especially critical, given the mobility of today's workers, \n     the turnover in the long-term care workforce, and the fact \n     that it is not unusual for individuals to work in multiple \n     states.\n       Your bill takes important steps to protect individuals in \n     both home-and community-based and institutional settings by \n     establishing a system of screening and national criminal \n     history background checks, including an FBI fingerprint \n     check. These background checks would apply to employees of \n     long-term care providers receiving Medicare or Medicaid funds \n     whose duties involve or may involve one-on-one contact with \n     individuals receiving long-term care. Penalties would apply \n     if providers knowingly hire or continue to employ an \n     individual with a conviction for a relevant crime or a \n     finding of substantiated abuse of an individual receiving \n     long-term care.\n       This legislation builds on the framework of the criminal \n     background check pilot program included in the Medicare \n     Modernization Act and gives states resources to put in place \n     the infrastructure for criminal background checks. This bill \n     includes many important provisions, and we want to continue \n     working with you to ensure that long-term care employers \n     provide adequate direct supervision of employees during \n     provisional employment or an appeal. In addition, we want to \n     improve the balance in accountability between states and \n     providers in the legislation. We appreciate your willingness \n     to work with AARP on this bill.\n       This bill would make significant strides in protecting \n     individuals across the country receiving long-term care \n     services and we look forward to working with you and your \n     colleagues on both sides of the aisle to advance this \n     important initiative. If there are any further questions, \n     please feel free to call me or have your staff contact Rhonda \n     Richards of our Federal Affairs staff.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              David P.

Herb Kohl,\n     Chairman, Special Committee on Aging,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kohl: On behalf of the Wisconsin Board on \n     Aging and Long Term Care, I am pleased to express our support \n     for the Patient Safety and Abuse Prevention Act of 2007.\n       The Patient Safety and Abuse Prevention Act would offer \n     substantially increased protection for consumers of long-term \n     care by requiring a national criminal background check on all \n     caregivers who come into direct contact with residents. \n     Today, long-term\n\n[[Page S7360]]\n\n     care providers often are not required to do interstate \n     criminal background checks on workers. Where background \n     checks are done, they are often limited to nursing \n     assistants. This overlooks the possibility that licensed \n     professional staff and ancillary workers such as dietary or \n     housekeeping staff who may have criminal histories could be \n     employed to deliver resident care. It is imperative that \n     Congress ensure that workers with histories of criminal abuse \n     cannot move from state to state with impunity while \n     continuing to work in a ``target-rich environment.''\n       As well, the bill's provisions addressing the need for \n     assistance by CMS in funding the costs of obtaining the \n     interstate background checks and the requirement that states \n     notify employers of subsequent offenses by previously cleared \n     workers are welcome additions to the system. These provisions \n     will tighten the net and make it even more difficult for \n     workers with backgrounds of criminal misappropriation of \n     property, abuse, and neglect to find a place providing care \n     to our vulnerable elders.\n       As the Executive Director of the Wisconsin Board on Aging \n     and Long Term Care, I thank you for pursuing this important \n     legislation, and I look forward to working with you to ensure \n     its passage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              George F.

Herbert H. Kohl,\n     Chairman, Special Committee on Aging,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Kohl: On behalf of the 542-member Elder \n     Justice Coalition (EJC), I applaud you on the planned \n     introduction of the Patient Safety and Abuse Prevention Act \n     of 2007. The Elder Justice Coalition has long supported your \n     efforts to secure passage of legislation to ensure that \n     employees of long-term care facilities or providers do not \n     have criminal records or other histories of abusive conduct \n     that could lead to endangering facility residents and others \n     receiving long-term care.\n       Since the Elder Justice Act, as introduced in the 110th \n     Congress (S. 1070), does not include background check \n     provisions, we are pleased that you will be introducing this \n     important bill. We commend your leadership and steadfast \n     commitment to protecting individuals who need long-term care \n     from abuse, neglect, and exploitation, and for your \n     leadership on other issues concerning the nation's older \n     population.\n       Thank you also for being an original co-sponsor of the \n     Elder Justice Act. Please let us know how we can be \n     supportive of your continued work for elder justice.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Robert B. Blancato,\n                                             National Coordinator.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE (for himself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 1578. A bill to amend the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance \nPrevention and Control Act of 1990 to establish vessel ballast water \nmanagement requirements, and or other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the United States has more than 95,000 \nmiles of coastline, and its ocean territory is larger than the combined \nland area of all 50 States. We rely on our oceans for such diverse \nbenefits as recreation, food, transportation, and energy. All \nAmericans, regardless of whether they reside in the Nation's heartland \nor along the coast, are impacted by the ocean.\n  That is why I rise today, joined by Vice Chairman Ted Stevens and \nseveral other Commerce Committee colleagues, in introducing a group of \nbills to provide for sustainable use and protection of our ocean and \ncoastal areas.\n  Our oceans and coasts provide us with tremendous economic and \nrecreational opportunities. It is critical that use of ocean resources \nand coasts is sustainable and that we address the many existing and \nemerging risks to their well-being. As the U.S. Commission on Ocean \nPolicy has thoroughly documented, our oceans and coasts are faced with \nmany threats, including those posed by pollution, increasing population \ngrowth and coastal development, overfishing, climate change, and ocean \nacidification. All of the bills my colleagues and I are introducing \ntoday implement recommendations of the Ocean Commission.\n  First, the Coral Reef Conservation Amendments Act of 2007 would \nreauthorize the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000 and provide \ncritical authorities for preserving, restoring, and managing in a \nsustainable manner our coral reef ecosystems. Coral reefs are one of \nthe oldest and most diverse ecosystems on the planet, and they provide \nenvironmental and economic benefits such as shoreline protection as \nwell as critical habitat for approximately half of all federally-\nmanaged fisheries.\n  Second, the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act Amendments of 2007 \nwould reauthorize and strengthen authorities to survey and analyze the \nphysical condition of our Nation's coasts and waterways, along with \nelements that impact safe navigation. Conducting surveys of our \nNation's coasts and waterways is a core mission for the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration and provides valuable services \nto the maritime industry and to Federal agencies responsible for \nmaritime transportation, homeland security, and emergency response.\n  Third, the Ballast Water Management Act of 2007 would amend the \nNonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 and \nestablish ballast water management requirements to mitigate the \nintroduction and spread of invasive species from ships. The bill would \nalso seek to prevent the introduction of invasive species from ship \nequipment or hulls. Invasive species brought into the United States \nfrom other countries have caused billions of dollars in damage to the \nU.S. economy.\n  In addition to the initiatives I have highlighted, a number of other \nocean-related bills are being introduced today by colleagues on the \nCommerce Committee. These include a bill by Senator Lautenberg to \nestablish a much-needed Federal program to conduct research, \nmonitoring, and education to examine the processes and consequences of \nocean acidification, and a bill by Senator Snowe to reauthorize the \nCoastal Zone Management Act.\n  This week we celebrate Capitol Hill Ocean Week. Many organizations \nand agencies are using this opportunity to educate and raise public \nawareness about the impact of our oceans on our society and economy. \nThe bills that my colleagues and I are introducing today address many \nof those needs being highlighted. I urge my Senate colleagues to \nsupport the Commerce Committee's bipartisan efforts to improve the \nhealth and management of our oceans and coasts.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1578\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Ballast Water Management Act \n     of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Section 1002(a) of the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance \n     Prevention and Control Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 4701(a)) is \n     amended--\n       (1) by redesignating paragraphs (14) and (15) as paragraphs \n     (15) and (16);\n       (2) by inserting after paragraph (13) the following:\n       ``(14) aquatic nuisance species may be introduced by other \n     vessel conduits, including the hulls of ships;\n       (3) by striking ``inland lakes and rivers by recreational \n     boaters, commercial barge traffic, and a variety of other \n     pathways; and'' in paragraph (15), as redesignated, and \n     inserting ``other areas of the United States, including \n     coastal areas, inland lakes, and rivers by recreational \n     boaters, commercial traffic, and a variety of other \n     pathways;'';\n       (4) by inserting ``nongovernmental entities, institutions \n     of higher education, and the private sector,'' after \n     ``governments,'' in paragraph (16), as redesignated;\n       (5) by striking ``technologies.'' in paragraph (16), as \n     redesignated, and inserting ``technologies;''; and\n       (6) adding at the end the following:\n       ``(17) in 2004, the International Maritime Organization \n     agreed to a Convention, which the United States played an \n     active role in negotiating, to prevent, minimize, and \n     ultimately eliminate the transfer of aquatic nuisance species \n     through the control and management of ballast water and \n     sediments;\n       ``(18) the International Maritime Organization agreement \n     specifically recognizes that countries can take more \n     stringent measures than those of the Convention with respect \n     to the control and management of ships' ballast water and \n     sediment; and\n       ``(19) due to the interstate nature of maritime \n     transportation and the ways by which aquatic nuisance species \n     may be transferred by vessels, a comprehensive and uniform \n     national approach for addressing vessel-borne aquatic \n     nuisance species is needed to address this issue \n     effectively.''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Coastal Zone Management Act; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Coastal Zone \nEnhancement Reauthorization Act of 2007. I am pleased to have my \ncolleague, Senator Cantwell, join me in cosponsoring this bill, which \nwill enable our Nation to improve the management of our valuable, yet \nvulnerable, coastal resources.\n  More than half of all Americans reside in coastal zones, and each \nyear their number grows by more than 3,600. Yet, coastal regions \ncomprise just 17 percent of the land area in the contiguous United \nStates. People are drawn to our oceans and Great Lakes to experience \nthe economic opportunities, natural beauty, and recreational bounty \nthat these regions have to offer. Part of that value, both the tangible \nand intangible, comes from the habitat these ecosystems provide for a \nvariety of plants and animals, ranging from rare microscopic organisms \nto commercially valuable fish stocks. As population pressures increase, \nwe must work diligently to maintain a balance between human use of \nthese delicate regions and their natural, ecological functions.\n  When Congress passed the CZMA in 1972, it established a unique State-\nFederal framework for facilitating sound coastal planning. The law \ngives States the opportunity to create a coastal zone management plan \nwhich, once approved, makes States eligible for matching Federal funds \nto carry out the goals of its plan. This system allows States to tailor \nplans to their individual needs, but permits the Federal Government to \nensure that marine resources, which often overlap political boundaries, \nare managed responsibly nationwide. As a result of this program's \nsuccess, more than 99.9 percent of the United States' 95,376 shoreline \nmiles are managed under this system, including, 34 of the 35 coastal \nand Great Lakes states and territories. The 35th, Illinois, has \nsubmitted a plan for Federal approval.\n  The CZMA has not been reauthorized in over a decade, and the program \nhas been operating with authorization levels and mandates that expired \nin 1999. Much has changed in the interim, and persistent threats to \ncoastal areas, such as increasing rates of nonpoint source water \npollution and constriction of working waterfront areas, have out-paced \nstates' abilities to maintain an appropriate balance between \ndevelopment and conservation. The Coastal Zone Enhancement \nReauthorization Act of 2007 would encourage states to take additional \nvoluntary steps to combat these problems through the Coastal Community \nProgram.\n  Each year, we also learn more about threats to our coasts from \nimpacts of global climate change, yet the CZMA currently provides no \nfoundation to manage these problems. Mounting evidence indicates that \nincreasing concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide, approximately \na third of which is absorbed in our oceans, is affecting marine \nchemistry and acidifying sea water. As global temperatures rise, we are \nalso experiencing an increase in ocean temperatures which can affect \nthe migratory patterns and range of marine species distribution. The \nproblems of potential sea level rise have also been well-documented in \nacademic journals and the mainstream media. The bill I introduce today \ncontains a provision giving states the authority to adapt their coastal \nzone management plans to address these potential impacts and develop \npotential mitigation and adaptation measures.\n  The Coastal Zone Enhancement Reauthorization of 2007 also \nsignificantly increases the authorization levels for the Coastal Zone \nManagement Program, enabling States to better achieve their coastal \nmanagement goals. The bill authorizes $170 million for fiscal year 2008 \nand increases the authorization levels to $193.5 million for fiscal \nyear 2012. This adjustment in funding\n\n[[Page S7367]]\n\nwould enable the States' coastal programs to achieve their full \npotential.\n  The Coastal Zone Management Program has a long record of helping \nstates achieve their coastal area management goals by enhancing their \nability to maintain clean, safe, and productive coastlines that \nultimately serve the best interest of our Nation. This program enjoys \nwidespread support among coastal States, as demonstrated by the near \nunanimous participation by eligible States, and the many Commerce \nCommittee members who have worked with me to strengthen this program \nover the past several years.\n  I am pleased to introduce this legislation that would provide our \ncoastal states with the funding and management frameworks necessary to \nmeet the ever-increasing conservation and development challenges facing \nour coastal communities, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Additionally, as Ranking Member of the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation's subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, \nFisheries, and Coast Guard, I would like to commend my colleagues for \ntheir hard work that has resulted in today's introduction of six ocean-\nrelated bills. As you are aware, we are in the midst of Capitol Hill \nOceans Week, and I am pleased that we can commemorate that occasion by \nbringing these critical marine issues to the fore. I look forward to \nworking with my fellow Committee members and the rest of the Senate as \nwe improve management of our Nation's invaluable coastal and ocean \nresources for the benefit of all Americans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1579\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish an interagency committee to develop an \nocean acidification research and monitoring plan and to establish an \nocean acidification program within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would establish a comprehensive Federal research plan and program \nto address ocean acidification, which poses a growing threat to the \nhealth of our oceans.\n  Our oceans help reduce global warming by absorbing carbon dioxide \nfrom the atmosphere. To date, about one-third of all human-generated \ncarbon emissions have dissolved into the ocean. However, the increase \nin carbon dioxide lowers ocean pH, and causes the oceans to become more \nacidic. This increase in acidity is corrosive to marine shells and \norganisms that form the base of the food chain for many fish and marine \nmammals. These changes in ocean chemistry also threaten coral reef \necosystems, habitats so rich in biodiversity they are called he rain \nforests of the sea. Even a mild increase in ocean acidity could make \nthese organisms more vulnerable to disease, pollution and other \nenvironmental stresses. If the acidic conditions increase \nsignificantly, marine shells could actually begin to dissolve.\n  Ocean acidification demands our immediate attention. Current \nprojections of carbon dioxide emissions suggest that the acidity of our \noceans is likely to accelerate significantly in the coming years. NOAA \nscientists have said that ocean acidity has increased 30 percent since \nthe industrial revolution and they estimate by the end of this century \nthe acidity of the oceans may increase 150 percent. They also project \nthat current trends could result in a decrease in ocean pH to the \nlowest levels in 20 million years.\n  Ocean acidification threatens our marine ecosystems and could result \nin significant social and economic costs. The rich biodiversity of \nmarine organisms is an important contribution to the national economy \nproviding food, tourism, and aesthetic benefits, but they are \nvulnerable to human activity. Ocean acidification threatens fish and \nall calcifying organisms including corals, scallops, clams, crabs, \nlobsters, and plankton.\n  It is important to note the potential economic impacts of ocean \nacidification. Coastal and marine commercial fishing generates upwards \nof $30 billion per year and employs nearly 70,000 people. Many of these \nfisheries also rely upon healthy coral habitats. Increased ocean \nacidification reduces the ability of corals and shellfish to produce \ntheir skeletons. Globally, coral reefs are home to more than 4,000 \nkinds of fish, and generate $30 billion per year in fishing, tourism, \nand protection to coasts from storms. Scientists have estimated that, \ndue to excess carbon dioxide in the oceans, corals may be unable to \nform their skeletons by mid-century, and could begin to dissolve by the \nend of this century. Destroying these ecosystems will have staggering \nenvironmental, social and economic consequences.\n  In addition, ocean acidification directly threatens numerous \ncommercially and recreationally important fish and shellfish species \nfrom coast to coast. Carbon dioxide-rich waters have been shown to \ndecrease the body weight of Pacific salmon and increase the mortality \nrate of Alaskan blue king crab. Over 50 percent of our commercial catch \nin the United States is shellfish. In New Jersey, sea scallops and \nclams are some of the State's most valuable fisheries, valued at $121 \nmillion. These and other important shellfish species are threatened by \ngrowing acidification.\n  Research on the processes and consequences of ocean acidification is \nstill in its infancy. The urgency of developing interagency \ncollaboration to address this far-reaching environmental problem is \nwidely recognized in the scientific community. In January, the \nAdministration Ocean Research Priorities Plan, ORPP, identified ocean \nacidification as a research priority. Consistent with the ORPP, my \nlegislation will establish a comprehensive research and monitoring \nprogram within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, \nNOAA. This is critical for ocean management in the long-term because \nmany questions on the effect of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide \non ocean chemistry and marine life remain unanswered.\n  My legislation also establishes an interagency committee to develop a \ncomprehensive ocean acidification research and monitoring plan designed \nto improve the understanding of the environmental and economic impacts \nof increased ocean acidification. The plan will identify priority \nresearch areas and strengthen relevant programs within our federal \nagencies. The plan will also address commercially and recreationally \nimportant species, as well as vulnerable ecosystems including coral \nreefs and coastal and polar oceans threatened by acidification.\n  The rise of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere has been measured \ncontinuously since 1958. Known as the ``Keeling Curve'', these \nmeasurements are a cornerstone of our understanding of man-made \nincreases in carbon dioxide causing global warming and ocean \nacidification. It is vital that we establish a program for long-term \nglobal measurements of ocean pH to understand the processes and \nconsequences of ocean acidification. A key component in our bill \ndirects federal agencies to establish a long-term monitoring program of \npH levels in the ocean utilizing existing global ocean observing \nassets.\n  Congress has been hearing from our Nation experts on ocean \nacidification since 2004. Now is the time for national investment in a \ncoordinated program of research and monitoring to improve understanding \nof ocean acidification, and strengthen the ability of marine resource \nmanagers to assess and prepare for the harmful impacts of ocean \nacidification on our marine resources.\n  I would like to thank Senator Cantwell for her cosponsorship and \nsupport on this important issue. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues in the Senate to ensure passage of this legislation so that \nwe can fill this vital research need and protect our valuable marine \nresources.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1581\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The oceans help mitigate the effects of global warming \n     by absorbing atmospheric carbon dioxide. About a third of \n     anthropogenic carbon dioxide is currently absorbed by the \n     ocean.\n       (2) The rapid increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide is \n     overwhelming the natural ability of the oceans to cope with \n     human-induced carbon dioxide emissions.\n       (3) The emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is \n     causing the oceans to become more acidic. The increase in \n     acidity and changes in ocean chemistry are corrosive to \n     marine shells and organisms that form the base of the food \n     chain for many fish and marine mammals including the \n     skeletons of corals which provide one of the richest habitats \n     on earth.\n       (4) The rich biodiversity of marine organisms is an \n     important contribution to the national economy and the change \n     in ocean chemistry threatens our fisheries and marine \n     environmental quality, and could result in significant social \n     and economic costs.\n       (5) Existing Federal programs support research in related \n     ocean chemistry, but gaps in funding, coordination, and \n     outreach have impeded national progress in addressing ocean \n     acidification.\n       (6) National investment in a coordinated program of \n     research and monitoring would improve the understanding of \n     ocean acidification effects on whole ecosystems, advance our \n     knowledge of the socio-economic impacts of increased ocean \n     acidification, and strengthen the ability of marine resource \n     managers to assess and prepare for the harmful impacts of \n     ocean acidification on our marine resources.\n\n[[Page S7378]]\n\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to provide \n     for--\n       (1) development and coordination of a comprehensive \n     interagency plan to monitor and conduct research on the \n     processes and consequences of ocean acidification on marine \n     organisms and ecosystems and to establish an ocean \n     acidification program within the National Oceanic and \n     Atmospheric Administration; and\n       (2) assessment and consideration of regional and national \n     ecosystem and socio-economic impacts of increased ocean \n     acidification, and integration into marine resource \n     decisions.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 224\n\n       Whereas ending the violence and terror that have devastated \n     the State of Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza since September \n     2000 is in the vital interests of the United States, Israel, \n     and the Palestinian people;\n       Whereas the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict \n     strengthens extremists and opponents of peace throughout the \n     region;\n       Whereas more than 7 years of violence, terror, and military \n     engagement have demonstrated that armed force alone will not \n     solve the Israeli-Palestinian dispute;\n       Whereas the vast majority of Israelis and Palestinians want \n     to put an end to decades of confrontation and conflict and \n     live in peaceful coexistence, mutual dignity, and security, \n     based on a just, lasting, and comprehensive peace;\n       Whereas on May 24, 2006, addressing a Joint Session of the \n     United States Congress, Prime Minister of Israel Ehud Olmert \n     reiterated the Government of Israel's position that ``In a \n     few years, [the Palestinians] could be living in a \n     Palestinian state, side by side in peace and security with \n     Israel, a Palestinian state which Israel and the \n     international community would help thrive'';\n\n[[Page S7387]]\n\n       Whereas, in his speech before the Palestinian Legislative \n     Council on February 18, 2006, Palestinian Authority President \n     Mahmoud Abbas said, ``We are confident that there is no \n     military solution to the conflict. Negotiations between us as \n     equal partners should put a long-due end to the cycle of \n     violence . . . Let us live in two neighboring states'';\n       Whereas, in June 2002, the President of the United States \n     presented his vision of ``two states, living side by side in \n     peace and security'', and has since repeatedly reaffirmed \n     this position;\n       Whereas a robust and high-level American diplomatic \n     presence on the ground is critical to bringing Israelis and \n     Palestinians together to make the tough decisions necessary \n     to achieving a permanent resolution to the conflict;\n       Whereas June 2007 marks the 40th anniversary of the Six-Day \n     War between Israel and a coalition of Arab states;\n       Whereas all parties should use the occasion of this \n     anniversary to redouble their efforts to achieve peace; and\n       Whereas achieving Israeli-Palestinian peace could have \n     significant positive impacts on security and stability in the \n     region: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) reaffirms its commitment to a true and lasting solution \n     to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, based on the \n     establishment of 2 states, the State of Israel and Palestine, \n     living side by side in peace and security, and with \n     recognized borders;\n       (2) denounces the use of violence and terror and reaffirms \n     its unwavering commitment to Israel's security;\n       (3) calls on President Bush to pursue a robust diplomatic \n     effort to engage the State of Israel and the Palestinian \n     Authority, begin negotiations, and make a 2-state settlement \n     a top priority;\n       (4) urges President Bush to consider appointing as Special \n     Envoy for Middle East Peace an individual who has held \n     cabinet rank or someone equally qualified, with an extensive \n     knowledge of foreign affairs generally and the Middle East \n     region in particular;\n       (5) calls on the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority to \n     recognize the State of Israel's right to exist, to renounce \n     and end all terror and incitement, and to accept past \n     agreements and obligations with the State of Israel;\n       (6) calls on moderate Arab states in the region to \n     intensify their diplomatic efforts toward a 2-state solution \n     and welcomes the Arab League Peace Initiative; and\n       (7) calls on Israeli and Palestinian leaders to embrace \n     efforts to achieve peace and refrain from taking any actions \n     that would prejudice the outcome of final status \n     negotiations.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Lugar, \nSenator Dodd, and Senator Hagel to introduce a resolution calling for a \nlasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian dispute.\n  Our resolution reaffirms the Senate's commitment to a true and \nlasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, based on the \nestablishment of two States, Israel and Palestine, living side by side \nin peace and security, and with recognized borders; denounces the use \nof violence and terror and reaffirms our unwavering commitment to \nIsrael's security; calls on President Bush to pursue a robust \ndiplomatic effort to engage the Israelis and Palestinians, reinvigorate \nnegotiations, and make a two-state settlement a top priority; urges \nPresident Bush to consider appointing a high-level Special Envoy for \nMiddle East Peace; calls on the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority to \nrecognize Israel's right to exist, renounce and end all terror and \nincitement, and accept past agreements and obligations with Israel; \ncalls on moderate Arab states in the region to intensify their \ndiplomatic efforts toward a two-state solution and welcomes the Arab \nLeague Peace Initiative, and; calls on Israeli and Palestinian leaders \nto embrace efforts to achieve peace and refrain from taking any actions \nthat would prejudice the outcome of final status negotiations.\n  Senator Baucus, Senator Byrd, Senator Whitehouse and Senator Sununu \nhave also joined us as original cosponsors.\n  We are this week marking the the 40th anniversary of the start of the \nSix-Day War between Israel and a coalition of Arab states which lasted \nfrom June 5 to June 10, 1967. Israel's stunning triumph in that \nconflict, when its very existence was at stake, sent a powerful and \nunambiguous message to its neighbors and the international community \nthat the existence of a Jewish homeland in the Middle East was a fact \nthat could not be denied.\n  Since then, Israel, with the support and active engagement of the \nUnited States, has signed peace agreements with two of its adversaries \nfrom that war, first with Egypt in 1979 and then with Jordan in 1994.\n  Both treaties greatly enhanced Israel's security and brought hope to \nits people.\n  Yet a comprehensive Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement has remained \nelusive, resulting in the loss of numerous innocent lives and \ndestroying the hopes and dreams of Israelis and Palestinians alike.\n  Since September 2000 and the start of the second Intifada, violence \nand terror have engulfed the region and devastated the prospects for \npeace.\n  It has become quite clear to me that the current impasse is not \nsustainable. There is no military solution to this conflict. The lack \nof any movement in the peace process only emboldens the opponents of \npeace, strengthens the hands of the extremists, and puts the vital \ninterests of Israel, the Palestinian people, and the United States at \nrisk.\n  Yet the vast majority of Israelis and Palestinians have made it clear \nthat they want to end this conflict and live side by side in peaceful \ncoexistence, mutual dignity, and security.\n  We owe it to them and ourselves to do everything in our power to make \nthis vision a reality.\n  Indeed, a just resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute and a \ncomprehensive Arab-Israeli peace agreement should be our top priorities \nin the region.\n  They will open the door to new opportunities, enabling us to tackle \nother seemingly intractable challenges in the region: the civil war in \nIraq, the influence of Syria and Hezbollah in Lebanon, and Iran's \nuranium enrichment program.\n  As the Iraq Study Group report argued, ``The United States will not \nbe able to achieve its goals in the Middle East unless the United \nStates deals directly with the Arab-Israeli conflict.''\n  We cannot achieve these goals by sitting on the sidelines or sending \nlow-level envoys to the region.\n  We need a vigorous and sustained high level American presence on the \nground in the Middle East to make this happen.\n  I know that Secretary of State Rice is personally committed to \nbringing both sides together so they will take on the tough issues and \nfind the right solutions, and she has my full support.\n  She has already made four trips to the region and I hope she will \nreturn again soon.\n  President Bush should also become engaged in this process and \nconsider appointing a Special Envoy for Middle East peace who has \nextensive experience dealing with this issue and has served in a high-\nlevel government capacity.\n  We all know what a final peace agreement will look like. The drafters \nof the Geneva accord showed us that with courage and determination, the \ntough decisions can be made that will bring peace and prosperity to \nboth sides.\n  While it is critical that the United States take a leadership role on \nthis issue, it is also critical that moderate voices in the Arab world \nbe a voice for peace.\n  That is why the Arab League Peace Initiative is important. It is an \nexample where Arab leaders have stepped forward Hamas must also step \nforward and fulfill the demands of the international community by \nrecognizing Israel's right to exist, renouncing and end all terror and \nincitement, and accepting past agreements between Israel and the \nPalestinian Authority.\n  Now is as good a time as ever to work for peace. There will always be \nexcuses for those who don't want peace. But it is incumbent on those \nwho wish for peace to work through the difficult issues.\n  As a United States Senator, I have stood by Israel and the Israeli \npeople and will continue to do so. We will not waiver in our efforts to \nensure their safety, stability, and prosperity. Achieving a just and \nlasting peace in the Middle East is the cornerstone of that endeavor.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/07/senate-section/article/S7387-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7387-S7388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 225--DESIGNATING THE MONTH OF AUGUST 2007 AS \n              ``NATIONAL MEDICINE ABUSE AWARENESS MONTH''\n\n  Mr. BIDEN (for himself and Mr. Grassley) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n[[Page S7388]]\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution \nmarking August 2007 as National Medicine Abuse Awareness Month. The \nintentional misuse of prescription and over-the-counter drugs has \nreached troubling levels. This resolution takes an important step in \nraising teens' and parents' awareness of the problem.\n  While recent studies indicate that the use of illegal drugs has \ndeclined somewhat over the past 5 years, the excessive use of legally \navailable drugs has skyrocketed during the same period. The figures \nspeak for themselves: 1 in 5 teens has misused prescription drugs, and \nmore people age 12 or older have recently started misusing prescription \npain relievers than smoking marijuana.\n  The numbers are also troubling for abuse of over-the-counter cough \nand cold medicines. While over-the-counter and prescription medicines \nare safe, effective, and potentially lifesaving when used properly, the \nabuse and recreational use of these medicines can be lethal. Recent \nstudies indicate that 1 in 10 young people aged 12 through 17, or 2.4 \nmillion kids, have intentionally abused cough medicine to get high off \nof its active ingredient, Dextromethorphan. This trend is dangerous, \nand it must stop.\n  The problem is multifaceted, but one critical element of the solution \nis clear: educating teens and parents about the grave dangers of \nmedicine abuse.\n  The way I see it, the problem of non-medical use of prescription and \nover-the-counter drugs can be chalked up to two key factors. First, too \nmany teens are under the impression that ``legal'' drugs are safe \nanytime, in any dose, and even without a prescription or doctor \nsupervision. They are gravely mistaken. Excessive prescription drug use \ncan lead to dependency, overdose, and even death, if not prescribed and \nmonitored by a physician.\n  Second, these drugs are cheap and easy to obtain. A bottle of cough \nsyrup costs a few dollars and a prescription drug can be taken from a \nmedicine cabinet for free. A February 2007 report released by the \nOffice of National Drug Control Policy reveals that a shocking 47 \npercent of youth interviewed said they got their prescription drugs for \nfree from a relative or friend. The last thing a parent wants is to \nbecome his or her child's ``dealer.'' But that is precisely what \nhappens when they leave medications lying around at home. Hence, these \ntwo factors, a false perception of the dangers and a cheap, readily \naccessible high, have put our teens in danger, and we must act to \nprotect them.\n  National Medicine Abuse Awareness Month takes an important step to \nraise public awareness about the dangers that misuse of these drugs \npose by promoting the message that over-the-counter and prescription \nmedicines must be taken only as labeled or prescribed, and that when \nused recreationally or in large doses they can have serious and life-\nthreatening consequences. It reminds parents to educate themselves \nabout this problem and talk to their children about all types of \nsubstance abuse, and it encourages national, State, and local officials \nto increase awareness of this disturbing trend.\n\n  I have worked and continue to work in consultation with the Consumer \nHealth Care Products Association and the Community Anti-Drug Coalition \nof America, to reverse this trend, and I applaud the important steps \nthat these groups have taken. Among other initiatives, they have \ncreated educational toolkits, such as A Dose of Prevention: Stopping \nCough Medicine Abuse Before It Starts, which include guides to educate \nparents, teachers, law enforcement officials, doctors and healthcare \nprofessionals, and retailers about the potential harms of cough and \ncold medicines and over-the-counter drug abuse.\n  I also commend the nonprofit Partnership for Drug-Free America and \nits community alliance and affiliate partners for undertaking a \nnationwide prevention campaign. Their campaign utilizes research-based \neducational advertisements, public relations, news media and the \nInternet to inform parents about the prevalence of intentional abuse of \nmedicines among teens, empowering parents to effectively communicate \nthe facts of this dangerous trend to their children and to take \nnecessary steps to keep prescription and over-the-counter medicines \nsafely in their homes.\n  Prevention is a key component of the solution, and education is a key \ncomponent of prevention. We've got to do our best to raise awareness on \nthis matter, and reverse the worrisome trend of increasing over-the-\ncounter and prescription drug misuse. This resolution takes an \nimportant step towards achieving that goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/07/senate-section/article/S7388-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7388-S7389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 226--RECOGNIZING THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER AS ``NATIONAL \n                    HOMELESS YOUTH AWARENESS MONTH''\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Menendez, Mrs. Murray, \nMr. Brown, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Obama, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Bayh, \nMr. Feingold, Mr. Casey, Mr. Nelson of Florida, and Mr. Kennedy) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, today, Senators Brownback, Boxer, Smith, \nBill Nelson and I are introducing a bipartisan resolution. It states \nclearly what so many of us agree on, the need for a political \nsettlement in Iraq. But then it offers what virtually no one has put \nforward: a policy to actually secure that political settlement.\n  We propose that the United States actively support a political \nsettlement among Iraqis based on the provisions of Iraq's constitution \nthat call for creating federal system of government, with strong \nregions and a limited central government.\n  And we urge the administration to bring in the international \ncommunity, including the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council \nand Iraq's neighbors, to support a settlement based on federalism and \nto convene a conference with Iraqis to help them reach that settlement.\n  Each of us recognizes this reality: when a country is caught in a \ncycle of self-sustaining sectarian violence as Iraq is today, there are \nonly four ways to end it:\n  First, a bloodletting that leaves one side victorious or both sides \nexhausted. In the case of Iraq, that could take years . . . years we do \nnot have and should not accept.\n  Second, an open-ended foreign occupation that America cannot sustain.\n  Third, the return of a strongman, who is not on the horizon. Even if \nhe were, it would be a tragic irony to replace one dictator with \nanother.\n  Or fourth, a political agreement to form a decentralized, federal \nsystem that separates the warring factions and gives them control over \nthe fabric of their daily lives, including the police, jobs, education, \nmarriage and religion.\n  It's a model that worked in Bosnia. It offers the possibility, but \nnot the guarantee, of a soft landing Iraq.\n  The Bush administration has another vision for Iraq. But the entire \npremise of its policy is fundamentally and fatally flawed. It believes \nIraqis will rally behind a strong central government that keeps the \ncountry together and protects the rights of all citizens equally.\n  But there is no trust within the central government, trust of the \ngovernment by the people, and no capacity by the government to deliver \nservices and security. And there is no evidence that we can build that \ntrust and capacity soon.\n  Simply put, Iraq cannot be run from the center, absent a dictator or \nforeign occupation. If we want the country to hold together and find \nstability, we have to make federalism work. If we don't, there will be \nno political accommodation at the center.\n  Violent resistance will increase. The sectarian cycle of revenge will \nspiral out of control. The result will be at best the violent break up \nof Iraq into multiple states--at worst the total fragmentation of the \ncountry.\n  This resolution is part of a comprehensive strategy I have proposed \nto bring our troops home, to leave behind a stable Iraq and to protect \nour soldiers so long as a single one of them remains in Iraq.\n  I believe that is the best way to end the war in Iraq responsibly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/07/senate-section/article/S7390-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7390-S7391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1476.

Mr. COBURN submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by \nhim to the joint resolution S.J. Res. 14, expressing the sense of the \nSenate that Attorney General Alberto Gonzales no longer holds the \nconfidence of the Senate and of the American people; which was ordered \nto lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. NO CONFIDENCE IN CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The national debt of the United States of America now \n     exceeds $8,500,000,000,000.\n       (2) Each United States citizen's share of this debt exceeds \n     $29,000.\n       (3) Every cent that the United States Government borrows \n     and adds to this debt is money stolen from future generations \n     of Americans and from important programs, including Social \n     Security and Medicare on\n\n[[Page S7398]]\n\n     which our senior citizens depend for their retirement \n     security.\n       (4) The power of the purse belongs to Congress.\n       (5) Congress authorizes and appropriates all Federal \n     discretionary spending and creates new mandatory spending \n     programs.\n       (6) For too long, Congress has simply borrowed more and \n     more money to pay for new spending, while Americans want \n     Congress to live within its means, using the same set of \n     common sense rules and restraints Americans face everyday; \n     because in the real world, families cannot follow Congress's \n     example and must make difficult decisions and set priorities \n     on how to spend their limited financial resources.\n       (7) Last year, the interest costs of the Federal debt the \n     Government must pay to those who buy U.S. Treasury bonds were \n     about 8 percent of the total Federal budget. In total, the \n     Federal government spent $226,000,000,000 on interest costs \n     alone last year.\n       (8) According to the Government Accountability Office, \n     interest costs will consume 25 percent of the entire Federal \n     budget by 2035. By way of comparison, the Department of \n     Education's share of Federal spending in 2005 was \n     approximately 3 percent of all Federal spending. The \n     Department of Health and Human Services was responsible for \n     approximately 23 percent of all Federal spending. Spending by \n     the Social Security Administration was responsible for about \n     20 percent of all Federal spending. Spending on Medicare was \n     about 12 percent of all Federal spending. Spending in 2005 by \n     the Department of Defense, in the midst of 2 wars in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan and a global war against terrorism, comprised \n     about 19 percent of all Federal spending. Thus, if we do not \n     change our current spending habits, the Government \n     Accountability Office estimates that as a percentage of \n     Federal spending, interest costs in 2035 will be larger than \n     defense costs today, Social Security costs today, Medicare \n     costs today, and education costs today.\n       (9) Congress has raided the Social Security and Medicare \n     Trust Funds for decades to hide the true size of the annual \n     budget deficit. This practice has undermined the solvency of \n     these programs and threatens both the retirement security of \n     today's workers and the economic opportunities of future \n     generations of Americans.\n       (10) It is irresponsible for Congress to create or expand \n     Government programs that will result in borrowing from Social \n     Security, Medicare, foreign nations, or future generations of \n     Americans without reductions in spending elsewhere within the \n     Federal budget.\n       (11) Last month, Congress approved a $2,900,000,000,000 \n     budget resolution that includes $23,000,000,000 more in \n     spending than was requested by the President.\n       (12) Congress has repeatedly demonstrated its inability to \n     prioritize spending. The Senate has approved the \n     authorization of hundreds of billions of dollars in new \n     spending this year alone while repeatedly rejecting \n     amendments to cut wasteful spending.\n       (13) The Senate has twice this year rejected amendments \n     stating that Congress has a moral obligation to offset the \n     cost of new Government programs and initiatives.\n       (14) Among the projects that Congress has authorized \n     spending for this year include a new visitors center in \n     Louisiana and beach enhancement in southern California. When \n     posed with the question to first house displaced Louisiana \n     storm survivors before spending money to construct the \n     visitors center, the Senate overwhelming voted to construct \n     the visitors center. When given the option to first protect \n     the millions of citizens who live in the Sacramento area from \n     floods before adding sand to a southern California beach, the \n     Senate overwhelming voted for sandy beaches.\n       (15) Congress's inability to prioritize spending may be \n     best epitomized by the Senate's vote to build a controversial \n     bridge in Alaska. When given the choice to spend nearly half \n     a billion dollars to repair the Twin Spans Bridge in New \n     Orleans damaged by Hurricane Katrina or to construct a new \n     bridge nearly as long as the Golden Gate Bridge and higher \n     than the Brooklyn Bridge to an island with 50 residents in \n     Alaska, the Senate voted overwhelming in favor of the new \n     Alaska bridge.\n       (16) The cost of Congressional pork projects, known as \n     earmarks, has more than doubled from $19,500,000,000 in 1996 \n     to more than $47,400,000,000 in 2005. Earmarks have been \n     linked to a number of recent Congressional investigations and \n     convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff boasted that earmarks were a \n     form of political currency doled out from what he called the \n     earmark ``favor factory''. In December of last year, the \n     public was promised by the newly elected majority that ``We \n     will place a moratorium on all earmarks until a reformed \n     process is put in place'' and that ``We will work to restore \n     an accountable, above-board, transparent process for funding \n     decisions and put an end to the abuses that have harmed the \n     credibility of Congress''. Yet, the Senate has already \n     approved hundreds of earmarks this year while failing to \n     adopt earmark reform rules changes. The House adopted earmark \n     rule changes but the appropriations committee has said it \n     will circumvent these reforms by adding earmarks after bills \n     are passed behind closed doors when bills can no longer be \n     amended or debated.\n       (17) This lack of ability to prioritize Federal spending \n     underscores the ``borrow and spend'' binge behavior of \n     Congress that has contributed to the national debt which \n     exceeds $8,500,000,000,000.\n       (18) Polls have repeatedly found that Americans \n     overwhelming oppose new spending and bigger Government. A \n     February 2007 poll released by Democracy Corps found that 80 \n     percent of likely voters disapprove of the Federal \n     Government's handling of spending. Of all of the issues \n     polled, the Government's handling of spending scored the \n     highest rate of voter disapproval, more than health care (71 \n     percent disapproval), energy (64 percent disapproval), or the \n     environment (59 percent disapproval). One specific poll \n     question asked respondents which of 2 statements they agreed \n     with: ``I want Congress to first invest in areas like health \n     care, education, and energy, even if it means spending \n     additional money'' or ``I want Congress to first focus on \n     cutting wasteful spending and making government more \n     accountable.'' Fifty-eight percent of respondents agreed with \n     the statement about cutting wasteful spending, while only 36 \n     percent agreed with spending additional money first. When \n     asked who they trusted more on the issue of spending, only 18 \n     percent picked Congress. A December 2006 Gallup Poll found \n     that 61 percent of Americans thought ``big government'' was \n     the biggest threat to the country's future. This included 56 \n     percent of Democrats and 63 percent of Republicans.\n       (19) Congress has ignored the public's views on spending \n     which may explain its declining approval ratings in several \n     different independent polls released in the last month. Only \n     35 percent of respondents of a poll released by the \n     Associated Press approve of the way Congress is handling its \n     job, down 5 points since April.
