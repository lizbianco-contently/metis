Mr. President, this morning, the Senate will be in a period \nof morning business for 1 hour, with the time divided between both \nsides, the Republicans having the first half and the majority the \nsecond half. Following that period of time, the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the 9/11 legislation, S. 4.\n  Last night, the Republican leader and I had a discussion about the \nlegislation, the importance of completing it and how we do so. The \nRepublican leader modified a pending amendment in order to include the \nprovisions of three other amendments which were pending, and then filed \ncloture on that amendment. Before adjourning last night, I filed \ncloture on both the substitute amendment and the bill. So tomorrow \nmorning, Friday, we will have a cloture vote on the Republican \namendment. And, of course, if cloture is not invoked, then there is an \nimmediate cloture vote on the substitute. So Members could be here \nFriday well beyond the noon hour.\n  Just to remind Members, since cloture has been filed on the \nsubstitute and the bill, they have until 1 p.m. today to file any \nadditional germane first-degree amendments. At this point, \napproximately 110 amendments have already been filed.\n  Right now, 40 amendments are currently pending. That includes, of \ncourse, the substitute amendment. I am advised that from a preliminary \nreview by the Parliamentarians of these pending amendments, only eight \nof them are germane. I have the list of amendments here. It is a long \nlist, as we indicated, of some 100-plus amendments. Out of those, there \nare eight that are germane. There may be a couple more that are \narguably germane. But that is where we are. We will instruct the two \nmanagers to see if they, today, can move through the germane \namendments. That would speed things up postcloture tomorrow.\n  We are still attempting to resolve other issues on this most \nimportant bill. It is a bill that deals, as we know, with the \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission. It has been 2\\1/2\\ years since \nthey completed their work. The House has already done theirs. We are \ngoing to do our very best to follow suit. I feel\n\n[[Page S2854]]\n\ncomfortable we will be able to complete something before we leave here \nthis Friday or Saturday or, if good fortune smiles on us, we can work \nout something tonight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/08/senate-section/article/S2854-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2854]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we are on a very important piece of \nlegislation, as we all know, the unfinished work of the recommendations \nof the \n9/11 Commission. We have been on this bill now for almost 2 full weeks, \nbut we have been unsuccessful so far in being able to get votes on key \namendments, which I do believe would fill a significant gap in the \nprotections that are available to the American people in the post-9/11 \nworld.\n  We yesterday offered a package of amendments which actually \nrepresents a consolidation of previously filed amendments I want to \ndiscuss briefly, which I think fulfills that important role of gap-\nfilling in the unfinished work from the 9/11 Commission \nrecommendations.\n  Last night, Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, filed cloture \non amendment No. 312, as modified. It is my hope, when we have that \nvote tomorrow--as currently scheduled under the regular order--we will \nhave an up-or-down vote on provisions critical to addressing threats \nthat terrorists employ in the United States and on U.S. citizens.\n  This amendment contains five critical homeland security tools. It is \nimperative we include this legislation to give the appropriate Federal \nagencies the authority, No. 1, to punish those who recruit terrorists; \nNo. 2, to revoke the visas of terrorists; No. 3, to allow the U.S. \nGovernment to detain dangerous aliens; No. 4, to punish those who \nprovide material support--in other words, financial inducement--or I \nshould say support to families of those who engage in terrorist acts; \nand, No. 5, to protect families of soldiers from terrorist hoaxes.\n  These are all contained in amendment No. 312, on which a cloture \nmotion has been filed, and upon which we will vote tomorrow, if not \nbefore by agreement.\n  I want to explain these important tools so Members understand what is \nat stake.\n  The first of these provisions is to provide the Federal Government, \nfor the first time in our Nation's history, the ability to punish those \nwho actually recruit terrorists. We know from intelligence products \ngained from--and now public--Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the mastermind of \n9/11, they were actively engaged in recruiting terrorists within the \nUnited States--in our prisons, in some mosques, and elsewhere--with the \nidea of having a terrorist who could act within this country and who \nwould, therefore, not be stopped by the various protective mechanisms \nwe put in place, whether it be the Transportation Security \nAdministration, improvement of our intelligence gathering and sharing \nto prevent dangerous aliens from entering the country and committing \nterrorists acts.\n  The whole concept behind Khalid Shaikh Mohammed's efforts was to \nrecruit people domestically, people who would not meet sort of the \ntypical description some would anticipate or the profiles the \nintelligence officials might have of the type of person who would be \nlogically suspect for terrorist activities. So what this part of the \namendment would do would be to punish recruitment of terrorists within \nthe United States. This is a gap in our laws that needs to be filled.\n  Senator Grassley had previously filed an amendment which is now \nincluded in this consolidation. This has to do with revoking the visas \nof terrorists. Under current law, visas approved or denied by consular \nofficials are nonreviewable. That is overseas. If somebody applies for \na visa, and they do not get it, then those are not reviewable. In other \nwords, there is not a stream of litigation or successive appeals they \ncan go through in order to challenge the denial of their visa.\n  However, if a visa is approved but later revoked and that individual \nis on U.S. soil, the decision by the consular officer is reviewable in \nU.S. courts. This amendment makes these revocations nonreviewable.\n  This is both a practical problem and is actually a huge difficulty, \nidentified by the Government Accountability Office in 2003. They said \nthat even if an alien's visa is revoked on terrorism grounds after the \nalien reaches the United States, it is almost impossible to deport the \nsuspected terrorist because persons with a revoked visa can stay in the \nUnited States and have a right to successive appeals of a consular \nofficer's decision.\n  Moreover, allowing the review of these revoked visas, especially on \nterrorism grounds, jeopardizes the classified intelligence that may \nhave led to the revocation in the first place and makes the FBI and CIA \nhesitant to share the information. We can see how that standoff would \noccur. They are hesitant to share the information; therefore, visas of \ndangerous persons are not revoked.\n  So due to the practical delay caused by review, we would suggest--\nthis amendment suggests--we treat the visas exactly the same whether \nthey are denied outside of the country or revoked inside of the country \nbased on terrorism grounds.\n  Also included in this package is an amendment that has to do with the \ndetention of individuals who have entered our country illegally and are \nsubject to being repatriated, particularly criminal aliens. This grows \nout of a Supreme Court decision in 2001, where the Supreme Court held, \nin the Zabidah case, the Department of Homeland Security could not \ndetain a person longer than 6 months. In this case, for someone with a \ncriminal record, who could not legally stay in the United States, they \ncould not detain them more than 6 months. Unless they were successful \nin getting them repatriated or returned to their country of origin, the \nonly thing the Department of Homeland Security could do is release them \ninto the general population of the United States. That is simply an \nunacceptable result.\n  What this amendment would do is change the statutory law of the \nUnited States, as invited by the U.S. Supreme Court, to authorize the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to detain dangerous aliens longer than \n6 months if, in fact, there is a reasonable expectation that individual \nwill be repatriated to their country of origin.\n  For example, the Government had to release Carlos Rojas Fritze, who \nsodomized, raped, beat, and robbed a stranger in a public restroom and \nthen called it, bizarrely, ``an act of love,'' and Tuan Thai, who \nrepeatedly raped, tortured, and terrorized women and vowed to repeat \nhis crimes. These are just two individuals who, under the Supreme Court \ndecision, had to be released into the American public--obviously a \ngreat danger to the American\n\n[[Page S2855]]\n\npeople. We need to act to fix this gap, as invited by the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, so dangerous aliens like these individuals can be detained and \nso the American people can be protected.\n  One other element of this package of amendments is punishing those \nwho provide material support for terrorists. We recall that Saddam \nHussein was providing $25,000 for the families of Palestinians who \nengaged in terrorist attacks in Israel. The fact is, there is a \npractice in some quarters of providing financial support for families \nas an inducement to terrorists so they know that if they commit \nterrorist acts, at least their families will be financially provided \nfor. Well, this provision of this amendment would punish material \nsupport for terrorists, and I think the reasons for doing that are \nself-evident.\n  The provision will expand the section of the U.S. Criminal Code which \npunishes murder or assault of U.S. nationals overseas for terrorist \npurposes, so that it equally punishes attempts and conspiracies to \nmurder U.S. nationals for terrorist purposes.\n  Finally, protecting families of soldiers from terrorist hoaxes. The \nlast provision necessary for the safety and security of all citizens is \nestablishing the right of the American Government to protect the \nfamilies of soldiers from terrorist hoaxes.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak for \n2 more minutes in our morning business allocation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. This last provision provides the right of the American \nGovernment to protect families of soldiers from terrorist hoaxes. For \nexample, this provision would increase the penalties for perpetrating a \nhoax about the death, injury, or capture of a U.S. soldier during \nwartime.\n  I think we would all agree that a hoax about the death of a U.S. \nsoldier is a serious offense that should be made a crime and can result \nin devastating consequences to the family that is the subject of a \nhoax. In one such incident involving a soldier from Flagstaff, AZ, who \nwas serving in Iraq, the Army sent the soldier a satellite phone so he \ncould call home from Iraq to reassure them that he was, in fact, alive \nand uninjured. Unfortunately, another soldier was killed in the process \nof trying to deliver the satellite phone to the soldier so he could \nreassure his own family, and the message did not get through on a \ntimely basis.\n  I think we would all agree this is simply unacceptable. Our military \npersonnel put their lives on the line every day for our freedom and our \nfamilies who support them. One of the most important things we can do \nis make sure they are protected against those who would perpetrate \nthese kinds of cruel hoaxes on them and take advantage of their \nconcerns and natural anxiety for the welfare of their loved ones \nserving us abroad.\n  So I hope our colleagues will vote for cloture on this important \npackage of amendments, and we will have that opportunity tomorrow, if \nnot sooner.\n  Mr. President, I know I have other colleagues, my two colleagues from \nGeorgia, who are here to speak in our portion of morning business, and \nI will yield the floor at this time to them.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, may I inquire as to how much time is \nremaining on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Seventeen minutes 50 seconds.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the amendment proposed by the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn. \nIt has been 5\\1/2\\ years since the horrendous terrorist attacks against \nthe United States on September 11, 2001. Since that attack, many \nimprovements have been made in the way law enforcement communities \naround the country are combating terrorism, but it is very important \nthat we continue to give our law enforcement community every tool they \nneed to protect Americans. Americans expect Congress to do everything \npossible to improve the Nation's security, and Senator Cornyn's \namendment adds to the important and necessary tools needed by law \nenforcement to prosecute the war against terrorism.\n  I would like to take just a few minutes to touch on some of the \nimportant provisions that are included in this amendment. The first \nissue I would like to talk about is punishing those who recruit or \nassist terrorists.\n  For the first time, we will be able to target terrorist recruiters--\nthose who seek out and try to persuade individuals to commit terrorist \nacts against the United States and our allies.\n  It is no secret that al-Qaida attempts to seek out individuals living \nwithin the United States who can operate freely here and who do not \nnecessarily fit the profile of those who perpetrated the 9/11 attacks \nto join their cadre of jihadists. Even the 9/11 Commission Report \ndiscusses al-Qaida's ability to recruit:\n\n       Mosques, schools, and boarding houses served as recruiting \n     stations in many parts of the world, including the United \n     States.\n\n  For example, an early bin Laden organization, al-Khifa, recruited \nAmerican Muslims to fight in Afghanistan. Al-Khifa had offices in my \nown State of Georgia as well as Chicago, New York, Boston, Pittsburgh, \nand Tucson.\n\n  The amendment also creates a new offense for aiding the family or \nassociates of a terrorist in order to target those who give money to \nfamilies of suicide bombers after such bombings. Any person convicted \nof doing any of these things should face severe punishment. This is not \nuncommon. We saw Saddam Hussein offering up to $25,000 to the families \nof suicide bombers in Palestine as a reward for their sons' and \ndaughters' terrorist attacks. This type of support promotes and \nencourages suicide bombers and simply cannot be tolerated. The American \npeople are probably shocked that these offenses are not already on the \nbooks. Support for this amendment will send a strong message that this \ncountry has not forgotten how September 11, 2001, changed this world \nand that we will do everything in our power to prosecute terrorists and \nthose who support them.\n  A second key provision in this amendment deals with closing a \nloophole in the law that allows suspected terrorists to stay in the \nUnited States after their visas have been revoked on terrorist grounds.\n  In June of 2003, a GAO report revealed that suspected terrorists can \nand, in fact, do stay in the United States after their visas have been \nrevoked because they are suspected of terrorist activity. After the \nloophole came to light, the GAO found that more than 100 people were \ngranted visas that were later revoked because there was suspected \nterrorist activity.\n  Under current law, decisions to approve or deny visas by consular \nofficers are nonreviewable and deemed final. However, if a visa is \napproved and the individual enters the United States and then the visa \nis revoked while that person is still in the United States, the \nrevocation decision is reviewed by the U.S. courts. Giving an alien on \nU.S. soil the ability to appeal a revocation decision when it is based \non terrorist-suspected grounds virtually annihilates the effectiveness \nof this antiterrorism tool.\n  To begin, visa revocations are not taken lightly, according to the \nState Department. A State Department spokesman made this comment:\n\n       A consular officer does not have the authority to revoke a \n     visa based on suspected ineligibility, or based on derogatory \n     information that is insufficient to support an ineligibility \n     finding. A consular revocation must be based on an actual \n     finding that the alien is ineligible for a visa.\n\n  In addition, each alien gets the opportunity to explain their case, \nso once a consular officer notifies an alien of his intent to revoke, \nthe consular officer must give the alien the opportunity to show why \nthe visa should not be revoked.\n  I ask my colleagues to recall the 9/11 Commission Report's finding on \nour flawed visa policies. We know that the 19 hijackers used 364 \naliases and lied on their visa applications when they applied for 23 \nand obtained 22 visas. Allowing aliens to remain on U.S. soil with \nrevoked visas is a national security concern, and this amendment will \nclose this loophole in the law so they cannot do it again.\n  A third issue this amendment deals with is the detention of \ndeportable aliens. The Supreme Court has limited the period of \ndetention of deportable aliens to 6 months after a final order of \nremoval is issued. As a result, when the difficulty in removing an \nalien lasts up to 6 months, the U.S. Government has\n\n[[Page S2856]]\n\nto release the alien into the public. We have all heard the deplorable \nstories of some of the horrific acts committed by deportable aliens who \nwere released into the United States after they were not removed from \nthe country within the 6-month limit. This amendment would allow the \nGovernment to keep these aliens in custody until they can be removed \nand prevent them from harming American citizens.\n  I want to close by thanking my colleague from Texas for the work he \nhas done on this amendment and his effort in making our country safer. \nThis is what the American people want, expect, and deserve. This is the \nright thing to do, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The junior Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague, Senator \nChambliss from Georgia, and his excellent remarks. I stand today \nshoulder to shoulder with him in endorsing Senator Cornyn in what he \nhas brought forward to the Senate. Notwithstanding one's position on \nthe debate of the last 3 days, I think it is ironic that we spent the \nlast 72 hours debating whether we should give collective bargaining \nrights to TSA employees after we debated this 5 years ago and decided \nnot to do that and after having spent very little time talking about 9/\n11 and the security of the United States of America.\n  What Senator Cornyn has done is taken the ideas of Senator Kyl, \nSenator Grassley, Senator Cornyn, and others and brought forward \nmeaningful amendments that ought to be on a 9/11 bill. I sincerely hope \nthat my colleagues, when the cloture vote comes forward tomorrow, will \nvote to invoke cloture so we can bring these amendments to the floor \nand have a meaningful addition to the 9/11 bill.\n  I wish to talk about three of these amendments for just a second and \ntalk about why they are so important.\n  No. 1 is on recruiting. It is always good when you can tell a real \nlife story and not just a hypothetical. About a year ago, in my \nhometown of Atlanta, GA, there was an announcement by the U.S. Secret \nService, the CIA, and international intelligence agencies that two \nyoung men at Georgia Tech--the Georgia Institute of Technology--had \nbeen taken into custody under suspicion of terrorism. As it turns out, \nboth of these two young men, using the library computers at Georgia \nTech, were in a terrorist cell that was born in Pakistan, organized in \nToronto, and was recruiting in Atlanta, GA.\n  Now, not because we overlooked it but because nobody ever thought \nabout it, we have never had a statute to punish someone for recruiting \nterrorism. So right in my own home State of Georgia, right in my own \nhometown, two 21-year-old students at Georgia Tech were recruited and, \nfortunately, caught and, fortunately--because of the PATRIOT Act, I \nmight add--intercepted because of the watching and the maintenance of \nthose computers. But this was a terrorist cell, and these individuals \nwere recruited. There is no punishment for recruiting those folks.\n  Al-Qaida has demonstrated and the \n9/11 Commission told us that recruitment is the main source or resource \nof human beings for suicide bombers, for airplane hijackers, and others \nwho would carry out the acts of al-Qaida. So, first of all, Senator \nCornyn bringing this forward is absolutely appropriate.\n  Secondly, and briefly, Senator Grassley's amendment with regard to \nthe reviewability of the revocation of a visa is included in this \npackage. Paint this picture for a second: All 19 of the hijackers on 9/\n11 got into the United States in a legal way. Most of them had \noverstayed their visas. But just think for a second. Had they been \ncaught, had they been suspected of a terrorist act when they were about \nto commit it, and had their visa been revoked, they would have had the \nright to stay in this country and judicially appeal that revocation, \nwhich meant they could have stayed here even after being identified and \nquite possibly still carried out a terrorist attack.\n  To let you know how important this amendment is, I have an \ninteresting fact for everybody to take in and digest for just a second. \nIn 1986, when we reformed immigration in this country, we granted \namnesty and created a number of legal citizens and legal visas in the \nUnited States. We also created a mechanism for judicial review. There \nare still two cases from the 1986 Immigration Reform Act under judicial \nreview 21 years later. Those individuals still remain in the United \nStates of America.\n  If we capture somebody for suspected terrorism and, under the \ndisciplines we use, revoke that visa, it only stands to reason that \nthey should not be reviewable and should be returned to the country \nfrom which they came.\n  Otherwise, we would be knowingly and willingly harboring someone we \nsuspect would cause harm to the United States of America and commit a \nterrorist act.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the time that has been afforded me. I \nstand in full support of the Cornyn amendment and in a sincere hope \nthat my colleagues will vote for the motion to invoke cloture and pass \nthis very important amendment for the safety and security of the United \nStates of America and its people.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Obama). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Durbin pertaining to the introduction of S. 831 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I now call for the regular order with \nregard to the Sununu amendment, No. 291.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, that is where we will keep the Senate for some period \nof time as we hope people on both sides can reason together and come to \nsome meeting of the minds that will allow us to complete work on the \nmore than 50 amendments that are pending and in a state of suspended \ngridlock and, unfortunately, standing in the way of the adoption of the \n9/11 bill that is before us.\n  I will repeat that this bill came out of our Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee with a nonpartisan vote--16 to nothing \nand 1 abstention. It has matters that are critically important to our \nnational security and our homeland security. It would be a shame if its \npassage here and movement to conference with the House, which has \nalready passed companion legislation, is held up because of the \nparliamentary and procedural gridlock the Senate is in now.\n  I hope my colleagues on both sides can, as I said, reason together to \nbreak that gridlock so we can complete work on the pending amendments \nand proceed to final passage of this legislation. Pending that, the \nSununu amendment, No. 291, will remain the pending business.\n  Mr. President, I now suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, as the Chair knows, and Members of the \nSenate know, the Senate is unfortunately in gridlock at this moment on \nthis important bill because of disagreements as to how to handle \nseveral of the amendments. The trouble is the essential bill that came \nout of our committee, on which the distinguished occupant of the chair \nis a member, is intact. It does a lot to support first responders at \nthe local level, to increase information sharing within our Government \nto avoid the failure to connect the dots that preceded 9/11. It is full \nof very important unfinished business that came from the 9/11 \nCommission Report.\n  Unfortunately, in addition to the 50 amendments pending and the \nrefusal of\n\n[[Page S2858]]\n\nsome Senators to grant consent to go on to hold votes on amendments on \nwhich we actually have bipartisan agreement, yesterday the minority \nleader came to the floor, and in a unique action--it is not seen around \nhere too much--filed a cloture motion on four amendments that were \npending. That will now keep us, barring some break and agreement \nbetween our leaders, in this state of suspended animation until \ntomorrow when the vote is scheduled both on the cloture motion filed by \nthe Republican leader and the one on the overall bill to bring us to a \nconclusion filed by Senator Reid, the majority leader. What is very \nimportant is to focus us back on what this is all about and, hopefully, \nto shake us all up to remember that we are responding to, in this \nlegislation, 5\\1/2\\ years after 9/11, the unfinished business of our \nNation to protect our people from another terrorist attack.\n  Obviously, we are building on what we did in the 9/11 Commission \nlegislation that passed in 2004, but there is more to do; we all agree. \nI am about to read a letter into the Record. I hope this letter will be \nread by every Member of the Senate and bring us back to what this is \nall about and honestly force us to reason together to get over this \nmomentary gridlock to do what is important for our country.\n  The letter is addressed to the Republican leader, the Honorable Mitch \nMcConnell. It comes from a number of the leaders of groups established \nby family members of victims of 9/11: Carol Ashley, mother of Janice, \n25, member of Voices Of September 11th; Mary Fetchet, mother of Brad, \n24, founding director and president of Voices of September 11th; \nBeverly Eckert, widow of Sean Rooney, 50, member of Families of \nSeptember 11; and Carie Lemack, daughter of Judy Larocque, 50, \ncofounder and president, Families of September 11. Obviously, the names \nI mentioned, the first names and ages, were among those who were killed \nby the terrorists on September 11. This is a letter from these four \nfamily members of September 11 to Senator McConnell.\n  The letter reads as follows:\n\n                                                    March 8, 2007.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: As family members who lost loved \n     ones on 9/11, we support full implementation of the 9/11 \n     Commission recommendations. We are writing out of grave \n     concern that your recent introduction of highly provocative, \n     irrelevant amendments will jeopardize the passage of S. 4. It \n     is inconceivable that anyone in good conscience would \n     consider hindering implementation of the 9/11 Commission \n     recommendations and we strongly disagree with these divisive \n     procedural tactics.\n       Just as the Iraq war deserves separate debate, so do each \n     of the amendments you offered. S. 4 should be a clean bill \n     and debate should conclude this week with a straight up and \n     down vote. Each day that passes without implementation of the \n     remaining 9/11 Commission recommendations, the safety and \n     security of our nation is at risk.\n       Tactics such as those you are contemplating, aimed at \n     endangering the 9/11 bill, sends a signal to America that \n     partisan politics is alive and well under your leadership. \n     Both parties must work together to pass this critical \n     legislation. We, the undersigned, understand the risk of \n     failure all too well.\n           Respectfully,\n     Carol Ashley,\n       Mother of Janice, 25, Member, VOICES of September 11th.\n     Mary Fetchet,\n       Mother of Brad, 24, Founding director and President, Voices \n     of September 11th.\n     Beverly Eckert,\n       Widow of Sean Rooney, 50, member, Families of September 11.\n     Carie Lemack,\n       Daughter of Judy Larocque, 50, Co-founder and President, \n     Families of September 11.\n\n  This letter should be read by every Member of the Senate, not only \nwith regard to the cloture motion that was filed yesterday but, \nfrankly, also to some of the normal posturing and game playing that is \ngoing on by different Members, blocking agreement and moving forward on \nthe bill unless their particular amendment is agreed to.\n  It is time for us to wake up, focus on what is really important and \nget this bipartisan bill, S. 4, Improving America's Security Act, \nadopted as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. While the Senate \nawaits resolution on the parliamentary and, I suppose, political \ngridlock in which we find ourselves, I thought I would say a few words \nto remind my colleagues of the background that led to this particular \nlegislation, S. 4, which, I repeat, came out of our Homeland Security \nCommittee with a unanimous, nonpartisan vote of 16 to 0 and one \nabstention and is before us now.\n  I go back to August 21, 2004. On that day, the 9/11 Commission's \nofficial mandate as an independent, nonpartisan commission ended, 1 \nmonth after the release of their final report. But the 10 \nCommissioners, the 10 citizens who were members of the Commission and \nresponsible for its extraordinary work--the findings, the \nrecommendations, many of which we adopted in legislation that followed \nin 2004--the 10 Commissioners decided to stay active in the public \ndebate over the Commission's recommendations that fall. They made a \nreal contribution to continuing to remind us why adopting--certainly \nconsidering first and then adopting--their recommendations was so \nimportant. They testified before Congress during the latter half of \n2004 and played a critical role in helping bring about the passage and \nenactment and the signature by the President of the Intelligence Reform \nand Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004.\n  The 10 Commissioners understood the importance of keeping the \nspotlight on the implementation of their recommendations. They \nconcluded that without their persistent attention, there was a risk \nthat we in Washington would lose focus on the difficult challenges that \nhad been highlighted in the Commission's report and that we would go on \nto other work--not that, obviously, we would lose our care and concern \nabout terrorism. So these 10 Commissioners formed the 9/11 Public \nDiscourse Project, an independent nongovernmental group that held a \nnumber of meetings in 2005 to follow up on the implementation of the \nCommission's recommendations.\n\n  This group, the 9/11 Public Discourse Project, held a series of \npublic meetings to which I have referred in 2005 to gauge progress on \nimplementation of the legislation that resulted from their initial \nreport. In the fall of 2005, later in the year, they issued a series of \nreport cards on intelligence, homeland security, and foreign policy \nthat graded the Federal Government on its implementation of their \nrecommendations.\n  On December 5, 2005, these Commissioners, now joined together in what \nthey called The Project, issued their final report summarizing their \ngrades on the implementation of the 9/11 Commission's 41 \nrecommendations. I can't say that I agreed with all their grades, but \nthey were certainly sobering and should also have been motivating for \nall of us. The Project issued 1 A, 11 Bs, 9 Cs, 12 Ds, 5 Fs, and 2 \nincomplete grades. That calculates out to a C-minus average--not \nexactly the type of grades that would make us happy if our kids brought \nthem home, and obviously the kinds of grades that should make us not \nonly unhappy but agitated and anxious to raise them up when the grades \ndeal with our national security, our homeland security.\n  The cochairs of the 9/11 Commission who went on to be cochairs of the \n9/11 Public Discourse Project, former New Jersey Governor Thomas Kean \nand former member of the House of Representatives Lee Hamilton, vice-\nchair, issued a statement on the release of the report where they \nlamented the progress and its implementation. I quote from the Kean-\nHamilton statement on December 5, 2005. They said:\n\n       We are safer--no terrorist attacks have occurred inside the \n     United States since 9/11--but we are not as safe as we need \n     to be.\n\n  I continue quoting:\n\n       We see some positive changes. But there is so much more to \n     be done. Many obvious steps that the American people assume \n     have\n\n[[Page S2859]]\n\n     been completed have not been. Our leadership is distracted.\n\n  ``There is so much more to be done,'' Chairman Kean and Vice Chairman \nHamilton told the Nation that day at the end of 2005. That is why our \nHomeland Security Committee took up the call and why we reported out S. \n4, which is before the Senate today.\n  Chairman Kean and Vice Chairman Hamilton went on in their remarks to \ndiscuss areas that had not been adequately addressed. They focused on \ninteroperability for first responders around the country, effective \nscreening of visitors to the U.S. against the terrorist watch list, \nhomeland security grant allocations, and they bemoaned what they called \n``the lack of urgency about fixing these problems.''\n  Their statement then continued:\n\n       Bin Laden and al-Qaida believe it is their duty to kill as \n     many Americans as possible. This very day they are plotting \n     to do us harm.\n       On 9/11 they killed nearly 3,000 of our fellow citizens. \n     Many of the steps we recommend would help prevent such a \n     disaster from happening again. We should not need another \n     wake-up call.\n\n  I continue--this is all Kean and Hamilton:\n\n       We believe that the terrorists will strike again. If they \n     do, and these reforms have not been implemented, what will \n     our excuses be? While the terrorists are learning and \n     adapting, our government is still moving at a crawl.\n\n  Tough words from Tom Kean and Lee Hamilton.\n  The terrorists are learning and adapting faster than ever. We saw \nevidence of that last August in the United Kingdom when a terrorist \nplot to blow up planes using liquid explosives--those planes heading \ntoward the United States--was thankfully disrupted. We see evidence on \nthe Internet today which terrorist groups are using increasingly to \nfind new recruits, to develop new capabilities, to share information, \nand to propagandize about their latest exploits. They are moving, these \nterrorists, at a rapid pace. We not only must keep up with them, we \nmust move ahead of them and move more rapidly than they are.\n  Chairman Kean and Vice Chairman Hamilton went on to discuss \nresponsibility for addressing this challenge. They said:\n\n       The first purpose of government in the preamble of our \n     Constitution is to ``provide for the common defense.'' We \n     have made clear time and again what we believe needs to be \n     done to make our country safer and more secure: The \n     responsibility for action and leadership rests with Congress \n     and the President.\n\n  Of course, I agree, and I presume every Member of the Senate agrees, \nthe responsibility rests with us and with the President. We have a \nchoice to make as we debate this bill. We can bear the burden and \nresponsibility of action and leadership and carry out the essential \nreforms that will strengthen our Nation's security or we can forego our \nresponsibilities and take a chance with the homeland security of our \ncountry and its people. That is a risk that I know no Member of this \nChamber wants to take.\n\n  In the final chapter of their book, ``Without Precedent''--that is \nthe name of the book, ``Without Precedent''--which recounted their \nexperience leading the 9/11 Commission, Tom Kean and Lee Hamilton \nrepeat this last statement and conclude with these powerful words:\n\n       We now call upon our elected leaders to come together again \n     with that same sense of urgency and purpose. We call upon \n     Republicans and Democrats to work together to make our \n     country safer and more secure. The American people deserve no \n     less.\n\n  That is from Tom Kean and Lee Hamilton. They are absolutely right. \nThey deserve no less. The American people deserve no less.\n  So we have come together on our committee, and we are moving very \nrapidly on the Senate floor, beginning last Wednesday through this \nweek. We have had some good, healthy debates, disagreements, but \nresolved with votes. The bill as it came out of our committee is in \nstrong shape. It would be a tragedy if we let the procedural \ndifferences, the personal concerns about individual amendments, the \ninability to reason together to stop us from passing this bill and \npassing it urgently. I am confident that we will be able to do it, but \nthe sooner the better.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I note the presence of my friend \nand colleague from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter pertaining to the introduction of S. 813 \nand S. 814 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in the absence of any other Senator \nseeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I note the presence on the floor of our \ncolleague from Arizona. I yield the floor to him at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, yesterday afternoon, our colleague Senator \nSpecter criticized the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia in the Al Odah v. U.S. case. That decision upheld \nthe recently enacted Military Commission Act's bar on lawsuits brought \nby enemy combatants held at Guantanamo Bay.\n  Senator Specter argued that the Guantanamo detainees have a \nconstitutional right to bring these lawsuits, and he predicted that Al \nOdah will be overruled. He based his argument largely on the Supreme \nCourt's 2004 decision in Rasul v. Bush. Senator Specter argued that \nRasul's ruling that habeas extends to Guantanamo Bay was a \nconstitutional ruling. Senator Specter based his argument on Rasul's \ndiscussion of the 18th century common law of habeas corpus. Senator \nSpecter also argued that Justice Scalia's opinion in Rasul acknowledged \nthat Rasul overruled Johnson v. Eisentrager, the landmark decision \nestablishing that captured enemy combatants do not enjoy the privilege \nof litigation.\n  I will address each of Senator Specter's argument in turn. At the \noutset, however, I would like to note that last September, Senator \nSpecter argued that a passage from the plurality opinion in the 2004 \ndecision in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld established that all aliens held in the \nUnited States, regardless of combatant status, are constitutionally \nentitled to seek writs of habeas corpus. In response at that time, I \nargued that Hamdi did not effect such a radical result. I noted that \nthe holding of Hamdi clearly only involved U.S. citizens; that the \nnotion of extending habeas to aliens based on territorial distinctions \nwas inconsistent with the logic of Hamdi; and that Senator Specter's \nreading of Hamdi was inconsistent with basic rules of construction that \nurge against reading groundbreaking new rules into obscure and \nambiguous passages of opinions.\n  I am pleased to see that, today, Senator Specter has not renewed the \nargument that Hamdi extended habeas rights to noncitizen enemy \nsoldiers. I will assume that he was persuaded by the force of the \narguments that I made last September.\n  Today, allow me to try to persuade Senator Specter, and the rest of \nmy colleagues, that the majority opinion in Rasul v. Bush does not \nrequire that the constitutional guarantee of habeas corpus be extended \nto alien enemy combatants who are being detained during wartime.\n  Section 7 of the Military Commissions Act, like its predecessor, the \nDetainee Treatment Act, is predicated on the continuing validity of \nJohnson v. Eisentrager's constitutional holding, on the unbroken \ncommon-law tradition of denying the privilege of litigation to captured \nalien enemy soldiers, and on the understanding that the holding in \nRasul v. Bush was a statutory holding, not a constitutional one.\n  Neither Senator Specter, nor anyone else, has been able to cite a \nsingle case prior to Rasul v. Bush in which any English or American \ncourt has ever held that captured enemy soldiers who are not citizens \nare entitled to seek the writ of habeas corpus. Not one case can be \ncited that grants the writ to alien enemy soldiers. The absence of any \nsuch example over the centuries of the history of the writ of habeas \ncorpus speaks volumes, and alone should be\n\n[[Page S2860]]\n\nconclusive of the constitutional question. Simply put, when the \nConstitution was adopted, the notion that the common law writ of habeas \ncorpus could be employed by alien enemy soldiers was unheard of and it \nremained unheard until June of 2004, when the Supreme Court decided \nRasul v. Bush.\n  Of course, with 5 votes, the Rasul Court could have grafted a habeas \nright for alien enemy combatants onto the Constitution. I believe that \nto do so would have been deeply irresponsible, and I believe that this \nis clearly not what the court did in Rasul.\n  In support of his interpretation of Rasul, Senator Specter argued \nthat Justice Scalia's opinion in Rasul noted that the Rasul majority \noverruled Eisentrager, which had denied litigation rights to alien \nenemy combatants. In response, I would first note that Justice Scalia's \nopinion in Rasul was a dissenting opinion. As any lawyer knows, a \ndissenting opinion's characterization of a court's holding is hardly \nauthoritative. An argument about what a case means that is based \nprimarily on the dissent is inherently a weak argument.\n  Moreover, I do not think that Justice Scalia's dissenting opinion in \nRasul is in any way inconsistent with the notion that Eisentrager's \nconstitutional holding remains good law, and that the constitutional \nright of habeas corpus does not extend to alien enemy soldiers. Justice \nScalia makes clear in his dissent that he is accusing the majority only \nof overruling Eisentrager's statutory holding, not its constitutional \nholding.\n  Justice Scalia begins at page 493 of his dissent by quoting the \nfollowing passage from Eisentrager: ``Nothing in the text of the \nConstitution extends such a right''--a right of habeas corpus for war \nprisoners held overseas--``nor does anything in our statutes.'' It is \nJustice Scalia who italicized the absence of a statutory right when \nquoting this passage. He then went on to note:\n\n       Eisentrager's directly-on-point statutory holding makes it \n     exceedingly difficult for the Court to reach the result it \n     desires today. To do so neatly and cleanly, it must either \n     argue that our decision in Braden overruled Eisentrager, or \n     admit that it is overruling Eisentrager.\n\n  In this passage, Justice Scalia does accuse the Rasul majority of \noverruling Eisentrager, but he also makes clear that he only accuses it \nof overruling Eisentrager's statutory holding, not its constitutional \nholding.\n  But the argument that Rasul v. Bush's holding was only statutory, and \ndid not extend constitutional rights to enemy combatants, is supported \nby more than just Justice Scalia's dissent. The majority opinion itself \nrepeatedly and clearly indicates that the holding in that case is only \nstatutory, not based on the Constitution. For example, on page 475 of \nthe opinion, for example, the majority clearly states that ``[t]he \nquestion now before us is whether the habeas statute confers a right to \njudicial review'' of the detention of the detainees at Guantanamo Bay. \nThus the court was careful to make clear that it was the habeas statute \nthat it was interpreting, not the Constitution.\n  On the next page, when distinguishing Eisentrager, the Rasul majority \nopinion states that ``Eisentgrager made quite clear that [its analysis \nwas] relevant only to the question of the prisoner's constitutional \nentitlement to habeas corpus. The court had far less to say on the \nquestion of the petitioner's statutory right to habeas corpus.''\n  Finally, at page 478, when explaining how it would distinguish the \nholding in Eisentrager, the majority stated: ``Because subsequent \ndecisions of this Court have filled the statutory gap that had \noccasioned Eisentrager's resort to ``fundamentals,'' persons detained \noutside the territorial jurisdiction of any federal district court no \nlonger need rely on the Constitution as the source of their right to \nfederal habeas review.''\n  This statement could not be clearer that Rasul only addressed the \npetitioners' statutory right to habeas, not any constitutional right. \nThe court stated that statutory changes--or rather, changes in the \ninterpretation of statutes--made it unnecessary to reach any \nconstitutional questions in Rasul.\n  Senator Specter's other main argument for his interpretation of Rasul \nis that the majority opinion's discussion of 18th century common law is \na constitutionally binding interpretation of the scope of the writ. My \nresponse is that may be so, but it is not relevant to the \nconstitutionality of the Military Commissions Act. The discussion in \nRasul that Senator Specter cites is about how far the writ applies \noverseas. It is not about whether the writ applies to alien enemy \nsoldiers.\n  Rasul's discussion of the common law of habeas corpus appears in Part \nIV of the majority decision--after the court had already decided that \nthe statutory right extended to the detainees at Guantanamo. This part \nof Rasul is devoted to responding to the argument that the presumption \nagainst extraterritorial application of legislation requires that the \nhabeas statute be construed to not extend to Guantanamo Bay. Justice \nStevens stated that ``[w]hatever traction the presumption against \nextraterritoriality might have in other contexts, it certainly has no \napplication to the operation of the habeas statute with respect to \npersons detained within `the territorial jurisdiction' of the United \nStates.'' Justice Stevens then asserted that at common law the writ \napplied to aliens held overseas, and he went on to describe common law \ncases that he characterized as extending the writ to aliens held at \nplaces outside of the ``sovereign territory of the realm.''\n  Whatever the merits of Justice Stevens's historical analysis, it is \nused in Rasul only to rebut the presumption against \nextraterritoriality. It is used to argue that the writ presumptively \ndoes extend overseas. But this part of Rasul does not address the \ncentral question raised by the Military Commissions Act: whether alien \nenemy soldiers, wherever they are held, are constitutionally entitled \nto seek the writ of habeas corpus. Regardless of whether the writ \napplies to other aliens held at U.S. facilities overseas, the writ does \nnot--it has never been extended--to alien enemy combatants detained \nduring wartime, whether those soldiers are held inside or outside of \nthe United States.\n  None of the common law decisions that Justice Stevens discusses in \npart IV of his opinion granted habeas relief to an alien enemy war \nprisoner. That is because, as I noted earlier, in the history of habeas \ncorpus, prior to Rasul, alien enemy war prisoners have never been found \nto be entitled to the writ. Rasul's historical analysis can be cited \nfor the proposition that the writ extends extraterritorially, even to \naliens. But its discussion does not address the question that we are \nconcerned with here today: whether the writ extends to alien enemy \nsoldiers.\n  Indeed, at one point in its discussion, the Rasul opinion does tend \nto confirm that the common-law habeas right does not extend to enemy \nsoldiers. In its exploration of the scope ``historical core'' of the \ncommon-law writ, Rasul quotes a passage from the Supreme Court's prior \ndecision in Shaughnessy v. United States, which noted that executive \nimprisonment has long been considered oppressive and lawless, and that \nno man should be detained except under ``the law of the land.'' As \nRasul notes, this commentary on the historical scope of the writ came \nfrom Justice Jackson.\n  Just 3 years before he wrote the passage in Shaugnessy that is quoted \nin Rasul, here is something else that Justice Jackson said about the \nscope of the writ. Here is what Justice Jackson said in Johnson v. \nEisentrager about the notion that the writ extends to alien enemy war \nprisoners: ``No decision of this Court supports such a view. None of \nthe learned commentators on our Constitution has ever hinted at it. The \npractice of every modern government is opposed to it.''\n  So there you have it, from the same source that the Rasul majority \nquotes to establish the historical scope of the writ. The writ upholds \nand enforces the law of the land, but the law of the land does not \nextend litigation privileges to aliens with whom we are at war.\n  Let me also cite another, more recent source in support of my \nargument. Yesterday, Senator Specter quoted an editorial from the New \nYork Times that, unsurprisingly, was hostile to the Military \nCommissions Act and the Administration. In response to Senator \nSpecter's liberal columnist, allow me cite my own liberal columnist \nBenjamin Wittes. Mr. Wittes writes op-eds for the Washington Post, is a \nscholar\n\n[[Page S2861]]\n\nat the Brookings Institution, and generally has unimpeachable liberal \ncredentials. I doubt that he and I agree on very many things. Yet this \nis what he had to say, in a recent column in The New Republic, about \nthe D.C. Circuit's decision in Al Odah upholding the Military \nCommissions Act:\n\n       The [Al Odah] court held both that Congress--not the \n     executive branch--stripped the courts of jurisdiction to hear \n     lawsuits from detainees at Guantanamo, and that it had the \n     constitutional power to do so. As a legal matter, the \n     decision is correct. And, if and when the Supreme Court \n     reverses it, as it may do, the decision won't be any less \n     correct. The reversal will signify only that a majority of \n     justices no longer wishes to honor the precedents that still \n     bind the lower courts.\n       As the case heads towards the Supremes, you'll no doubt \n     hear a lot about suspension of the Great Writ of habeas \n     corpus--the ancient device by which courts evaluate the \n     legality of detentions. And you'll also hear a lot about \n     Guantanamo as a legal ``black hole.'' It's all a lot of rot, \n     really, albeit rot a majority of the justices might well \n     adopt.\n       Until the advent of the war on terrorism, nobody seriously \n     believed that the federal courts would entertain challenges \n     by aliens who had never set foot in this country to overseas \n     military detentions--or, at least, nobody thought so who had \n     read the Supreme Court's emphatic pronouncement on the \n     subject. ``We are cited to no instance where a court, in this \n     or any other country where the writ is known, has issued it \n     on behalf of an alien enemy who, at no relevant time and in \n     no stage of his captivity, has been within its territorial \n     jurisdiction,'' the Court wrote in 1950. ``Nothing in the \n     text of the Constitution extends such a right, nor does \n     anything in our statutes.''\n  A final passage from Mr. Wittes Commentary reads as follows:\n\n       Notwithstanding the passionate dissent in the D.C. Circuit \n     case, the notion that [the Military Commissions Act] somehow \n     suspends the writ--a step the Constitution forbids except in \n     cases of rebellion or invasion--is not credible. As a legal \n     matter, it merely restores a status quo that had been \n     relatively uncontroversial for the five decades preceding the \n     September 11 attacks--that federal courts don't supervise the \n     overseas detentions of prisoners of war or unlawful \n     combatants. The demand that they do so now is not one the \n     Constitution makes.\n\n  I would also like to address a point that Senator Sununu made on the \nfloor yesterday. Senator Sununu argued that, because detention of the \nGuantanamo prisoners may be indefinite, these prisoners should be given \na right to challenge their detention.\n  In response, I would like to simply describe the protections that the \nCSRT process provides to Guantanamo detainees and discuss why it would \nbe highly problematic to substitute that process with habeas review.\n  In the CSRT system, a detainee is provided with a personal \nrepresentative who is assigned to help him prepare his case before the \ntribunal. CSRT hearings also include a hearing officer who is required \nto search government files for ``evidence to suggest that the detainee \nshould not be designated as an enemy combatant.'' Prior to the actual \nhearing, the CSRT officers must provide the detainee with a summary of \nthe evidence to be used against him. CSRTs are then subject to \nadministrative review, and the detainee has an appeal of right to the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which is charged \nwith evaluating whether the tribunal complied with the CSRT rules, and \nwhether those rules and procedures are constitutional.\n  All of the procedures described here, incidentally, are above and \nbeyond what lawful prisoners of war are entitled to under the Geneva \nConventions in an Article 5 hearing. Those hearings do not assign \nanyone to help a detainee, they do not require the government to search \nits files for exculpatory evidence, they do not require that a summary \nof the incriminating evidence be provided to the detainee, and they are \nnot subject to any judicial review whatsoever.\n  Indeed, the CSRTs not only provide more process than is required \nunder the Geneva Conventions; the CSRTs require more process than the \nSupreme Court has suggested is required for the United States to detain \neven a U.S. citizen as an enemy combatant. In the governing plurality \nopinion in the 2004 Hamdi decision, the Supreme Court suggested that \neven a U.S. citizen could be detained as a war prisoner if his \ndetention were reviewed by a ``properly constituted military \ntribunal.'' The Supreme Court expressly cited as an example of such a \ntribunal the Article 5 hearings that are conducted under the Geneva \nConventions in cases where there is doubt about a detainee's status. \nThe CSRTs are modeled on and closely track these Geneva Convention \nArticle 5 hearings. And, as I just described, in several respects the \nCSRT process provides even greater protections than an Article 5 \nhearing provides.\n  The Military Commissions Act, of course, does not apply at all to \nUnited States citizens. Out of deference to the force of the legal \nargument made by Justice Scalia in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, both the DTA and \nthe MCA were drafted to only bar aliens from seeking habeas relief, not \nUnited States citizens. And, again, the CSRT hearings that alien enemy \ncombatants do receive provide even more process than the Hamdi \nplurality suggested is owed to an American citizen.\n  Nevertheless, the detainees and their lawyers are unsatisfied with \nthe CSRT process. They want to give Al Qaeda detainees the right to see \nclassified evidence related to their detention, and they want to allow \nthe detainee to call his own witnesses.\n  In a recent column in the National Journal, Stuart Taylor, Jr. cites \na strong example of why it would be a very bad idea to share classified \ninformation with suspected Al Qaeda detainees. Mr Taylor writes:\n\n       Consider the list of almost 200 un-indicted co-\n     conspirators, including the then-obscure Osama bin Laden, \n     that prosecutors in the 1995 trial of 11 subsequently \n     convicted Islamist terrorists were legally required to send \n     to defense counsel. ``That list was in downtown Khartoum \n     within 10 days,'' U.S. District Judge Michael B. Mukasey of \n     Manhattan, who tried the case, recalled in a recent panel \n     discussion. ``And he [bin Laden] was aware within 10 days * * \n     * that the government was on his trail.''\n\n  Mr. Taylor goes on to cite another example where the release of \nsensitive information to a suspected terrorist in the course of legal \nproceedings endangered national security:\n\n       In another judge's case, [Judge] Mukasey recalled, ``there \n     was a piece of innocuous testimony about the delivery of a \n     battery for a cell phone;'' this tipped off terrorists to \n     government surveillance' and as a result [their] \n     communication network shut down within days and intelligence \n     was lost to the government forever, intelligence that might \n     have prevented who knows what.\n\n  Mr. President, it is incidents like this that we must keep in mind \nwhen presented with demands that suspected al-Qaida or Taliban members \nbe allowed to pursue habeas litigation. In civilian litigation, a \ncriminal defendant has a presumptive right to see classified evidence \nused against him. Under CIPA, the Government must summarize or redact \nthe evidence, but the summary or redaction must still provide an \nadequate substitute for the raw evidence. If the substitute is not \ndeemed adequate, the Government must either show the evidence to the \ndetainee or it cannot use the evidence.\n  In the context of Guantanamo, where detention hearings rely heavily, \nif not exclusively, on classified evidence, applying these habeas \nlitigation rules would mean that we would have to either share \nclassified information with al-Qaida detainees or we would have to let \nthem go. Neither of these is an acceptable option. Even the fiercest \ncritics of Guantanamo must accept that the bulk of the detainees held \nthere are connected to al-Qaida or other terrorist groups. We cannot \nsimply seal off these detainees from all contact with the world and \nassume that we will hold them forever. We must assume that some will be \nreleased and that they will be allowed some communication with those \noutside Guantanamo and, under these circumstances, we simply cannot \nhand over classified evidence to Guantanamo detainees.\n  As happened during the embassy bombers' trials, we must assume that \nclassified evidence provided to the detainees will go straight back to \nthe rest of al-Qaida.\n  I should also emphasize that denying an al-Qaida detainee access to \nclassified information does not mean that such evidence will not be \nsubject to any adversary review in the CSRT and DTA process. In the \npending Bismullah case, the Government has proposed a procedural order \nunder which a detainee counsel who has obtained a security clearance \nwould be able to review the classified evidence in the CSRT hearing. If \nthis proposed order is adopted, as I assume it will be in some form, \nthe detainee's lawyer, though not the detainee himself, will have \naccess\n\n[[Page S2862]]\n\nto the classified information used in the CSRT.\n  So when you hear evidence or arguments that the DTA review is unfair \nor that it is inadequate, keep in mind the actual stakes at issue. The \ndetainee's cleared lawyer will get access to the classified \ninformation, but the detainee will not.\n  Under these circumstances, should the Congress force the military to \nprovide classified information to both the lawyer and the suspected \nterrorist?\n  Another complaint about CSRTs is that the Guantanamo detainees are \nnot allowed to call their own witnesses at the hearings. Just who would \nthose witnesses be the detainees would call? Whose testimony would be \nmost relevant to the detainee's enemy combatant status? The only answer \nto this question would be the soldier who originally captured the \ndetainee.\n  Here is Mr. Stuart Taylor's commentary on the proposal that \nGuantanamo detainees be allowed to compel witnesses at their CSRT \nhearings:\n\n       Should a Marine sergeant be pulled out of combat and flown \n     around the world to testify at a detention hearing about \n     when, where, how, and why he had captured the particular \n     detainee? What if the Northern Alliance or some other ally \n     made the capture? And should the military be ordered to \n     deliver high-level al Qaeda prisoners to be cross-examined by \n     other detainees and their lawyers?\n\n  I would suggest that simply to ask this question is to answer it.\n  Here is more that Mr. Taylor had to say about such proposals:\n\n       Many libertarians and human rights activists, on the other \n     hand, would settle for nothing less than the full panoply of \n     protections afforded to ordinary criminal defendants. They \n     should be careful what they wish for. As McCarthy points out: \n     Enemy combatants are often in a position to be killed or \n     captured. Capturing them is the more merciful option, and \n     making it more difficult or costly would almost certainly \n     effect an increase in the number killed.\n\n  The CSRT hearings and the DTA review strike the right balance. They \ngive detainees enough process to ensure that the persons held are enemy \ncombatants and that they pose no threat to the United States. But this \nsystem does not provide a process that would undermine the war with al-\nQaida or that is inconsistent with the realities of war.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I listened with interest to the \ncontentions of the Senator from Arizona and would respond in a number \nof ways. First, the Senator from Arizona went to some length to try to \nundercut the conclusion that aliens are entitled to the same rights as \nAmerican citizens--aliens held at Guantanamo--and made reference to no \ncase before Rasul had so held.\n  But the issue is what does Rasul hold? I would refer the Senator from \nArizona to the opinion of Justice Stevens, which appears at page 2686 \nof volume 124 of the Supreme Court Recorder, which says as follows:\n\n       Aliens held at the base, no less than American citizens, \n     are entitled to invoke the Federal Courts' authority under \n     section 2241.\n\n  Now, it is true that the Congress can change a statute, but it is \nequally true that Congress cannot change a constitutional right, and \nthere is a constitutional right to habeas corpus, which is set forth \nexplicitly in article I, section 9, clause 2 of the United States \nConstitution, which says:\n\n       The privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be \n     suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the \n     public Safety may require it.\n\n  Now, where the Constitution is explicit in the circumstances where \nthe constitutional right can be suspended, obviously there is a \nconclusion that there is such a constitutional right.\n  The Senator from Arizona goes into considerable analysis as to why \nthe Eisentrager case has not been overruled by Rasul. Well, it seems \npretty plain to me on the face that Rasul does overrule Eisentrager, \nand I cited in yesterday's argument the conclusion of Justice Scalia \nthat Rasul overruled Eisentrager. Justice Scalia complains of that. If \nhe had found some way to distinguish Eisentrager in the Rasul opinion, \nI think he would have done so.\n  The Senator from Arizona says we can't rely on a dissenting opinion \nas to what the holding is. Well, I would disagree with that. I think a \ndissenting justice has a good bit of reliability, and especially \nJustice Scalia. When the concession is made that Justice Scalia reads \nRasul to overrule Eisentrager, I think that is pretty good authority, \nperhaps better authority than the opinion of Arlen Specter, maybe even \nbetter authority than the opinion of the distinguished Senator from \nArizona, who is a real legal scholar--on the Arizona Law Review, all \nthe academic standards, but perhaps not superior in legal analysis to \nJustice Scalia.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will stipulate to that.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I have just had a stipulation, may it please the court, \nthat Justice Scalia's interpretation would topple Senator Kyl's \ninterpretation.\n  Let me pose the question directly to Senator Kyl from the debate we \nhave just joined, and I thank him for coming and participating in the \ndebate. It is a rarity on the floor of the Senate to have two Senators \ndebating an issue.\n  Isn't the flat statement by the Supreme Court, speaking through \nJustice Stevens, that ``aliens held at base, no less than American \ncitizens, are entitled to invoke the Federal Courts' authority under \nsection 2241''--albeit that is a statute and the Court of Appeals for \nthe D.C. Circuit has tried to sidestep the court opinion in Rasul by \nsaying it was a holding on a statute which the Congress can change, and \ndenies the very strong language of the court in saying that there is a \nright which was established at the time of 1789, and the Constitution \nspeaks explicitly of the ways to suspend the right, so there is a \nconstitutional right--but taking that language, ``aliens held at base, \nno less than American citizens, are entitled to invoke the Federal \nCourts' authority under section 2241,''--isn't that conclusive that \naliens are entitled to invoke the habeas corpus rights under the \nConstitution?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, first of all, I appreciate both the courtesy \nof the Senator from Pennsylvania and his important legal analysis and \nwould answer the question in this way.\n  I think that most observers believe that the Rasul decision is not a \ndecision on the Constitution but on the statute; that it interprets \nrights based upon the statute, which Congress can change; that it is \nnot a holding that provides a constitutional right to alien enemy \ncombatants to litigate via habeas corpus.\n  Secondly, the Great Writ that has been quoted by the Senator from \nPennsylvania has always been understood in decisions of the court to be \ndefined as it existed at the time of the Constitution. That is why \nthere is always a great interest in looking back to decisions in the \ncommon law of England prior to the adoption of our Constitution, the \nBill of Rights.\n  I think, as I said in my statement, that there has never been a case \nthat suggests that at the time the language about habeas corpus was put \ninto our Constitution any court, in either the United States or \nEngland, at the time, had ever held that the writ applied to alien \nenemy combatants. So it has never been held that the writ applies to \naliens. It has been held that it applies to U.S. citizens, and it has \ncertainly never been held that it applies to alien enemy combatants.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, Mr. President, may I redirect the line of \ncontention that if the Supreme Court said authoritatively that aliens \nare covered under a habeas corpus statute, wouldn't that apply a \nfortiori necessarily to aliens being covered under a constitutional \nright of habeas corpus?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would say to my colleague that nothing in \nthe grant of the writ in the Constitution, as far as I know, would deny \nthe right of Congress to expand it to include others. Certainly, one \ncould not take away from the writ as it was understood when it was put \ninto the Constitution. For example, we could not deny to U.S. citizens \nthe writ of habeas corpus because of the constitutional provision, but \nit would not speak to the question of whether Congress could extend the \nauthority of the writ to aliens.\n  The case here, however, is that the decision in question was based on \na statute which Congress had adopted, and it does not go to the \nquestion of whether the writ itself ever applied to aliens. In fact, it \nnever applied to alien enemy combatants.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would ask the Senator from Arizona if\n\n[[Page S2863]]\n\nthere is anything in the legislation, 2241, statutory right of habeas \ncorpus, which in any way suggests that it is an expansion of the right \nof habeas corpus to apply to aliens who were not being comprehended in \nthe ordinary understanding of the constitutional right of habeas \ncorpus. Anything at all in the statute or legislative history?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would have to go back and read it very \nclosely, but my recollection is that the court found the statute rather \nuninformative and rather unclear, and that was part of the basis for \nthe court reading it in a way that went beyond what I thought it \nprovided. Nonetheless, one can understand that when the court views a \nstatute that doesn't provide clear limitations, its inclination may \nwell be to lean forward in its interpretation.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, Mr. President, it may be uninformative and it may \nbe unclear, but it doesn't, on a statutory basis, extend the right to \naliens. To make the contention that a reading of the statutory right of \nhabeas corpus, which goes not beyond that language, was an attempt to \nextend it, and that the Court, in Rasul, was saying, well, the statute \ngives more rights than the Constitution, I think, is an extraordinary \nstretch. But I will conclude the colloquy with the contention that \ncertainly the Great Writ, the constitutional right with all its \nmajesty, would be no narrower than a statute. I would concede Congress \ncould extend the statute further, but there is no indication absolutely \nthat the Congress did intend it. And that the court of appeals' \ndecision, distinguishing Rasul as being a statutory interpretation, and \nthen the court of appeals saying there is no constitutional right, is \nthinner than tissue paper. But we will hear more from Justice Stevens, \nI am sure, on this point in due course.\n\n  Let me now move to a portion of my argument yesterday on which the \nSenator from Arizona has not commented. I will begin with the \nmemorandum from the Secretary of the Navy dated July 7, 2004, which \ndefines enemy combatants and then says that notice will be given to all \ndetainees and they will be notified ``of the right to seek a writ of \nhabeas corpus in the courts of the United States.''\n  As I said yesterday, I hadn't noted this provision until we did the \nresearch preparing for debate on this amendment. I will first direct a \nquestion to the Senator from Arizona as to whether the Senator from \nArizona was familiar, before I cited it yesterday, that the Department \nof Defense had acknowledged the rights of Guantanamo detainees to seek \na writ of habeas corpus in the Federal courts?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the answer is no, I was not. I regret I \ndidn't hear the argument of the Senator yesterday.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The Department of Defense concedes that detainees have a \nright to a writ of habeas corpus, that Congress has delegated to the \nSecretary of Defense the authority to promulgate rules relating to the \ndetainees, and where the Secretary of Defense through the Deputy says \nthey have a right to habeas corpus, that should end the discussion.\n  But let me pursue one other line further here; that is, the fairness \nof what happens under the Combat Status Review Tribunals.\n  The memorandum from the Deputy Secretary of Defense defines what an \nenemy combatant is. It says:\n\n       The term ``enemy combatant'' shall mean an individual who \n     was part of supporting Taliban or al-Qaida forces or \n     associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the \n     United States or its coalition partners. This includes any \n     person who has committed a belligerent act or has directly \n     supported hostilities in aid of enemy forces.\n\n  Then the memorandum further says that:\n\n       A preponderance of the evidence shall be the standard used \n     in reaching this determination, but there shall be a \n     rebuttable presumption in favor of the Government's evidence.\n\n  The first question I direct to the Senator from Arizona relates to \nthe rebuttable presumption in favor of the Government's evidence, and \nnote that a very basic, fundamental, Anglo-Saxon, U.S. right is the \npresumption of innocence. Does the Senator from Arizona think it is \nfair that there be a presumption of guilt articulated in a rebuttable \npresumption in favor of the Government's evidence?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me just try to respond very briefly to \nthe question of the Senator. Again, I regret I didn't hear the full \nargument that was made yesterday.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Wait a minute. Mr. President, regular order. The Senator \nfrom Arizona may yield, but I have directed the question through the \nChair to the Senator from Arizona. Having had an extensive discussion \non this issue yesterday--and when I say ``extensive,'' it was extensive \nby the Senator from South Carolina--all factors considered, I would \njust as soon not hear it again but would be willing to listen to it \nlater.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will respond very briefly by saying, first \nof all, I fully associate myself--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Arizona \nmay respond.\n  Mr. KYL.--with the comments of my colleague from South Carolina \nyesterday.\n  To the first point, if I could just make a brief comment, after the \nRasul decision, after the Rasul case was decided--\n  Mr. SPECTER. No coaching.\n  Mr. KYL. No coaching.\n  After the Rasul case was decided, I am sure, Senator Specter, you \nwould agree it was important for the Department of Justice to advise \npeople of the rights that were provided as a result of that decision. \nThat is my understanding of what they did. They had a policy of saying: \nThe Court has made this decision. They found a statutory right of \nhabeas corpus, and you have the right to do the following things under \nthat statute. But that would not be a pronouncement of law by the \nDepartment of Defense. Certainly it hasn't been relied upon, to my \nknowledge, by any court in deciding what the scope of the writ is. So, \nas to your first point, I hardly think it is good evidence of the \nconstitutional application of the writ to detainees that after the \nRasul decision, the Department of Justice properly advised people as to \ntheir statutory rights based upon that decision.\n  As to the second question--just one quick quotation. This was \nprovided to me, at my request, by Senator Graham. In the Hamdi case, in \nthe O'Connor opinion, she specifically answers the question you posed, \nSenator Specter, on page 27 of the opinion, where she says:\n\n       Likewise, the Constitution would not be offended by a \n     presumption in favor of the Government's evidence so long as \n     that presumption remained a rebuttable one and a fair \n     opportunity for rebuttal were provided.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, that is a good segue into my next \nquestion, as to whether the Combat Status Review Tribunals give you a \nfair opportunity. I was about to quote Justice O'Connor in support \nof my argument that there is not a fair opportunity. Let me be very \nspecific. The decision of Judge Green, In re: Guantanamo Cases, which I \ncited yesterday, which appears in 355 Fed. Sup. 2d 443--and I quote \nfrom her statement, at page 468. Judge Greene says this:\n\n       The inherent lack of fairness of the CSRT's [Combat Status \n     Review Tribunal's] consideration of classified information \n     not disclosed to the detainees is perhaps most vividly \n     illustrated in the following unclassified colloquy, which, \n     though taken from a case not precisely before this judge, \n     exemplifies the practice and severe disadvantages faced by \n     all Guantanamo prisoners.\n\n  In reading a list of allegations forming the basis for the detention, \nMustafa Ait Idir, a petitioner in Boumediene--which is the case that \nwent to the court of appeals; this is the case which they decided and \nupheld the procedures of the Combat Status Review Tribunal--Judge Green \ngoes on to say:\n\n       The Recorder of the CSRT asserted: ``While living in \n     Bosnia, the detainee associated with a known al-Qaida \n     operative.''\n\n  In response the following exchange occurred.\n\n       Detainee: Give me his name.\n       Tribunal President: I do not know.\n       Detainee: How can I respond to this?\n\n  And then the detainee later says:\n\n       I asked the interrogators to tell me who this person was. \n     Then I could tell you if I might have known this person, but \n     not if person is a terrorist. Maybe I knew this person as a \n     friend. Maybe it was a person that worked with me. Maybe it \n     was a person that was on my team. But I do not know if this \n     person is Bosnian, Indian or whatever. If you tell me the \n     name, then I can respond and defend myself against this \n     accusation.\n\n\n[[Page S2864]]\n\n\n  The Tribunal President then says:\n\n       We are asking you the questions and we need you to respond \n     to what is on the unclassified summary.\n\n  And the detainee later said:\n\n       I was hoping you had evidence that you can give me. If I \n     was in your place--and I apologize in advance for these \n     words--but if a supervisor came to me and showed me \n     accusations like this, I would take these accusations and I \n     would hit him in the face with them. Sorry about that.\n\n  And then in parens it says:\n\n       Everyone in the tribunal room laughed.\n\n  That is from the transcript. The Tribunal President said:\n\n       We had a laugh but it is OK.\n\n  Then Judge Green says:\n\n       The laughter reflected in the transcript is understandable, \n     and this exchange might have been truly humorous had the \n     consequences of the detainee's ``enemy combatant status'' not \n     been so terribly serious and had the detainee's criticism of \n     the process not been so piercingly accurate.\n\n  This tribunal, as to the detainee in the Boumediene case, that got to \nthe circuit court of appeals--how the circuit court of appeals could \nsay this is fair, how the circuit court of appeals could say this \ncomports with the definition the Department of Defense has set out, \nthat enemy combatant means ``an individual who is a part or supporting \nTaliban or al-Qaida forces or including a person who has committed a \nbelligerent act or who has directly supported hostilities in aid of the \nenemy Armed Forces'' when the only thing in the transcript is ``while \nliving in Bosnia the detainee associated with a known al-Qaida \noperative''--``associated with a known al-Qaida operative'' hardly \nmeets the definition of the Department of Defense itself, of supporting \nTaliban or al-Qaida forces or ``associated forces that are engaged in \nhostilities'' or ``a person who has committed a belligerent act.''\n  This detainee, whose detention was upheld by the Court of Appeals of \nthe District of Columbia on as great a stretch as imaginable on legal \nprinciples, is looking at a record where all the detainee was supposed \nto have done was talked to al-Qaida. They couldn't even name the \nperson. That is miles from satisfying the definition by the Department \nof Defense.\n  Let me ask the Senator from Arizona, is that fair?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I answer my friend and colleague from \nPennsylvania that I disagree with a lot of jury verdicts and with a lot \nof court opinions. But once a matter is concluded, as officers of the \ncourt, we are supposed to respect the decision of the court. I do. I \ndon't know the facts of every case that has been litigated, but they \nhave done so under a procedure that has been upheld as constitutional. \nJust as I was willing to stipulate that Justice Scalia probably has a \nbetter handle on Supreme Court interpretation than either--well, I \ndidn't stipulate that he has a better interpretation than Senator \nSpecter, but I acknowledged in my case that he would--I think you have \nto say that if a court of appeals has made such a decision, then it is \na bit presumptuous for us, with great confidence, to say that they \nnecessarily were wrong.\n  So I am not going to second guess a decision like that. I would \nrather simply point to the most recent decision which upheld the \nprocedures in the Al-Odah case--that case will be decided by the U.S. \nSupreme Court. My colleague and I have a different view, I suspect, as \nto how that case will come out. We will just have to wait and see. If \nit turns out that I am correct, that the court of appeals' decision is \ncorrect, then this debate which we have had here probably won't matter. \nBut I do believe that until that decision is made, it would be unwise \nfor us to again change the law, thus throwing into even greater \nconfusion what has up to now been a pretty confused state of affairs.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would not mind being a bit \npresumptuous. I wouldn't even mind being a lot presumptuous in response \nto the opinion of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. \nBut I don't think it is presumptuous at all to go into the facts, which \nwe know from Judge Green's opinion, as to the detainee involved in the \nBoumediene case and where the only allegation is that he talked to an \nal-Qaida person and they couldn't even give the name.\n  You have the definition of the Department of Defense requiring that \nthere be information about the detainee supporting al-Qaida forces or \ncommitting a belligerent act. However, nobody said those things about \nthe detainee in the case. And then there is the court of appeals, a \nsplit court, with the opinion of Judge Rogers in dissent, I understand \nthe relative merits of a two-judge majority, one in dissent, but that \ndoesn't overcome the continuing importance of the Rogers' analysis of \nthe majority opinion concerning their attempt to slice the apple by \nholding that the Supreme Court's opinion in Rasul was statutory and not \nconstitutional.\n  The majority said that the Eisentrager case was not overruled by \nRasul. But it obviously was, as Justice Scalia acknowledged in his \ndissent in the Rasul case. And Justice Scalia would have all the more \nreason for disagreeing if there was any basis at all to say that \nEisentrager was not overruled.\n  You have the court of appeals relying on the Eisentrager case that \nwas specifically overruled by Rasul, and not acknowledging a \nconstitutional right of habeas corpus and not acknowledging the fact \nthat while you can change an act of Congress, a statute cannot trump \nthe Constitution.\n  I do not think it is presumptive at all to say that the procedures \nunder the combat status review tribunal ought to be changed.\n  Regrettably we are not going to get a vote on this matter on this \nbill. We are not going to get a vote because a cloture petition has \nbeen filed. That is arcane. But in the unlikely event anybody is \nwatching on C-SPAN 2, that means nongermane amendments will fall, and \nthis is nongermane for technical reasons.\n  I tried yesterday to get cloture on this amendment, which would have \nenabled us to get a vote tomorrow morning at the time of the cloture \nvote on the underlying bill. However, that required getting 17 \nsignatures, and the majority leader was opposed, and the Democrats \nwould not sign on. There are a few Republicans who were prepared to \nsign on; some did.\n  But talking to Senator Leahy, who is the cosponsor, we are going to \ntry to get the majority leader to bring it up free standing, or we can \nadd it on to some other bill, and we will be better prepared to try to \nget cloture in the future.\n  Let me say one final word, and that is, Senator Kyl and I are good \nfriends. Senator Graham and I are good friends. We sit on many matters \nwhere we are in agreement. I have great respect for Senator Kyl. I \nalready identified his qualifications--law review, outstanding scholar, \noutstanding Senator. Senator Graham is an acknowledged expert in \nmilitary law, knows more about military law than perhaps anybody else \nin the Chamber, not that he knows more about constitutional law than \nanybody else in the Chamber, but as much constitutional law as anybody \nelse in the Chamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this is going to sound too much like the \nmutual admiration society, but before Senator Specter said what he \nsaid, I rose because I wanted, in return, to pay him a compliment.\n  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee prior to the last election, he \nperformed admirable service to the Senate. I think it is not well known \nthat that kind of a job requires a lot of different skills to be \nemployed to deal with a lot of cantankerous Senators who have their own \nideas about how things should be done. Senator Specter always conducted \nthat committee in a way which allowed us to get business done, and \nrespected the rights of Senators. Far too often, debate, or what passes \nfor debate in this Chamber, is speeches given by Senators on different \npoints of view, like ships passing in the night with no joining of the \nissues, and no serious discussion of complex legal issues, when that \nshould be required.\n  Certainly the Presiding Officer would be well qualified to judge what \nI am saying. But I always appreciated the opportunity, even when we \nwere in disagreement, to discuss and to debate with the Senator from \nPennsylvania, because he is a serious scholar who takes these matters \nseriously. He may not always come up with legal theory with which I \nagree, but it is always interesting to debate him. At the end of\n\n[[Page S2865]]\n\nthe day, I would like to think this kind of debate does add to a record \nthat the Court or other observers might actually find informative and \nhelpful in their decisions.\n  Again, while we disagree with each other on this matter, I think it \nis apparent that we do so respectfully and with regard for each other's \nopinions.\n  I want to say there is no greater expert in our body on military law \nthan the Senator from South Carolina. I have always appreciated his \nwise advice and counsel on these matters as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, this is a session worthy of the Senate, \nworthy of the country, and I think incredibly important. I compliment \nSenator Kyl for what I thought was an excellent overview of what the \nlaw requires in this area, what the Geneva Conventions require, and how \nour country exceeds the requirement of the Geneva Conventions.\n  To my good friend Senator Specter, there is no better champion of \nfairness and constitutional causes than Senator Specter. On this we \nrespectfully disagree as to what the courts have said, and as far as \nthe lay of the land of how you do this.\n  I do not come to this body as an expert on the Geneva Conventions. I \nhave had some time in the military as a military lawyer. I have a \npretty good understanding of what is going on in some respects. But I \nask every Senator to review what is going on and make their own \njudgments, ask their own legal friends if they are not lawyers, and try \nto be fair.\n\n  We will all serve the country well if we will have a process that is \nconstitutionally sound, that meets the test of fairness, and also \nrecognizes we are at war and we are under great threat. So my basic \npresumption here as a Senator is I want to put infrastructure in place \nthat recognizes the country is in an ongoing global struggle, and that \nas part of that global struggle we are dealing with people who are out \nof uniform.\n  This is not a capital to conquer or a navy to sink or an air force to \nshoot down. This is a unique war in the sense that it is ideologically \nbased, not a particular location we are trying to conquer and not a \nparticular uniform we are trying to suppress. The global war on \nterrorism is about extreme versus moderation, and it is rearing its \nhead all over the planet.\n  So the battlefield in this war, from my point of view, is the globe \nitself, just as in World War II--the al-Qaida enemy. That is who we are \ntalking about, people affiliated with al-Qaida, al-Qaida-like \noperatives who are going throughout the planet trying to kill \ncivilians, rampantly trying to inflict harm on our own troops for an \nideological agenda based on religion. They have no boundaries. They are \nnot signatories to the convention. They do not play by the law of armed \nconflict.\n  But even if they have a status in the law of armed conflict, we are \ntrying to make sure their status is determined in the proper way. We \nrealized in past wars that the Viet Cong and others operated outside of \na uniform, in a guerilla-type fashion. Well, the terrorists operate out \nof uniform with absolutely no respect for any concept of the law of \narmed conflict. But once they are captured, if they are not killed, \nthen it becomes about us, not about them.\n  What does the United States do when it finds an enemy combatant, \nsomeone out of uniform, who is engaged in hostilities? See, I do \nbelieve 9/11 was not just a crime; this was an act of war. There are \nwarriors all over this planet involved in a great struggle, in their \nminds, against moderate Muslims and every other religion, Christian, \nJewish faith, and they have no place for the rest of us. If you solved \nthe Jewish-Palestinian problem tomorrow, they would still be coming \nafter us.\n  The people at greatest risk are moderate Muslims in the Middle East \nwho would tolerate different ways of looking at religion. So there is a \nglobal struggle, and when we find a person we believe to be an al-Qaida \noperative or a supplier of materials to al-Qaida, the first thing, if \nthey survive the battle, is that our military must fight the war, and \nif they are captured, we have to determine their status.\n  If there is a question as to whether the person captured by the \nAmerican military is a lawful combatant, an enemy combatant, or \nnonbelligerent, who makes the decision as to what is the proper status \nfor that individual?\n  Well, under the law of armed conflict--and I do believe we are at \nwar--it is the military. Under the Geneva Conventions, it is the \nmilitary. Article 5 of the Geneva Conventions is very important. \nBecause within that article, it informs the world at large, the \nsignatories of the conventions, that a competent tribunal must be \nempaneled to determine the status. That competent tribunal panel all \nover the world is the military.\n  The reason I object so vehemently to allowing habeas petitions to be \nfiled to determine who is a military threat is we would be conferring \nwhat is a military decision, historically and under the law of armed \nconflict, and literally making it a civilian judge's decision where \nwitnesses would be called and the judge would have a full-blown trial, \nwith some very sensitive information.\n  I do respect our judges, but with all due respect to our judges--I \nthink most of them appreciate this--they are not trained as to who a \nmilitary threat is to the United States. That truly is a military \ndecision, and we are not making that up after 9/11. That has been a \nmilitary decision under the Geneva Conventions article 5 since the \nconventions were drafted. So we are doing nothing new because we were \nattacked by an ``un-uniformed'' enemy.\n  The question as to what Senator Specter has raised: What process do \nwe have in place to determine if a person is truly an enemy combatant, \na concept recognized by the Geneva Conventions, the combat status \nreview tribunal to me is not only constitutionally sound, it goes \nbeyond what the Geneva Conventions require. Senator Specter read a \ntranscript of a case that went to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. I \nwant us to slow down for a moment and think about that. The case as to \nwhether this person was an enemy combatant worked its way up through \nour Federal judiciary to the second highest court in the land.\n  Under the law we passed last year, we allowed in every decision by \nthe military that results in a finding that a person is an enemy \ncombatant that that individual will be able to go to our court system, \nwhich is not required under the Geneva Conventions and is done nowhere \nelse that I know of, and the court will review that case on two \ngrounds: Were the procedures in place constitutional--Senator Specter \nmentioned this--and do you feel comfortable with the rebuttable \npresumption? Well, that has already been decided. In the Hamdi case of \n2004, they specifically comment on the CSRT procedures. There is a \npreponderance of the evidence test required. The Government must prove \nby a preponderance of the evidence that the person in question is an \nenemy combatant.\n  This is not a judicial proceeding, this is an administrative \nproceeding. It is like the EPA deciding an administrative question. But \nit is an important decision, because if you are an enemy combatant, you \ncan be held for an indeterminate period of time. As long as you are a \nthreat, you can be held as long as hostilities exist.\n  The problem with this war is we do not know when the war is going to \nbe over, so we want to build robust due process.\n  Let me tell my colleagues without hesitation: We have let almost \n200--I can't remember the number--go from Guantanamo Bay who had been \ncaptured and determined to be enemy combatants. Every year their status \nwas reviewed because we do not want to keep people forever unless there \nis a reason to keep them. Three things are looked at in every person's \ncase administratively: Do you have intelligence value still; are you a \nthreat to the country; and has anything new come into the case file to \nsay you were originally misidentified as an enemy combatant? Twelve of \nthe people released have gone back to the fight, have gone back to \ntrying to kill Americans and civilians.\n  The question for this country and the world is when it comes time to \ndecide to release somebody, there is risk to be had in that decision. \nWho should share that risk the most? Is it the civilian populations \nthat have been the victims of these ``un-uniformed'' killers who have \nchosen to join these organizations or support them with no boundaries \nor should it be the people who take up these causes?\n\n[[Page S2866]]\n\n  I will tell you where I am coming down. If there is a doubt as to \nwhether they continue to be a threat to our country and other peace-\nloving people, we are not going to turn them loose to fight us again. \nEvery enemy combatant is not a war criminal. There is a separate \nproceeding at Guantanamo Bay to deal with those people involved in war \ncrimes. If you start mixing the two, it will come back to haunt our \ncountry because we do not want to stand for the concept as a nation \nthat every time an American soldier is captured in the battles of the \nfuture it would be appropriate to label them a war criminal. War \ncriminals have to do specific things. Being part of an enemy force does \nnot make one a war criminal.\n  So the point I am trying to make is the administrative procedures in \nplace at Guantanamo Bay have been found to be constitutional, but we \nadded a provision last year that allows the court to review whether the \ntribunal's finding was supported by a preponderance of the evidence, \nand allowing a rebuttal presumption in favor of the Government's \nevidence.\n  In other words, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals can look at the \nmilitary's findings, not just the process, and they can say, as a panel \nof judges: Wait a minute, there is no competent evidence to support a \nfinding that you are an enemy combatant. The court can say the case \nfile is deficient. Not only was the process deficient--the process \ncould be constitutionally sound--but it could result in an individual \ncase where there was not sufficient evidence in the opinion of the \ncourt. The court does this all the time.\n  The court will review administrative bodies' decisionmaking abilities \nthroughout this land. It could be in the EPA, it could be in some other \nagency of the Government, where the court will be able to look at the \nhearing officer's findings and determine if there was sufficient \nevidence to support that hearing officer's finding.\n  So going back to the transcript Senator Specter read, they did not \ntell him who it was. Well, maybe the reason he was not told who \ninformed is because if we put out in a public setting our informant \nsystem, they will wind up getting killed. That is not an unknown \nconcept in criminal law.\n  So I would argue, there is information in these cases that will never \nbe publicly disclosed because if we start publicly disclosing the \nentire network that led to this capture, we are going to get people \nkilled and we will be less safe. That is why we have a classified \nportion.\n  Shaikh Mohammed, the mastermind of 9/11, will be going through this \nprocess tomorrow, I believe, at Guantanamo Bay. Fourteen other high-\nvalue detainees captured in the global war on terror--very significant \nplayers in the al-Qaida movement--will be given a hearing at Guantanamo \nBay, where the Government will have to prove the person in question--\nShaikh Mohammed--is, in fact, an enemy combatant as defined by our own \nregulations, consistent with the Geneva Convention.\n  These hearings will be closed. I applaud the fact they are closed. \nThe evidence will be redacted and given to the public and the press. \nBut there will be a transcript available to be reviewed by the DC \nCircuit Court of Appeals, including the classified portion, in a \nclassified setting.\n  I think it would be a huge mistake to disclose the methods and \noperations and the sources that led to the capture of Shaikh Mohammed \nin an administrative proceeding. Our courts will look at that evidence \nin a classified fashion because Shaikh Mohammed will be allowed to have \nhis case reviewed, after the military makes their decision, in Federal \ncourt--something never done in any other war. The reason we did this \nlast year, with Senator Levin's help, was to make sure--because we do \nnot know when this war will be over--there will be a check and balance \non a military decision never known in any other war.\n  I support that check and balance. I support the idea that every \nmilitary decision regarding enemy combatant status will work its way \nthrough our court system. I vehemently object to taking what is a \nmilitary decision and giving it to a civilian judge in a habeas forum, \nwhich is a complete Federal trial where the civilian judge makes the \ndecision, not the military. Let the judges review the military work \nproduct. Do not give it to the civilian judges.\n  Shaikh Mohammed will be classified one way or the other. I am sure he \nwill be classified as an enemy combatant. But the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals will get to review his case. What is likely to happen in his \ncase, if you believe the press reports? If he truly can be proven to be \nthe mastermind of 9/11, he will be tried as a war criminal because the \nactivities he engaged in--of orchestrating a series of attacks on our \ncountry, where you hijack civilian aircraft to go into the World Trade \nCenter and to attack Washington, DC--would be a violation of war, as \nwell as a crime.\n\n  So he could work his way into the military commission trial \nprocedure. ``Enemy combatant'' is an administrative determination. \nCharging somebody with a war crime is a totally different process. If \nthe Government charges him with a war crime in a military commission \nsetting, in a military commission format at Guantanamo Bay, they will \nnot be allowed to give to the jury classified information proving he is \nguilty of what we are accusing him of doing, unless they share it with \nthe accused. That was my objection to President Bush's proposal. I do \nnot want to create a precedent where one of our soldiers could be tried \nin a foreign land, accused of being a war criminal, and never be given \nthe evidence and be able to defend against what would be a criminal \nproceeding resulting in death or long-term imprisonment.\n  So for Shaikh Mohammed or anyone else, if the Government decides to \nuse classified evidence to find someone guilty, they get a chance to \ndefend themselves because we are talking about a punishment that could \ninclude execution.\n  There are two different concepts. The rules are different. What goes \non in a military commission trial is consistent with what we do with \nour own troops under the Uniform Code of Military Justice when we try \nthem for crimes. One is an administrative determination that exceeds \nthe Geneva Convention requirements. The other is a criminal proceeding \nunder the Law of Armed Conflict that I believe will be constitutional \nand the courts will say is a process worthy of this country.\n  As to what the law is, I say to my good friend, Senator Specter, I \nbelieve the Rasul case was based on this concept. The Department of \nJustice argued that Guantanamo Bay was outside the jurisdiction of the \nUnited States. If that were the case, if they won that argument, the \nconstitutional provisions of habeas would not apply, nor would the \nstatutory provisions. But Rasul was about a statute, not about the \nconstitutional provisions, in my opinion.\n  Here is what the court said: They rejected the Bush position that the \nlaws of the United States do not apply to Guantanamo Bay because of the \nlease and because of the relationship we have to that facility.\n  Do you know what. I think the court was right. I think that was an \nill-advised position by the Bush administration.\n  So once Rasul was decided, and they rejected Eisentrager's statutory \ninterpretation test, the Rasul court, in my opinion, said since it is \nwithin the United States, and Congress has not spoken to this in 2241--\nCongress has never said because you are an alien enemy combatant at \nGuantanamo Bay you cannot have a 2241 right--we are going to confer \nthat right until Congress decides otherwise.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, will the Senator from South Carolina \nyield for one question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, when the Senator from South Carolina \nsays, in the case cited that got to the Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia, where the charge was he had talked to an al-Qaida \nperson, but they could not give the name--and the Senator from South \nCarolina seeks to justify that on the ground there might be some \ncircumstance where disclosing the name would reveal a confidential \nsource--can the Senator from South Carolina give any conceivable way \nthere would be a disclosure of a source simply by identifying the al-\nQaida person this detainee was supposed to have talked to?\n\n[[Page S2867]]\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, if I may, just not being an intelligence \nexpert, when we start naming the people involved around the individual, \nthen we are talking about locations, specific sites. I would be very \nworried if we started naming in detail al-Qaida operatives, where they \nwere, what they said, because that could set in effect a chain of \nevents that would allow the enemy to understand what happened in that \ntransaction.\n  We may just disagree about this issue, but I do believe that the \nclassified--that Shaikh Mohammed--maybe I can say it this way. I am \nglad that Shaikh Mohammed's case is classified, and we are not going to \nreveal to the public how we captured him, all the evidence that led us \nto find out where he was and what he was doing. I think it would be a \nnightmare for this country.\n  As to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals opinion, I say to Senator \nSpecter, they said the procedure was constitutional. I agree with them. \nWhether or not the individual case had sufficient evidence to support a \nfinding is now subject to review by the court. This gentleman will get \nthat review by the court based on what we did last year.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I find it very hard--really \nimpossible--to follow that answer. I cannot conceive of what the Shaikh \nMohammed case has to do with my question or has to do with the \nproceeding before the Combat Status Review Tribunal for the detainee \nwhose case got to the court of appeals, where he was accused of talking \nto an al-Qaida person, and they could not even identify the name of the \nperson. That is not asking any places and times and whatever other \nactivity was taken. I would rest my case, contrary to the arguments by \nthe Senator from South Carolina, on that point.\n  If anybody thinks the Senator from South Carolina has given any \nreason that they could not identify the identity of the al-Qaida person \nwithout disclosing a confidential source--not talking about when, \nwhere, and under what circumstances--if my colleagues who will vote on \nthis ultimately are satisfied with the answer by the Senator from South \nCarolina, then I will accept their judgment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I appreciate that. And I will continue. I will say this \nto my good friend from Pennsylvania. You were reading the transcript of \na case that went on appeal. You have determined yourself that an \ninjustice was rendered. You have made an opinion inconsistent with what \nthe court found. You have your own sense of justice. I appreciate it, I \nadmire it, but I do believe the court is right and you are wrong.\n  I do believe there is no constitutional right available to enemy \ncombatant terrorists, noncitizens. I do not believe Rasul decided that, \nbecause if they had decided that, all these cases we are talking about \nwould have been dismissed.\n  The circuit court of appeals may not be the--they would have gotten \nthat. We have a case going to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals that \neither they have no idea of what the law is or Senator Specter is \nwrong.\n  So I hope my colleagues will understand the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals is not blind to the issues in this case, they just did not miss \nthe fact that the Supreme Court, in Rasul, 3 years ago, declared a \nconstitutional right and the DC Circuit Court of Appeals is out to \nlunch as a group of judges who do not understand one of the biggest \ndecisions in American jurisprudence. If my colleagues believe that \nRasul created a constitutional right for an enemy combatant, \nnoncitizen, and everybody in the legal system has missed it, then you \nshould not trust anything coming out of the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals, you should not trust any decision coming from district court \njudges all over the country who are dismissing these cases, and you \nshould not believe a thing I say.\n  But there is a reason the DC Circuit Court of Appeals did not feel \nbound by a constitutional finding in Rasul--because the court did not \nfind that. There is a reason they upheld the proceedings in the case in \nquestion, and some of that reason may be classified. I don't know. But \nI do know this: It is not good law or public policy to take a \ntranscript released by the defense counsel and read it in isolation and \ntry to use that anecdotal story to say that the whole process is \nbroken, when the court looked at the entire process and found that it \nwas not broken. I can promise my colleagues that if the Rasul case said \nthere was a constitutional right to habeas corpus by a noncitizen enemy \ncombatant, it would have been a major issue in the Al Odah case. The \nreason Al Odah decided what it did is because it rejected the defense \nclaim there should be, and there is no evidence in the Al Odah case \nthat the DC Circuit Court of Appeals took precedent in the Rasul case \nand came out with a different finding. Don't my colleagues think there \nwould have been a long discussion in the Al Odah case by the DC Circuit \nCourt of Appeals that here is why the precedent set in Rasul for a \nconstitutional habeas right for an enemy combatant noncitizen is wrong?\n\n  So please give the DC Circuit Court of Appeals some credit for not \nmissing the biggest issue in military law in 200 years because they \ndidn't miss it. Please give the Department of Defense some credit that \nwhen they issued this memo to detainees and their lawyers in July of \n2004 indicating there is a habeas petition available to you, that it \nwasn't the Department of Defense's desire to create that right and that \nwhat they were doing was consistent with Rasul in saying that under \n2241 you now had this right. For someone to suggest that memo was a \nconscious decision by the Department of Defense to give a habeas right \nto detainees I think completely misunderstands what the memo was about, \ndistorts what it was about, and is a complete misunderstanding of what \nhappened in Rasul. The Department of Defense had no other choice but to \ntell the detainees after the Rasul decision: You can file habeas \npetitions under 2241.\n  The Supreme Court in three cases has told the Congress: You need to \nspeak here. We found a statutory right because you haven't excluded it. \nDo you want as a Congress to confer on the Shaikh Mohammeds of the \nworld an ability to go into Federal court of their own choosing, to \nfind the most liberal judge they can find in this country, and take the \nmilitary and every other intelligence agency to court and have that \njudge, in a full-blown trial, determine whether this person is an enemy \ncombatant? That would be changing a process on its head. That would be \ntaking away from the military the ability they have under the Law of \nArmed Conflict to decide who an enemy combatant is and give it to a \ncivilian judge who is not trained in that. It would be a fundamental, \nfar-reaching mistake that would haunt us and undermine our national \nsecurity, put judges in positions they are not trained for, and take \naway from our military an obligation and right they have to defend us. \nThere is a place for judges. There is a place for the Congress. There \nis a place for the President. There is a place for those fighting this \nwar.\n  I have one simple goal. I want to put people in the lanes where they \ncan do the most good and the least harm. I do believe, if we turn this \nwar into a crime and if we take the Shaikh Mohammeds of the world and \nwe let civilian judges have a full-blown trial about how we found out \nthey were the mastermind of 9/11 and if you take away from the military \nwhat a military threat is and you give it to civilian judges, you are \ngoing to make this war much harder to prosecute, and it will come back \nto haunt us. It has never been done before for a reason. We never \nallowed the Nazis, who are on par with al-Qaida, the ability to go into \nour Federal courts and sue the people who were fighting them--our \ntroops. Because Justice Jackson in 1950 said: You would undermine the \ncommander. They would be fighting the enemy on two fronts: on the \nbattlefield and in the courts of the United States. It would undermine \nthe commander's credibility. It would lead to chaos. There is a reason \nthe Germans and the Japanese never went to Federal court. It would be, \nin my opinion, dangerous to give to al-Qaida more rights than we gave \nto the Nazis.\n  This is a great debate to have, but it needs to be based on some \nsound concepts. I don't think it is a sound concept to say that Rasul \ngave a constitutional right to noncitizen enemy combatants under our \nConstitution. I don't think it is a sound concept to say that the DC \nCircuit Court of Appeals 2\n\n[[Page S2868]]\n\nweeks ago missed that. They didn't miss it. That is not what this \ndebate is about. This debate is about whether 2241--something under our \ncontrol--whether we as a Congress want to give to enemy combatants the \nability to sue our own troops. There are over 160 lawsuits filed. It \nhas made a nightmare of Guantanamo Bay. They are suing our own troops \nfor medical malpractice, for DVD access, for better exercise. You name \nit, they have brought a lawsuit around it and it has clogged our courts \nand it has impeded the ability to run this jail.\n  Let me tell my colleagues, in a classified and unclassified manner, \nthe intelligence we have received from people housed at Guantanamo Bay \nhas helped this country defend itself. The last thing we should be \ndoing in an ongoing war is hampering our ability to defend ourselves \nbecause we are having two fronts--the military front and the legal \nfront--that confers a status on our enemy that will undermine the \nability of our military to defend us.\n\n  This is a statement from one of the lawyers who has filed one of \nthese 160 lawsuits:\n\n       The litigation is brutal for the United States. Boy, was he \n     right about that.\n\n  We are having to call people off the battlefield. We are having to \nbring people off the battlefield into the new battlefield--the \ncourtroom--to explain to some civilian judge why we think they are an \nenemy prisoner--enemy combatant that threatened the United States.\n\n       It is huge. We have over 100 lawyers now from big and small \n     firms working to represent these detainees. Every time an \n     attorney goes down there, it makes it that much harder for \n     the U.S. military to do what they are doing.\n\n  Boy, was that right.\n\n       You can't run an interrogation with attorneys.\n\n  You better believe that is right. We are interrogating to make sure \nwe find out what the enemy is up to the best we can so they don't kill \nus. Now, if you want to take the interrogation process at Guantanamo \nBay and put a bunch of lawyers in the middle of it, which we have never \ndone in any other war--we never gave to the Nazis--then you are \ncrippling the ability of this country to defend itself. It has nothing \nto do with fairness. You are creating a right never known in an armed \nconflict previously, and you will be criminalizing what I think is a \nwar in a dangerous way.\n  What are they going to do now that we are getting court orders to get \nmore lawyers down there? They are going to shut off the interrogation \nand the information is going to stop.\n  We have made mistakes at Guantanamo Bay. The Bush administration has \ntaken legal positions that I don't think have been sound, but I believe \nwe have finally got this right, and I am going to end now.\n  I think after a lot of give and take and after a lot of court \ndecisions, we are on the road to exactly where we need to be, and we \nhave it right. Here is what we have in place: a system that is Law of \nArmed Conflict compliant, Geneva Conventions compliant, that realizes \nthat fairness is part of being an American, but we are at war with \npeople who want to kill us, and if they could, they would go back to \nit, some of them. Some of them are war criminals. Some of them are \nwarriors who are assisting in the effort that had to be kept off the \nbattlefield until they are no longer a threat. The military is doing a \ndarn good job, and I stand by the men and women down there who are \ncarrying out this job at Guantanamo Bay. I stand with you. I am proud \nto be your advocate in this body. You are getting good intelligence, \nconsistent with lawful interrogation techniques. You are making \ndecisions about who an enemy prisoner is, who a threat is to this \ncountry, in a sound way. Keep it up. Your work product will be going to \ncourt, so be mindful that what you do will get reviewed, as it should. \nSome have been let go--about 100-and-something. Most, as far as I know, \nhave gone back and not been a threat. Every year, every person at \nGuantanamo Bay will get to have their case argued anew. They will get \nto make a case: I am not an enemy combatant. I am no longer a threat. I \nhave no intelligence value.\n  We do not want to misidentify someone. That has probably happened. \nThis is a confusing war. I am not here to say there has not been \nsomeone sent to Guantanamo Bay who was a mistake. That is true of jails \nin Missouri, and it is true of jails in South Carolina. But you can't \nsay there is no risk involved when you release somebody because I can \ntell my colleagues with certainty that 12 of the people we thought were \nno longer a threat, because we wanted to be fair and let them go, have \ngone back to try to kill Americans.\n  There is no perfect outcome. You try to create a system that models \nwho you are and is as fair as possible, recognizing you are at war. \nThese war crime tribunals and commissions are going on during the war. \nThe enemy combatant determinations are being made during the war. The \nreason we don't want to disclose how we found Shaikh Mohammed is \nbecause the war is going on, and we don't want to help people who are \nour enemies. So everybody caught and suspected by our military of being \nan enemy combatant involved in a global war on terror out of uniform \nsupporting al-Qaida, they are going to get to go to Federal court, but \nwe are going to let the military decide if they are a threat first, and \nthe judges of this country can look over the military's shoulder and \nsee if the military got it right in that case and if the procedures are \nfair. If you are convicted of a war crime at Guantanamo Bay, as Shaikh \nMohammed may be or someone like him, you are going to get your day in \nFederal court because it is an automatic right. Whatever procedures are \nused by our military, which is modeled after our own process to try our \nown people, will go through legal scrutiny, the procedures and the \noutcome.\n  So if you are worried as an American that we are putting people away \nforever without due process, don't worry about it. That is something to \nbe concerned about. If you are worried that your country has gotten \nsomebody in the global war on terror and we house them and nobody ever \ngets to look at the work product, don't worry about it. But if you are \nworried that the Congress is about to confer a right never known in any \nother war to al-Qaida that will undermine our security, you are right \nto worry. It is all about judges: What they should do and when they \nshould do it--and I respect judges. It is all about the military: What \nshould they do and when should they do it. God knows I respect them.\n  We have the right balance. The military fights, they kill our \nenemies, they capture our enemies, and once they are captured, they are \ngoing to be treated by this country under the Law of Armed Conflict, \nconsistent with our values and consistent with the Geneva Convention \nand consistent with the fact that we are at war. Everything they do \nwhen it comes to adjudicating these prisoners' status will be reviewed \nin our Federal courts after the military acts. Every person convicted \nwill have their day in court, and the courts can look and see if they \nwere treated fairly. That is what America should do. That is what we \nare doing.\n  Please understand this war is different, and we have to make \naccommodations in a variety of ways, but this is a war. This is not a \ncrime. These people we are rounding up throughout the globe wish to \nkill us all.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are not in morning business. We are \nconsidering S. 4.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, as I did a couple days last week, \nI continue with my discussion on the issues the Senate will face as the \nDemocratic leadership draws up its budget resolution, and that is going \nto be 2 days next week in the Budget Committee and then I think the \nweek after next, depending on what the\n\n[[Page S2869]]\n\nDemocratic leader decides to do, we generally will have a whole week of \ndebate on the budget and adoption of the budget.\n  We face an important milestone because the Democratic leadership \ncontrols the Senate for the first time since the 2002 election. Over \nthe past 4 years, there has been a lot of passionate debate over the \nfiscal policies the Republican leadership proposed and implemented over \nthe last 4 years. In November, the voters sent a Democratic majority to \nCongress. The budget debate we are about to enter provides Democrats \nwith their opportunity to chart a fiscal policy path for the Nation.\n  Before the budget arrives, I have taken to the floor to recap and \nevaluate some of the consistent themes we have heard from the \nDemocratic leadership over the past 4 years. Since the Finance \nCommittee has jurisdiction over nearly all of the revenue side of the \nbudget, I focused on the issues on that side of the ledger, the revenue \nside.\n  Since the position of the Democratic leadership has been to let the \nbipartisan tax relief plans of 2001 and 2003 expire, I talked about the \neffects of that automatic tax increase--yes, automatic tax increase--\nthat happens without even a vote of the Congress if we don't continue \nthis tax policy that was adopted in 2001 and 2003 beyond the year of \n2010.\n  It is a very important consideration. For the last 4 years, \nRepublican budgets on Capitol Hill have made it clear that our priority \nwas to ensure that virtually every American taxpayer would not see that \nautomatic tax increase come in their earnings of 2011, and that still \nis our policy. That is a policy reflected in the budget the President \nof the United States has sent to the Congress. So the year 2011 is the \nyear the bipartisan tax relief sunsets.\n  I emphasize that 2001 was the year of bipartisan tax relief. I had \nthe good fortune of working that year, 2001, with Senator Max Baucus \nhelping me get that bipartisan tax relief passed. He is now chairman of \nthe committee, being that the Democrats are in the majority. I have the \ngood fortune of maintaining a close working relationship with him.\n  The President's budget, as I already said, maintains the assurance \nthat these tax policies of the last 7 years will continue in place \nbeyond the year 2010. During the 4-year period 2003 to 2006, the \nDemocratic leadership was harshly critical of this policy which was \npassed in 2001 and 2003; that is, the Democratic leadership opposed the \nfiscal policies of preventing a tax increase on virtually every \nAmerican taxpayer automatically because Congress wouldn't even have to \nvote on it.\n  My first speech defined the tax increases built into that fiscal \npolicy. My second speech highlighted some of the macroeconomic risks of \nthat widespread automatic tax increase. Last week, I remarked to the \nSenate and discussed with the Senate potential omissions in the \nDemocratic leadership's budget; that is, the discussion was about \nfiscal policy that was present in prior budgets. If the Democratic \nleadership's past criticisms of those budgets were carried out, the \nfiscal policy of continuing tax relief would end. This week, I am going \nto focus on the track record of the Democratic leadership and discuss \npotential problems from proposals that might be contained in that \nbudget. You could say, from our standpoint, I am examining errors of \ncommission this week, whereas last week I examined errors of omission.\n\n  Today, I wish to refer to the use of revenue-raising offsets in the \nbudget context. As any budgeteer can tell you, the budget resolution is \nnot a law. It doesn't amend the Internal Revenue Code or Medicare law \nor appropriations. The budget resolution is like a blueprint for a \nbuilding. The actual construction of tax and spending policies will \noccur later on this year.\n  The budget resolution is, however, critical to actual tax, actual \nspending, and actual deficit decisions the Congress will undertake. The \nmatter of offsets is critical in this respect: If additional spending \nis proposed in the resolution without real offsets, then deficits are \nmore likely. Likewise, if popular tax relief is proposed but not offset \nwith real proposals, then deficits could appear and be larger--though, \non this last point, the track record of the last 4 years shows tax \nrelief grew the economy and record levels of Federal revenue came into \nthe Treasury as a direct result.\n  My basic point is that if a proposed offset is not realistic and the \nproponents succeed, budget discipline could be undermined. In other \nwords, phony offsets, if incorporated into the budget, can lead to \ndeficits.\n  Today, I am just going to follow the numbers. Just follow the \nnumbers. I am not going to make any judgments or make any assumptions \nabout the revenue-raising proposals. I am going to analyze these \nproposals strictly from a fiscal standpoint.\n  I analyze two categories of offsets from the standpoint of whether \nthe budget arithmetic adds up, and I am going to examine last year's \nrecord of the Democratic leadership on offsets but look at it as if \nthey were in control at the time. It is not a pretty picture.\n  I am going to take a look at proposed offsets from a series of \namendments, real amendments that were debated here on the floor of the \nSenate during last year's budget resolution debate. During that debate, \nvirtually all Democratic members had a common theme in their purported \noffsets for their amendments to this resolution. That purported theme \nwas that they would close tax loopholes to pay for whatever popular \nspending program they wanted to propose. Closing corporate tax \nloopholes was the common refrain to pay for spending.\n  I will list the amendments and the popular spending proposals:\n\n       Senator Kennedy, Vocational Education and Pell Grants;\n       Senator Akaka, Veterans Medical Services;\n       Senator Murray, Community Block Grants;\n       Senator Stabenow, Emergency Responders;\n       Senator Menendez, Port Security;\n       Senator Byrd, Amtrak;\n       Senator Reed of Rhode Island, LIHEAP;\n       Senator Sarbanes, Corps of Engineers and other Federal \n     services;\n       Senator Dorgan, Native American programs;\n       Senator Stabenow, Veterans' Health Care;\n       Senator Akaka, Title I Education Grants; and\n       Senator Lincoln, Agriculture.\n\n  These are all here, and more than what I gave are here.\n  Mr. President, at this point I ask unanimous consent that a list of \nthese amendments by vote and by amendment number, so that they are \nthere for people who aren't listening to what I am saying to consider, \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Paid for by Closing Tax Loopholes\n\n       Vote #39 Kennedy Amendment, No.3028 Vocational Education \n     and Pell Grants; Vote #41 Akaka Amendment, No. 3007 Veterans \n     Medical Services; Vote #43 Murray Amendment, No. 3063 \n     Community Block Grants; Vote #45 Stabenow Amendment, No. 3056 \n     Emergency Responders; Vote #47 Menendez Amendment, No. 3054 \n     Port Security; Vote #51 Byrd Amendment, No. 3086 Amtrak; Vote \n     #57 Reed Amendment, No.3074 LI-HEAP; Vote #60 Sarbanes \n     Amendment, No. 3103 Corps of Engineers and Other Federal \n     Services; Vote #61 Dorgan Amendment, No. 3102 Native American \n     Programs; Vote #63 Stabenow Amendment, No. 3141 Veterans \n     Health Care; Vote #64 Akaka Amendment, No. 3071 Title I \n     Education Grants; Vote #66 Lincoln Amendment, No. 3106 \n     Agriculture.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as you can see, the proposed spending is \npopular and has a nice political edge. Democrats could record \nthemselves as voting for the amendment, and they could criticize \nRepublicans for voting against those amendments. From a political \ncalculation perspective, these were profitable efforts on the part of \nthe Democratic leadership. The fiscal consequences, however, were \nanother story.\n  If Democrats had been in the majority, as they are now, the fiscal \neffect of these amendments would have been a very big problem, and here \nis why. One-time spending increases, even if for 1 year, are built into \nthe CBO baseline, and they are built in forever. This is explicitly the \ncase for increases in discretionary spending. It is also implicitly the \ncase with entitlement spending. If anyone disputes that point, I would \nask them to show me the last time we reversed new entitlement spending. \nIt just never happens around here is the best thing to say.\n  Let's take a look at the Kennedy amendment on vocational education \nand Pell grants to which I have referred. The amendment was purported\n\n[[Page S2870]]\n\nto be $6.3 billion, but that was for 1 fiscal year. That $6.3 billion, \nif adopted, would probably be extended in later years. It is in the \nbaseline. So Senator Kennedy found his offset by closing $6.3 billion \nin what he referred to as corporate tax loopholes. I am not going to \nfind fault with closing those tax loopholes. I have been involved in \nthings like that for a long period of time, and successfully so. The \nfiscal and political effect, though, of Senator Kennedy's amendment was \nto identify specific popular spending and offset it with a nondefined \ntax increase. From a realistic standpoint, Senator Kennedy's amendment \nidentified less than 10 percent of the gross spending burden it would \nhave placed on future budgets to the extent the unspecified revenue \noffset was duplicative or not realistic. The real effect was that the \n$6.3 billion additional spending would have been added to the budget \nfor that fiscal year.\n  All 12 of these listed amendments used the same undefined offset.\n  Several Members referred to revenue raisers in a Democratic \nsubstitute amendment to the 2005 Tax Relief Reconciliation bill, and \nthey kept trying to spend the same money over and over again. Let's \ntake a look at the list of revenue raisers in the substitute amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a Joint Committee on \nTaxation estimate of the revenue offsets to the 2005 substitute be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Inventory of Specified Democrat Revenue Offsets\n\n                       [In billions over 5 years]\n\nGross Revenue Available from Democratic Substitute                $53.6\nLess Enacted Offsets                                               -9.3\nLess Small Business Tax Relief Bill Offsets                        -8.7\nNet Available Democratic Offsets                                   35.6\nSource: Joint Committee on Taxation\n\n       Recap of Democratic Revenue Raisers and Spending Proposals\n\n                       [In billions over 5 years]\n\nNet Available Democratic Revenue Offsets                          $35.6\nLess Cost of Democratic Spending Amendments                      -105.2\nNet Cost of Democratic Spending Amendments                        -69.6\nSource: Joint Committee on Taxation\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That substitute amendment is an overinclusive inventory \nof offsets. I say ``overinclusive'' because it included the universe of \nrevenue raisers that the Democratic caucus supported. Republicans \nsupported many, but not all, of these offsets.\n  Joint Tax scored these revenue raisers during last year's budget \ndebate. According to the Joint Tax experts, that universe of Senate \noffsets raised $53.6 billion over 5 years. That is this chart right \nhere: $53.6 billion. At that time, I noted that the budget resolution \nassumed several billion in revenue raisers to cover part of the \nreconciliation bill. Indeed, in the reconciliation conference, we used \neight of these revenue raisers. They accounted for about $9 billion--\nand I should say only $9 billion over 5 years. I had hoped to use \nadditional raisers accounting for about $7.5 billion over 5 years, but \nthe House rejected that, and we then found some offsets someplace else. \nSo we will take a look at them.\n  If you account for the revenue offsets left over, you can subtract \nout another 10 revenue-raising proposals that are in the Senate's small \nbusiness minimum wage bill. Those revenue raisers--and those are things \nwhich had just been before the Senate--those revenue raisers included \n$8.7 billion over 5 years. That is this figure here.\n  Of the raisers in the 2005 substitute amendment, about $18 billion of \nthose were enacted or are in play in discussions between the House and \nthe Senate. So if we review the Senate Democratic inventory of \nidentified as well as scored revenue raisers and net out current law \nand Senate-passed tax legislation, we find 18 revenue proposals \navailable. These are proposals the Democratic caucus has advocated that \nare left over. They raise approximately $36 billion over 5 years.\n  Everyone should know there are revenue raisers in that total I just \nrecited that the administration doesn't support. You don't have to let \nthat detract you from it, but those would be issues which would be \nsubject to, I suppose, a Presidential veto.\n  Let's forget that for the moment. There are many in this total that \nthe House and Senate Republicans don't support. As we have found in the \nsmall business tax relief discussions, House Democrats aren't keen on \nsome of these proposals either. Nevertheless, to bend over backward and \nto be fair to the Senate Democratic leadership, I am going to tally the \nproposals they have supported as a caucus.\n  Let me repeat the total corporate loophole closers and other offsets \nDemocrats have defined. It is $36 billion over 5 years. Put another \nway, I would like to say it is only $36 billion over 5 years, but I \nwant you to see what they want to use that $36 billion for--presumably \nto cover a lot of other expenditures they can't do because the numbers \ndon't allow it. That total of $36 billion, then, provides a ceiling of \noffsets to compare to the spending amendments.\n  Let's go back and match the spending amendments with the universe of \nDemocratic revenue raisers. The revenue raised is a far cry from the \ncumulative demand of the amendments that were filed. The amendments \nthat have been filed that propose to use those tax loophole closers as \noffsets total $105 billion in new spending. So the Senate Democrats \npropose $36 billion in revenue raisers that were supposed to offset \n$105 billion in new spending, but it doesn't add up. That means the \nspending exceeded revenue raisers by $69 billion.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of the Democratic \namendments to the fiscal year 2007 budget resolution be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S2871]]\n\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS08MR07.001\n\n\n[[Page S2872]]\n\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS08MR07.002\n\n\n[[Page S2873]]\n\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS08MR07.003\n\n\n[[Page S2874]]\n\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this list was prepared by analysts and \nwas based upon filed amendments printed in the Congressional Record. I \nthink it is interesting that only one filed amendment on this list \nwould decrease taxes over 5 years, and only one amendment would result \nin decreased spending over 5 years. The amendment decreasing spending \nwas filed by New York's junior Senator and would reduce spending by $1 \nmillion. That is one-thousandth of a billion dollars.\n  Put another way, if you subtract the $36 billion from the $105 \nbillion in new spending proposed, it means the other side's amendments \nwere short $69 billion--short $69 billion. Right here. This figure. \nThis money proposed for offsets, add up all of the amendments put \nbefore the Senate, and you come out short. Revenue neutrality? No. \nBudget neutrality? No.\n  Now, that $69 billion needs to come from someplace. If the other side \nhad prevailed, it would have wiped out the tax relief of last year's \nbudget, including what we do to keep more Americans from paying that \nhorrible tax, the alternative minimum tax. You can't have it both ways. \nEither the other side, if they had prevailed, would have added $69 \nbillion in deficit spending or they would have gutted the tax relief \nthey claim to support.\n  Budgets are about choices. In this case the choices are clear. If the \nDemocratic leadership would have controlled the Senate last year, we \nwould have no tax relief in that budget or we would have added $69 \nbillion in deficit spending. Neither choice would be the right choice \nfrom the standpoint of the American people.\n\n  Defining offsets is very important. It is very important because we \nneed real numbers if we are going to have intellectually honest \nbudgeting. My analysis of corporate loophole closers and other revenue-\nraising proposals shows the Democratic caucus has supported at most $36 \nbillion in specific revenue-raising proposals. By the way, that is \nabout the revenue loss for last year's AMT patch. So the alternative \nminimum tax would have hit another 7 or 8 million Americans.\n  Using unspecified revenue-raising proposals is not realistic. If \nDemocrats intend to live by pay-go, short for ``pay as you go,'' the \nFinance Committee will need those revenue-raising proposals to handle a \nportion--and just a portion--of the demand of the tax system.\n  There are two other categories of revenue-raising proposals \nidentified by the Democratic leadership. One is repealing tax relief \nfor higher income taxpayers. The other is reducing or closing the tax \ngap. I will talk about the tax gap in a later speech.\n  When folks in the Democratic leadership talk about raising taxes on \nhigher income taxpayers, it sounds as if all fiscal problems can be \nsolved as long as you want to look down the road. Liberal think tanks \nand sympathetic voices in the east coast media tend to echo that \nsentiment. As a matter of intellectual honesty in budget debates, we \nought to have an idea of how much revenue is there. Since the most \npopular proposal is to repeal the bipartisan tax relief for higher \nincome taxpayers, I have asked the Joint Tax Committee to provide \nupdated estimates of those proposals--such as the corporate loophole \ncloser. I do not expect the revenue would cover the spending demands. I \nwas pleased to see the Budget Committee chairman make a public comment \nlast week that seemed to address these proposals. According to the \nMarch 1, 2007 edition of Congress Daily AM, the chairman indicated he \nintended to put forward a budget with ``no tax rate increases.'' I will \nhave to see the budget resolution and hear the chairman's explanation, \nbut I read that comment to mean the Democratic leadership will not, at \na minimum, propose to roll back current law tax rates.\n  This would be especially interesting in light of the so-called \nmillionaire's tax amendment put forward in the past by members of the \nchairman's party. The millionaire's tax amendment filed for the fiscal \nyear 2007 budget would have increased taxes by about $105 billion. Of \ncourse, those same amendments spent that money, so deficit reduction \nwould not have been received.\n  Today I have examined the question of revenue-raising offsets. The \ninventory of available, defined, specific revenue-raising offsets is \nrelatively small. Last year, Democratic amendments overspent the \navailable revenue offsets by $69 billion. The Democratic leadership has \nindicated a desire to apply pay-go, pay as you go, to the current law \ntax relief. If pay-go is to be observed with respect to the alternative \nminimum tax and other popular expiring tax relief provisions, the \nDemocratic leadership will need those revenue raisers and even more to \noffset the revenue lost from these time-sensitive provisions.\n  When we start to examine and debate the budget resolution, we will \nneed to use intellectually honest numbers. Using the undefined \ncorporate loophole closer is fiscally dangerous. It enables even more \nspending at a time when Government is at record levels as far as real \ndollars. Runaway spending is at the root of our current or future \nfiscal problems. Using phony revenue-raising offsets sets up two \nnegative fiscal outcomes, an undefined tax increase and/or deficit \nspending.\n  All Members, whether Republican or Democrat, ought to agree to be \ntransparent with all these numbers and all these figures in the \namendments that are posed in the upcoming budget debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nIdaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nproceed for 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Idaho is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Craig relating to the introduction of S. 815 are \nprinted in today's Record under ``Introduced Bills and Joint \nResolutions.'')\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I rise today to support the Improving \nAmerica Security Act of 2007, the legislation in front of us. It will \nput us on a path of more security for the future by implementing the \nunfinished recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. I commend all of \nthose involved in this important effort.\n  As I came to speak on the floor in support of the legislation we have \nbeen working on for the last couple of weeks, I find myself needing to \nexpress great concern about the place in which we find ourselves at \nthis point--unable to move forward with the final bill and the relevant \n9/11 Commission amendments that have been offered because of an effort \nby the Senate Republican leader to offer a wide-ranging number of \nunrelated amendments to this bill. So we find ourselves now stopped and \nwaiting to figure out a way to resolve this effort.\n  The families who lost loved ones 5\\1/2\\ years ago have been waiting \nfor the Congress to act. The 9/11 Commission report was released. After \nit was released, I assumed we would immediately take that document and \nbegin to move forward aggressively because we all want safety for our \nfamilies. We all live in America, and we are all concerned about \nvulnerabilities and risks and what we need to be able to do to keep our \nfamilies safe and the country safe.\n  Unfortunately, things did not move under the former Congresses. We \nnow find ourselves in a situation where, again, we are stalled because \nof a set of unrelated issues that have come up. I wish to share for the \nRecord the deep concern of family members who lost loved ones on 9/11 \nand who have written a letter to the distinguished Republican leader of \nthe Senate. I think it expresses their grave concern about where we are \nright now. They are calling on us to move forward and act.\n  This reads:\n       Dear Senator McConnell: As family members who lost loved \n     ones on 9/11, we support full implementation of the 9/11 \n     Commission recommendations. We are writing out of grave \n     concern that your recent introduction of highly provocative, \n     irrelevant amendments will jeopardize the passage of S. 4. It\n\n[[Page S2875]]\n\n     is inconceivable that anyone in good conscience would \n     consider hindering implementation of the 9/11 Commission \n     recommendations, delaying much-needed homeland security \n     improvements. We strongly disagree with these divisive \n     procedural tactics.\n       Just as the Iraq war deserves separate debate, so do each \n     of the amendments you offered. S. 4 should be a clean bill \n     and debate should conclude this week with a straight up and \n     down vote. Each day that passes without implementation of the \n     remaining 9/11 Commission recommendations, the safety and \n     security of our nation is at risk.\n       Tactics such as those you are contemplating, which endanger \n     the 9/11 bill, send a signal to America that your priority is \n     partisan politics, not protecting America against terrorism. \n     Both parties must work together to pass this critical \n     legislation.\n       We, the undersigned, understand all too well the risk of \n     failure to secure our nation.\n           Respectfully,\n     Carol Ashley,\n       Mother of Janice, 25, Member, Voices of September 11th.\n     Mary Fetchet,\n       Mother of Brad, 24, Founding Director and President, Voices \n     of September 11th.\n     Beverly Eckert,\n       Widow of Sean Rooney, 50, Member, Families of September 11.\n     Carie Lemack,\n       Daughter of Judy Larocque, 50, Co-founder and President, \n     Families of September 11.\n\n  We know the job that needs to get done. I commend our Senate majority \nleader for making the wise determination, out of respect for these \nfamilies, not to proceed with amendments relating to Iraq, which we all \ncare deeply about. We want to have that debate on the policies and \nsupport for our troops and future direction as it relates to Iraq.\n  But the distinguished majority leader made the determination not to \nproceed on this bill because the families, the communities, and the \ncountry have waited too long for it to pass. So I think it is very \nunfortunate that we have had to get to this point, but it is very \nimportant that we pass a bill of tremendous significance.\n  I commend Chairman Lieberman and all of the members of the committee \nfor their leadership. I commend particularly Senator Lieberman for his \nconviction to bring these issues to the Senate and for hanging in there \nand trying to get this done. The 9/11 Commission did a great service to \nour country by asking tough questions about the 9/11 attacks and then \nmaking recommendations to keep us safe in the future. The 9/11 \nCommission not only gave a detailed explanation of how the attacks \nhappened but also gave Congress and the administration detailed \nrecommendations in how to fix our vulnerabilities and prevent future \nattacks. For that, we are grateful for their service.\n  In December 2005, a group led by former members of the 9/11 \nCommission released a report card that overwhelmingly gave the \nadministration and Congress failing grades for their poor \nimplementation of the 9/11 Commission recommendations. This legislation \nis intended to change those failing grades to passing grades and to \nmake us more secure.\n  The members of the commission gave the Government a D for improving \nchecked bag and cargo screening. This bill requires all cargo and \npassenger aircraft to be screened and dedicates funding for the \nscreening of checked baggage.\n  The Government also received Ds for creating incentives for \ninformation sharing and increasing Government-wide information sharing. \nThis legislation makes several changes to information and intelligence \nsharing urged by the Commission. The bill establishes incentives for \nGovernment-wide information sharing and makes permanent the information \nsharing environment program, which will expire next month. The bill \nalso creates the Interagency Threat Assessment and Coordination Group, \nwhich will facilitate the production and dissemination of Federal \nintelligence products to other Federal agencies and to State, local, \nand tribal governments.\n  The former Commissioners gave the Government another D for the lack \nof progress on intelligence oversight reform. However, the days of \nCongress giving President Bush a free pass are over, and this \nlegislation increases Congress's oversight of the intelligence \ncommunity and gives the intelligence community greater freedom to \nsubmit information to Congress, without approval by an executive branch \nofficer.\n  One appalling lack of progress has been in the area of first \nresponder communications interoperability. The 9/11 Commissioners gave \nthe Government an F for failing to provide an adequate radio spectrum \nfor first responders. This lack of progress is appalling to me because \nof the shortcomings the Commission identified in this area.\n  The 9/11 Commission report outlined the numerous communications \nproblems first responders have had as they have tried to save lives. \nThe report detailed the problem the police officers and firefighters in \nNew York faced because they were on different radio systems. Over 50 \ndifferent public safety organizations from Maryland, Virginia, and the \nDistrict of Columbia reported to the Pentagon to help, but they could \nnot talk to each other.\n  The 9/11 Commission concluded that:\n\n       The inability to communicate was a critical element at the \n     World Trade Center, Pentagon, and Somerset County, \n     Pennsylvania, crash site where multiple agencies and multiple \n     jurisdictions responded. The occurrence of this problem at 3 \n     very different sites is strong evidence that compatible and \n     adequate communications among public safety organizations at \n     the local, State, and Federal levels remains an important \n     problem.\n\n  The 9/11 Commission published its final report in July 2004, but the \nmen and women in the first responder community knew of the \ncommunications difficulties before 9/11.\n  Not long after 9/11, I traveled around Michigan and held a number of \ndifferent townhall meetings. Over and over again, I heard the same \nthing from our police officers and firefighters, our emergency \nresponders. In the 5 years since the September 11 attacks, one of the \ntop requests for support I receive every year from the communities in \nMichigan is for interoperable communications equipment. Nearly every \ntime I meet with police and firefighters and emergency medical \npersonnel, they bring up this issue.\n  The 9/11 Commission is not alone in the assessment of this problem. \nIn June of 2004, a U.S. Conference of Mayors survey found that 94 \npercent of cities didn't have interoperable capabilities between police \nand firefighters and emergency workers; 60 percent of cities didn't \nhave interoperable capability with the State emergency operation center \nin their State.\n  It has been over 5 years and we now are seeing this come forward in \nthis important bill. I commend everybody involved in this legislation \nfor putting in the first grant program for interoperability. This is a \nprogram that would be dedicated to improving communications between our \nfirst responders and would authorize $3.3 billion over the next 5 years \nto begin to get this right.\n  Our committee that has brought this forward has done an excellent job \nof presenting a package for us of which we can all be proud. It is a \nbipartisan effort. I hope we are going to see us move beyond this \nstalemate able to get the job done. The people of my State, and each of \nour States, are counting on us, and certainly the families who have \nsuffered such a grave loss in the attacks on our country are counting \non us to focus on the job in front of us and get it done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Sanders pertaining to the introduction of S. 818 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 313\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I have an amendment pending, as my \ncolleagues know, that I cannot get a vote on. I don't know whether the \nother side will relent and give us a vote on the amendment. I offered \nit a week ago today. The amendment deals with the issue of al-Qaida. \nThis bill is about\n\n[[Page S2876]]\n\nthe recommendations by the 9/11 Commission. It has been, I am told, \n2,002 days since 9/1/2001. I was sitting in the Capitol that morning at \na Democratic leadership meeting on that side of the Capitol with \nwindows that looked out to the east.\n  We saw first on the television set the airplanes that attacked the \nWorld Trade Center. We saw the second plane fly into the second \nbuilding of the World Trade Center. We then saw black smoke rising from \nthe Pentagon that morning. Then this building was evacuated.\n  That has been a long while ago. Yet it seems like only yesterday. We \nlooked up into the real bright blue sky that morning and saw F-16 \nfighter jets flying air cover over this Nation's capital.\n  We discovered later, because they boasted about it, that it was al-\nQaida--Osama bin Laden, al-Zawahiri--who attacked this country and \nmurdered several thousand of America's citizens. They boasted about it. \nThey sent us videotapes, audiotapes telling us they were the ones who \nattacked our country.\n  Well, it is not 9/1/2001 today. It is a couple of thousand days \nlater. Those who boasted they attacked this country are now living in \nPakistan. That does not come from me, that comes from the top terrorist \nofficial in our country. In fact, both of the top intelligence chiefs \nin our country in the last 2 months have said the following, and I will \nquote them:\n\n       Al Qaeda is the terrorist organization that poses the \n     greatest threat to U.S. interests, including to the Homeland.\n\n  Think of that. Nearly 6 years after we were attacked by al-Qaida, we \nare told: The greatest threat to our country--and this is from open \ntestimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence by Mr. \nNegroponte, the top intelligence head in this country--is al-Qaida.\n  Here is what he said--this was repeated a couple of weeks ago by his \nsuccessor:\n  Al-Qaida leaders ``continue to plot attacks against our homeland and \nother targets with the objective of inflicting mass casualties. And \nthey continue to maintain active connections and relationships that \nradiate outward from their leaders' secure hideout in Pakistan . . . ''\n  It has been 2,002 days. Those who killed thousands of Americans, \nthose who are now the greatest terrorist threat to our country are \nliving in a secure hideout in Pakistan. I would like to understand what \nis a higher priority for this country than to eliminate the leadership \nof al-Qaida, if, in fact, they represent the gravest terrorist danger \nto America. What is a higher priority?\n  I offer this amendment with my colleague, Senator Conrad. Incidently, \nwe offered and passed an amendment on this subject last fall that got \ndropped in conference.\n  This amendment that is fairly simple. It asks the administration, the \nDirector of National Intelligence, and the Secretary of Defense to give \nCongress, every 6 months, a classified report telling us three things. \nFirst, whether the al-Qaida leadership is still in a secure hideout in \nPakistan and, if not, where are they?\n  Second, tell us where they are, based on your knowledge. \nIncidentally, as I said, we have had testimony twice now from the top \nintelligence official in the Government that they are in a secure \nhideout in Pakistan. Second, whether the countries in which they reside \nare cooperating with us in our attempt to eliminate the al-Qaida \nleadership.\n  Third, our report will require the head of our intelligence and the \nhead of the Department of Defense to tell us what additional resources \nthey need, if they need additional resources, to capture Mr. bin Laden, \nMr. Zawahiri, and al-Qaida's leadership.\n  We are having an aggressive debate in this country about Iraq. We \nshould. It is an unbelievably difficult situation. In the shadow of 9/\n11, in the shadow of the terrorist threat that emerged immediately from \n9/11, we were told by our intelligence community, by the \nadministration, in top secret briefings, that Iraq posed imminent \ndanger to this country and possessed weapons of mass destruction.\n  It turns out the intelligence was not accurate.\n  There are many reasons for that, some very troubling. But it turns \nout the intelligence was wrong. Nonetheless, the President committed \ntroops to battle, and we are in Iraq and have been in that war in Iraq \nlonger than for the Second World War. It is a lengthy period. It has \nlasted longer than the Second World War.\n  In fact, the National Intelligence Estimate was just released a \ncouple months ago. A portion has been declassified. It says that most \nof what is happening in Iraq is sectarian violence. Yes, there are some \nal-Qaida in Anbar Province, but the bulk of what is happening in Iraq \nis sectarian violence. Translated, it means there is a civil war going \non in Iraq.\n  That does not surprise anybody. Watch the evening news. Read the \nnewspapers. We understand and see the evidence of this civil war. The \nquestion now for our country is, what do we make of a circumstance \nwhere we now find ourselves having substantial numbers of American \nsoldiers in the middle of a civil war in Iraq? How do we respond to \nthat? And how do we deal with that?\n  President Bush, some months ago, presented false choices to our \ncountry. He said the issue is just stay the course or cut and run. He \nsaid: I am for staying the course and they are for cutting and \nrunning--a completely false choice, and he knew it. Later, he said he \nnever said ``stay the course,'' but, in fact, he did many times.\n  But it was never the proper choice, stay the course or cut and run. \nThe question is, What is a smart choice for our country? What \nrepresents our best interests, the best interests of our troops, the \nbest interests of our own national interest with respect to the country \nof Iraq?\n  We are going to leave Iraq. That is not in question. The question is, \nwhen and how. The American people are not going to have American \nsoldiers in the middle of civil strife in Iraq for 6 months, 6 years, \n16 years. We are leaving Iraq. The question is, how and when, and that \nis a worthy debate to have. We have soldiers risking their lives.\n  Our country has asked soldiers to risk their lives for deployments--\nmany of them multiple deployments. Yet the country has not gone to war \nwith those soldiers. We send soldiers to Iraq to fight, and we are \ntold: Go shopping. Soldiers go to war; we go to the mall. This country \nhas not asked to be--excuse me, I should say it differently. No one has \nasked this country to be engaged in this war. We are told: Do you know \nwhat? In this war we should have tax cuts.\n  In fact, we have already spent somewhere close to $500 billion on the \nwar--none of it paid for. We send soldiers to war and then are not \nwilling to pay the costs. The cost in lives and treasure for this \ncountry is substantial. The question that we are coming to grips with \nin this Chamber, finally, at long last, is, what do we make of all of \nthis? What kind of strategy do we develop? How do we approach this in a \nway that begins to decide what makes the best sense for this country's \nnational interest?\n  We have had many discussions about that. I think we have arrived at \nsome points in that discussion that will make a great deal of sense for \nthis country. But even as we discuss Iraq, which is not the central \nfront in the war on terrorism, we have people coming to the Congress \nand testifying before our committees and telling us the greatest threat \nto our country--the greatest threat to our country--is al-Qaida. Then \nwe go home, as we talk about Iraq in the Senate, and we turn on the \ntelevision set and see that al-Qaida is reconstituting training camps \nin Pakistan, and we see that al-Qaida is ramping up an opportunity with \nthe Taliban to begin operations in Afghanistan to threaten the \nGovernment of Afghanistan.\n  So what do we make of all of that? Well, there is a giant yawn, it \nseems to me--just a giant yawn. Nobody cares. Nobody says much about \nal-Qaida. If this is the greatest terrorist threat to our country, why \nis it not No. 1 on this country's agenda--eliminating the leadership of \nal-Qaida?\n  The President says:\n\n       I don't know where bin Laden is. I have no idea and really \n     don't care. It's not that important. It's not our priority.\n\n  ``I am truly not that concerned about him,'' the President says.\n  His intelligence chief comes to us and says, ``Al-Qaeda is the \nterrorist organization that poses the greatest\n\n[[Page S2877]]\n\nthreat to U.S. interests. . . .,'' and we are not concerned about Osama \nbin Laden, the man who boasted about murdering thousands of American \ncitizens?\n  Then we read this in the morning papers:\n\n       Senior leaders of Al Qaeda operating from Pakistan have re-\n     established significant control over their once-battered \n     worldwide terror network and over the past year have set up a \n     band of training camps in the tribal regions near the Afghan \n     border, according to American intelligence and \n     counterterrorism officials.\n       American officials said there was mounting evidence that \n     Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, had been \n     steadily building an operations hub in the mountainous \n     Pakistani tribal area of North Waziristan.\n\n  How many warnings do we need? How often do we have to be told? Who \nhas to tell us before we understand what are priorities are?\n  I have offered, with my colleague, Senator Conrad, a simple amendment \nsaying: Let's keep our eye on the ball. Every 6 months we should \nreceive a classified report to say what is being done about this, where \nis the leadership of al-Qaida. Are they still in a secure hideout or \nhideaway in Pakistan? If so, are the leaders of this country helping us \nto try to eliminate that leadership? What kind of resources are \nnecessary?\n  The President said some long while ago the issue with respect to \nterrorism is not just the terrorists but also those who harbor them. If \nthe leadership of al-Qaida is in northern Pakistan, are they being \nharbored by the Government of Pakistan? Oh, I know, I am worried about \nPresident Musharraf. Sure. We all are. But is the Government of \nPakistan--reportedly a government that has just made some sort of \ncommitment with the Taliban, sort of a nonaggression pact with the \nTaliban, a Taliban that is likely protecting and hiding the leadership \nof al-Qaida--is that in our national interest? I don't think so.\n  So I offer an amendment, a simple, tiny, little amendment that says: \nLet's keep our eye on the ball. If this is the greatest threat to our \ncountry, why is it not ranked No. 1? Why is it relegated to an ``I \ndon't care; I don't know where he is or they are; it does not matter''?\n\n  How about deciding this is a priority.\n  Why are we not able to get a vote on this amendment? Why, after a \nweek, are we not able to get a vote? Why would someone vote against \nthis amendment? Why would someone oppose an attempt by our country to \ndecide this is a priority? Why don't we have a vote and see if there \nare those who are opposed? I don't know. It is very frustrating. We \nbring a bill to the floor of the Senate dealing with 9/11.\n  Madam President, 9/11 was very simple and tragic; 9/11 was the day \nthat a terrorist organization named al-Qaida hijacked airplanes, used \nthose airplanes, full of fuel, as guided missiles, low-tech weaponry, \nto murder thousands of Americans.\n  We know who did it. They claimed they did it. They boasted about it. \nNow we are told by the top intelligence chief in our country we know \nwhere they are. And 2,002 days later, they are still there. By the way, \nwe still receive messages from them from time to time. They send an \naudio tape or a video tape to Al Jazeera, and they speak to us. So they \nexist. Our intelligence chief says we know they exist and where they \nare.\n  The question is, why is this country not doing what it is required to \ndo to deal with the highest and most significant terrorist threat that \nexists to the United States? I do not understand it.\n  So the question will be, I guess, in the coming hours, who is \nblocking this amendment? Why are they blocking this amendment? Why on \nEarth would anyone oppose such an amendment? Is the U.S. Congress \nwilling to debate these issues, make decisions on these issues? I \nthought it was the great deliberative body in our country. You come to \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate and exchange views, and you have a debate, \na competition of ideas, and you select the best from each rather than \nthe worst of both. That is what I thought this was about. I am \nenormously proud to be here. This is a great place. But it is \nenormously frustrating to spend a week on an amendment such as this and \nthen discover that there are people who will decide you cannot have a \nvote on an amendment. Why? Because they are worried it might make \nsomebody look bad.\n  This amendment is not about making anybody look bad. It is about \nturning this country to aim at the greatest terrorist threat that is \ndescribed by our top intelligence chief and deciding to do something \nabout it.\n  I come to the floor a third time now talking about this in the \ncontext of the other issues of Iraq and other matters we will discuss, \nincluding trying to pass the 9/11 bill. I do so recognizing a lot of \npeople have a lot of ideas around here--some good, some bad. We vote on \nmany of them. This is an idea we ought to vote on, and we ought to do \nit soon.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, let me inquire of the Senator from \nMaine. The ranking member is here, but the manager of the bill is not \nhere. She has heard my presentation, I guess, three times now and \nperhaps is long tired of it. But let me ask if there is an opportunity \nfor me to propound a unanimous consent request to get a vote on this \namendment. I know I visited with the Senator from Connecticut and with \nthe Senator from Maine yesterday and, I think, the day before about \nthis amendment.\n  Could I get some expression from the ranking member of the thinking \nof the chairman and the ranking member about getting a vote on this \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, although it appears nothing has been \nhappening today, in fact, there have been extensive negotiations going \non behind the scenes with a list of amendments from our side and from \nthe Senator's side. I know for a fact the Senator's amendment is on \nthat list and is part of the discussions that are underway.\n  But the system of trying to clear these amendments is a very time-\nconsuming one. There are Senators on the Democratic side who have \nobjected to clearing the list and there are Senators on my side of the \naisle who have objected to clearing the list.\n  But I can tell the Senator I personally did ask for the Senator's \namendment, as did the manager of the bill, to be added to the list for \nthose where we would try to either clear them through unanimous consent \nor we would try to get a rollcall vote. I personally have no objection \nto having a rollcall vote on the Senator's amendment or accepting the \nSenator's amendment, but we have not yet completed the clearance \nprocess. The reason I have remained on the floor is in the hope that \nclearance will occur. But I will tell the Senator there are problems \nclearing the joint list on both sides of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, my understanding is my amendment is not \non the list from the minority side. I do not know whether that is true \nor not, but I am told it is not on the list. If it is on the list, I am \nenormously heartened. As always, my colleague from Maine is very \ncordial, and I have always enjoyed working with her.\n  My only inquiry is to try to find a way, after a week, to be on the \nlist so we can move this amendment. I would say to my colleague--and I \nknow she would agree with this--it is often the case, as they say, \nwhere appearances are deceiving. That is not necessarily the case in \nthe Senate. When it looks as if we are not doing much, in most cases we \nare not doing much.\n  I remain hopeful that behind the scenes we will get a list in which \nwe will be able to clear a number of amendments. At the end of that, I \nwill be the first to come to the floor to congratulate the chairman and \nthe ranking member, who have exhibited enormous patience. I have \ncomplained about coming here now for a week, I guess three times. They \nhave been sitting on the floor all week. So they show even greater \npatience with respect to the bill itself. My impatience is about my \namendment.\n\n  My hope will be that as lists are exchanged, I will find the name of \nthis\n\n[[Page S2878]]\n\namendment on the list and that it will be cleared at some point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, first I thank my friend from North \nDakota for his empathy for what the Senator from Maine and I are going \nthrough. There is a particular syndrome here that probably \npsychiatrists someday will analyze. But anyway, so far we are surviving \nit. It is frustrating.\n  I support the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota. It makes \neminent sense to me in every way and it is certainly relevant to this \nbill. We have a process where we are trying to put together a group of \namendments from both sides, and yet there are few people whose \namendments haven't made it to that list who are refusing to consent. \nThis is one of those moments of Senate gridlock, but we are going to \ncontinue to work at it. I in particular want to reassure the Senator, \nmy friend, we are going to try to continue to work to get his amendment \npassed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me thank the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator \nfrom Maine. No one that I know of ever has accused the Senate of \nspeeding. We have never been accused of speeding. It is a slow, \ndeliberate, frustrating process to get legislation done. I understand \nthat. No one has to have more patience than those who have managed the \nbill on the floor.\n  Let me look ahead with great anticipation of coming to the floor and \nthanking both of them for allowing me to get my amendment passed. I \nwould much prefer that than coming to the floor in a crabby mood about \nan amendment I couldn't get done.\n  I thank them for their patience and thank them for their work, and I \nhope later today we will be able to clear some of these amendments.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator yield? Is it too late to object to the \nSenator's amendment?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator has a right to object to anything at any \ntime. In fact, there are some professional objectors, as we know, here \nin the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I will point out we do have \nprofessional objectors on both sides. We have people who are eager to \nobject to amendments going forward. But the Senator from Connecticut \nand I are working hard to try to clear a list that could be accepted by \nunanimous consent without rollcall votes, and then I have just \nconfirmed with my staff what I said a few moments ago, that there is a \nsecond list we are trying to clear for rollcall votes. I am not saying \nthe Senator's amendment has cleared the UC list, but I am telling the \nSenator his amendment remains on a list we are trying to develop to \nhave rollcall votes.\n  Now, this is a difficult procedure because of the power of any \nSenator to throw a monkey wrench into the works, and we have a lot of \nmonkey wrenches and other tools that are being thrown by Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle. But I do want to assure the Senator his \namendment is on a list the Senator from Connecticut and I are trying to \nclear for votes.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I am in favor of pushing this from time \nto time. Yesterday we had a vote on something that was very instructive \nand I appreciate the majority leader pushing it to a vote.\n  We had for 2 years--2 years--a vacancy in the Assistant Secretary for \nIndian Affairs position--for 2 years. This is shameful. People are \nliving in Third World conditions in this country and the head of the \nBIA had not been confirmed. For 2 years it was vacant. This was a \nnominee by the President, and I supported the nominee. He sent it up \nlast fall. We didn't get it done. He sent it up earlier this year, and \nI immediately moved it out of my committee. This is President Bush's \nappointment, and a good one, I might add. There was a hold on it. We \nfinally forced it to the floor of the Senate a couple of days ago, and \nguess what. The vote was 87 to 1. One person in the Senate puts a hold \non something and the whole thing grinds to a halt.\n  Let's force it in a vote, as my colleague Senator Reid did, and we \nwill discover who is trying to hold things up. Let's move ahead on \nthese amendments and have votes, and we will get the best of what both \nsides have to offer.\n  I yield the floor, and I make a point of order that a quorum is not \npresent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Request\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Monday, this \ncoming Monday, March 12 at 3 p.m., the Senate begin debate on the \nfollowing: S.J. Res. 9, sponsored by Senator Reid of Nevada; S. Res. \n101, sponsored by Senator Reid of Nevada; S. Con. Res. 7 by Senator \nWarner; S. Res. 70 by Senator McCain; S. 641 by Senator Gregg; that \nthere be 6 hours for debate on these items en bloc on Monday, equally \ndivided between the two leaders or their designees; that no amendments \nor other motions be in order to any of the above; that on Tuesday, \nMarch 13 there be 6 more hours for debate on the above, divided in the \nsame way; that at the conclusion or yielding back of that time, the \nSenate vote on each of the above in the above order; and that the \npreceding all occur without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, we \nhave watched carefully our good friends on the other side of the aisle \non this issue going back to January in an attempt to reach some kind of \na consensus on their side of the aisle. I asked my staff to go back and \ntotal up the number of different proposals that have either been \nproposed here on the floor or proposed by one of our good friends on \nthe other side. There are 16 of them.\n  There was a Biden resolution and then there was a Levin resolution. \nThen there was a Reid-Pelosi resolution, the Murtha plan, the Biden-\nLevin resolution, the Conrad funding cut. There was a waiver plan, a \ntimeline plan, a Feingold resolution, an Obama resolution, a Clinton \nresolution, a Dodd resolution, a Kennedy resolution, a Feinstein \nresolution, a Byrd resolution, a Kerry resolution, and today would make \nNo. 17.\n  At this particular juncture, having just gotten this proposal, it \nwould be necessary, I would say to my good friend, the majority leader, \nfor me to share it with members of my conference. We also would want to \nmake certain it would still be the view of my side that the Warner \nproposal, the McCain proposal, and the Gregg proposal would be the ones \nwe would want to offer. That was 3 weeks ago. I was one of those \nprivileged to hear a briefing from General Petraeus over at the \nPentagon this morning. Conditions are changing. We would have to go \nthrough a fairly significant consultative process on this side of the \naisle to be able to conclude exactly what we would want to offer. I am \nprepared to begin that process, but I can't today agree to this \nparticular consent agreement. Therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we all recall that when we had the debate \na couple of weeks ago, the issue was could the Republicans offer \namendments to the antisurge resolution that was on the floor. The \npurpose of that, of course, was to divert attention away from the \nantisurge resolution. The House and the Senate voted on the antisurge \nresolution, and 56 percent of the Senate and 56 percent of the House \nvoted against the surge.\n  I was of the understanding that following the discussion--following \nthe legislation that was completed on that matter, Republicans wanted \nthe opportunity to offer McCain, which was pro-surge; Warner, which was \nmiddle ground; and then Judd Gregg, which was a feel-good amendment. At \nthis stage it appears they have changed their opportunities.\n  I say this: This war has been going on for 48 months--48 months. This \nwar\n\n[[Page S2879]]\n\nwill soon be beginning the fifth year. As of less than 2 weeks, the war \nwill be in its fifth year. When the Democrats were in the minority, we \ntried lots of ways to get the President to refocus on this war, to \nchange course. We have been in the majority for 8 weeks and what have \nwe done? We have had almost 50 hearings on Iraq. These are hearings \nthat should have been done a long time ago. We have 3,200 dead American \nsoldiers, 25,000 of them wounded. We are now focusing on Walter Reed, \nand the same type of oversight we have at Walter Reed and our other \nmilitary facilities, taking care of our wounded veterans, and then \nbeing, some of them, dumped into the Veterans' Administration system \nprior to their being able to be in that system.\n  We are being criticized for wanting to go forward on the debate, as \nwe thought the minority wanted. General Petraeus, today, from Iraq--it \nwas on all the news--what did he say? He said the war in Iraq cannot be \nwon militarily. He said that. I didn't say that, he said it. It can \nonly be won politically.\n  We believe, as does an overwhelming majority of the American people, \nthat President Bush wants to change course in Iraq. That is why we want \nto debate that. We don't want to take a lot of time. It will be very \nshort. But the mission in Iraq has changed dramatically during these 4 \ngoing on 5 years. I am disappointed that again the minority does not \nwant to debate on Iraq.\n  I say this: There will be a debate on Iraq. The House and Senate, a \nmajority in the House and Senate agree that the course in Iraq must \nchange. Today, the House propounded what they want to do. Today, we \npropounded what we want to do. They are basically the same thing. \nTheirs is a little different because they are getting on to a \nsupplemental appropriations bill. We cannot do that. But it is the same \nprinciple--change course in Iraq and redeploy these troops.\n  We will have other opportunities to debate Iraq. But at this stage I \nam very disappointed we are not going to be able to set up a time next \nweek to go forward. In the meantime, I have spoken to the managers of \nthis legislation now before the body. Hopefully, we can move forward.\n  I say to everyone here, any bags that were packed for weekend travel \nshould be put on hold. Save that for some other time. We could be in \nhere over the weekend. We could have as many as three cloture votes \nover the weekend. One will be on the package of bills that has had no \nhearings or anything else. We will do that. I guess it is an \nopportunity--filing that cloture--to see if November 7 was correct; did \nthe Democrats win? I guess that is what that first vote will be. I \nthink it will be that they did win. Then we will go to cloture, if \nnecessary, on the bill, and then on the substitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, let me agree with the majority leader \nthat the Iraq debate will be coming. Nobody on my side objects to \nhaving that debate. It is about supporting the troops.\n  Shortly we will have before the Senate supplemental appropriations, \nwhich is about funding for the troops. That debate, I am certain, will \noccur, as the majority leader indicated, before the Easter recess. We \nwill take a look at the proposal he offered a few moments ago to see \nwhether it is possible to have another Iraq debate next week before we \nhave another one 2 weeks from now. But I cannot agree to this today, \nhaving just been handed the plan the majority has a few moments ago, \nand not having had an opportunity to consult with my own side about \nwhat proposals we might think would be appropriate to offer--some 3 \nweeks after the last discussion of the possibility of entering into a \nunanimous consent agreement to handle this measure.\n  With regard to the status of the war, I am certain nobody in this \nChamber objects to the fact we have not been attacked here at home \nsince 9/11. I doubt if anybody in the Chamber thinks that is a complete \naccident, some quirk of fate. It is a direct result of having been on \noffense in both Afghanistan and Iraq. Nobody is satisfied with the \nprogress made in Iraq. That is why we have a new Secretary of Defense \nand why we have a new general, from whom I and others heard this \nmorning, indicating there are early signs that this mission may well \nsucceed.\n  I don't think we ought to say to our troops in the middle of this new \nmission we are not going to support them. That is what this is all \nabout. We will get back to the Iraq debate in due time. Members on my \nside of the aisle will be happy to engage. We think this is the most \nimportant issue in the country, and we look forward to having that \ndebate, at the latest in the context of the supplemental appropriation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Before my friend leaves, I renew my consent making it 60 \nvotes rather than 50 votes. Does that affect anything?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. My objection is for the same reason I objected to the \nearlier consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from California \nis recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am sorry the Republican leader was \nunable to agree to the proposal put forward by Senator Reid on behalf \nof the Democratic majority of the Senate. It seems to me my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle cannot accept yes for an answer. They have \nwanted for a long time to have a vote on the Gregg amendment. Senator \nReid said, fine, we will vote on the Gregg amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield for a second?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I am happy to.\n  Mr. REID. I want to make sure the Record is clear. Speaking to the \nmajority whip, I want to make sure everybody understands we are going \nto get to this, and whether we do it next week or on the supplemental, \nwe are going to do it. We can do it on both. The issue is that the \nHouse is on the supplemental already; therefore, they have things they \ncan do on it we cannot do until we get to it.\n  Thank you very much.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. I am glad the leader explained that. The fact is, \nwith the approval of the other side, we could have taken up the Iraq \nissue on Monday, and we could all have been heard all of Monday, \nTuesday, and then voted for the resolution that represented our ideas, \nour thoughts, on how to proceed in Iraq.\n  The fact is, that proposal was objected to by the Republicans. What \nwas that proposal? It was everything they wanted last week. They wanted \na vote on the Gregg amendment. We said fine, you can do it. They wanted \na vote on the Warner amendment. Senator Reid said you got it. They \nwanted a vote in favor of the surge with the McCain amendment. Senator \nReid had that in his proposal. We Democrats are asking for a vote on \nour proposal, which I will talk about in a minute, and another proposal \nthat would be similar to Senator Gregg's.\n  Republicans would have gotten three of their amendments and \nproposals, and we would have gotten, on our side, two. But the \nRepublicans cannot say yes. What this means is Senator Reid is right. \nWe are not going to debate Iraq next week--at least not Monday. We will \ndebate it in the context of the supplemental or, if we can reach \nagreement, in the context of a unanimous consent resolution.\n\n  I am very proud to be a cosponsor of the Reid joint resolution. I \nwant to talk about what it does. It says we support the troops. It says \nthe circumstances cited in the 2002 use of force authorization have \nchanged substantially. We all know that. It is not the same. We went in \nto find weapons of mass destruction. Then they changed the mission to \ncapture Saddam Hussein. Then they changed the mission to make it safe \nfor an election. Iraq has had three. Then they changed the mission to \ntrain the Iraqi troops, and they have now 300,000.\n  But I have to say that to see our troops in the middle of a civil war \nis not what we should be supporting. The Iraq Study Group said that, \nand this resolution says U.S. troops should not be policing a civil \nwar. The American people agree with that. Further, we say U.S. policy \nin Iraq must change to emphasize the need for a political solution.\n  We all know there will never, ever be a solution, no matter how many \ntroops are sent to Iraq, and whether they stay there a week, a month, a \nyear, or 10 years, there will never be a solution\n\n[[Page S2880]]\n\nuntil that solution is a political one, where the countries in the \nregion come forward, where the various parties in Iraq who are warring \ncome to the table and hammer out an agreement.\n  Now, we know what happened when the President chose to go into Iraq. \nHe turned his back. He turned his back on the war I voted for, the war \nagainst Osama bin Laden. He turned his back on the people of \nAfghanistan. Yes, we are there. But if we had done with half of the \nnumber of troops we had in Iraq now, and if we had used those in \nAfghanistan, and if we had spent maybe a third of the funding we spent \nin Iraq in Afghanistan, we would have a different scene in Afghanistan. \nWe would be in a better place in Afghanistan.\n  So, clearly, what happened with the Iraq war was it took our focus \noff the war on terror. We call for the President to properly transition \nthe mission of U.S. forces and begin a phased redeployment no later \nthan 120 days following enactment. So we will start bringing the troops \nhome. We Democrats want to start bringing the troops home and, if they \ndon't come home, redeploy them out of Iraq to other places. It is our \ngoal to redeploy all combat forces from Iraq by March 31, 2008.\n  I have to say, what I have heard from my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle, whenever we talk about a timeline, is it is terrible to \nset a timeline. I rhetorically ask, why? Don't we need to send a \nmessage to the Iraqis that we will not hold their hands forever, that \nthey have to take care of their own country, that we cannot keep \nsending the treasure of our country in the form of our troops forever? \nWe have lost too many. Too many are wounded. I met with paralyzed \nveterans today. I can tell you that from the look on their faces, they \nare desperate for help they are not getting. Why? Because we have so \nmany wounded, this administration wasn't ready for the numbers. They \nnever say that. They weren't ready. They weren't ready to support our \ntroops.\n  Now, we need a comprehensive strategy to ensure stability in Iraq. As \nI said, we need a mission our troops can accomplish. In our resolution, \nwe call for three limited purposes: force protection, training and \nequipping Iraqi troops, and targeted counterterror operations. So we \nsay, for the troops remaining, they will not be in the middle of a \ncivil war, but they will protect our forces who are there, they will \ntrain and equip Iraqis and continue counterterror operations.\n  We want to change course. We want to transition the mission and we \nwant to bring civility to Iraq. Now, that is Senator Reid's proposal. I \nthink the vast majority of Democrats are supporting it.\n  More than 3,175 U.S. military men and women have been killed in the \nwar in Iraq. More than 23,900 have been wounded. So it is not hard to \nunderstand why a majority of the American people now believe the war in \nIraq was not worth fighting. The American people understand our \nmilitary and their families are paying a very severe price for this \nnever-ending war. They understand this administration's foreign policy \ndecisions have not only made us less safe, but they have empowered \ndangerous leaders such as the one in Iran. It is time for us to begin \nthe redeployment of our forces from Iraq, just as the Reid resolution \nrecommends, so we can return our focus to the war on terror and fight \nthat war from a position of strength. We cannot defeat al-Qaida while \nwe are bogged down in the middle of a civil war.\n  I do hope we can pass Senator Dorgan's resolution making a very \nstrong point that Osama bin Laden attacked our country, and we want him \ncaptured.\n  Our troops have performed brilliantly. They have done everything \nasked of them. They deserve the love and support of a grateful Nation. \nWhen you love the troops, you give them a mission they can accomplish. \nYou don't give them mission impossible. You don't give them a mission \nthat puts them in the middle of a civil war, and that is why the \nDemocratic proposal is so important.\n  As former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright recently told the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee, on which I serve:\n\n       We have put our forces in the absurd position of trying to \n     prevent violence by all sides against all sides. The Sunnis \n     want us to protect them from the Shiites. The Shiites want us \n     on the sidelines so that they can consolidate their power. \n     Both are divided among themselves. . . .\n\n  This is what she said to our committee. I was there when she said it:\n\n       If I was a soldier on patrol in Baghdad, I wouldn't know \n     whom to shoot at until I was shot at, which is untenable.\n\n  An unclassified summary of the National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq \nstates:\n\n       The intelligence community judges that the word ``civil \n     war'' accurately describes key elements of the Iraqi \n     conflict, including the hardening of ethno-sectarian \n     identities, a sea change in the character of the violence, \n     ethno-sectarian mobilization, and population displacements.\n\n  That is our intelligence community. There is no military solution to \nthe situation in Iraq. The only sustainable solution is a political and \ndiplomatic one, as I said previously.\n  Some warn us we must not redeploy our troops from Iraq and take them \nout of the middle of the civil war or else there will be a larger civil \nwar. But I say we should heed the advice of Ed Luttwak, a senior fellow \nat the Center for Strategy and International Studies, who said:\n\n       By interfering with the civil war [in Iraq], we are \n     prolonging it. . . .\n\n  Let me repeat that:\n\n       By interfering with the civil war [in Iraq], we are \n     prolonging it . . . we are intruding in matters we cannot \n     manage successfully. And therefore, I believe, that \n     disengagement is the right way to go.\n\n  I wish to talk about something that gets Senators in trouble, and \nthat is using the words ``love the troops.''\n  There is a lot of rhetoric about what it means to love the troops. I \nsay when you love the troops, you give them gear and equipment they \nneed, and you don't tell them to settle for less. We remember Secretary \nRumsfeld who said, when asked by the troops about body armor:\n\n       As you know, you have to go to war with the Army you have, \n     not the Army you want.\n\n  We will never forget that stinging rebuke to a soldier who was deeply \nfearful about the lack of armor, the lack of equipment. That arrogant \nstatement shows why our service members were left scrounging for scrap \nmetal for their vehicles and asking their families back home to send \nbandages and body armor.\n  What was interesting about the last election is people said nothing \nwill change, nothing will change if the Democrats win this election. \nThe first thing that happened was Rumsfeld was gone in 5 minutes--in 5 \nminutes. So elections have consequences, and I believe now we have a \nSecretary of Defense who seems to me to be trying to grapple with the \nproblems he is facing. He isn't arrogant, and he doesn't tell the \ntroops to go get lost if they ask a tough question.\n  The President is now increasing the number of troops in Iraq. Today I \nlearned that in addition to the surge, he is adding another 2,000 \ntroops. But we still know not all of them will have the best equipment. \nThis is unacceptable, and loving our troops has to be more than a \nslogan. When you love your troops, you send them into battle adequately \nequipped.\n  When you love the troops, you don't lower the standards for their \nfuture colleagues in arms. In order to meet recruiting goals, the Army \nhas significantly lowered eligibility standards. The number of waivers \ngranted to Army recruits with criminal backgrounds has grown about 65 \npercent in the last 3 years. Approximately 11 percent, or 894, of the \n8,120 waivers granted in 2006 were for people with felony convictions. \nWhen you love the troops, do you want to put them next to someone who \nhas been convicted of a felony?\n  Our military men and women must trust their fellow soldiers with \ntheir lives. We must ensure that our military meets the highest \nstandards.\n  I compliment Congressman Murtha, who is known in this country as a \nwar hero, who has been there, who has done that, who has seen things \nnone of us would ever want to see. He says we can't keep sending our \ntroops back into the field, into combat, without adequate preparation, \ntraining, and the highest standards--and rest.\n  I say that when you love the troops, you don't send them to moldy \nhospital rooms to recuperate. You don't do it. Recent press reports \nhave revealed that\n\n[[Page S2881]]\n\nsoldiers are languishing in substandard facilities at Walter Reed Army \nMedical Center. I thank my colleagues in the Congress for investigating \nthis matter because some of us believe it is the tip of the iceberg.\n  I have asked my State staff to go on a tour of California hospitals \nand report back to me as to conditions in those hospitals.\n  An investigation by the Washington Post found vermin, leaking pipes, \nand mold at Walter Reed Building 18, an old hotel used by \noutpatients receiving care at the main Walter Reed Hospital facility.\n\n  The Post also highlighted larger and even more disturbing problems \nrelated to personnel management and recordkeeping. Soldiers complained \nof lost paperwork, of difficulty locating their appointments and of \nmonths--even as long as 2 years--spent trying to navigate a \nbureaucratic nightmare. According to the Post, some soldiers have \nsimply given up trying to receive care and have gone home.\n  I wish to point out to the Senate--because we all know there are deep \ndifferences about this war--I want people to know that although Senator \nLieberman and I do not see eye to eye on this war--and he will say that \nand I will say that; we see it from a different point of view--we have \nteamed up to try and make sure our soldiers on the battlefield get the \nmental health help they must have.\n  We are disturbed about some of the rules, about what we have found in \nour investigation with our staffs. And that is, many times doctors are \noverruled by the officers and a doctor will say: Do not send this \nindividual out because they have post-traumatic stress and sometimes, \nunfortunately, we have learned the doctor doesn't hold sway, and the \nsoldier is sent out with a pocketful of antidepressants, just as you \nwould give someone aspirin for a headache.\n  This isn't good enough for our soldiers. Senator Lieberman and I are \nnow working with Senator Murray, Senator Inouye, Senator Levin, and \nSenator Akaka to try and make sure our soldiers get the care they need, \nwhether it is physical injury or mental injury.\n  I went to a hospital in San Francisco. I saw x-rays of brains that \nwere damaged by explosions, and then I saw x-rays of brains of people \nwho had post-traumatic stress. The doctors told me that in both cases, \nyou see the damage. You can't tell one from the other.\n  So when you love the troops, you don't send them back into combat \nwith post-traumatic stress and a bottle of antidepressants. You don't \ndo it. Tragically, we know this is happening.\n  As part of the 2007 Defense authorization bill, my legislation passed \nrequiring the DOD to issue guidelines as to the deployability of \nservicemembers with post-traumatic stress, but the DOD has not issued \nthe guidelines and servicemembers with PTSD, post-traumatic stress \ndisorder, continue to be deployed.\n  When you love the troops, you don't reduce the number of permanent \ndisability decisions to save money, when so many of these troops are, \nin fact, permanently disabled. Recent press reports in my hometown \npaper, the Desert Sun in California, have suggested that the Army is \ntrying to save money by giving our troops less of a disability rating \nthan they deserve, despite an enormous spike in the number of \nbattlefield injuries resulting from service in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Now, after nearly 4 years in Iraq, which was supposed to be a walk in \nthe park, a mission easily accomplished, an enemy in the last throes, \nit is time to tell this President the time is up for his ever-changing \nmission.\n  Our troops, whom we all love, deserve more than broken promises, \nbroken bodies, and broken dreams. It is time that Congress, following \nthe will of the voters, start redeploying the troops out of Iraq now, \nas Britain has done, as Japan has done, as Italy has done, as Hungary \nhas done, as Spain has done, as Portugal has done, as Norway has done.\n  It is time to say to the President that the authorization you \nreceived from this Congress has to come to an end, just like your \ncoalition of the willing is coming to an end. The American people want \nthis over.\n  The Democratic resolution that Senator Reid tried to get before our \nbody is reasonable. It is not a cut-and-run resolution. It is a \nresolution that says: Start redeploying the troops out of there, change \nthe mission, as the Iraq Study Group suggested, take our troops out of \nthe middle of a civil war, give them missions they can accomplish--\nforce protection, training and equipping Iraqi troops, targeted \ncounterterrorism operations so we can continue that war against al-\nQaida for which I voted.\n  I didn't vote for this one. This one is a diversion from the war on \nterror, in my humble opinion.\n  My people in California want their National Guard home protecting \nthem in case of emergency. I met with my National Guard. They are short \nof equipment. In a State such as mine where we have earthquakes, fire, \nflood, drought--every kind of problem one can name--we want our \nNational Guard home and ready. There are terror targets in my State. We \ndo have those symbols of America that the terrorists would love to \ntarget.\n  We want our troops back home. We are willing to say if you get them \nout of a civil war, if you want to keep them in the area to do a \nlimited number of missions, that make sense, fine. It is time for \ndiplomacy. It is time for a political solution. It is time for this \nSenate to take up Harry Reid's offer and allow us to vote on our \nresolution that starts redeploying the troops out of Iraq and bring up \nSenator Warner's resolution and bring up Senator Gregg's resolution and \nbring up Senator McCain's resolution--bring them all to the floor of \nthe Senate. But don't block us from having this debate which we were \nready to start on Monday.\n  I hope my Republican friends will reconsider. This is not the first \ntime they have blocked us from debate on Iraq. We respect their points \nof view. We honor their points of view. We encourage them to support \nthe resolutions that they support. But don't block a debate.\n  In closing, I compliment my friends, the managers of this 9/11 bill. \nThis is such an important bill. It is so important. I restrained myself \nfrom offering amendments on this bill. I had something I wanted to do \nregarding blast-resistant cargo containers, but I didn't want to hold \nup getting this bill done. We can work on some of the fine points \nlater.\n  I hope colleagues on both sides will vote to bring debate to a close \non this 9/11 bill. Both our colleagues have worked so hard on it, and \nthe 9/11 Commission has warned us we have work to do. We are so happy \nto see this bill on the floor. So let's get it done as soon as \npossible, and then let's go to a debate on a cloud that is hanging over \nall our heads, regardless of how one feels about this war. Let's have \nthat Senate debate, that respectful debate on how to achieve success \nand bring our troops home from Iraq.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I wish to notify our colleagues who are \nwatching, or their staffs, that there is good news to report. There has \nbeen a break in the gridlock, and I soon will be propounding a \nunanimous consent agreement that will provide for a limited period of \ntime for debate and then votes on four amendments that have been in \ndispute, perhaps one or two judicial nominations after that, and that \nwill open the way for Senator Collins and me to move to adopt several \nother amendments we have been working on and on which there is \nbipartisan agreement, and those we can do by consent. So, in a few \nmoments, I hope we can come forward to offer this light which suggests \na breakthrough as we head to the cloture votes tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness for no more than 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Walter Reed\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, we have had hearings this week \nin several of our committees on the situation at Walter Reed Army \nHospital\n\n[[Page S2882]]\n\nand the great public service that the Washington Post has done in their \ninvestigative piece bringing to light the conditions that our soldiers \nsurely should not be in. Naturally, there is no excuse for there to be \nmold and leaking ceilings and pipes that do not work, and so forth. It \nseems to foretell a greater problem since the Post brought this to \nlight. More people have asked questions about the delivery of health \ncare to our wounded soldiers, sailors, marines, anyone representing the \nUnited States, particularly in service to the country. There are just \ntoo many things that keep coming up that the system is not working as \nit should.\n  A major injury that we are finding coming out of Iraq and Afghanistan \nis traumatic brain injury, called TBI. If it is not diagnosed and \ntreated early, then many times the effects are irreversible. Why is it \nthat the inspector general of the Department of Veterans Affairs, in an \nIG report last July, July of 2006, points out that in traumatic brain \ninjury, if you are in the military compared to if you have that injury \nin the private sector, it takes three times as long?\n  These are the very young men and women we are supposed to be \nprotecting and looking out for their health because we are so \nappreciative of their service to this country. Indeed, that inspector \ngeneral's report points out that if you are in the private sector and \nyou have a brain injury, you are at least going to get that treatment \nwithin 2 weeks. The IG report says that if you are in the military, you \nare not going to get that treatment on average until 6 weeks later. \nThat is the difference--a lifetime of debilitation by not having the \nearly treatment for that brain injury.\n  So the word is out.\n  I am headed to one of four trauma centers in the country. It happens \nto be in my State, a veterans hospital that is one of the specialty \ntraining centers, specialty centers for brain injuries. It is in the \nTampa VA hospital, the Haley Hospital. Of course, now that this has \nbeen in the news, I have been getting these questions about: Are they \ngetting the kind of care they should? I hear some people who say yes, I \nhear others who say it is excellent care, and I hear others who say it \nis not. Well, we are going to find out. That is the responsibility of \nthis Senator from the State of Florida. That is the responsibility of \nthis Senator, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  Let me tell my colleagues what else we are hearing. We are hearing \nthat in this bureaucratic tape, this is what is happening: The soldier \ncomes back from Iraq, is diagnosed with the traumatic brain injury, \nsomebody makes a decision that they ought to go to one of those four VA \nhospitals that have a specialty for brain injury, but they do not get \nthe paperwork processed to get them out of the military so that they \nare then eligible for the veterans. Believe it or not, I heard of cases \nwhere they send the soldier down there, they get to the veterans \nhospital for brain treatment, and they say: We cannot treat you; you \nhave not been released from the military.\n  How bad is that bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo? Who is the victim? The very \npeople for whom we have set up a system of military hospitals and \nveterans hospitals to try to give the best care to. This nonsense has \ngot to stop.\n  It is my hope that as a result of the Post bringing to light \ndeplorable conditions in Building 18 at Walter Reed Army Hospital, it \nis scratching back the surface to see what is underneath, and whether \nit be the conditions in a hospital, veterans or military, whether it be \nbureaucratic handling of that hospital, military or veterans, or \nwhether it is the administrative bureaucratic handling of the patient \nbetween the two systems, that we get it straightened out. We owe no \nless to the people who are sacrificing for this country.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceed to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Well, Mr. President, here is one of my speeches I guess I \nam going to have to make every fortnight, but it is 6:20--it is on \nThursday--and here we stand or mostly sit or hide and will not act on \nimportant amendments on this legislation because our colleagues will \nnot come to agreement on some provision or another in the managers' \npackage or some amendment.\n  I say to my colleagues, this is no way to legislate. If you have a \nproblem, get over here and state it. If you have an objection, have the \ncourage to stand up--be the man or the woman--and express your \nobjection.\n  This is outrageous, and I am not blaming our leadership. It is not \nthem. It is us. This whole bill has been a curiosity to me because I \nthought we were making good progress, and then we were not, and then I \nthought we were going to again, and now we are not.\n  So I tell you--it is not my authority to do so--but if I had the \nability to wave a wand, I would say we are going to vote. If you don't \nlike it, vote against it, but you are not stopping these amendments.\n  So I urge everybody involved--whether it is my colleagues on this \nside of the aisle or the other side--come over here and let's get going \nbecause we look pathetic when we do this sort of thing. It is just \noutrageous. We have votes we could take. We have two judges. Let's \nvote. Let's have a vote on the judges, and it will give us a chance to \nexplain to our colleagues what the problem is with these other \namendments.\n  So I plead with somebody: Pull the trigger. Let's have a vote. Then \nlet's get some results around here. I am telling you, we all look bad. \nDid we not hear the American people? They want us to produce results. I \nhave looked at these amendments. There is nothing wrong with any of \nthese amendments. It is going to be injurious to the institution, to \nthe Republicans and the Democrats. And, yes, I admit, I am outraged \nbecause I want to go home and be with my wife, have supper, and live a \nnormal life. I would suggest some of our other colleagues do that. \nMaybe we could get a little more done around here and not look so bad \nin the process.\n  I want to say to the managers of the bill, I love them both, and I \nthink they have been doing the very best they can. They are ready to \ngo. So it is a disservice to Senator Lieberman and Senator Collins, who \nhave been managing this bill, which, yes, has problems, but we are \nnever going to get them resolved, never going to get to a reasonable \nconclusion without actually having some votes.\n  When was the last time we had a vote around here? I can't even \nremember. Yesterday?\n  So Senator Lieberman, I know you would like to get the show on the \nroad. I support anything you want to do. If you want to just move the \nprevious question, I am for that, or any other motion you want to make \nthat would get the process started. A motion to table--that would be \ngood. We could get going.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I say to my friend from Mississippi, first, I want to \ncongratulate you on your normalcy; that you actually want to get home \nand have dinner with your wife. That is a very healthy thing to do.\n  Mr. LOTT. I know it is abnormal for Senators.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. No, I think it is normal. But I would say--I will \nyield to Senator Collins in a moment--that we, as managers of this \nbill, really appreciate what you have said because we started on the \nbill last Wednesday. We had some good, healthy debate on a series of \namendments that went to the heart of what the bill is about. Frankly, \nthose amendments are done.\n  Now this bill is ready to be adopted and sent to conference, and what \nhas happened, as always happens, is people see a vehicle moving, and \njump on it with related or unrelated amendments. Incidentally, of all \nthe amendments filed, apparently only seven or eight are going to \nsurvive as germane, presuming cloture is invoked tomorrow.\n  So people get to be--well, they see a horse moving and they want to \njump on. Also, then others get to be quite demanding and, might I say \nrespectfully, occasionally unreasonable in blocking votes on the \namendments. It is one thing to be against an amendment, but\n\n[[Page S2883]]\n\nlet's come out, vote on it. You can have your say. The record will be \nestablished. But to block the amendment from coming up that then blocks \nthis important bill--which most of us will support--from going forward, \nthat does not make sense.\n  So I appreciate the Senator's exacerbation.\n  Mr. President, I yield to my friend, the ranking member of the \ncommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I, too, want to commend the Senator from \nMississippi for putting forth a commonsense solution to the impasse in \nwhich we find ourselves. The Senator from Connecticut and I have been \non the floor all day long. We have worked with our colleagues. We have \ncome up with a group of amendments which we believe could be cleared by \nunanimous consent because they are not controversial. Yet can we clear \nthat package? No. We cannot because even though there is no objection \nto the specific amendments in that package, they are being held up by \nSenators who want other amendments or are trying to ensure or block \nvotes on other proposals.\n  We also came up with a set of amendments tonight--two Democratic \namendments, two Republican amendments--that warrant rollcall votes. Two \non each side, what could be fairer? Yet we cannot get rollcall votes.\n  If Members are opposed to amendments, come to the floor, debate them, \nand vote no, but do not prevent us from moving forward on a very \nimportant bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine and the \nSenator from Connecticut for their work. I admire them both so much.\n  Can I inquire, Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is Sununu amendment No. \n291 to the substitute to S. 4.\n  Mr. LOTT. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President: Would a motion to \nmove the previous question be a proper way to proceed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no such motion in the Senate.\n  Mr. LOTT. Would a motion to table be in order, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A motion to table is in order.\n  Mr. LOTT. It is not my prerogative, but I am threatening it.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, who is the first nominee?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of John Alfred \nJarvey, of Iowa, to be United States District Judge for the Southern \nDistrict of Iowa.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. Presdient, today we consider the nomination of John A. \nJarvey, who has been nominated for a seat on the U.S. District Court \nfor the Southern District of Iowa. In his 18 years as a U.S. Magistrate \nJudge in the Northern District of Iowa, Judge Jarvey has built upon his \nreputation as is a well-respected attorney and former federal \nprosecutor and earned the bipartisan support of both home State \nSenators. I know Senator Grassley, who has been a strong advocate for \nJudge Jarvey on the committee, will welcome his confirmation.\n  A native of Minneapolis, MN, Judge Jarvey received his B.S. in \naccounting from the University of Akron in 1978 and his J.D. from Drake \nUniversity in 1981 before clerking for Judge Donald E. O'Brien in the \nNorthern District of Iowa. After his clerkship, Judge Jarvey began his \ncareer as a trial attorney in the criminal division of the Justice \nDepartment from 1983 to 1987, working in the narcotic and dangerous \ndrug Section before his appointment as a magistrate judge for the \nNorthern District of Iowa in 1987. He is now the chief magistrate judge \nof that district. Since 1993, Judge Jarvey has also been trial advocacy \ninstructor at Iowa Law School since 1993.\n  With his confirmation today, the Senate will have confirmed nine \njudicial nominations for lifetime appointments this year. That is more \nthan half the total of confirmations for the entire 1996 session and we \nare still in February of this year. Of course, it was the Republican \nSenate majority that refused to proceed with qualified nominees and \nslowed consideration of President Clinton's nominations.\n  Indeed, one of the casualties of their pocket filibusters was an \noutstanding nominee from Iowa. Bonnie Campbell had served as attorney \ngeneral for the State of Iowa and as the head of the Violence Against \nWomen Office at the Department of Justice. Despite her qualifications \nand without any explanation, the Republican leadership in the Senate \nstalled her nomination for many months and then killed it. Hers was one \nof the more than 60 judicial nominations of President Clinton that \nRepublicans pocket filibustered.\n  President Bush's nominations from Iowa have fared better in a \nDemocratic-controlled Senate than President Clinton's did under \nRepublican control. Judge Jarvey will be the third Iowa District Court \njudge confirmed while I have been chairman of the Judicial Committee. \nWe also confirmed an 8th Circuit nominee from Iowa, Michael Melloy, \nwhen I was last Chairman.\n  I have long urged the President to fill vacancies with consensus \nnominees. After Judge Jarvey's confirmation, according to the \nAdministrative Office of the U.S. Courts there will still be some 51 \njudicial vacancies, 25 of which have been deemed to be judicial \nemergencies. The President has sent the Senate nominations for only 22 \nof those seats, and has yet to send us nominees for 17 of the judicial \nemergency vacancies. That means two-thirds of the judicial emergency \nvacancies are without a nominee from this President.\n  I congratulate Judge Jarvey, his wife, and his three children on his \nconfirmation today.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support Judge \nJohn Jarvey, who has been nominated to serve as a U.S. district judge \nfor the Southern District of Iowa. The Judiciary Committee unanimously \napproved Judge Jarvey some time ago, and I am glad that now we are \nmoving expeditiously on his nomination.\n  I would like to give my colleagues a little background on this \nstellar nominee. Judge Jarvey comes from Cedar Rapids, IA. Since 1987, \nhe has been the chief U.S. magistrate judge for the U.S. district \ncourt, Northern District of Iowa. He also has been a trial advocacy \ninstructor at the University of Iowa Law School since 1993.\n  I received many letters from the Iowa legal community praising Judge \nJarvey's judicial temperament, courteousness to litigants, and respect \nfor and commitment to our judicial system. He has been praised for his \njudicial ethics and abilities as an administrator. Many letters \ncommented on\n\n[[Page S2884]]\n\nJudge Jarvey's intelligence, command of the law and rules of evidence, \nand his fairness.\n  Judge Jarvey has been given a unanimous rating of ``well qualified'' \nby the ABA. I am confident that this man possesses the skill, \nintegrity, commitment, intellect, and temperament that we expect of all \ngood judges.

There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is: Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof John Alfred Jarvey, of Iowa, to be U.S. District Judge for the \nSouthern District of Iowa?\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.

The clerk will report the nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Sara Elizabeth Lioi, of \nOhio, to be United States District Judge for the Northern District of \nOhio.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we consider the nomination of Sara \nElizabeth Lioi for a lifetime appointment to a seat on the Northern \nDistrict of Ohio. Hers will be the tenth judicial nomination for a \nlifetime appointment to the Federal courts that the Senate has already \nconsidered this year.\n  Judge Lioi has spent nearly 10 years on the Stark County Court of \nCommon Pleas. I am sure Senator Voinovich, who appointed her to the \nbench when he was Governor of Ohio, will welcome her confirmation. I \nthank Senator Brown for expediting his consideration of this \nnomination. This process works best when the White House consults with \nSenators from both sides of the aisle.\n  Judge Lioi received her B.A. from Bowling Green State University in \n1983, where she graduated summa cum laude, and her J.D. from Ohio State \nUniversity College of Law in 1987. She worked in private practice with \nDay, Ketterer, Raley, Wright & Rybolt Ltd. in Canton, OH, upon \ngraduation from law school. Her practice included appellate and trial \nlitigation and service as special counsel to Stark State College of \nTechnology. She was elected a principal of her law firm in 1993 and \nstayed there until Governor Voinovich appointed her to the bench in \n1997. Judge Lioi has been active in the judicial and legal community, \nserving on a statewide Board of Commissioners on Character and Fitness, \nthe Supreme Court's Board of Commissioners on Grievances and \nDiscipline, and the Supreme Court of Ohio Task Force on Rules of \nProfessional Conduct.\n  With Judge Lioi's confirmation, we will have confirmed all the \ndistrict court nominees left pending on the Senate's Executive Calendar \nat the end of the last Congress when Republican holds prevented us from \nconfirming them all. We have worked hard to expedite these nominations \nthrough the committee and the Senate this year. I thank particularly \nthe new Members for allowing us to proceed so quickly and congratulate \nJudge Lioi and her family on her confirmation today.\n  We have now proceeded with 10 confirmations even though the President \ndid not renominate Judge Janet Neff for one of the many emergency \nvacancies that plague the Western District of Michigan. Last year the \nSenators from Michigan had worked with the White House and the \nPresident had proceeded to nominate her. The Democratic members of the \ncommittee cooperated to expedite her consideration along with others. \nLast September 16, we held a confirmation hearing for her and other \nnominees on an expedited basis and the committee sent them to the \nSenate without a single objection on September 29.\n  Regrettably, rather than meet to work out a process to conclude the \nconsideration of judicial nominations last session, the Republican \nleadership of the Senate stalled these nominations and, in particular, \nthe President's nomination of Judge Janet Neff. After the Senate \nsession in October, I learned that several Republicans were objecting \nto Senate votes on some of President Bush's judicial nominees. \nAccording to press accounts, Senator Brownback had placed a hold on \nJudge Neff's nomination, even though he raised no objection to her \nnomination when she was unanimously reported out of Judiciary \nCommittee. He later sent questions to Judge Neff about her attendance \nat a commitment ceremony held by some family friends several years ago \nin Massachusetts. Senator Brownback spoke of these matters and his \nconcerns on one of the Sunday morning talk shows.\n  Could it really be that Judge Neff's attendance at a commitment \nceremony of a family friend failed some Republican litmus test of \nideological purity, that her lifetime of achievement and qualifications \nwere to be ignored, and that her nomination was to be pocket \nfilibustered by Republicans?\n  I do not know why the President has not chosen to renominate Judge \nNeff. The situation in the Western District of Michigan is quite dire. \nJudge Robert Holmes Bell, Chief Judge of the Western District, wrote to \nme and to others about the situation in that district, where several \njudges on senior status--one over 90 years old--continue to carry heavy \ncaseloads. Judge Bell is the only active judge. Senator Brownback, who \nraised concern about the burdens falling on senior judges in his home \nState, should be sensitive to the dire situation in the Western \nDistrict of Michigan exacerbated by his hold.\n  I have long urged the President to fill vacancies with consensus \nnominees, particularly for those determined to be judicial emergencies. \nAccording to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, after Judge \nLioi's confirmation, there will remain 50 judicial vacancies, 25 of \nwhich--more than half--have been deemed to be judicial emergency \nvacancies. Of those 25 judicial emergency vacancies, the President has \nyet to send us nominees for 17 of them. That means two-thirds of the \njudicial emergency vacancies are without a nominee from the President. \nThat includes the judicial emergency vacancy that Judge Neff should \nhave filled months ago but for another Republican pocket filibuster.\n\n[[Page S2885]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time. I see the \nranking member on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, thank you for allowing me to speak on \nbehalf of a very deserving person from the State of Ohio, as the Senate \nconsiders her nomination to the Federal bench. I am here to express my \nstrong support for Judge Sara Lioi, who the President has nominated to \nserve on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.\n  Judge Lioi has a distinguished and impressive record as an attorney \nin private practice, as an Ohio Court of Common Pleas Judge, and as a \ncommunity leader in Stark County, Ohio, where she has deep roots.\n  A native of Stark County, Judge Lioi graduated from GlenOak High \nSchool and from Bowling Green State University, where she graduated \nsumma cum laude and earned the distinction of Phi Beta Kappa.\n  Later, Judge Lioi went on to attend my law school alma mater, the \nMoritz College of Law at the Ohio State University, receiving her law \ndegree in 1987. After graduating from law school, Judge Lioi joined the \nlaw firm of Day, Ketterer, the oldest law firm in Stark County, Ohio, \nas an associate. Judge Lioi was later recognized by her colleagues when \nthey elected her to the firm's partnership in 1993.\n  As an attorney, she represented individuals, schools, and other \ninstitutions of higher learning, cities, small businesses, and \nmultinational corporations. While in private practice, she represented \nclients at both the trial and appellate levels.\n  In November 1997, when I was Governor, I appointed Judge Lioi to fill \na vacancy on the Stark County Common Pleas Court. Since then, Stark \nCounty voters have twice reelected her.\n  Since ascending to the bench, Judge Lioi has disposed of over 9,500 \ncases and conducted over 350 trials, over 335 of which were jury \ntrials. In sum, she has broad courtroom experience, both on and off the \nbench. This extensive experience will serve her well as a Federal trial \ncourt judge.\n  Judge Lioi has also earned the respect of her colleagues and fellow \nattorneys. During her time as a practicing attorney, she served on the \nSupreme Court of Ohio Board of Commissioners on Grievances and \nDiscipline, and for over 10 years, Judge Lioi has served on the Supreme \nCourt of Ohio Board of Commissioners on Character and Fitness, \nincluding the last 5 as the Chair of this Commission.\n  I believe her service on these important commissions evidences the \nhigh esteem in which members of the Ohio bar hold her, and is testimony \nof her excellent character.\n  Judge Lioi's legal credentials are not the only reasons I support her \nnomination. Today, too many people do not take the time to become \ninvolved in their communities; however, Judge Lioi remains involved in \na number of civic organizations. A graduate of Leadership Stark County, \nshe has remained active with that program, as well as other not-for-\nprofit community agencies, including Community Services of Stark \nCounty, Stark County Humane Society, Walsh University Advisory Board, \nand the Plain Local Schools Foundation. We need judges who not only \nhave exceptional legal skills, but who also recognize how the law \nimpacts individuals and communities, and involvement in one's community \nfacilitates this understanding. Judge Lioi has this understanding \nbecause she is participating in her community every day.\n  As a result of Judge Lioi's fine academic and professional \nachievements, I am not surprised that the American Bar Association \nunanimously found her well-qualified to serve as a Federal district \ncourt judge.\n  In reviewing Judge Lioi's academic and professional record, it is \nclear that she is well-qualified to serve as a judge on the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Ohio, and I urge my \ncolleagues to vote to approve her nomination to the Federal bench.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am willing to have a voice vote if nobody \nwants a rollcall vote.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I agree that we can have a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is, Will \nthe Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Sara Elizabeth Lioi, \nof Ohio, to be United States District Judge for the Northern District \nof Ohio.\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of speaking about \ntwo amendments. I wish to say that I really appreciate the efforts of \nthe Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from Maine, who have \nliterally been on this floor all day. As you can tell, the Senator from \nMaine has been struggling with a cold through the week. She has been as \nbrave as she can, trying to get this important bill passed even though \nshe doesn't feel at her best. The Senator from Connecticut has been \nworking hard.\n  For some reason, we just can't seem to get a vote on two amendments \nthat are very important to Louisiana. These amendments have been \ncosponsored by Senator Vitter, of course, from the State of Louisiana, \nand myself. Both of these amendments have been cleared on the \nDemocratic side now for some time. We continue to have opposition, and \nwe are not even sure where the opposition is coming from because the \nperson who is holding it or the reasons cannot be made clear publicly, \nso I am not exactly sure what the opposition is to these two \namendments.\n  I thought, while we were pondering about what to do, I would just \ntalk again about what these amendments do and why they are so \nimportant.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 295\n\n  The first amendment is amendment No. 295, which has been pending for \n2 weeks. I understand some colleagues may want to vote no. That most \ncertainly is their prerogative. I bring this amendment to the floor \nwith many cosponsors, Democrats and Republicans, but it is being held \nup on the Republican side tonight. It has been cleared on the \nDemocratic side.\n  This amendment is to allow a waiver of the 10-percent match that has \nbeen required of Katrina and Rita recovery efforts. The reason we are \nasking that, as this board very dramatically shows, is the scale of \nthis disaster is so far above any disaster, natural or otherwise, that \nwe have experienced in this country that without this relief, the \nrecovery is in jeopardy. That is not just because of the amount of \nmoney that has to be put up by local governments that are struggling to \nliterally barely keep the lights on but also because of the redtape \ninvolved in this required match.\n  I understand the principle of a match. In principle, I agree that \nwhen you have a disaster, the local area and the State should put up \nsome money and the Federal Government should\n\n[[Page S2886]]\n\npick up the bulk of it. That is normally what is done. But as you can \nsee here, for Hurricane Andrew, which was the most expensive storm \nprior to Katrina and Rita, the per capita impact was $139. The per \ncapita impact was $139 for Hurricane Andrew. In the World Trade Center \nattacks, which, of course, were not a natural disaster but a terrorist \nattack, it was $390 per capita. But for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, \nthe first and third most costly storms in the history of the Nation, \nthe per capita hit to Louisiana is $6,700. That is to say that, \nliterally, this storm is off the chart. We have never attempted to \nrecover from a disaster such as this, and the tools we have are \ninsufficient. They were insufficient the day before the storms hit. \nThey were insufficient the day after the storm hit. Eighteen months \nlater, they are still insufficient.\n  We have made some progress but not nearly enough progress. It is not \njust the amount of money, which is a staggering amount--$110 billion--\nbut most of that money, because it was sent through poorly designed \nbureaucracies, never reached the end. Part of it was siphoned off by \ncontractors who made huge profits at the expense of the victims of the \nstorm. I can go on and on. There have been well-documented failures.\n  The bottom line is the recovery is still underway, and it is being \nhampered tonight--today--because this 10 percent match is being \nrequired. It is our State's No. 1 request of this Congress, and it is \njustified. It has been done in the past. It was done for Hurricane \nAndrew. It was done for the World Trade Center attacks. Why would \nanyone on the Republican side of this Senate tonight hold up an \namendment that would give us the same coverage or same treatment? Not \nany more. We are not asking for anything more than what has been done--\nfor Louisiana and for Mississippi and for Florida, which were extremely \nhard hit in the last hurricane seasons.\n  We have over 23,000 project work orders pending. Every one of those \nproject work orders in all of the parishes and counties that were hard \nhit--23,000 is a lot of requests--every single one needs to have a 10-\npercent match, which requires certain reviews. Sometimes they are done \nby one Federal agency. Sometimes they are done by another Federal \nagency. It is slowing down the recovery. Every day this recovery is \nslowed down, every day this redtape persists--it is normally a \nnuisance. Normally, redtape is a nuisance in normal, regular life in \nAmerica. In the gulf, it is a noose. It is strangling people. It is \nsucking the life out of them.\n  We cannot rebuild under these conditions. The storm was too great. \nThe disaster was too big. The damage was too broad. We are not saying \nwe can't rebuild and are not willing to use some of our own money, but \nwe cannot come up with this 10 percent match, particularly under the \nconditions which the current law requires. It must be changed. As I \nsaid, the tools that were given to us are insufficient. I promise, as \nsure as I am standing here, when this 10 percent is waived and these \nprojects go forward and the gulf coast rebuilds, the taxes generated \nfrom this region will more than pay back the money that has come to us \nover time.\n  This storm, hopefully, will not hit again for another hundred years \nor 50 years. There are 50 years of good work and a hundred years of \ngood work. By that time, we will have a lot of our wetlands and levees \nrebuilt. So it is in some ways like a temporary loan, if you will, to \nover 30 million people who live in the gulf coast, to say: We believe \nin you, we know you can rebuild, we know you can create these jobs, so \nget about the business of doing it, and the country will benefit in the \nlong run.\n  That is what one of the amendments does. For some reason--I want to \nmake it perfectly clear tonight, this amendment has been cleared on the \nDemocratic side--It is being held up. I don't know why or by whom.\n  I thank Senator Coburn publicly because he had some concerns about \nthis amendment but, with a very appropriate modification to the \namendment which says that this loan forgiveness will sunset 2 years \nafter it goes into effect-- he had some objection to it going on \nindefinitely. Senator Vitter and I accepted that amendment to this \namendment. So his objections have been met.\n\n  Senator Sessions had some concerns. His objections have been met.\n  There is some other hold on it. I just wanted to speak publicly, \nagain, about the importance of getting this 10 percent waived. Again, \nit was done for Hurricane Andrew and it was done for the World Trade \nCenter towers. You can see the scope of this disaster for the people of \nthe gulf coast.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 296\n\n  The second amendment, briefly, which is an amendment I offered with \nSenator Vitter and others--and we have Republican and Democratic \ncolleagues on this amendment--is a loan forgiveness amendment. This is \na very touchy point for us on the gulf coast. I wish I had this list \nblown up. I do not. Of course no one can read it because it is too \nsmall to be seen, but we will get it blown up as soon as we can.\n  What I am holding here is a list of loans that have been taken out. \nThis is just for Louisiana, but there is a Mississippi list just like \nthis. There are community disaster loans that are taken out, like for \nthe city of Harahan, the city of New Orleans, St. Bernard Parish, St. \nBernard Parish School, Cameron Parish, which was almost totally \ndestroyed. Of course, when these parishes are almost totally destroyed, \nthey cannot go to banks to borrow money. No bank will lend it to them. \nThe only people they can borrow from is themselves--the Federal \nGovernment. We lend money to communities all the time, and we lend \nmoney to them under longstanding practices. This has been going on way \nbefore I got to the Senate--for decades. Sometimes those loans are \nforgiven, and sometimes they are not forgiven. It is up to the \nadministration, the agency, to evaluate. If you can repay the loans, \nthen you repay them. If you can't, you do not.\n  Last year, or 18 months ago, when we had this tragedy happen to us, \nunder the last Congress we had many Republicans who supported our \neffort but not quite enough because there was a group in the House, led \nby sort of a conservative caucus over there, that said this: We will \nlend you money, but we are taking away your right to have repayment \nwaived even if you deserve to have it waived. Even if your situation is \nworse than that of anybody else we have ever seen, we are removing that \nright.\n  I objected then; I did not think it was right. But we were voted \ndown. So we have lived under this new rule, which was made only for \nMississippi and Louisiana, because when the act was passed 18 months \nago, over my strenuous objection, everything in the future could be \nforgiven, everything in the past had the option to be forgiven, but for \nthe good people of Mississippi and Louisiana, for some reason we were \ncarved out, to say: We will lend you the money, but you will pay it \nback no matter what. I objected to it then, and I object to it tonight.\n  The amendment Senator Vitter and I have submitted is to just put us \nback where everybody else is--not any more, not any less. Just give us \nthe option to have these loans forgiven. Many of these loans will be \npaid back. They are substantial loans. Some of them are $120 million, \nsome of them are $2 million, some of them are $22 million. Some are \njust $100,000 loans, depending on what a sheriff or school board \nneeded. But, again, this disaster was unprecedented in American \nhistory. Many of these loans will be paid back, but that is for the \nadministration to decide. If they believe these entities in Mississippi \nand Louisiana cannot repay these loans, then they will waive them. But \nunder the current laws, as passed in the last Congress--particularly \ndriven by a group on the House side--that forgiveness option was \nremoved.\n  The two amendments are to waive the 10 percent, which we think is \njustified--more than justified--by this chart and many other facts that \nhave been submitted to the record--and to go back to the regular \nroutine law that says: If you borrow money you, of course, must pay it \nback. But if you cannot, we retain the option to forgive you. That is \nall we are asking for Gulfport, for Biloxi, for Pascagoula, for New \nOrleans, for Cameron, for Creole, for little cities--Thibodaux and \nHouma and cities that have borrowed money that might be able to pay it \nback, but then again they might not.\n\n[[Page S2887]]\n\n  For the millions of people who live on the gulf coast, we may not be \na fancy coast like the east coast or the west coast, but we are a \nworking coast, and we are proud of it. We are fighting hard to come \nback, and we are contributing as much money as we can to the effort. \nPeople are working hard--wealthy, middle-income, and poor people, Black \nand White, Hispanic and Asian are working hard to come back.\n  We cannot come back if the rules keep changing for us. If the hurdles \nget higher, we cannot jump them. Leave them the same as everyone else, \nand we will be happy to rebuild our communities. We are building them \nstronger and smarter than ever before.\n  But when you have had most of your schools destroyed, most of your \nlibraries destroyed, most of your universities damaged, it is an \nunbelievable situation to have to come back from. I know we have some \nwork to do on many items. But at least the Federal Government can keep \nthe rule book the same for everybody. We are happy to play by those \nrules.\n  On behalf of the people I represent, I strongly object to these new \nrules that are placed on us, for taking away options that others have \nenjoyed and used for their benefit. I am reminded of the disaster in \nNorth Dakota, Grand Forks. I did not visit North Dakota, but I have \nheard a lot about it. I have read about it.\n  That town of 50,000 was just about destroyed by the water that came \nthrough. Because there was a little different attitude in Washington, \nGrand Forks has been rebuilt. It is bigger than it was. It is stronger \nthan it was. The people have their jobs back. That is what the Federal \nGovernment is about. The Federal Government should have the same \nattitude with the people in Louisiana and Mississippi in our time of \nneed.\n  We most certainly can afford this after spending $400 billion helping \n23 million people who live in Iraq achieve democracy. We most certainly \ncan support 30 million people to keep the democracy they have and have \nhad for 226 years.\n  I hope tomorrow morning, when I come back to this floor, these \namendments have been cleared on the Republican side of the aisle. If \nnot, at least the person who is holding it up will have the guts to \ncome to the floor and debate me on it and let us have a vote. I am \nhappy to have a vote. I am happy to debate. If my colleagues, after \nhearing this, say: Senator, you are just wrong, the facts are not on \nyour side, then I am fine. I would lose the vote.\n  But please let the people of Louisiana and Mississippi have a chance. \nThat is why I guess we are stopped, because we cannot get a vote on \nthese two amendments. They are not that complicated. I think people \nunderstand them. I hope we can get these two amendments passed. If \nsomeone has strong objections, I am happy to stay here tonight to \ndebate. I will come early in the morning. I will stay all weekend. I do \nnot have to go anywhere this weekend. I am happy to stay and talk about \nit for as long as I need to.\n  I tried to speak about it privately with my colleagues. Now I am \ndoing it rather publicly. I wanted to express that and let people know \nall the facts as I know them. I hope we can get these amendments voted \non sometime tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Iraq Reconstruction\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today because a daunting task lies \nbefore us in Iraq. That task is the reconstruction of a war-torn and \nbruised nation. Let's put the battle over a troop surge or increased \nfunding aside and join together in a strategy to one day leave Iraq, a \nfree Iraq, in a place better than we found it. And not better by our \nstandards, but better for the people and future of Iraq.\n  Last week, a group of airmen from Nellis Air Force Base in my \nhometown were recognized with Bronze Stars for their courageous efforts \nin Iraq. As part of an Explosive Ordnance Disposal team they have done \nremarkable work saving lives. CAPT Brian Castner was awarded the Bronze \nStar after a 6-month tour--his third tour in Iraq. His wife, Jessica, \nsaid of his mission:\n\n       My grandparents fought in World War II and, because of \n     that, Japan is our friend. And we just hope and pray at night \n     that 30, 50 years from now that for our children and our \n     grandchildren that Iraq will be our friend, and if his \n     efforts today keeping people safe does that, it makes every \n     sleepless night worth it.\n\n  If we are going to succeed at making a future friend and ally out of \nIraq, then we need a new direction forward. Our new military strategy \nmust be paired with a new reconstruction strategy in order to cool off \nthe vitriolic hatred and violence that has consumed Iraq, and this new \ndirection must be based on realistic goals.\n  When we first liberated Iraq from the brutal dictatorship of Saddam \nHussein, we were disgusted by the ruler's palaces and extreme wealth in \ncontrast with the deplorable conditions of those he ruled. We were \nanxious to give the Iraqi people all that they had lacked. While our \nintentions were good, our expectations were unrealistic and our \nperformance failed to deliver.\n  We looked to build a self-sufficient democratic nation in the Middle \nEast with an accompanying civil society, responsible and just court \nsystem, representative government, responsive police units, a \nrespected, and a protected border. We wanted to create a model to which \npeople of other states in the region could aspire.\n  In hindsight, we should not have imagined that building a democracy \nwould be so simple. It never has been. We simply did not have the \nstrategy and tactics properly prioritized, maybe building the roof \nbefore the foundation. It is no wonder why our efforts were \nunsuccessful. But it is not too late to regroup. A great deal depends \non our new direction being successful.\n  Our policy needs to change from lofty aspirations to a focus on \nproviding, as a minimum, the basic services that were available during \nthe Saddam Hussein era. At the same time, we need to communicate that \nwe are laying the groundwork for future opportunities that were \nunimaginable under that barbaric regime. We need to redirect our \nefforts to vital services such as water and waste water systems, \nirrigation canals, and a reliable electricity supply. Concentrating our \nresources on improving everything simultaneously is foolish and ends up \nbeing far less efficient. The laundry list of what we initially tried \nto accomplish in Iraq is what scholar Amitai Etzioni calls a \n``scattergun approach.'' We tried to do too many things at once, and \ndid none of them really well. Instead, Mr. Etzioni suggests, we need a \n``triage'' approach. We need to make services such as water, sewers, \nand electricity a priority. We work on them until they are successfully \ncompleted, and then we turn to the next project. While the building of \nbanks and schools are important, if Iraqi families can't get running \nwater in their homes or more than a few hours of electricity a night, \nwhy should they trust us? The less tangible gifts of a free democratic \nsystem are meaningless to a mother caring for her sick child in the \ndarkness.\n  While our priorities have been part of the problem, our attitude may \nhave also been a source for our difficulties. A Marine reservist from \nNevada, Jon Carpenter, who served two tours in Iraq and whose brother \nis there now, told me about the approach taken by those around him to \nthe Iraqis. ``Sir, this is your country. What problems do you see that \nneed to be addressed and what can I do to assist you in these \nproblems,'' they would ask. ``I may have some monetary resources \ncoming, some people with skill sets to help you, and my time and energy \nto make the solutions happen. Where would you like to begin?''\n  If it had been the policy of all our military leaders on the ground \nto give that kind of deference to the local Iraqis, we may have been \nable to build a greater deal of good will and success. And don't get me \nwrong, our men and women in uniform have made tremendous progress in \nIraq. They have worked tirelessly and have been committed to the cause, \nbut we need to understand the importance of successfully delivering the \nmost basic services to the Iraqi people as part of their path to self \nsufficiency. It will also create a situation where there is no \ntolerance for insurgents or their efforts to destroy what belongs to \nthe Iraqi people.\n  In order for the Iraqi Government to become self-sufficient, Iraq's \npotential\n\n[[Page S2888]]\n\nfor producing oil also must be realized. Currently the Iraqis are \nproducing roughly 2.1 million barrels of oil a day. This is down from \nthe 2.5 million barrels of oil a day produced during the previous \nregime. We need a plan that will reliably deliver 3 million barrels a \nday. At $60 per barrel, the incremental 900,000 barrels per day \ngenerates nearly $20 billion per year. This would go a very long way \ntoward funding many of the improvements that are mandatory to stabilize \nthe situation in Iraq.\n  As report after report indicates, one of the challenges to building \nIraq's oil revenues has been insurgent attacks against oil \ninfrastructure. As Senator Clinton and I wrote in the Wall Street \nJournal, we believe a distribution of revenues to all Iraqis through an \nIraq Oil Trust would mean they would have a greater incentive to keep \nthe oil flowing, help the economy grow, reject the insurgency, inhibit \ncorruption and commit to the future of their nation. An Iraq Oil Trust, \nmodeled on the Alaskan Permanent Fund, would guarantee that every \nindividual Iraqi would share in the country's oil wealth. Oil revenues \nwould accrue to the national government and a significant percentage of \noil revenues would be divided equally among ordinary Iraqis, giving \nevery citizen a stake in the nation's recovery and political \nreconciliation and instilling a sense of hope for the promise of \ndemocratic values.\n  I know there are plans that distribute the oil revenues to the \ndifferent provinces, but I firmly believe that each Iraqi citizen must \nreceive a share--it means a path to opportunity for these people. With \nthat share, an Iraqi citizen can make money, invest in a business, use \nit for collateral for a home, or build savings. With that share in an \nIraq oil trust comes hope for the future.\n  There is still reason to hope for success in Iraq. Our new military \nstrategy is showing progress on the ground, but we must continue to \ngive our men and women in uniform the tools they need for the \nmonumental task at hand. A focused plan for ``triage'' in the \nreconstruction of Iraq, coupled with a strong military strategy, will \nboost our credibility and secure Iraq for their future and for ours. If \nwe don't succeed on the battleground and in the reconstruction efforts, \nwe risk creating an enemy state that will be a safe haven for \nterrorists and a grave threat to generations of Americans.\n  Instead, let us work together to ensure that 50 years from now, our \nfriendship with the people of Iraq will be thriving. We owe it to our \nbrave men and women, like Captain Castner, to make that vision a \nreality.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, youth violence is an enormous problem \nacross America, including Pennsylvania. Regrettably, the city of \nPhiladelphia had more homicides last year than any major city.\n  This is a problem that has been present in major American cities, and \nPhiladelphia specifically, since the days when I was Philadelphia's \ndistrict attorney. A great number of those homicides are related to \nyouth violence.\n  On January 19 of this year, I convened a meeting that was attended by \nMayor John Street; District Attorney Abraham; U.S. Attorney Pat Meehan; \nand representatives of Governor Rendell, with whom I discussed the \nmatter specifically. There was a followup hearing attended by Senator \nCasey and myself on February 19, where we addressed the subject with a \nfocus on trying to find mentors for these at-risk youth.\n  We are searching for long-range solutions to the crime problem, the \nunderlying causes of crime--which is obviously very complicated and \nvery long term--such as education, training, job training, decent \nhousing, and a whole host of factors that lead to crime. It is a matter \nI have been working on for decades, since my days as an assistant \ndistrict attorney in Philadelphia. Regrettably, we don't seem to be \nmuch further along on attacking those underlying causes of crime, or \ndealing with the problems of criminal recidivism, after people are \nreleased from jail. It is no surprise that if we release a functional \nilliterate from jail, they will go back to a crime of violence. Without \nbeing able to read or write and not having job training, there is a \nvery high degree of recidivism. We are trying to push the so-called \nsecond offender law to give people rehabilitation after the first \noffense.\n  Senator Casey and I believe that addresses the issue in the short \nterm, but it is not the answer, because there is no absolute answer. \nHowever, short-term help could be provided if we could find mentors to \nteam up with at-risk youth on an individual basis. Many of these at-\nrisk youth come from broken homes and have no parental guidance. If \nthere could be a mentor, or ``substitute parent,'' in the short term, I \nthink that could be helpful.\n  We have also worked with the superintendent of schools of \nPhiladelphia, on some ideas he has about trying to give motivation to \nhigh school students, to put them on a path of going to college. We are \nworking to have some early determination from the many colleges and \nuniversities in the Philadelphia area, to try to encourage these young \npeople to be motivated to finish high school with the prospect of \ncollege.\n  Regarding the mentoring program, we are asking the universities also \nto see if they can provide mentors from their student body or faculty \nand, in the case of students, to give them course credit. We reached \nout to the athletic teams in Philadelphia, including the 76ers, the \nEagles, and efforts are being made to include the Philadelphia Phillies \nas well, because it is well known that young people are interested in \nrole models and might be willing to follow that lead.\n  We have also moved forward on trying to improve the situation in the \ncity of Reading, which has been designated as the 21st most violent \ncity in the United States. Toward that end, on February 23, with the \ncooperation of one of Reading's leading citizens, Al Boscov, we \nconvened a meeting with the U.S. Attorney's Office, the FBI, the \nAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the State \npolice, the local chief of police, the local sheriff, the school \nsuperintendent, and with citizens to again look at the crime problem. \nWe intend to follow up in Reading to try to get additional personnel to \nassist that city, because it is, as I said, the 21st most dangerous \ncity in the United States.\n  We have similar meetings planned for Lancaster and York next Monday, \non the 12th. We also intend to go to Allentown and other cities. In \nPittsburgh, we plan to convene a meeting on April 5, looking for ways \nto bring more Federal resources to bear on this crime problem. We are \nlooking to the upcoming budget to try to provide more funds, similar to \nthe $2.5 million grant we obtained for the U.S. Attorney for the \nEastern District of Pennsylvania to service the corridor from the \nLehigh Valley through Reading and through Lancaster.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a statement be printed, with \nunderstanding that there will be some repetition in the written \nstatement of what I have presented extemporaneously.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Senator Arlen Specter--Pennsylvania Anti-Crime and Youth Violence \n                               Initiative\n\n       Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to discuss \n     my recent efforts to address the crime and youth violence \n     issues facing cities in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. \n     Pennsylvania is making great strides in revitalizing its \n     cities through economic and community development. \n     Unfortunately, the same cities that are investing substantial \n     human and economic capital in revitalization efforts are also \n     facing increased levels of crime. For example, Philadelphia \n     had the highest homicide rate of all\n\n[[Page S2889]]\n\n     large cities in the United States in 2006--406 murders in one \n     year. The smaller city of Reading was ranked as the 21st most \n     dangerous in the Nation, and the most dangerous city in the \n     state of Pennsylvania. Cities across the state are \n     experiencing disturbingly high levels of youth involvement in \n     crime and gangs--an average of 15 young people between the \n     ages of 10 and 24 are murdered every day in the state of \n     Pennsylvania. The cost of crime to victims, neighborhoods, \n     and communities across America is staggering: at a September \n     19, 2006 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, economist Jens \n     Ludwig estimated that the pecuniary and non-pecuniary costs \n     of crime amounted to approximately $2 trillion nationwide per \n     year, or 17 percent of the GDP.\n       I have sought to examine the nature of crime and youth \n     violence in cities across Pennsylvania by convening \n     stakeholder meetings among Federal, State and local elected \n     officials and leaders in the fields of law enforcement and \n     crime prevention. These meetings have provided an avenue for \n     understanding the nature of local problems, provided a \n     constructive forum for discussing ongoing law enforcement and \n     prevention efforts designed to combat these problems, and \n     created an opportunity to discuss ideas for innovative \n     solutions moving forward.\n       On January 19, I held a roundtable discussion in \n     Philadelphia at which Mayor John Street, District Attorney \n     Lynne Abraham, United States Attorney Pat Meehan, \n     Philadelphia School District Chief Executive Officer Paul \n     Vallas, and other leaders in the community discussed \n     innovative solutions to the youth violence problem in the \n     city of Philadelphia. We discussed the idea of bolstering \n     mentoring efforts in the city of Philadelphia--an approach I \n     find very promising. Research shows that children with the \n     positive influence of an adult mentor in their lives are \n     significantly less likely to start using drugs and alcohol or \n     to be violent, and are more likely to be productive in school \n     and to have healthier peer and family relationships. \n     Following our meeting in Philadelphia, I have encouraged the \n     participation of volunteers from Philadelphia area \n     businesses, colleges and universities, and professional \n     sports teams, including the Eagles, the 76ers, and the \n     Phillies, in a citywide mentoring initiative. Volunteers from \n     those organizations will be working in cooperation with the \n     United Way and Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, with whom \n     we have partnered to ensure that volunteers have the training \n     and support they need to form successful mentoring \n     relationships.\n       On February 23, I held a roundtable discussion in Reading, \n     PA, at which Representative Joe Pitts, Representative Jim \n     Gerlach, and I discussed the collaborative efforts of State, \n     local, and Federal law enforcement with United States \n     Attorney Pat Meehan and representatives from the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, \n     the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the United \n     States Marshal, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the \n     Pennsylvania State Police, Reading City Police, and Berks \n     County Sheriff's Department. The discussion capitalized, in \n     part, on the previous efforts of community leader Albert \n     Boscov, who has been hosting an ongoing working group focused \n     on anti-crime issues in Reading. Our dialogue focused on the \n     most effective and efficient methods of keeping the streets \n     of Reading and surrounding neighborhoods safe. Presently, the \n     largest Federal presence in the area is the Anti-Gang \n     Initiative focused on the ``222 Corridor'' between Allentown \n     and Lancaster--which has provided a $2.5 million grant to \n     facilitate a collaborative Federal, State and local response \n     to the gang-related drug and gun trafficking in the area. The \n     initiative, which focuses on criminal law enforcement, \n     prevention programs to steer kids away from criminal \n     activity, and reentry programs to assist those returning from \n     prison to integrate back into society, is already making \n     headway into the gang problems in the area. Despite this \n     progress, Federal, State and local law enforcement officers \n     conveyed to me and to Representative Pitts and Gerlach the \n     continuing need for more resources in order to get more cops \n     out on the street.\n       I remain committed to ensuring that State and local law \n     enforcement receive the support that it needs. I will be \n     working with Federal law enforcement agencies to ensure that \n     existing programs are meeting the needs of the communities in \n     the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and across the United \n     States. I also plan to hold similar meetings in York, \n     Lancaster, Allentown, Pittsburgh and other Pennsylvania \n     cities in the coming months.\n       As the Senate moves forward in the 110th Congress, there \n     are a number of important legislative items focused on crime \n     prevention that demand our attention. The Juvenile Justice \n     Act, which was most recently authorized in the 21st Century \n     Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act (P.L. \n     107-273) is due to be reauthorized this year, and I will be \n     working to ensure that Juvenile Justice programs are \n     reauthorized in the form that most effectively and \n     efficiently handles the challenges of youth violence and \n     delinquency. The Recidivism Reduction and Second Chance Act, \n     which I will be introducing with Senators Brownback, Leahy, \n     and Biden, will provide essential reentry services to \n     prisoners in order to reduce recidivism rates, keep former \n     offenders productively engaged in society, and keep our \n     streets more safe.\n       We must do everything we can to ensure that the Nation's \n     youth receive the assistance they need to develop into \n     productive, healthy adults and to protect our citizens from \n     being victimized. I look forward to making a renewed \n     commitment toward coordinated law enforcement and prevention \n     efforts in the 110th Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/08/senate-section/article/S2889-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2889-S2890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      AMERICA COMPETES ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, along with the Republican leader, Senator \nMcConnell, I have introduced the America COMPETES, Creating \nOpportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, \nEducation, and Science, Act of 2007.\n  This legislation is the result of a truly bipartisan effort. Two \nyears ago, Senators Bingaman and Alexander asked the National Academies \nto make recommendations on the steps we should take as a nation to \nmaintain our competitive advantage. The result was the Augustine \nReport, ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' which provided four \nprimary recommendations:\n  First, the United States needs to dramatically improve K-12 science \nand mathematics education in order to increase our talent pool. Second, \nwe must sustain and strengthen our Nation's traditional commitment to \nlong-term basic research. Third, we must make the United States the \nmost attractive place to study and perform research. And fourth, we \nneed to provide incentives for innovation and long-term investment so \nthat the United States is the premier place to innovate.\n  The report warned that the Nation's traditional advantages ``are \neroding at a time when many other nations are gathering strength,'' and \nthat ``decisive action is needed now.''\n  America has faced this challenge before.\n  In 1957, when the Soviets launched Sputnik, it caused great panic and \nconcern about our ability to maintain our technological superiority. We \nresponded to these threats quickly. The following year, Congress passed \nthe National Defense Education Act, to keep the United States ahead of \nthe Soviets through increased investment in math and science education.\n  We trained a whole new generation of engineers and scientists, and \nthus ensured our preeminence in technology and innovation for a \ngeneration.\n  That fact is, Federal investment in the basic sciences and research \nhas long been a critical component of America's competitive dominance \nglobally. In fact, some economists have estimated that about half of \nthe country's economic growth since World War II has been the result of \ntechnological innovation.\n  Today, however, our position of dominance has been lost. We are \nchallenged by emerging countries like India and China, where national \ninvestment in basic research and subject areas such as math and science \ncontinues to grow at a far greater pace than here in the United States.\n  The Augustine panel cited many examples, but some of the statistics \nare striking.\n  Consider that in 2005, more than 600,000 engineers graduated from \ninstitutions of higher education in China, compared to 350,000 in India \nand only 70,000 in the United States. China's population is more than \nthree times that of the United States, yet they graduate more than \neight times the number of engineers.\n  The report also found that American 12th graders performed below the \ninternational average for 21 countries on general knowledge in math and \nscience. Another study cited in the report had American 15-year-olds \nranked 24th out of 40 countries on a math assessment. In my home State \nof Nevada, the situation is equally alarming, with our students ranked \n43rd in the Nation on a 2005 math assessment.\n  And even though technological giants like Microsoft, Apple, and Intel \nare American companies, the report indicates that the United States is \nnow a net importer of high technology products--a shift from the early \n1990s, when we had a $54 billion surplus in high-tech exports.\n  As other countries become more competitive, it is clear we must \nrefocus our energies on enhancing the Federal commitment to funding \nbasic research and education.\n  We must preserve the competitive edge of the United States in science\n\n[[Page S2890]]\n\nand technology by getting kids motivated to study math and science. To \ndo this, we need to provide more training for math and science \nteachers, increase the number of students taking advanced placement \ncourses, offer grants to establish high schools that specialize in math \nand science, and provide scholarships and fellowships for future \nscientists and engineers.\n  The legislation we are introducing today addresses some of these \nconcerns. It is, in effect, a downpayment, a modest first step to \nensuring that America retains its competitive edge.\n  I wish to thank Senators Bingaman and Alexander for authorizing the \nAcademies Study. This study, along with a number of recent reports and \nbooks--among them, Tom Friedman's ``The World is Flat,'' which I know \nthat many of my colleagues have read--brought a much-needed sense of \nurgency to this issue.\n  Many of these provisions were included in the Protecting America's \nCompetitive Edge Act, or PACE, which Senators Bingaman and Domenici \nintroduced in the last Congress, and I was pleased to cosponsor that \nimportant legislation.\n  I also want to recognize the hard work of a number of my colleagues, \nSenators Inouye, Stevens, Kennedy, Enzi, Lieberman, Ensign, Mikulski, \nHutchison, and Senator Nelson of Florida, who have been instrumental in \ncrafting this legislation.\n  The legislation that we are introducing will double the Federal \ninvestment for the National Science Foundation over the next 4 years, \nand for the Office of Science at the Department of Energy over the next \ndecade.\n  America COMPETES will create a DARPA-modeled research project at the \nDepartment of Energy and increase investment for basic research at NASA \nand other science-related Federal agencies.\n  The bill provides grants to States in order to better align \nelementary and secondary school curriculum with the knowledge and \nskills needed for the global economy. Nevada is already doing something \nsimilar, with our State P-16 Council.\n  The legislation will strengthen our math and science teaching \nworkforce by recruiting and training teachers to teach in high-need \nschools.\n  America COMPETES will expand the important Advanced Placement and \nInternational Baccalaureate, IB, programs by increasing the number of \nmath, science, and foreign languages AP and IB courses, and preparing \nmore teachers to teach these challenging courses. This is essential for \nStates such as Nevada, where only 6 percent of 12th graders took the AP \ncalculus exam and only 7 percent took an AP science exam.\n  The bill will help develop an infrastructure for innovation by \nestablishing a President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness to \npromote innovation and competitiveness.\n  Also, this legislation will help improve math instruction at the \nelementary and middle school level, through Math Now grants.\n  If signed into law, our bill will do many of the things that the \nAugustine Report recommended, but the truth is, in years to come, we \nwill have even more to do.\n  Though we make new and significant investments in research, we still \nmust address our tax structure and make sure that we do as much as \npossible to encourage investment in research and development. We should \nstart by finally making the R tax credit permanent.\n  We must also do more in education. This bill strengthens educational \nopportunities in science, technology, engineering, math, and critical \nforeign languages, but this is just a first step. For example, we must \ntake a very hard look at our high schools. As Bill Gates has often \nsaid, our high schools were designed for a 20th century economy and \noften do not address the needs of the 21st century workforce.\n  We should also realize that unless our most basic commitments to \nAmerica's students are met--by properly funding title I and No Child \nLeft Behind and making a college education accessible and affordable--\nthese efforts alone cannot prepare our students for the global economy.\n  Mr. President, Senator McConnell and I began the 110th Congress by \npromising a new spirit of bipartisanship. Of course we have had our \ndifferences on some issues, but I hope that, in jointly introducing \nthis important legislation, we send a signal that investing in \nAmerica's future is not a partisan issue.\n  The America COMPETES Act is an important first step in maintaining \nthis Nation's competitive advantage, and I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues to ensure that we follow through on the investments we \nare making in this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/08/senate-section/article/S2890-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR.

Her \nwork has attracted national recognition, and next month Dr. Lindquist \nwill be honored as Desert Research Institute Medal Recipient in Nevada. \nI would also like to thank the Desert Research Institute for their \ncontinued commitment in recognizing the best and brightest in our \nscientific and engineering communities.\n  Dr. Lindquist has a diverse background of experience in the medical \nfield. She is a member and former director of the Whitehead Institute. \nShe is also a professor of biology at the Massachusetts Institute of \nTechnology, as well as the Albert D. Lasker Professor of Medical \nSciences at the University of Chicago. Dr. Lindquist has been \nacknowledged by several institutes, including being elected into the \nprestigious Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1997.\n  Her life work in the medical field is nothing short of extraordinary. \nPotential cures for Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, and many \nneurodegenerative diseases lie in the most fundamental building blocks \nof the human body--our proteins. Lindquist and her colleagues have made \nit their professional mission to understand how long strands of \nproteins fold to create intricate shapes or misfold and clump together. \nIn her work, Dr. Lindquist found that when proteins misfold, they can \ncontribute to cystic fibrosis, Alzheimer's, and even mad cow disease. \nDr. Lindquist and her team have studied this exciting line of research \nso that we can better understand these diseases and hopefully develop \nnew treatments.\n  Dr. Lindquist's work has led to stunning medical breakthroughs in \nmedicine, biology, and bioengineering. But the true impact of her work \nis felt by mankind. Today millions of Americans across Nevada and our \nNation who suffer from neurodegenerative diseases have hope. Cures for \nsome of the most debilitating diseases are on the horizon as a result \nof Dr. Lindquist's work.\n  Again, it is with great pride that I recognize Dr. Susan Lindquist \nbefore the Senate. She is a deserving recipient of the Nevada Medal for \nher extraordinary work. I look forward to her continued accomplishments \nin this important field.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/08/senate-section/article/S2890-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2890-S2891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          A MESSAGE FROM IRAQ\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the superb \ncontribution of the thousands of men and women deployed in Operation \nIraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. The following e-mail, \nforwarded to my office by family members of a naval officer serving in \nIraq is indicative of the fighting spirit and considerable sacrifice \nthat members of the armed services are making on a daily basis. We owe \nall of these men and women a tremendous debt of gratitude for their \noutstanding service. This officer's perspective is most deserving of \nbeing considered by the American public.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the e-mail to which I \nreferred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Friends and Family:\n       Many of you watched the President address the nation two \n     nights ago regarding the way forward in Iraq. A few people \n     have asked me whether or not this surge will affect me. The \n     answer is yes, but only for a short time. Instead of coming \n     home in a few weeks, I will not be leaving until March at the \n     earliest.\n\n[[Page S2891]]\n\n     Some of the Navy guys who are trickling in to replace us are \n     being diverted to go work with the new units that are part of \n     the surge. Since the replacements are not coming as quickly \n     as planned, I get to stay a little longer.\n       I've been in the Navy long enough to know that deployments \n     never end on time and that the plan changes right up until \n     the last minute so I am not too upset about it. More \n     importantly, I am surrounded by a great group of soldiers who \n     continue to amaze me with their bravery and discipline every \n     day. I wish you could see how well they perform in such \n     confusing and chaotic circumstances. You would be very proud \n     of them. As much as I want to come home to Katie and Kellogg \n     and family and friends, I will not quit this post until \n     properly relieved. These men deserve nothing less.\n       Thanks to those of you who have sent packages and cards and \n     emails. I have enough Gold Bond powder and baby wipes to stay \n     clean and dry for months. It has been a long haul but it has \n     meant a great deal to me to know that all of you are in my \n     corner. I am hoping to be back in Chicago in time to hoist a \n     green beer with some of you on Saint Patty's Day but, until \n     then, take care and Go Bears!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/08/senate-section/article/S2891-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                        Sergeant Richard L. Ford\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to speak in memory of U.S. Army SGT. \nRichard L. Ford, of East Hartford, CT. Last month, at the age of 40, he \ndied of combat wounds sustained in Iraq.\n  Sergeant Ford served with the Army's distinguished White Falcons \nparatrooper regiment, a unit with a reputation for speed and \nflexibility that dates back to 1917. ``Richard possessed all the \nqualities of a great paratrooper,'' said his commanding officer, LTC \nRichard Kim. Those qualities were evident in the city of Mosul in \nFebruary, 2005. There, Sergeant Ford faced enemy fire to help save his \nfellow soldiers, an act of physical courage for which he was awarded \nthe Army Commendation Medal with a ``V'' device for valor. His other \ndecorations included a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart.\n  But Sergeant Ford was even more remarkable for his moral courage, the \nway he embodied the ideals of our volunteer military. No one sent \nRichard Ford to Iraq--he chose to go. Three years ago, he left his post \nwith the Army National Guard to enter active duty. ``He went through \nbasic training again just to do what he wanted to do--become an \ninfantry soldier,'' said his friend, SFC Chris Beloff. ``Anyone who \ndoes all that I have the utmost respect for, because he really believed \nin what he was doing.'' Sergeant Ford willingly left his loved ones and \nrisked his life for his beliefs; few of us can say the same.\n  The time away from his family must have hurt him the most. Even when \nhe was stationed at Fort Bragg, NC, Sergeant Ford would drive for 12 \nhours back to Connecticut on weekends to be with his father, Mason, and \nhis 11-year-old son, Michael Patrick. Shortly after Sergeant Ford's \ndeath, Michael called his father his ``biggest hero.'' Nothing can \nreplace him in the lives of those he loved, but they can be proud that \ntheir hero fought bravely and served selflessly.\n  We owe him a debt beyond payment. But I pledge to keep his memory \nfresh and to add my voice to the prayers of his family. To his father \nand son; to his brothers, Matthew Ford, and Mason Ford, Jr.; to his \nsister, Vanessa Migliore; and to his grandmother, Marjorie Gordon--I \noffer my deepest sympathy. And to this soldier who lost his life in our \nNation's service, I swear my highest respect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/08/senate-section/article/S2891-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to inform \nall Senators and their staffs of an exhibit of photographs to \ncommemorate International Women's Day, March 8, which is sponsored by \nthe U.S. Agency for International Development. The exhibit, entitled \n``Women Transforming Development,'' highlights the critical roles women \nplay in development and USAID's efforts to support women's equality and \nempowerment.\n  For more than three decades, USAID has worked to improve women's \nlives in the world's poorest countries. Where women are educated, the \nhealth and economic prospects of their families improve. Where women \nparticipate politically, democracy is strengthened. In the wake of \nconflict, women play a central role in the survival of their children \nand the rebuilding of their communities.\n  ``Women Transforming Development'' will be displayed in the Rotunda \nof the Russell Senate Building from March 7 through 16, 2007. The \npowerful images in the exhibit illustrate women's contributions to \neconomic development, peace and security, democracy, investments in \npeople, and humanitarian assistance in all regions of the world. They \ninclude images of USAID's work in Bangladesh, Mozambique, Ecuador, \nUkraine, and Senegal.\n  These photographs remind us of the injustice, discrimination, and \nhardship that women and girls of every nationality suffer daily. Young \nwomen are targeted and murdered in Juarez, Mexico, and in Guatemala. \nWomen in countries like Peru, Chad, and Nepal are often treated like \nbeasts of burden, spending much of their day carrying heavy loads of \nwater and firewood. Domestic abuse is endemic in most countries, and in \nsome, like Pakistan and Afghanistan, women who are raped are in danger \nof being imprisoned and beaten under laws that punish the victim.\n  The global statistics are sobering. According to USAID, two-thirds of \nthe 876 million illiterate adults worldwide are women. Two-thirds of \nthe world's 125 million school-aged children who do not attend school \nare girls, and girls are less likely to finish school than boys. \nSeventy percent of the 1.3 billion people living in poverty around the \nworld are women and children. Each year more than 500,000 women die \nduring childbirth and pregnancy. The vast majority of those deaths \ncould be prevented with basic reproductive health services. And more \nthan three-quarters of the world's 27 million refugees are women and \nchildren.\n  Yet at the same time, the photographs in this exhibit also depict \nwomen as strong leaders and participants in standing up for their \nrights and transforming their societies.\n  With Congress's support, USAID is working to improve women's equality \nand empowerment not only because it is just, but also because it is \nnecessary for successful development. For example, in addition to \nimplementing programs totaling hundreds of millions of dollars in the \nworld's poorest countries to improve maternal and reproductive health, \n67 percent of USAID's basic education programs focus on girls' \neducation. Nearly one-third of the people receiving USAID-supported \nbusiness development services are women. Last year, USAID provided $27 \nmillion to support antitrafficking activities in 30 countries. USAID \nassisted in the development of legislation against domestic violence, \nsexual harassment, and trafficking in persons in several countries.\n  These are important efforts that need to be expanded. Women and men \ntogether must embrace these goals.\n  I encourage all Senators and their staffs to visit the exhibit and \nshare in this powerful celebration of International Women's Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/08/senate-section/article/S2891-3", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2891-S2892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               HEAD START\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to commend and support \nmy colleagues on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee \nfor the hard work on the Head Start reauthorization bill.\n  I would particularly like to thank Senators Dodd and Harkin for \nincluding important language in the bill regarding childhood obesity \nprevention as part of Head Start. Obesity is a serious health concern, \nespecially in West Virginia where 64 percent of adults in West Virginia \nare overweight or at risk of becoming overweight. An even more alarming \nstatistic, however, is that 28 percent of low-income children between \nthe ages of 2 and 5 are already overweight. Furthermore, overweight \nchildren have a 70 percent chance of remaining overweight into their \nadulthood. Obesity in children is usually caused by lack of physical \nactivity, unhealthy eating patterns, or a combination of the two.\n  If Head Start can play a role in preventing obesity in children and \nfamilies, it will be a real achievement, and I strongly believe Head \nStart can because of our experience in West Virginia.\n  In December 2004, a pilot program designed by Amy Requa, Head Start \nhealth specialist, and Dr. Linda Carson, director of the West Virginia \nMotor Development Center, West Virginia University was initiated in \nHead\n\n[[Page S2892]]\n\nStart Region III, which includes West Virginia. The program, known as \n``I Am Moving, I Am Learning,'' is designed to prevent and reverse \nobesity among children enrolled in Head Start by integrating physical \nactivity and wise nutrition choices in their daily life and promoting \ngeneral good fitness habits.\n  According to the Surgeon General, children should exercise for at \nleast 60 minutes per day. ``I Am Moving, I Am Learning'' is designed to \nimprove the quality and quantity of exercise performed by children by \nincorporating it into daily classroom routines. After the first year of \nthe pilot program, results showed that Head Start participants were \nless sedentary and able to meet the daily exercise requirement, in \naddition to being able to move with more intensity over longer periods \nof time.\n  The benefits of ``I Am Moving, I Am Learning'' do not end at the \nclassroom. Because the risk of overweight children becoming overweight \nadults increases when one or more parent is obese, participants are \nencouraged to extend their healthy physical activity and food choices \nto the home. ``I Am Moving, I Am Learning'' is also not an isolated \nprogram; it is easily integrated with other community programs \ntargeting childhood obesity and family wellness.\n  Overall the results after the first year of the ``I Am Moving, I Am \nLearning'' show remarkable success. Children enrolled in the initiative \nshowed moderate improvement in body-mass index scores, indicating that \nthey were at healthier weights than at the start of the program. Due to \nits success, starting this year ``I Am Moving, I Am Learning'' is \nextending into Delaware, Pennsylvania, and California.\n  The goal of Head Start is ``to bring about a greater degree of social \ncompetence in the young children of low-income families.'' ``I Am \nMoving, I Am Learning'' succeeds in complementing this by creating \npositive self-esteem among children by removing the depression and \nsocial discrimination associated with obesity.\n  Adding incentives for Head Start agencies to add prevention of \nchildhood obesity is an important improvement. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to ensure that the Head Start program is \nreauthorized during this Congress. It was neglected in the past, and we \nshould be sure to review and strengthen our basic programs, such as \nHead Start.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/08/senate-section/article/S2892-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2892-S2895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. BIDEN.

The chairman, in \n     consultation with the ranking member, may also propose \n     special procedures to govern the consideration of particular \n     matters by the committee.\n       (f) Closed Sessions.--Each meeting of the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations, or any subcommittee thereof, including \n     meetings to conduct hearings, shall be open to the public, \n     except that a meeting or series of meetings by the committee \n     or a subcommittee on the same subject for a period of no more \n     than fourteen calendar days may be closed to the public on a \n     motion made and seconded to go into closed session to discuss \n     only whether the matters enumerated in paragraphs (1) through \n     (6) would require the meeting to be closed followed \n     immediately by a record vote in open session by a majority of \n     the members of the committee or subcommittee when it is \n     determined that the matters to be discussed or the testimony \n     to be taken at such meeting or meetings--\n       (1) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in \n     the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct \n     of the foreign relations of the United States;\n       (2) will relate solely to matters of committee staff \n     personnel or internal staff management or procedure;\n       (3) will tend to charge an individual with crime or \n     misconduct; to disgrace or injure the professional standing \n     of an individual, or otherwise to expose an individual to \n     public contempt or obloquy, or will represent a clearly \n     unwarranted invasion of the privacy of an individual;\n       (4) will disclose the identity of any informer or law \n     enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating \n     to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense \n     that is required to be kept secret in the interests of \n     effective law enforcement;\n       (5) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets \n     or financial or commercial information pertaining \n     specifically to a given person if--\n       (A) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept \n     confidential by government officers and employees; or\n       (B) the information has been obtained by the government on \n     a confidential basis, other than through an application by \n     such person for a specific government financial or other \n     benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to \n     prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such \n     person, or\n       (6) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential \n     under other provisions of law or government regulations.\n       A closed meeting may be opened by a majority vote of the \n     committee.\n       (g) Staff Attendance.--A member of the committee may have \n     one member of his or her personal staff, for whom that member \n     assumes personal responsibility, accompany and be seated \n     nearby at committee meetings.\n       Each member of the committee may designate members of his \n     or her personal staff, who hold a top secret security \n     clearance, for the purpose of their eligibility to attend \n     closed sessions of the committee, subject to the same \n     conditions set forth for committee staff under Rules 12, 13, \n     and 14.\n       In addition, the majority leader and the minority leader of \n     the Senate, if they are not otherwise members of the \n     committee, may designate one member of their staff with a top \n     secret security clearance to attend closed sessions of the \n     committee, subject to the same conditions set forth for \n     committee staff under Rules 12, 13, and 14. Staff of other \n     Senators who are not members of the committee may not \n     attend closed sessions of the committee.\n       Attendance of committee staff at meetings shall be limited \n     to those designated by the staff director or the minority \n     staff director.\n       The committee, by majority vote, or the chairman, with the \n     concurrence of the ranking member, may limit staff attendance \n     at specified meetings.\n\n\n                            RULE 4--QUORUMS\n\n       (a) Testimony.--For the purpose of taking sworn or unsworn \n     testimony at any duly scheduled meeting a quorum of the \n     committee and each subcommittee thereof shall consist of one \n     member.\n       (b) Business.--A quorum for the transaction of committee or \n     subcommittee business, other than for reporting a measure or \n     recommendation to the Senate or the taking of testimony, \n     shall consist of one-third of the members of the committee or \n     subcommittee, including at least one member from each party.\n       (c) Reporting.--A majority of the membership of the \n     committee, including at least one member from each party, \n     shall constitute a quorum for reporting any measure or \n     recommendation to the Senate. No measure or recommendation \n     shall be ordered reported from the committee unless a \n     majority of the committee members is physically present, and \n     a majority of those present concurs.\n\n\n                            RULE 5--PROXIES\n\n       Proxies must be in writing with the signature of the absent \n     member. Subject to the requirements of Rule 4 for the \n     physical presence of a quorum to report a matter, proxy \n     voting shall be allowed on all measures and matters before \n     the committee. However, proxies shall not be voted on a \n     measure or matter except when the absent member has been \n     informed of the matter on which he is being recorded and has \n     affirmatively requested that he or she be so recorded.\n\n\n                           RULE 6--WITNESSES\n\n       (a) General.--The Committee on Foreign Relations will \n     consider requests to testify on any matter or measure pending \n     before the committee.\n       (b) Presentation.--If the chairman so determines, the oral \n     presentation of witnesses shall be limited to 10 minutes. \n     However, written statements of reasonable length may be \n     submitted by witnesses and other interested persons who are \n     unable to testify in person.\n       (c) Filing of Statements.--A witness appearing before the \n     committee, or any subcommittee thereof, shall file a written \n     statement of his proposed testimony at least 48 hours prior \n     to his appearance, unless this requirement is waived by the \n     chairman and the ranking member following their determination \n     that there is good cause for failure to file such a \n     statement. Witnesses appearing on behalf of the executive \n     branch shall provide an additional 100 copies of their \n     statement to the committee.\n       (d) Expenses.--Only the chairman may authorize expenditures \n     of funds for the expenses of witnesses appearing before the \n     committee or its subcommittees.\n       (e) Requests.--Any witness called for a hearing may submit \n     a written request to the chairman no later than 24 hours in \n     advance for his testimony to be in closed or open session, or \n     for any other unusual procedure. The chairman shall determine \n     whether to grant any such request and shall notify the \n     committee members of the request and of his decision.\n\n\n                           RULE 7--SUBPOENAS\n\n       (a) Authorization.--The chairman or any other member of the \n     committee, when authorized by a majority vote of the \n     committee at a meeting or by proxies, shall have authority to \n     subpoena the attendance of witnesses or the production of \n     memoranda, documents, records, or any other materials. At the \n     request of any member of the committee, the committee shall \n     authorize the issuance of a subpoena only at a meeting of the \n     committee. When the committee authorizes a subpoena, it may \n     be issued upon the signature of the chairman or any other \n     member designated by the committee.\n       (b) Return.--A subpoena, or a request to an agency, for \n     documents may be issued whose return shall occur at a time \n     and place other than that of a scheduled committee meeting. A \n     return on such a subpoena or request which is incomplete or \n     accompanied by an objection constitutes good cause for a \n     hearing on shortened notice. Upon such a return, the chairman \n     or any other member designated by him may convene a hearing \n     by giving 2 hours, notice by telephone to all other members. \n     One member shall constitute a quorum for such a hearing. The \n     sole purpose of such a hearing shall be to elucidate further \n     information about the return and to rule on the objection.\n       (c) Depositions.--At the direction of the committee, staff \n     is authorized to take depositions from witnesses.\n\n\n                            RULE 8--REPORTS\n\n       (a) Filing.--When the committee has ordered a measure or \n     recommendation reported, the report thereon shall be filed in \n     the Senate at the earliest practicable time.\n       (b) Supplemental, Minority and Additional Views. A member \n     of the committee who gives notice of his intentions to file \n     supplemental, minority, or additional views at the time of \n     final committee approval of a measure or matter, shall be \n     entitled to not less than 3 calendar days in which to file \n     such views, in writing, with the chief clerk of the \n     committee, with the 3 days to begin at 11:00 p.m. on the same \n     day that the committee has ordered a measure or matter \n     reported. Such views shall then be included in the committee \n     report and printed in the same volume, as a part thereof, and \n     their inclusion shall be noted on the cover of the report. In \n     the absence of timely notice, the committee report may be \n     filed and printed immediately without such views.\n       (c) Rollcall Votes.--The results of all rollcall votes \n     taken in any meeting of the committee on any measure, or \n     amendment thereto, shall be announced in the committee \n     report. The announcement shall include a tabulation of the \n     votes cast in favor and votes cast in opposition to each \n     such measure and amendment by each member of the \n     committee.\n\n\n                            rule 9--treaties\n\n       (a) The committee is the only committee of the Senate with \n     jurisdiction to review and\n\n[[Page S2894]]\n\n     report to the Senate on treaties submitted by the President \n     for Senate advice and consent to ratification. Because the \n     House of Representatives has no role in the approval of \n     treaties, the committee is therefore the only congressional \n     committee with responsibility for treaties.\n       (b) Once submitted by the President for advice and consent, \n     each treaty is referred to the committee and remains on its \n     calendar from Congress to Congress until the committee takes \n     action to report it to the Senate or recommend its return to \n     the President, or until the committee is discharged of the \n     treaty by the Senate.\n       (c) In accordance with Senate Rule XXX.2, treaties which \n     have been reported to the Senate but not acted on before the \n     end of a Congress ``shall be resumed at the commencement of \n     the next Congress as if no proceedings had previously been \n     had thereon.''\n       (d) Insofar as possible, the committee should conduct a \n     public hearing on each treaty as soon as possible after its \n     submission by the President. Except in extraordinary \n     circumstances, treaties reported to the Senate shall be \n     accompanied by a written report.\n\n\n                          rule 10--nominations\n\n       (a) Waiting Requirement.--Unless otherwise directed by the \n     chairman and the ranking member, the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations shall not consider any nomination until 6 calendar \n     days after it has been formally submitted to the Senate.\n       (b) Public Consideration.--Nominees for any post who are \n     invited to appear before the committee shall be heard in \n     public session, unless a majority of the committee decrees \n     otherwise, consistent with Rule 3(f).\n       (c) Required Data.--No nomination shall be reported to the \n     Senate unless (1) the nominee has been accorded a security \n     clearance on the basis of a thorough investigation by \n     executive branch agencies; (2) the nominee has filed a \n     financial disclosure report and a related ethics undertaking \n     with the committee; (3) the committee has been assured that \n     the nominee does not have any interests which could conflict \n     with the interests of the government in the exercise of the \n     nominee's proposed responsibilities; (4) for persons \n     nominated to be chief of mission, ambassador-at-large, or \n     minister, the committee has received a complete list of any \n     contributions made by the nominee or members of his immediate \n     family to any Federal election campaign during the year of \n     his or her nomination and for the 4 preceding years; and (5) \n     for persons nominated to be chiefs of mission, the report \n     required by Section 304(a)(4) of the Foreign Service Act of \n     1980 on the demonstrated competence of that nominee to \n     perform the duties of the position to which he or she has \n     been nominated.\n\n\n                            rule 11--travel\n\n       (a) Foreign Travel.--No member of the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations or its staff shall travel abroad on committee \n     business unless specifically authorized by the chairman, who \n     is required by law to approve vouchers and report \n     expenditures of foreign currencies, and the ranking member. \n     Requests for authorization of such travel shall state the \n     purpose and, when completed, a full substantive and financial \n     report shall be filed with the committee within 30 days. This \n     report shall be furnished to all members of the committee and \n     shall not be otherwise disseminated without authorization of \n     the chairman or the ranking member. Except in extraordinary \n     circumstances, staff travel shall not be approved unless the \n     reporting requirements have been fulfilled for all prior \n     trips. Except for travel that is strictly personal, travel \n     funded by non-U.S. Government sources is subject to the same \n     approval and substantive reporting requirements as U.S. \n     Government-funded travel. In addition, members and staff are \n     reminded to consult the Senate Code of Conduct, and, as \n     appropriate, the Senate Select Committee on Ethics, in the \n     case of travel sponsored by non-U.S. Government sources.\n       Any proposed travel by committee staff for a subcommittee \n     purpose must be approved by the subcommittee chairman and \n     ranking member prior to submission of the request to the \n     chairman and ranking member of the full committee.\n       (b) Domestic Travel.--All official travel in the United \n     States by the committee staff shall be approved in advance by \n     the staff director, or in the case of minority staff, by the \n     minority staff director.\n       (c) Personal Staff.--As a general rule, no more than one \n     member of the personal staff of a member of the committee may \n     travel with that member with the approval of the chairman and \n     the ranking member of the committee. During such travel, the \n     personal staff member shall be considered to be an employee \n     of the committee.\n       (d) Personal Representatives of the Member (PRM).--For the \n     purposes of this rule regarding staff foreign travel, the \n     officially-designated personal representative of the member \n     (PRM) shall be deemed to have the same rights, duties, and \n     responsibilities as members of the staff of the committee on \n     Foreign Relations. Furthermore, for the purposes of this \n     section, each member of the committee may designate one \n     personal staff member as the ``Personal Representative of the \n     Member.''\n\n\n                          RULE 12--TRANSCRIPTS\n\n       (a) General.--The Committee on Foreign Relations shall keep \n     verbatim transcripts of all committee and subcommittee \n     meetings and such transcripts shall remain in the custody of \n     the committee, unless a majority of the committee decides \n     otherwise. Transcripts of public hearings by the committee \n     shall be published unless the chairman, with the concurrence \n     of the ranking member, determines otherwise.\n       (b) Classified or Restricted Transcripts.--\n       (1) The chief clerk of the committee shall have \n     responsibility for the maintenance and security of classified \n     or restricted transcripts, and shall ensure that such \n     transcripts are handled in a manner consistent with the \n     requirements of the United States Senate Security Manual.\n       (2) A record shall be maintained of each use of classified \n     or restricted transcripts as required by the Senate Security \n     Manual.\n       (3) Classified transcripts may not leave the committee \n     offices, or S-407 of the Capitol, except for the purpose of \n     declassification.\n       (4) Extreme care shall be exercised to avoid taking notes \n     or quotes from classified transcripts. Their contents may not \n     be divulged to any unauthorized person.\n       (5) Subject to any additional restrictions imposed by the \n     chairman with the concurrence of the ranking member, only the \n     following persons are authorized to have access to classified \n     or restricted transcripts.\n       (A) Members and staff of the committee in the committee \n     offices or in S-407 of the Capitol;\n       (B) Designated personal representatives of members of the \n     committee, and of the majority and minority leaders, with \n     appropriate security clearances, in the committee offices or \n     in S-407 of the Capitol;\n       (C) Senators not members of the committee, by permission of \n     the chairman, in the committee offices or in S-407 of the \n     Capitol; and\n       (D) Officials of the executive departments involved in the \n     meeting, in the committee offices or S-407 of the Capitol.\n       (6) Any restrictions imposed upon access to a meeting of \n     the committee shall also apply to the transcript of such \n     meeting, except by special permission of the chairman and \n     ranking member.\n       (7) In addition to restrictions resulting from the \n     inclusion of any classified information in the transcript of \n     a committee meeting, members and staff shall not discuss with \n     anyone the proceedings of the committee in closed session or \n     reveal information conveyed or discussed in such a session \n     unless that person would have been permitted to attend the \n     session itself, or unless such communication is specifically \n     authorized by the chairman, the ranking member, or in the \n     case of staff, by the staff director or minority staff \n     director. A record shall be kept of all such authorizations.\n       (c) Declassification.\n       (1) All noncurrent records of the committee are governed \n     Rule XI of the Standing Rules of the Senate and by S. Res. \n     474 (96th Congress). Any classified transcripts transferred \n     to the National Archives and Records Administration under \n     Rule XI may not be made available for public use unless they \n     have been subject to declassification review in accordance \n     with applicable laws or Executive orders.\n       (2) Any transcript or classified committee report, or any \n     portion thereof, may be declassified, in accordance with \n     applicable laws or Executive orders, sooner than the time \n     period provided for under S. Res. 474 if:\n       (A) the chairman originates such action, with the \n     concurrence of the ranking member;\n       (B) the other current members of the committee who \n     participated in the meeting who participated in such meeting \n     or report have been notified of the proposed \n     declassification, and have not objected thereto, except that \n     the committee by majority vote may overrule any objections \n     thereby raised to early declassification; and\n       (C) the executive departments that participated in the \n     meeting or originated the classified information have been \n     consulted and consented to the declassification.\n\n\n                    RULE 13--CLASSIFIED INFORMATION\n\n       (a) The handling of classified information in the Senate is \n     governed by S. Res. 243 (100th Congress), which established \n     the Office of Senate Security. All handling of classified \n     information by the committee shall be consistent with the \n     procedures set forth in the United States Senate Security \n     Manual issued by the Office of Senate Security.\n       (b) The chief clerk is the security manager for the \n     committee. The chief clerk shall be responsible for \n     implementing the provisions of the Senate Security Manual and \n     for serving as the committee liaison to the Office of Senate \n     Security. The staff director, in consultation with the \n     minority staff director, may appoint an alternate security \n     manager as circumstances warrant.\n       (c) Classified material may only be transported between \n     Senate offices by appropriately cleared staff members who \n     have been specifically authorized to do so by the security \n     manager.\n       (d) In general, Senators and staff undertake to confine \n     their access to classified information on the basis of a \n     ``need to know'' such information related to their committee \n     responsibilities.\n       (e) The staff director is authorized to make such \n     administrative regulations as may be necessary to carry out \n     the provisions of this rule.\n\n\n                             RULE 14--STAFF\n\n       (a) Responsibilities.--\n       (1) The staff works for the committee as a whole, under the \n     general supervision of the chairman of the committee, and the \n     immediate direction of the staff director, except\n\n[[Page S2895]]\n\n     that such part of the staff as is designated minority staff, \n     shall be under the general supervision of the ranking member \n     and under the immediate direction of the minority staff \n     director.\n       (2) Any member of the committee should feel free to call \n     upon the staff at any time for assistance in connection with \n     committee business. Members of the Senate not members of the \n     committee who call upon the staff for assistance from time to \n     time should be given assistance subject to the overriding \n     responsibility of the staff to the committee.\n       (3) The staff's primary responsibility is with respect to \n     bills, resolutions, treaties, and nominations.\n       In addition to carrying out assignments from the committee \n     and its individual members, the staff has a responsibility to \n     originate suggestions for committee or subcommittee \n     consideration. The staff also has a responsibility to make \n     suggestions to individual members regarding matters of \n     special interest to such members.\n       (4) It is part of the staff's duty to keep itself as well \n     informed as possible in regard to developments affecting \n     foreign relations and in regard to the administration of \n     foreign programs of the United States. Significant trends or \n     developments which might otherwise escape notice should be \n     called to the attention of the committee, or of individual \n     Senators with particular interests.\n       (5) The staff shall pay due regard to the constitutional \n     separation of powers between the Senate and the executive \n     branch. It therefore has a responsibility to help the \n     committee bring to bear an independent, objective judgment of \n     proposals by the executive branch and when appropriate to \n     originate sound proposals of its own. At the same time, the \n     staff shall avoid impinging upon the day-to-day conduct of \n     foreign affairs.\n       (6) In those instances when committee action requires the \n     expression of minority views, the staff shall assist the \n     minority as fully as the majority to the end that all points \n     of view may be fully considered by members of the committee \n     and of the Senate. The staff shall bear in mind that under \n     our constitutional system it is the responsibility of the \n     elected members of the Senate to determine legislative issues \n     in the light of as full and fair a presentation of the facts \n     as the staff may be able to obtain.\n       (b) Restrictions.--\n       (1) The staff shall regard its relationship to the \n     committee as a privileged one, in the nature of the \n     relationship of a lawyer to a client. In order to protect \n     this relationship and the mutual confidence which must \n     prevail if the committee-staff relationship is to be a \n     satisfactory and fruitful one, the following criteria shall \n     apply:\n       (A) members of the staff shall not be identified with any \n     special interest group in the field of foreign relations or \n     allow their names to be used by any such group;\n       (B) members of the staff shall not accept public speaking \n     engagements or write for publication in the field of foreign \n     relations without specific advance permission from the staff \n     director, or, in the case of minority staff, from the \n     minority staff director.

Mr. President, I want to recognize Guardian Industries, \nwhich is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year. Guardian has been \na leader in the glass, building, and automotive parts manufacturing \nindustries and an important contributor to Michigan's economy for many \nyears.\n  Guardian Industries was established in 1932 as Guardian Glass \nCompany. What began as a small windshield fabrication business in \nDetroit, MI, grew to become a large-scale operation with the opening of \nits first float glass assembly plant in 1970. Since then, Guardian has \nbuilt or acquired numerous fabrication plants throughout the world and \ndiversified its business through the purchase and development of new \ntechnologies and methods of production.\n  Over the years, Guardian Industries has steadily grown to become one \nof the world's chief manufacturers of float glass and fabricated glass \nproducts and the world's largest producer of mirrors. Guardian has also \nbecome a major player in the building materials and distribution \nbusiness and a leading supplier of exterior products to the automotive \nindustry.\n  During its 75 years of existence, Guardian Industries has made a \nsignificant contribution to Michigan's economy. With a global workforce \nof over 19,000 employees, including about 1,000 in southeast Michigan, \nGuardian has demonstrated its commitment to making Michigan's economy a \nleader in manufacturing and technological development. Guardian \nIndustries also plays an important role in community improvement \nthroughout southeastern Michigan. Through its awarding of scholarships \nto local students pursuing advanced degrees and its financial support \nof the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, Guardian has shown a commitment to \nstrengthening the fiber of community in Michigan.\n  I know my colleagues join me in commending the tremendous effort and \nhard work of the many employees of Guardian Industries over the years \nand wish them many more years of success and growth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/08/senate-section/article/S2895-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2895-S2897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             LATIN AMERICA\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, later today, President Bush will start on a \n6-day visit to five countries in the Western Hemisphere: Brazil, \nUruguay, Colombia, Guatemala, and Mexico.\n  The trip comes at an important time for the region and for U.S. \nrelations with our hemispheric neighbors. In an historic convergence, \nduring a 13-month period beginning in November 2005 and ending this \npast December, a dozen countries throughout Latin America and the \nCaribbean held Presidential elections. Those elections are a testament \nto the tremendous democratic strides made throughout the Americas \nduring the past two decades and saw governments elected to power that \nspan the ideological spectrum.\n  In many ways, the election results symbolize the important political, \neconomic, and social change occurring throughout the Americas. As many \nhave noted, the elections gave voice to a yearning across the \nhemisphere for social and economic development--a yearning among tens \nof millions of people for a better life. This is a welcome development \nand a challenge to all of us who wish to see the Americas continue down \na path of democracy with justice, because, while we should welcome this \ndemocratic call for change, we must recognize that hard and steady work \nlies ahead to make these hopes a reality.\n  That a desire for fundamental change has been expressed through the \nballot box is an enormous stride forward. Too often, change in the \nAmericas has occurred in an anti-democratic fashion. Those days must \npermanently be put to rest. All citizens of the Americas have a \nfundamental right to live in freedom and to express themselves through \nrobust democratic institutions.\n  That a desire for expanded prosperity has been given such clear voice \nraises the stakes. Governments must now do more to address the basic \nneeds and aspirations of their people in an effective, democratic, and \nsustainable way. A failure to fulfill the most basic functions of \ngovernment, and a failure to create the conditions in which tens of \nmillions across the Americas can realize their hopes and break free of \npoverty could undo these gains. The denial of opportunity is now the \nmost significant threat to the consolidation of democracy in the \nregion.\n  Unfortunately, the elections and this desire for change have occurred \nat a time when U.S. prestige and influence have fallen to depths not \nseen in at\n\n[[Page S2896]]\n\nleast a generation. As has been the case throughout the world, our \nstanding in the Americas has suffered as a result of the misguided \npolicies and actions of the Bush administration. It will take \nsignificant work to repair the damage wrought by 6 years of neglect and \nmismanagement of relations.\n  The United States can ill afford this deterioration of our standing. \nWith each passing day, we draw closer together to our neighbors to the \nsouth. This convergence creates new challenges, but it also opens the \ndoor to a more hopeful future. If we pay careful attention to \ndevelopments throughout the region and respond to them in a thoughtful \nand respectful way, then we can advance our many and varied national \ninterests at stake in the Americas.\n  I welcome the President's decision to travel to five important \ncountries in Latin America, and to reaffirm the importance of our \nrelationship with the more than 500 million people who live to our \nsouth. I am, however, disappointed that the President has fallen so \nshort in his promise to transform U.S. relations with the Americas. Our \nregional relationships cannot be properly attended to with one 6-day \ntrip, a series of photo opportunities, and some lofty rhetoric on \ncollaboration.\n  Nor does the Bush administration's declaration of 2007 as the year of \nengagement with the Americas suffice. One year of engagement out of \nseven is simply not good enough. In light of the Bush administration's \nwoeful record, creating false expectations does more harm than good. We \nmust be realistic about the challenges we face, and what we are doing \nto address them. We must devote our full time and our respectful \nattention to our relations within the hemisphere.\n  Earlier this week, President Bush spoke of a ``social justice'' \nagenda for the Americas. He was right to underscore the importance of \naddressing the basic needs of millions of our neighbors languishing in \npoverty. The primary responsibility for doing so, of course, lies with \nthe governments and societies throughout the hemisphere. Yet helping to \nlift people out of widespread poverty is in our interests, just as it \nis in accord with our values. When instability spreads to our south, \nour security and economic interests are at risk. When our neighbors \nsuffer, all of the Americas suffer.\n  The United States has an important role to play. Yet the President \nsends a mixed message when he makes his call for a social justice \nagenda after presenting the Congress with a budget for fiscal year 2008 \nthat, with the exception of HIV/AIDS funding, slashes both assistance \nfor economic development and health programs in the Americas. At a time \nwhen our standing in the hemisphere is so low, we cannot afford to send \nthis kind of message. Our commitment to justice in the Americas must be \nexpressed in more than one thoughtful expression in one pre-trip \nspeech. Our commitment must be matched by our deeds, not just our \nwords.\n  It is my hope that the President will break from his practice of \ntouting the importance of the Americas during his travels only to turn \nhis back upon his return.\n  Each stop on the President's trip presents an opportunity to move \nbeyond rhetoric, to renew relations in the hemisphere, and to set a new \ncourse for sustained followthrough in a way that advances important \nU.S. interests.\n  In Brazil, it has been reported that President Bush is expected to \njoin with President Inacio Lula de Silva to announce greater ethanol \ncooperation between the United States and Brazil. Together, the United \nStates and Brazil are the world's largest ethanol producers and \nconsumers. Brazil's more than 30 years of renewable fuel technology \ninvestments allowed it to achieve energy independence last year. \nEthanol now accounts for 40 percent of Brazil's fuel usage. More than \n80 percent of cars sold in Brazil today are flex-fuel vehicles capable \nof running on gasoline, ethanol, or a mixture thereof.\n  Greater Brazilian production of renewable fuels could boost \nsustainable economic development throughout Latin America and reshape \nthe geopolitics of energy in the hemisphere, reducing the oil-driven \ninfluence of Venezuela's Hugo Chavez. The more interhemispheric \nproduction and use of ethanol and other biofuels occurs, and the more \nsuch indigenously produced renewable fuels are used to replace fossil \nfuels, the better it is for our friends in the hemisphere.\n  As it relates to our country's drive toward energy independence, it \ndoes not serve our national and economic security to replace imported \noil with Brazilian ethanol. In other words, those who advocate \nreplacement of US-based biofuels production with Brazilian ethanol \nexports, however well intentioned they may be, are both \nmisunderstanding our long-term energy security challenge and ignoring a \nvaluable foreign policy opportunity. The U.S. needs to dramatically \nexpand domestic biofuels production, not embrace a short term fix that \ndiscourages investment in the expansion of the domestic renewable fuels \nin industry. Also, accelerating technology advances and transferring \nthe technology to our neighbors in the Caribbean and South America will \nhelp them employ their own resources to produce environmentally clean \nethanol to reduce their imported oil bill, thereby promoting economic \nstability in the Caribbean and South and Central America and strengthen \nthe U.S.-Brazil relationship.\n  It is vital that President Bush keeps the Congress involved each step \nforward in a U.S.-Brazil relationship based on renewable fuels. This \nrelationship must be structured so as not to hamper the domestic \nproduction of renewable fuels, or the development of new technologies \nhere at home that can enhance our energy security.\n  In Uruguay, President Bush has the opportunity to forge closer ties \nwith President Tabare Vazquez and to show that the United States is \nready, willing, and able to work productively with democratic-left \ngovernments. That this ability is in question and that it requires \nexplaining underscores how badly the President and his administration \nhave misunderstood and mismanaged the political, economic, and social \nchange occurring throughout the Americas. The United States is seen as \nsupporting democracy when it produces a desired result. It is vital to \nreverse that trend. I hope the President can begin that process, even \nif we have a long way to go.\n  The United States has invested a great deal--nearly $5 billion during \nthe past 7 years--to help stabilize Colombia. A more peaceful, just, \nand stable Colombia is undoubtedly in our national interest. It is \nimperative, however, that greater peace and stability contribute to a \nreduction in the flow of drugs from Colombia to the United States. Thus \nfar, we have not seen the kind of dropoff that the effective pursuit of \nour interests demands.\n  President Bush's closest ally in the region--Colombian President \nAlvaro Uribe--is embroiled in a controversy that has led to the arrest \nof eight of his supporters in the Colombian Congress and his former \nconfidant and former chief of Colombia's secret police for ties to the \ncountry's narco-terrorist paramilitaries. President Bush must be \ncareful to keep the pursuit of U.S. interests in Colombia distinct from \nspecific personalities, or personal relationships. The further \nconsolidation of legitimate governing institutions in Colombia--and the \nextension of their reach throughout Colombia are clearly in the \nnational interest of the United States, and the interest of Colombia.\n  Guatemala shares deep connections with the United States. Nearly 1 in \n10 Guatemalans now lives in the United States. Nearly $3 billion were \nremitted from the United States to Guatemala in 2005, representing \napproximately 10 percent of that country's gross domestic product. \nHaving emerged from decades of internal conflict that left as many as \n200,000 of its citizens dead, Guatemala finds itself struggling with a \nnew scourge of violence that is causing instability. Gang and drug-\nrelated criminal violence and the country's staggering levels of \npoverty pose enormous challenges--challenges that affect our country as \nwell. I am encouraged to see the Bush administration's new commitment \nto supporting a Central American regional approach to combat \ntransnational gangs. This initiative should incorporate the most \neffective techniques and practices from the United States and from \nthroughout the region. The United States must take the lead in rolling \nback the detrimental influence of these gangs in our own society and in \nCentral America.\n\n[[Page S2897]]\n\n  The relationship between the United States and Mexico is among our \nmost important in the world. Getting it right is vital to advancing our \ncore economic and security interests. To do that, a great deal of work \nneeds to be done. Mexico is making strong efforts to address the drug \ntrade and is working cooperatively with the United States on a number \nof security issues. But our complex relationship with Mexico has become \ncaptive to a single issue: the immigration debate in our country.\n  There is consensus that our immigration system is broken. It is past \ntime to fix it, and I am proud of my own support for a workable \nsolution. We need a comprehensive approach to illegal immigration that \nstops the flow of illegal immigrants across our borders, better manages \nimmigration flows going forward, and deals fairly with the illegal \nimmigrants already living and working in our country. A workable \nsolution will require bipartisan support, and I will work to build it. \nThe President has consistently voiced his support, for comprehensive \nimmigration reform. It is my hope that upon his return from Mexico he \nwill get to work, converting his words into deeds to help push \ncomprehensive immigration reform forward.\n  A great deal of work needs to be done. We need to restore U.S. \nrelations in the hemisphere. We need to consolidate the gains that have \nbeen made in the sweeping change of the last few years. We need to \nsustain our commitment to democracy, to social justice, and to \nopportunity for our neighbors to the south. The Western Hemisphere is \ntoo important to our core economic and security interests to be treated \nwith the neglect and mismanagement that have defined the past 6 years. \nIt is my hope that President Bush's trip marks the opening of a new \nchapter of cooperation and partnership a chapter of partnership with \nour neighbors to promote democracy with social and economic development \nfor the benefit of all of us who live in the Americas. It is time for \nthe United States to reclaim and renew its historic role as a leader in \nthe hemisphere and an example of hope for all who seek opportunity in \nthe Americas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/08/senate-section/article/S2897-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       HOT SPRINGS NATIONAL PARK\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, it is with the greatest pleasure \nthat today I honor Hot Springs National Park, which will soon be \ncelebrating its 175th anniversary. Hot Springs is a magical place which \nhas brought great distinction to my State because of its history and \nbecause of the allure it has held for generations of visitors.\n  On April 20, 1832, President Andrew Jackson and the U.S. Congress \nestablished Hot Springs Reservation in order to protect the 47 hot \nsprings flowing from the southwestern slope of Hot Springs Mountain. In \n1921, it was renamed Hot Springs National Park and became America's \n18th national park. Hot Springs remains the first protected area in the \nNation.\n  People have used the hot springs for more than 200 years to treat \nillnesses and to relax. The reservation eventually developed into a \nwell-known resort nicknamed, ``The American Spa,'' because it attracted \nnot only the wealthy but also indigent health seekers from around the \nworld. In fact, their motto was, ``We Bathe the World.''\n  Eight historic bathhouses make up ``Bathhouse Row'' with the Fordyce \nBathhouse housing the park's visitor center. The entire ``Bathhouse \nRow'' area is a National Historic Landmark District that contains the \ngrandest collection of bathhouses of its kind in North America. It was \nplaced on the National Register of Historic Places on November 13, \n1974.\n  On April 20, 2007, Hot Springs National Park and the Nation will \ncelebrate 175 years of preserving our natural resources. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in continuing to protect our great American \ntreasures, one of the greatest of which is Hot Springs National \nPark.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/08/senate-section/article/S2897-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               NATIONAL ENGINEERS FUTURE CITY COMPETITION\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Jake \nBowers, Emily Ponti, and Krisha Sherburne of St. Thomas More School in \nBaton Rouge, LA. They are the winners of the 2007 National Engineers \nFuture City Competition, and I would like to take a moment to recognize \nthese talented students in their tireless effort.\n  Starting in September, 30,000 entrants from 1,000 schools began \nacross the country working on their future cities for the National \nEngineers Future City Competition under the guidance of professional \nengineers in their local communities. In January the entrants were \nnarrowed down to 105 students from 35 schools to go to the nationals in \nWashington, DC. St. Thomas More School was one of these talented groups \nto be chosen.\n  This hard-working group presented their future city of Mwinda in the \nCongo Republic with the guidance of their teacher Mrs. Shirley Newman, \ntheir engineer mentor Mr. Guy Macarios, and the help of Mr. Eric Ponti. \nThe future city design featured renewable energy resources to power the \ncity and hydrogen-powered hover cars and buses to transport citizens \naround the city. St. Thomas More has made it to the nationals in this \ncompetition for the fourth time and is their second national win.\n  I applaud the students from St. Thomas More School for this great \nhonor and wish them continued success in their academic career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/08/senate-section/article/S2897-3", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/08/senate-section/article/S2897-4", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting nominations \nwhich were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/08/senate-section/article/S2897-5", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  The following message from the President of the United States was \ntransmitted to the Senate:\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/08/senate-section/article/S2897-6", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO \n             IRAN THAT WAS DECLARED ON MARCH 15, 1995--PM 9\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A bill to provide grants to recruit new teachers, principals, \nand other school leaders to, and retain and support current and \nreturning teachers, principals, and other school leaders employed in, \npublic elementary and public secondary schools, and to help higher \neducation, in areas impacted by Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Rita, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as my State and the rest of the Gulf \nCoast work to get back on their feet and rebuild their lives and their \ncommunities, we look to the future. We look forward to stronger levees, \na more responsive FEMA, a better medical system, and a better school \nsystem. We look to our children--because they are the future--and we \nare striving to build the best school system in the country. We are in \nthe middle of a remarkable period in Louisiana--and our schools are at \nthe center. Our schools are re-opening and developing in new and \ninnovative ways. There is a wonderful partnership with our institutions \nof higher learning, who are throwing themselves into not only \nrebuilding themselves but into standing up this new school system.\n  But key to this new school system are the people who make it work day \nafter day--our teachers, our principals, our aides--and it is vital \nthat we recruit, retain, and maintain all of the excellent individuals \nwho are dedicated to our children and the future.\n  That is why, today, I am so very proud to introduce the Landrieu-\nKennedy-Reid RENEWAAL Act of 2007.\n  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita not only damaged or destroyed 840 schools \nin Louisiana, but dozens more throughout the Gulf Coast. As the 176,000 \ndisplaced elementary and secondary school students and their families \nbegin to return, what was a need to rebuild these schools and bring in \nnew teachers has become an emergency. The RENEWAAL Act will help solve \na significant crisis in New Orleans--there are simply not enough \ntalented teachers in the city to educate the 29,000 children the system \nmust serve. In January, the New Orleans Recovery School District was \nforced to ``wait-list'' 300 students, in large part because they simply \ncould not find or encourage enough teachers to come to the region to \nteach them.\n  As the region continues to struggle and to grow, so will the need to \nbring more teachers to the Gulf Coast. The Louisiana Recovery Authority \nestimates that 12,000 teachers were displaced by Hurricane Katrina. \nPublic\n\n[[Page S2901]]\n\nschools in New Orleans will need an additional 750 teachers by fall \n2007 to accommodate the daily surge in enrollment. Some of the \ndistrict's high schools have student-to-teacher ratios surpassing 36 to \n1. Jefferson Parish currently has a shortage of about 60 teachers. \nParishes like St. Bernard and Cameron have managed to hold down \nstudent-to-teacher ratios only because they've increased the local tax \nburden on an already stretched population to the breaking point, even \nthough just a small portion of their schools have reopened. The future \nof the Gulf Coast lies in the rebuilding of its middle class; the \nfuture of the middle class in any community is in its schools.\n  The RENEWAAL Act provides up to $254 million over 5 years in salary \nsupplements, housing assistance and loan forgiveness for certified \nelementary and secondary school teachers and leaders who commit to \nserving the Hurricane Katrina and Rita affected areas for a minimum of \n3 years. The Act provides annual salary bonuses starting at $7,000 per \nyear for teachers and leaders, increasing with experience, a proven \ntrack record of success in an urban district or use the opportunity to \nreturn to their home district to help. RENEWAAL also provides student \nloan forgiveness of up to $7000 per year and housing assistance of up \nto $750 per month.\n\n  These incentives are necessary to help offset the dramatic cost of \nliving increases that are a reality in the Gulf region right now. The \nstarting salary for a Recovery School District teacher is $35,400 per \nyear, slightly below the state's median income of $37,400. The average \nrent in New Orleans parish has increased more than 40 percent in 1 \nyear--so much so that, currently, a Recovery School District teacher in \nNew Orleans would spend 40-50 percent of his or her monthly pre-tax \nincome on rent. The average student loan debt of the 60 percent of \nLouisiana students who graduate with student loan debt is over $17,000. \nThe combination of these financial burdens and the increased cost of \nliving make it impossible for some young people to put their \nconsiderable time and energy into rebuilding the Gulf Coast, even if \nthey once called it home. The incentives provided in the RENEWAAL Act \nwould give them the support they need to serve.\n  The bill also recognizes the unique role and the unique challenges \nHurricane Katrina and Rita impacted colleges and universities have in \nrebuilding our Gulf communities. Over 84,000 students were displaced in \nLouisiana as a result of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. RENEWAAL provides \n$500 million of funds to attract additional students to and retain \nfaculty at Louisiana's institutions of higher education. Colleges and \nuniversities suffering significant revenue gaps from decreased \nenrollment and repair costs would receive the help they need continue \ntheir missions. Our higher education system has long been the creative \nand professional life blood of New Orleans and the region, as the \ninstitutions directly impacted by the storms have trained hundreds of \nthousands of young professionals and entrepreneurs who use their skills \nto strengthen cities and towns along the Gulf Coast and nationwide.\n  I'd like to thank Congressman Charles Melancon and Congressman George \nMiller and their staffs for their hard work with us on this bill, \nculminating in its introduction as companion legislation in the House \nof Representatives. This bill is the latest example of their tireless \ndedication to supporting the children, families and students of the \nGulf Coast as we continue to work together to bring the people of \nLouisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Texas home.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 808\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a laboratory science pilot program at the \nNational Science Foundation; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill \ndesigned to improve the science learning experience for students in \nlow-income and rural school across the country. Investing in education \nis about investing in our future. Today's young people will be facing a \nnew world when they enter the workforce--a world that is globally \nintegrated and where technology has transformed the boundaries of human \ncapital so that our tax forms, blueprints, and x-rays can all be \nanalyzed halfway around the world. The greatest asset we have in this \ncountry is our collective intellect, and the Nation's competitive \nfuture will depend on us nurturing the intellect of the next generation \nof Americans.\n  In order to be competitive in the coming decades, we need to ensure \nthat we have given our students the tools to be successful in science, \nengineering, mathematics, and technology. The America COMPETES Act, S. \n761, which I was proud to join with my colleagues in introducing \nearlier this week, helps provide these tools at all levels of our \neducational system, from kindergarten through graduate school and \nbeyond. Unfortunately, I am concerned that we may not be paying enough \nattention to those students that are already in the greatest danger of \nnot reaping the full benefits of America's innovation future, such as \nminorities, women, and students in low-income or rural schools.\n  For example, according to the National Science Foundation, only 7 \npercent of our scientists and engineers are Hispanic, African-American, \nor Native-American, despite the fact that they make up 24 percent of \nthe total population. A minority scientist is also far less likely to \nachieve a post-graduate degree. By 2020, one-quarter of the Nation's \nschoolchildren will be Hispanic, and another 14 percent will be \nAfrican-American. That's 40 percent of our precious human capital, and \nwe can not neglect that tremendous resource when we talk about \nimproving our competitiveness for the future. No business could afford \nto leave 40 percent of its capital sitting idle, and neither can the \nUnited States.\n  That's why I offered an amendment during last year's Energy Committee \nmarkup of science and technology competitiveness legislation--an \namendment that has made it into the America COMPETES Act--which will \ncreate a series of outreach programs designed to get more minority \nelementary and secondary students excited about science, to increase \ntheir interest in entering these fields that will be such a crucial \npart of our economic future. A program like this called Hispanic \nEngineering Science and Technology Week (HESTEC) has been operating \nvery successful for the past few years as the University of Texas--Pan \nAmerican, and I hope to see that success replicated throughout the \nnation.\n  But these types of programs are only one part of getting students \nhooked on science. We can spend all the time in the world telling \nstudents how exciting it is to be a scientist, but unless we actually \nlet them experience that excitement--unless we let them discover the \njoy of scientific discovery first-hand-we will still lose them. And \nthat is the job of the science laboratory class. A well-designed, well-\nequipped, well-staffed high school laboratory can be an incredibly \ninvigorating and illuminating experience for a student. It can teach \nthem far more about scientific principles than they can learn from a \nbook or in a lecture, and more importantly, it teaches them the thrill \nof actually being a scientist. That, more than anything else, can mean \nthe difference between a student who goes on to become a chemist, an \nengineer, or a medical researcher, and one who loses interest in \nscience forever.\n  Unfortunately, a recent report by the National Academy of Sciences, \ncalled America's Lab Report: Investigations in High School Science, \nmade some findings that are extremely troubling for those of us who \nwant to provide all of our students an equal opportunity to succeed in \nscience and technology. It found that schools that have high \npercentages of minorities and low-income students are ``less likely to \nhave adequate laboratory facilities'' and ``often have lower budgets \nfor laboratory equipment and supplies'' than other schools. The study \nalso found that students in those schools ``spend less time in \nlaboratory instruction than students in other schools.'' Rural schools \nhad some of the same problems.\n  We can not expect our country to be adequately prepared for the \nfuture unless all of our students are adequately prepared for the \nfuture. And unless we do something to improve the laboratory experience \nfor our low-income, minority, and rural students, we simply won't be \nprepared. That's why I am proud to re-introduce the Partnerships for \nAccess to Laboratory Science bill, originally championed by Congressman \nHinojosa, which would authorize partnerships between high-need or rural \nschool districts, higher education institutions, and the private \nsector, with the goal of revitalizing the high school science labs in \nthose schools. The bill creates a pilot program, authorized at $5 \nmillion per year, to help schools purchase scientific equipment, \nrenovate laboratory space, design new experiments or methods of \nintegrating the laboratory with traditional lectures, and provide \nprofessional development for high school science lab teachers. This \nlast one is particularly important, because one of the key conclusions \nfrom the National Academy report is that ``improving high school \nscience teachers' capacity to lead laboratory experiences effectively \nis critical to advancing the educational goals of these experiences.'' \nThis bill is strongly supported by a number of scientific and \neducational organizations, including the American Chemical Society, the \nAmerican Council on Education, the National Science Teachers \nAssociation, and more.\n  We need to do a lot to ensure that our nation stays competitive \nthroughout the 21st century, and this bill is only one small step. But \nit is a sorely needed step, particularly for those students who need \nour help the most. I invite my colleagues to join us in support of this \nbill, and I look forward to working to enact this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 810\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) To remain competitive in science and technology in the \n     global economy, the United States must increase the number of \n     students graduating from high school prepared to pursue \n     postsecondary education in science, technology, engineering, \n     and mathematics.\n       (2) There is broad agreement in the scientific community \n     that learning science requires direct involvement by students \n     in scientific inquiry and that laboratory experience is so \n     integral to the nature of science that it must be included in \n     every science program for every science student.\n       (3) In America's Lab Report, the National Research Council \n     concluded that the current quality of laboratory experiences \n     is poor for most students and that educators and researchers \n     do not agree on how to define high school science \n     laboratories or on their purpose, hampering the accumulation \n     of research on how to improve labs.\n       (4) The National Research Council found that schools with \n     higher concentrations of non-Asian minorities and schools \n     with higher concentrations of poor students are less likely \n     to have adequate laboratory facilities than other schools.\n       (5) The Government Accountability Office reported that 49.1 \n     percent of schools where the minority student population is \n     greater than 50.5 percent reported not meeting functional \n     requirements for laboratory science well or at all.\n       (6) 40 percent of those college students who left the \n     science fields reported some problems related to high school \n     science preparation, including lack of laboratory experience \n     and no introduction to theoretical or to analytical modes of \n     thought.\n       (7) It is the national interest for the Federal Government \n     to invest in research and demonstration projects to improve \n     the teaching of laboratory science in the Nation's high \n     schools.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to prohibit human cloning and protect stem cell \nresearch; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Feinstein, \nSpecter, Kennedy, and Harkin in introducing the Human Cloning Ban and \nStem Cell Research Protection Act of 2007.\n  It is hard to imagine how far medical science has advanced in only 60 \nyears. Penicillin was made available just in time for D-Day and saved \nthousands of lives in the Second World War. Before that time, pneumonia \nor an infected wound was a death sentence. Now, doctors replace damaged \norgans with heart, liver, kidney, and lung transplants. Cancers that \nwere once fatal can be cured. Lives that were once forfeit to injuries \nare now saved by medical science. But there is no shortage of diseases \nthat still ravage humanity.\n  Many scientists believe that we are on the verge of a new revolution \nin medicine created by human stem cells. The reason stem cells are \nimportant to medicine is that many organs cannot make a sufficient \nnumber of new cells to replace damaged or lost ones. Stem cells are the \nonly way currently known that has the potential to replace damaged \ncells in organs such as the pancreas, kidney, heart, brain, and spinal \ncord.\n  Two common diseases may be treatable by stem cells sooner rather than \nlater. Diabetes is reaching epidemic proportions in the United States. \nDiabetes results when pancreatic cells cannot create enough insulin \nwhich is needed for the body to use glucose. Human embryonic stem cells \ncan now be coaxed into differentiating into functioning insulin-\nproducing cells and scientists at the NIH have concluded that creation \nof cells that could be transplantable may soon be possible.\n  Heart failure is one of the commonest chronic conditions of the \nelderly. The heart fails when it does not have enough functioning heart \nmuscle. Clinical trials of injection of stem cells into failing hearts \nto create new muscle tissue are going on around the world as we speak.\n  And treatment of other common diseases with stem cells is on the \nhorizon. In December of 1999 a group of investigators at Washington \nUniversity School of Medicine implanted embryonic stem cells in rats \nwith spinal cord injuries. The stem cells became nerve cells and the \nrats walked. I know families in Utah with spinal cord injured children \nwho pray for such a result in humans. Like the Utah family, the \nSchmanskis, who flew their daughter Tori to China for stem cell \ntransplantation. And like seventeen-year-old Travis Ashton from \nHighland, UT, who is raising money for the same procedure to treat his \nhead injury.\n  Another example of how stem cells may treat common diseases is renal \nfailure which occurs in an estimated 40 percent of critical care \npatients. Dr. Christof Westenfelder, professor of medicine and \nphysiology at the University of Utah has found that injecting stem \ncells into failing kidneys improves kidney function, prevents tissue \ninjury, and accelerates regeneration. These few examples of early stage \nresearch presage advances that we could only dream of before science \nknew of the possibilities of stem cells.\n  But with the promise of stem cells comes responsibility. Scientists \nare now working with stem cells created by a technique called somatic \ncell nuclear transfer. In this laboratory procedure, the DNA from the \ncell of one adult is inserted into an empty egg that has been donated \nfrom another adult. The result, if the science develops further, is a \ncollection of stem cells that could become a kidney or liver that is \nidentical to a missing or diseased organ of the donor of the DNA. \nHowever, this same collection of stem cells if implanted into a woman's \nuterus could possibly become a human being identical to the donor of \nthe DNA.\n  Let me be absolutely clear: I support the use of such stem cells to \ntreat human disease but abhor the possibility of their use for human \ncloning.\n  Our bill prohibits human reproductive cloning and imposes criminal \npenalties for attempting to do so. It provides a firm ethical framework \nfor somatic cell nuclear transfer for therapeutic purposes and \nestablishes stiff civil penalties for not following them.\n  It specifies that research in somatic cell nuclear transfer must \ncomply with NIH regulations.\n  It prohibits the use of fertilized eggs for somatic cell nuclear \ntransfer.\n  It limits maintenance of eggs receiving somatic cell nuclear material \nto 14 days.\n  It specifies that the egg must be voluntarily donated and not \npurchased.\n  It prohibits purchase or sale of eggs to which DNA has been \ntransferred.\n  It is our responsibility to promote stem cell research to treat human \ndiseases. It is equally our responsibility to be certain that such \nresearch is conducted in accordance with the best ethical standards and \nthat the technology can never be used to clone a human being in the \nUnited States.\n  The majority of the US public supports stem cell research and opposes \nhuman reproductive cloning. If we do not act soon to set ethical \nguidelines for legitimate research and to prohibit research that no one \nwants to see, then we may lose the chance. We may also lose the \nopportunity for America to lead the way in the treatment of diseases \nthat are the scourge of mankind.\n  I urge the Senate to take up this bill and to pass it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S2906]]\n\n                                 S. 812\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today Senators Hatch, Kennedy, \nSpecter, Harkin and I are introducing legislation to ban human \nreproductive cloning, while ensuring that important medical research \ngoes forward under strict oversight by the federal government.\n  The Human Cloning Ban and Stem Cell Research Protection Act of 2007 \nwould create a straightforward ban on human reproductive cloning. \nDespite disagreements over various types of biomedical research, there \nis near unanimous agreement that scientists should not create human \nclones.\n  At the same time, this legislation will enable research to be \nconducted that provides hope to millions of Americans suffering from \nparalysis and debilitating diseases including juvenile diabetes, \nParkinson's, Alzheimer's, cancer and heart disease.\n  The concerns with human reproductive cloning are many, and are both \nscientific and ethical in nature. The National Academy of Sciences \nexplains that using cloning, or nuclear transfer to create a child \ncould require hundreds of pregnancies and result in many abnormal late-\nterm fetuses. Some scientists question whether a human clone could ever \nbe created without significant abnormalities.\n  These concerns led the National Academy of Sciences to conclude that \nthere is an ``ethical and scientific consensus that nuclear transfer \nfor reproductive purposes has no place in legitimate research.''\n  That's why this legislation will make it a crime to clone a human \nbeing, or attempt to clone a human being by implanting cells that \nresult from nuclear transplantation into the uterus (there are no \nexceptions); prohibit the shipment of the product of nuclear \ntransplantation in international or interstate commerce for the \npurposes of human cloning; prohibit the export of an unfertilized \nblastocyst, a form of an embryo 5 to 7 days after conception, to any \nforeign country that does not ban human cloning.\n  These prohibitions ensure that valuable research undertaken in the \nUnited States will not be shipped abroad and used to create a human \nclone in a country without restrictions.\n  These prohibitions are supported by strict penalties, including: A \nmaximum ten-year prison term for cloning, or attempting to clone a \nhuman being; a fine of either $1 million, or three times any profits \nmade for any human cloning attempt. A violator is subject to whichever \nfine is greater, and these financial penalties are in addition to \nprison time.\n  Any real or personal property used to commit a violation of this ban, \nor derived from violation of this ban, will be subject to forfeiture.\n  The time to pass a legal framework for addressing reproductive \ncloning is now, before any rogue scientist successfully creates a human \nclone.\n  At the same time, this legislation does not prohibit scientists from \nworking with embryonic stem cells in the hopes of discovering cures and \ntreatments for dozens of catastrophic diseases.\n  This legislation draws a bright line between human reproductive \ncloning and promising medical research using somatic cell nuclear \ntransplantation for the sole purpose of deriving embryonic stem cells.\n  Somatic cell nuclear transplantation is the process by which \nscientists derive embryonic stem cells that are an exact genetic match \nas the patient. Those embryonic stem cells will one day be used to \ncorrect defective cells such as non-insulin producing cells or \ncancerous cells. Then those patients will not be forced to take immuno-\nsuppressive drugs and risk the chances of rejection since the new cells \nwill contain their own DNA.\n  It is truly astonishing that somatic cell nuclear transplantation \nresearch may one day be used to regrow tissue or organs that could lead \nto treatments and cures for diseases that afflict up to 100 million \nAmericans. What we are talking about here is research that does not \neven involve sperm and an egg.\n  I believe it is essential that this research be conducted with \nfederal government oversight and under strict ethical requirements.\n  That is why the legislation mandates that eggs used in this research \nbe unfertilized and--prohibits the purchase or sale of unfertilized \neggs to prevent ``embryo farms'' or the possible exploitation of women \nby coercing them into egg sales.\n  Imposes strong ethics rules on scientists, mandating informed consent \nby egg donors, and include safety and privacy protections;\n  Prohibits any research on an unfertilized blastocyst after 14 days--\nAfter 14 days, an unfertilized blastocyst begins differentiating into a \nspecific type of cell such as a heart or brain cell and is no longer \nuseful for the purposes of embryonic stem cell research;\n  Requires that all egg donations be voluntary, and that there is no \nfinancial or other incentive for egg donations;\n  Requires that nuclear transplantation occur in labs completely \nseparate from labs that engage in in vitro fertilization.\n  And for those who violate or attempt to violate the ethical \nrequirements of the legislation, they will be subject to civil \npenalties of up to $250,000 per violation.\n  To be clear, this is research that involves an unfertilized \nblastocyst. No sperm are involved. It is conducted in a petri dish and \ncannot occur beyond 14 days. It is also prohibited from ever being \nimplanted into a woman to create a child.\n  For those who believe that the clump of cells in a petri dish that we \nare talking about is a human life, that is a moral decision each person \nmust make for himself, but to impose that view on the more than 100 \nmillion of our parents, children and friends who suffer from \nParkinson's, diabetes, Alzheimer's and cancer is immoral.\n  The voters of Missouri affirmed this approach in 2006, approving a \nState ballot initiative banning reproductive cloning, while protecting \nimportant and potentially lifesaving medical research. In the absence \nof Federal guidance, many other states are taking action, sometimes \ncontradictory.\n  Sixteen States have passed laws pertaining to human cloning.\n  Thirteen of these States prohibit reproductive cloning--Arkansas, \nCalifornia, Connecticut, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, \nMissouri, New Jersey, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, \nVirginia.\n  Five States prohibit biomedical research like somatic nuclear \ntransfer, Arkansas, Indiana, Michigan, North Dakota, South Dakota.\n  Six States explicitly permit it, New Jersey, California, Missouri, \nConnecticut, Massachusetts, Iowa.\n  It is time to standardize these policies, under a common set of \nethical guidelines. This patchwork of laws will result only in \nconfusion, forbidding some researchers from conducting lifesaving \nresearch, while their colleagues in a neighboring state receive state \nfunding to do the same work.\n  Just like we have observed with the President's prohibition on \nembryonic stem cell research, this uncertainty is forcing our best and \nbrightest researchers overseas, to countries that fully embrace the \npromise of embryonic stem cell research.\n  They have a number of overseas options: The United Kingdom is \nproviding at least $80 million to fund ongoing research, including \nsomatic cell nuclear transfer research. This is helping to attract \nscientific talent from all over the world, including the United States.\n  Roger Pedersen, a renowned scientist, left the University of \nCalifornia San Francisco in 2001, citing the unfriendly research \nclimate in the United States. He is now conducting human stem cell \nresearch at Cambridge University in the United Kingdom.\n  He and his UK team are exploring the biology behind pluripotent, or \nmultipurpose stem cells, and looking for ways to use them for \ntreatments.\n  The Australian Parliament lifted a ban on therapeutic cloning \nresearch in December 2006.\n  It will allow Australian scientists to fully pursue important cures, \nand now provides an attractive alternative for American scientists who \ndo not want to wait any longer for Federal guidance.\n  It is time to provide some certainty and sanity in our national \npolicy. We must stop unethical human reproductive cloning, while \nunleashing our scientists to develop cures for catastrophic diseases \nthat impact millions.\n\n[[Page S2908]]\n\n  I urge the Senate to take up and pass this bill and help turn the \nhopes of millions of Americans into reality.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 813. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow an \nabove-the-line deduction for attorney fees and costs in connection with \ncivil claim awards; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the first bill which I am introducing, \nand that is to permit attorneys to deduct payment of litigation costs \nas ordinary and necessary business expenses. In litigation, \nillustratively on a personal injury claim, the plaintiff frequently is \nwithout funds and can only move forward with the litigation on a \ncontingency fee basis. In these situations, it is customary for the \nattorney to advance the costs of filing fees, depositions, and other \ncosts there may be. The Internal Revenue Service has taken the position \nthat those are loans from the attorney to the client, so the attorney \ncannot immediately deduct litigation payments as ordinary business \nexpenses. If the litigation costs are treated as ordinary business \nexpenses, the attorney would be able to deduct the expenses as they are \nincurred.\n  The Ninth Circuit has held that the Internal Revenue Service is \nwrong. As a result, attorneys in States within the Ninth Circuit can \ndeduct as ordinary and necessary expenses advances on litigation. This \nlegislation would make it explicit under the Internal Revenue Code that \nthese advanced costs could be deducted by attorneys across the country.\n  Again, I ask that the Record contain my extemporaneous comments and \nthe explanation as to why there is some repetition in the formal \nstatement which I now ask unanimous consent be printed in the Record, \nas well as the two bills which follow these two pieces of legislation \nwhich I am introducing.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Senator Arlen Specter\n\n\n   Statement on legislation to permit attorneys to deduct payment of \n      litigation costs as ordinary and necessary business expenses\n\n       Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to \n     introduce legislation amending the Internal Revenue Code to \n     permit attorneys to deduct payments of litigation expenses on \n     behalf of contingency fee clients as an ordinary and \n     necessary business expense. The IRS deems these advances to \n     be loans, so the attorney cannot immediately deduct \n     litigation related payments as ordinary expenses. If the \n     payments are treated as ordinary and necessary business \n     expenses, the attorney receives the benefit of being able to \n     deduct the expenses as they are incurred, and to recognize \n     the income associated with those expenses if and when damages \n     are recovered, which may be years later.\n       In part because the IRS deems these payments to be loans, \n     and State canons of legal ethics--based on common law of \n     medieval England--prohibited loans to clients, contingency \n     fee lawyers for many years were not able to pay these \n     expenses. In the latter part of the 1800s States began \n     permitting attorneys to advance client expenses as long as \n     the client remained obligated to repay the advances. Even for \n     their indigent clients, if there ultimately was not an award, \n     attorneys were required to seek repayment. The ABA Model Rule \n     has been updated to state that ``a lawyer may advance court \n     costs and expenses of litigation, the repayment of which may \n     be contingent on the outcome of the matter.'' Many States \n     model their rules on these Model Rules, and their ethics \n     rules have been updated, but the Internal Revenue Code has \n     not. Because my bill appropriately treats payments of costs \n     under contingency fee arrangements as ordinary business \n     expenses, attorneys may structure their fee contracts in ways \n     that do not run afoul of State ethics rules.\n       In addition, I note that tax treatment of these payments is \n     not consistent across all jurisdictions. In Boccardo v. \n     Commissioner, 56 F.3d 1016 (9th Cir. 1995) the Ninth Circuit \n     disagreed with the IRS and held that advances on behalf of \n     clients were ``ordinary and necessary expenses'' in \n     contingency cases with ``gross fee'' contracts. So the rule \n     is different in States in the Ninth Circuit; the IRS \n     continues to take the position that expense advances are not \n     deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses in \n     other jurisdictions. This different treatment is neither \n     logical nor equitable.\n       This change will encourage lawyers to represent those who \n     may not otherwise be able to pay an attorney for his work. \n     This is good policy and common sense.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                 S. 813\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ABOVE-THE-LINE DEDUCTION FOR ATTORNEY FEES AND \n                   COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH CIVIL CLAIM AWARDS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Paragraph (20) of section 62(a) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(20) Costs involving civil cases.--Any deduction \n     allowable under this chapter for attorney fees and court \n     costs paid by, or on behalf of, the taxpayer in connection \n     with any action involving a civil claim.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nthe deduction of attorney-advanced expenses and court costs in \ncontingency fee cases; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \ntwo bills relating to tax deductibility which impact unfairly on \nclaimants and plaintiffs in litigation and on attorneys. The second \nbill relates to permitting a taxpayer to deduct expenses for attorney's \nfees in contingency fee cases. For example, if a plaintiff secures \npunitive damages of $15,000 and the attorney collects one-third \ncontingency, $5,000 goes to the attorney. Under current law, the \nplaintiff is required to pay taxes on the full $15,000 without an above \nthe line deduction for the $5,000 paid on attorney's fees. This is a \nresult of technicalities of the Internal Revenue Code. My bill would \nclarify the tax law and will ensure consistent and fair treatment of \ntaxpayers.\n  Mr. President, I have just made an extemporaneous statement on the \nessence of the floor statement, and I now ask unanimous consent that \nthe full floor statement be printed in the Record and that there be \nincluded the segue of why there is some repetition of what I have just \nsaid and the written formal statement itself.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Senator Arlen Specter\n\n\n Statement on legislation to permit taxpayer deductions for attorneys' \n       fees in an award of damages or settlement of legal claims\n\n       Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to \n     introduce legislation that will allow taxpayers to subtract \n     from their gross income, in arriving at adjusted gross \n     income, the attorneys fees and court costs paid by, or on \n     behalf of, the taxpayer in connection with any income from \n     any settlement of legal claims or award of damages. This is \n     known as an ``above the line'' deduction.\n       This change does not affect the requirement that attorneys \n     pay federal income tax on legal fees they receive. What it \n     does eliminate is the inequity of the client also paying tax \n     on those same fees, when the client not entitled to, and did \n     not receive that money under the terms of a contingency fee \n     contract.\n       The tax treatment of these contingency fees is determined \n     through a patchwork of rules that are confusing and \n     inequitable. The legislation would ensure more uniform \n     treatment of contingency fees in all types of litigation and \n     across jurisdictions. In particular, it will eliminate \n     situations in which a plaintiff's recovery may be diminished, \n     primarily as a result of the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), \n     by taxation at a rate of approximately 60 percent on the \n     taxpayer's net recovery, after contingency fee.\n       This change is common sense and will ensure consistent and \n     fair treatment of taxpayers. Congress never intended that the \n     attorneys' portion of recoveries should be included in \n     taxable income--whether for regular income or alternative \n     minimum tax purposes.\n       Section 61(a) of the Code requires taxpayers to include in \n     their gross income ``all income from whatever source \n     derived,'' absent a contrary provision in the Code. Awards \n     for physical personal injury, other than punitive damages, \n     are not taxable (26 U.S.C. 104(a)(2)). Awards of fees in \n     cases primarily related to employment may be deducted ``above \n     the line'' as a result of the American Jobs Creation Act.\n       With these exceptions noted above, the Code treats \n     taxpayers as having received the entire amount of any award \n     or settlement (including any contingency fee portion). This \n     means that for awards based on certain claims or for punitive \n     damages, the taxpayer\n\n[[Page S2909]]\n\n     must include in adjusted gross income the entire award, even \n     though the true benefit or income to the taxpayer after \n     contingency fees and costs may be only 50 percent or 60 \n     percent of the award. This ``net'' then is reduced by what \n     many believe are unfair taxes because, even though the fees \n     may be taken as a miscellaneous itemized deduction under \n     Section 212, which provides for deduction for expenses \n     incurred for the production of income, this category of \n     deductions is subject to disallowance under the AMT, and a \n     phase out of itemized deductions under the regular tax code.\n       Accordingly, the current tax structure, when coupled with \n     the compensation arrangement found in contingency fee \n     contracts, generally (1) creates an enormous tax burden, \n     especially for lower income individuals who often have \n     contingency fees as their only avenue of obtaining legal \n     counsel; and (2) may drive up settlement costs as a result of \n     the serious diminution of the plaintiffs actual award after \n     taxes.\n       An illustration of the tax inequities and inconsistencies \n     follows: an individual/client who obtains $500,000 in a legal \n     settlement on a fraud claim, who incurs $200,000 in legal \n     fees and costs, and nets only $300,000, still may owe AMT on \n     $500,000, and would have to pay approximately $160,000, or \n     about 60 percent of the damage award, in federal and state \n     taxes. This leaves the client with only $140,000 of an award \n     intended to compensate the client in the amount of $500,000.\n       This clarification of tax law is common sense and will \n     ensure consistent and fair treatment of taxpayers, especially \n     those who can get representation only on a contingency fee \n     basis. I encourage my colleagues to consider this legislation \n     and join me in helping to correct this unfair situation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                 S. 814\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide health care benefits to veterans with a \nservice-connected disability at non-Department of Veterans Affairs \nmedical facilities that receive payments under the Medicare program or \nthe TRICARE program; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to talk a little bit about \nrecent events reported in the media surrounding the care and housing \nprovided to our returning, injured service members from Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Walter Reed, of course, is an Army-run facility. As such, \nit does not fall under the jurisdiction of the Veterans' Committee, \nwhich I am proud to lead along with my Chairman, Senator Akaka.\n  Never-the-less, the American public--rightly--does not care who runs \nthe place or who oversees it in Congress. Collectively, VA and DOD make \nup a system of services provided to active and former members of our \nArmed Forces.\n  Of course, we have all read about the poor conditions in Building 18 \nat Walter Reed. I am not here on the floor today to defend poor \nphysical infrastructure. It is bad, a free press reported it, senior \nofficials were held accountable, and it is being fixed.\n  I am here instead to talk about how the justified uproar over the \nconditions at Walter Reed seems to have provided an opportunity for \nsome of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to hone in on new \nstrategy for criticizing the war. The strategy appears to me to be one \nof ``questioning the competency'' of those who work in our Federal \nsystem caring for our wounded servicemembers.\n  Now I don't want to accuse anyone of politicizing the care and \ntreatment of our most deserving citizens. But, I have to wonder when I \nhear my friends on the other side of the aisle using a slight variation \non one of their ``catch-phrases'' from the 2006 elections. I've heard \none of my colleagues lament the ``culture of command'' in the military \nas the reason for poor conditions at Walter Reed.\n  I don't really know what the ``culture of command'' means, other than \nit sounds a lot like phrases used during the last election. But this \ntime they are using that playbook with the care provided by the 220,000 \ndedicated employees of the VA health care system.\n  Speaking of which, I want to caution my colleagues who have used the \ncase of the young veteran from Minnesota who tragically took his own \nlife a few weeks ago as an example of what is wrong with the VA health \ncare system. Some of us on the Veterans' Committee have been briefed \nthoroughly about all of the facts in this case. And while HIPPA \nprevents VA from defending itself in this situation, I am not so \nconstrained.\n  That said, I do not intend to reveal at this time the facts \nsurrounding this case. But, I believe all of my colleagues would tone \ndown their rhetoric on this example if all of the facts known to me \nwere known to them.\n\n  Still, there is no question that every individual instance of poor \ncare or treatment is a tragedy. And, every one of them should be \ninvestigated. There should be accountability at the highest levels. And \nthere should be consequences if VA is found to have been responsible \nfor inappropriate treatment.\n  But I have to say that using anecdotes of horribly unfortunate \nsituations, such as the Minneapolis tragedy to castigate an entire \nsystem of health care and the people who provide is not fair. It is \nsimply not fair.\n  But then again politics sometimes has no fairness.\n  Over the past 2 weeks, more than one Member has come to the floor or \nspoken in the press about how the VA system is failing our wounded \nservice men and women. Frankly perhaps we have failed them by not \ntaking actions to make those wounded in service the priority that we \nsay they are.\n  Instead, all I hear from Members on the other side is: we haven't \ngiven VA enough money. In fact, I hear we are preparing to throw $5 \nbillion at the VA in the supplemental Appropriations bill.\n  I find that to be very interesting especially when I consider that \nthis Senate just 3 weeks ago passed an FY 2007 Joint Funding Resolution \nwritten wholly by the new majority.\n  This is what some of my colleagues had to say about the money \nprovided in that bill for VA's health care system. One Senator from the \nmajority said: ``We have included an increase of $3.6 billion . . . so \nthat the VA can continue to meet the growing demand for health care for \nour veterans.''\n  Another said: ``If we do not pass this resolution, which includes \nneeded funding for the veterans health care system, we will have no one \nto blame but ourselves.''\n  And still another Senator from the majority had this to say arguing \nfor passage of the FY 2007 Resolution: ``We need a VA budget for the \ncurrent year that meets their needs.''\n  Yet now I hear that the VA is chronically under funded. The first \nchance the new majority had to provide all of the funding they believed \nwas needed was 3 weeks ago. That's right, just 3 weeks ago. And \napparently they neglected to do so.\n  Frankly, I think the budget for 2007 was an excellent budget. And I \nvoted for it. So, I am not going to run away from that right now. And I \ncertainly don't know if I can support throwing $5 billion at it because \nthe media is watching. Instead, I have a different idea.\n  I don't want to wait for a commission to report to me on the findings \nof their review of the VA health care system. Those findings will be \nimportant, of course. I thank Senator Dole and Secretary Shalala for \ntheir willingness to once again serve.\n  But, I say that we already have our own commission and our own \ninvestigators on the ground every single day. They are the veterans who \nuse the VA health care system. And overwhelmingly they are proud of \ntheir health care system.\n  In fact, I am so confident that the vast majority of our veterans \nfeel that way that I announce today that I will introduce legislation \nto give ANY service-connected disabled veteran the choice to go to any \nmedical facility in the United States.\n\n[[Page S2910]]\n\n  I understand that it may sound like I am agreeing with my Democratic \ncolleagues and that I have lost faith in the VA health care system. \nNothing could be further from the truth. Why? Because I believe the \nvast majority of our veterans will choose to stay right where they \nare--in the VA.\n  Our veterans know that VA is not a bunch of nameless, faceless \nbureaucrats who deserve to be vilified at the drop of a political hat. \nInstead our veterans see everyday the caring dedicated men and women \nwho treat them as they should be treated--with respect and compassion.\n  Veterans overwhelmingly will continue to come to the VA because of \nits people. They are some of the most caring individuals in government. \nAnd they provide some of the highest quality of care in the country. \nSo, I believe in empowering our veterans with this selection because I \nbelieve our veterans will select VA.\n  It's not just me who believes in VA. For the seventh year in a row \nVA's health care system outscored the private sector in the University \nof Michigan's Consumer Satisfaction Survey:\n  Ninety-one percent of VA's patients rated VA as having good customer \nservice;\n  Eighty-four percent of VA's patients were satisfied with their \ninpatient care compared to the private sector average of just 73 \npercent; and\n  Eighty-two percent are satisfied with their outpatient care compared \nwith just 71 percent on average in the private sector.\n  You might say: ``Well, then 10 or 16 percent were not satisfied and \nthat's a disgrace.'' I agree. We should strive for 100 percent \nsatisfaction.\n  But what we should not do is force our most deserving citizens to \nstay in a system for their health care while we talk about how to study \nit or while we throw money at it and declare we've done something.\n  I want to be clear. I think the number of veterans who don't trust VA \nfor their care is small. But I also think that if they've been injured \nwhile serving this Nation, then we should not force even a small number \nof them to keep coming to us if they don't trust us.\n  We have all of the objective studies, articles, and reviews that say \nwe're good. Now let's find out what our veterans think. If they leave \nin droves, then we'll learn something. But if they stay, as I think \nthey will, then we'll learn something too.\n  So I say to my colleagues if you don't believe that our doctors and \nnurses are providing the best care in the best facilities right now, \nthen I invite you to join me in giving those with service-connected \ndisabilities the option to pick up tomorrow and go to a facility they \ntrust.\n  Don't just stand up and throw money at it. Stand in the well of the \nSenate and vote to empower our heroes by providing them with immediate \nrelief.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANDERS:\n  S. 818. A bill to expand the middle class, reduce the gap between the \nrich and the poor, keep our promises to veterans, lower the poverty \nrate, and reduce the Federal deficit by repealing tax breaks for the \nwealthiest one percent and eliminating unnecessary Cold War era defense \nspending, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, in several weeks, the Senate will begin \nits deliberations on the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution. It is my \nstrong belief that the Senate must pass a budget that will expand the \nshrinking middle class, that will reduce the enormous and growing gap \nbetween the wealthy and the poor, that will keep our promises to our \nNation's veterans, that will reduce our recordbreaking national debt \nand lower the poverty rate. That is what this Senate should be focusing \non.\n  Simply stated, in my opinion, the way for us to move in that \ndirection is to repeal the President's tax breaks that have been given \nto the wealthiest 1 percent, the people who need it the least and, in \naddition, for us to take a hard look at the Pentagon, take a hard look \nat the waste and the fraud and the unnecessary weapons systems that are \nexisting in the Pentagon right now. We don't need weapons systems that \nwere designed to fight the Soviet Union; we need an approach to fight \nal-Qaida.\n  I think we can find billions of dollars in savings when we look at \nthe military budget as well. The bill I am introducing today, the \nNational Priorities Act, will in fact accomplish these goals.\n  A budget is more than a long list of numbers.\n  A budget is a statement about our values, our priorities, and the \ntime is long overdue for the United States Congress to get its \npriorities right, to begin to stand up for the middle class and working \nfamilies of this country, rather than multinational corporations and \nthe wealthiest people who, year after year after year, have so much \npower over this institution.\n  Let me do what is too rarely done on the floor of this Senate, and \nthat is take a hard and cold look at the reality facing the American \nmiddle class and working families of this country.\n  As a member of the Budget Committee, every week we have somebody from \nthe President's administration coming before us, and they tell us the \neconomy is doing great; it is marvelous. The people of Vermont and the \nmiddle class of this country don't believe it because every single day \nthey are seeing an economy which is forcing them, in many instances, to \nwork longer hours for lower wages, an economy in which they wonder how \ntheir kids are going to get decent-paying jobs, an economy which \nsuggests that for the first time in the modern history of our country, \nour children, if we do not change our direction, could have a lower \nstandard of living than we do.\n  What the American dream has been about is that our parents worked \nhard so that we could have a better life than they did, and that is \nwhat we want for our kids. But unless we make fundamental changes in \nthe way this economy is working, the likelihood is that our kids, \ndespite a huge increase in worker productivity, despite technology, \nwill have a lower standard of living than we do, and we must not allow \nthat to happen.\n  Since President Bush has been in office, more than 5 million \nAmericans have slipped into poverty. We are seeing an increase in the \nrate of poverty in the United States, including 1 million more \nchildren. Not only does the United States have the highest rate of \npoverty of any major country on Earth, we also, shamefully, have the \nhighest rate of childhood poverty in the industrialized world.\n  I know there is a whole lot of talk about moral values on the floors \nof the Senate and the House. To my mind, having the highest rate of \nchildhood poverty in the industrialized world is not a moral value. It \nis a disgrace. It is a shame. It is time we in this country paid \nattention to the children rather than the wealthiest people.\n  According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the childhood poverty rate is \nnearly 18 percent. Other studies suggest that it might be higher.\n  Some people say: Well, that's the way it goes. Well, that is not the \nway it goes among other major countries in the world. In Germany, the \nchildhood poverty rate is 9 percent; in France, it is less than 8 \npercent; in Sweden, it is less than 7 percent; in Norway, 4.2 percent; \nin Finland, 3.4 percent. If other countries can have childhood poverty \nrates of less than 5 percent, so can the United States of America.\n  Just one example. Our allies in Great Britain made a commitment to \nend childhood poverty and they have reduced the childhood poverty rate \nby over 20 percent since 1999. At the same time, child poverty in the \nUnited States increased by 12 percent. If we make the commitment, we \ncan do that.\n\n  Let's take a look at our health care situation. The costs of health \ncare, as everybody in this country knows, are soaring. The number of \npeople without health insurance has risen to a record high of 46.4 \nmillion in the year 2005. That is an increase of almost 7 million more \nAmericans lacking health insurance since President Bush took office.\n  While the President continues to cut taxes for millionaires and \nbillionaires, the lack of health insurance kills many more Americans \neach year than September 11 and Katrina combined. In fact, the National \nAcademy of Sciences estimates that 18,000 Americans die each year \nbecause they lack health insurance.\n  In my view, the United States of America must join the rest of the \nindustrialized world. We must guarantee health care to all of our \npeople as a right of citizenship. While I know some\n\n[[Page S2911]]\n\npeople say we can't afford to do it, I would argue that at a time when \nwe are spending more than twice as much per capita on health care as \nany major nation on Earth, we can do that. We can provide quality \nhealth care to every man, woman, and child as a right of citizenship \nwithout spending a nickel more than we are presently spending. But to \ndo that, we must be honest. We are going to have to take on the \ninsurance companies. We are going to have to take on the drug \ncompanies. We are going to have to take on the multinational \ncorporations that benefit out of our health care system and say that \nwhen we spend money for health care, it should go to health care not \nfor profiteering.\n  Health care is not just a human rights issue, it is not just a moral \nissue, it is an economic issue as well. Small businesses cannot survive \nif they are forced to pay huge increases in health care premiums each \nand every year. That is true in the State of Vermont. That is true all \nover America. More and more small businesses are simply saying: We \ncan't do it; we can't provide health insurance to our workers--which is \none of the reasons the number of uninsured is going up.\n  In addition to the health care crisis, there is an area within health \ncare that I want to focus a lot of attention on, and that is the crisis \nin dental care. In rural America, in rural Vermont it is becoming very \ndifficult for people to find a dentist. The Surgeon General has \nreported that tooth decay has become the single most common chronic \nchildhood disease, five times more common than asthma and seven times \nmore common than hay fever.\n  I will be introducing legislation to address the dental crisis in \nthis country. I do not want to see kids in schools have teeth rotting \nin their mouths. We can do better than that.\n  In terms of education, millions of middle-class American families are \nfinding it increasingly difficult to afford the escalating cost of a \ncollege education with average tuition and other costs increasing by \nmore than $4,300 at a 4-year public university and over $8,000 at a 4-\nyear private college since 2001.\n  We all understand that young people are not going to make it into the \nmiddle class unless they get a college education. We all understand \nthat our Nation is not going to be economically competitive if our \nyoung people do not get the best college education they possibly can. \nYet all over our country, middle-class families are saying: How am I \ngoing to be able to afford to send my kids to college? And young people \nare graduating college on average about $20,000 in debt. If they are \nlower income, they may come out of college $30,000, $40,000 in debt.\n  If we are serious in what we say about the importance of education, \nwe have to make college education affordable to every family in this \ncountry. We don't want to lose the intellectual capital of millions of \nyoung people who are sitting there wondering: Can I afford to go to \ncollege? Do I want to come out of college deeply in debt?\n  Last year, 35 million Americans in our country, the richest country \nin the history of the world, struggled to put food on the table--\nstruggled to put food on the table. The Agriculture Department recently \nreported that the number of the poorest, hungriest Americans keeps \ngoing up.\n  What is going on in this great country when more and more of our \nfellow Americans are going hungry and are struggling to put food on the \ntable? This should not be happening in America. But it is not only \nhunger, we have an affordable crisis in housing as well. Today millions \nof working Americans are paying 50 to 60 percent of their limited \nincomes to put a roof over their heads, and we have families in the \nUnited States of America--families--who are sleeping in their cars, \nchildren who are sleeping in cars, and we have people, as we all know, \nwho continue to sleep out on the streets of cities and towns all over \nAmerica.\n  Last year, there were 1.2 million home foreclosures in this country, \nan increase of 42 percent since 2005.\n  When we talk about the needs of the middle class, it is not just \naffordable housing. The issue of energy is a prominent issue that must \nbe addressed. The cost of energy has risen rapidly. Since President \nBush has been in office, oil prices have more than doubled and gasoline \nprices have gone up by 70 percent since January of 2001, and gas prices \nare soaring as I speak. In rural States, such as my State of Vermont, \nsuch as Minnesota, workers get into their cars, they fill up their gas \ntanks, and suddenly they are finding that increased cost is coming \nright out of their paycheck. They are not making much more money. The \ncost of gas is going up.\n\n  In America today, the bottom line is that millions of American \nworkers are working longer hours for lower wages. The median income for \nworking-age families has declined 5 years in a row. Husbands are \nworking long hours, wives are working long hours, kids in high school \nare working trying to make ends meet, and in many instances people are \nfalling further and further behind.\n  Today, incredible as it may sound, the personal savings rate in \nAmerica is below zero, and that has not happened since the Great \nDepression of the 1930s. In other words, all over this country, working \npeople and people in the middle class are purchasing groceries and \nother basic necessities with their credit cards and are going, in the \nprocess, deeper and deeper in debt.\n  Over the past 6 years, when we talk about the economy and decent-\npaying jobs, we should recognize that as a nation, we have lost 3 \nmillion manufacturing jobs which often pay people good wages and good \nbenefits. In my own small State of Vermont, we have lost 10,000 \nmanufacturing jobs in the last 6 years, which is 20 percent of the \nmanufacturing jobs in our small State.\n  The reality is that if somebody loses their manufacturing job and \nthey are lucky enough to find another job, in most cases, that other \njob will pay substantially lower wages and have worse benefits than the \nmanufacturing job they have lost.\n  Today, 3 million fewer American workers have pension coverage than \nwhen President Bush took office, and half of private sector American \nworkers have no pension coverage whatsoever. I have long been involved \nin the struggle to make sure that workers have been able to retain the \npensions that were promised to them by their employers. But we are \nseeing more and more workers who have enormous pension anxiety: Is the \npension that was promised to me 20 years ago when I began to work in \nthis company going to be there when I need it, when I retire? More and \nmore workers are finding that will not be the case.\n  One thing we do not often talk about is just how hard the people in \nour country are working. We kind of forget about that. But the fact is, \nthe people, working people in this country, now work the longest hours \nof any people in the industrialized world. In my State of Vermont, it \nis absolutely not uncommon to see people who are working not one job, \nnot two jobs, but on occasion working three jobs trying to cobble \ntogether an income, trying to cobble together some health care for \ntheir families. People are working 50 hours, 60 hours, 70 hours.\n  The New York Times reported a while back that the idea of the 2-week \npaid vacation is becoming something of history. So we have people who \nare working 51 weeks a year, and there are people working 52 weeks a \nyear. That is what is going on in the middle class and working families \nof our country.\n  The reason I raise these issues is that it is terribly important to \nbring a dose of reality to the floor of the Senate.\n  When the President tells us the economy is doing great, the truth is \nthat he is right, in one sense. The economy is not doing well for the \nmiddle class. It is not doing well for working families. Poverty is \nincreasing. But the President is right when he says the economy is \ndoing well for the wealthiest people in this country. That is true. The \nrich are getting richer, the middle class is shrinking, and poverty is \nincreasing. That is the reality.\n  The reality is that the upper 1 percent of the families in America \ntoday, that 1 percent has not had it so good since the 1920s. According \nto Forbes magazine, the collective net worth of the wealthiest 400 \nAmericans increased by $120 billion last year to $1.25 trillion. The \n400 wealthiest Americans are worth $1.25 trillion.\n  Sadly, the United States today--and I know we don't talk about this \ntoo much, but it is important to bring it out on the table--the United \nStates\n\n[[Page S2912]]\n\ntoday has, by far, the most unequal distribution of wealth of any major \ncountry on Earth and the most unequal distribution of income of any \nmajor country on Earth, and that gap between the rich and everybody \nelse is growing wider. Today, the wealthiest 13,000 families in America \nearn nearly as much income as the bottom 20 million, and the wealthiest \n1 percent own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent. Let me repeat \nthat: 13,000 families earn almost as much income as the bottom 20 \nmillion, and the richest 1 percent own more wealth than the bottom 90 \npercent. That trend is very dangerous for our country. It suggests we \nare moving in the direction of an oligarchy, where a small number of \npeople have incredible wealth and, with that wealth, incredible power, \nat the same time as the vast majority of our people are struggling just \nto keep their heads above water. We as a nation can do a lot better \nthan that.\n  According to a December 2006 report by the Congressional Budget \nOffice, the average after-tax income of the wealthiest 1 percent of \nhouseholds rose from $722,000 in 2003 to $868,000 in 2004. After \nadjusting for inflation, that is a 1-year increase of nearly $146,000, \nor 20 percent. This represents the largest increase in 15 years \nmeasured both in percentage terms and in real dollars.\n  Now, what does that mean in English? What it means in English is that \nthe wealthiest people in this country are doing phenomenally well, that \nis what it means, while a lot of other people are struggling very hard \nto keep their families afloat.\n  Why have I given this overview of the state of the economy? I have \ngiven this overview because I believe we need a budget that begins to \naddress the realities I have just discussed. We need a budget that says \nto the middle class and working families and low-income Americans: We \nknow you are hurting; we are on your side. At the same time, we need a \nbudget that says to the very wealthiest people in this country: You \nknow what, you are part of America, too. Your incomes are soaring. If \nyou are a CEO of a large corporation, you are making 400 times what the \nworker in your company is making. You know what, we want you to be part \nof America, and you have to make some sacrifices so the people in this \ncountry don't go hungry and so working-class kids can get a college \neducation. Join America. Don't be separate with your huge incomes.\n  The President has just, as you know, introduced his budget. He has \ntold us that in his budget, the United States does not have enough \nmoney to meet the health care needs of this country. His response is to \ninadequately fund the Children's Health Insurance Program and to cut \nMedicare and Medicaid by $280 billion over the next decade.\n  The President has told us we don't have enough money to take care of \nour veterans, and we all have seen recently what has been going on at \nWalter Reed Hospital. The President has said that despite the fact that \nwe have 22,000 wounded in Iraq and that we have veterans on waiting \nlists all over this country, we just don't have the money to take care \nof our veterans.\n  The President has told us we don't have enough money for childcare; \nwe don't have enough money for dental care; we don't have enough money \nfor special education; we don't have enough money to address the crisis \nin global warming; we don't have enough money to make sure qualified \nstudents have access to a quality education without going deeply into \ndebt.\n  The President has told us we don't have enough money to fully fund \nHead Start, that we don't have enough money to expand the earned income \ntax credit.\n  That is what the President has told us.\n  The President, in his budget, has also told us something else. The \nPresident has said we don't have enough money for the needs of the \nmiddle class and working families, but we do have enough money to \nprovide $70 billion in tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent and that \nwe really don't have to take a hard look at the Pentagon and all the \nwaste, the fraud, and the unnecessary weapons systems that are in that \ninstitution.\n  In my view, these upside-down priorities have to be changed, and that \nis the responsibility of this Senate. The bill I am introducing today \nwill begin to turn our national priorities in a very different \ndirection from that which the President is suggesting.\n  The National Priorities Act will repeal tax breaks for the wealthiest \n1 percent in 2008 and eliminate $60 billion in waste, fraud, and abuse \nat the Pentagon and use that money to do the following. In other words, \nwhat we are doing is we are going to ask our wealthy friends who have \nreceived huge tax breaks to start paying a little bit more in taxes. We \nare going to ask the Pentagon to take a hard look at their huge budget \nand eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse. We are going to be raising about \n$130 billion to do that.\n  Now, let me tell you what we can do with that $130 billion. We can \nprovide health care services for over 4 million Americans by increasing \ninvestments in federally qualified health centers and by raising funds \nsubstantially for the National Health Service Corps. In my State and \nall over America, federally qualified health centers are providing \ncost-effective quality health care to millions of people. By increasing \nfunding and expanding these programs, putting more money into these \nprograms, we can provide high-quality health care, dental care, mental \nhealth counseling, and low-cost prescription drugs, and we can do it in \na cost-effective way. We can make a serious effort to provide primary \nhealth care to every man, woman, and child in this country. That is \nwhat we can do.\n  We can expand access to dental care. By providing $140 million more \nfor workforce, capital, and equipment needed, we can address in a \nsignificant way the dental care crisis in this country.\n  We can provide health insurance to over 8 million children not \ncovered by expanding the CHIP program, Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, by over $15 billion. In my State of Vermont, almost all of our \nkids have health insurance. The rest of our country should move in that \ndirection. It is not acceptable that children in America do not have \nhealth insurance. We can do that through this legislation.\n  We can address the crisis in terms of inadequate funding in the VA \nand make sure that all of our veterans get the health care they were \npromised, the health care they deserve. That is what this budget does.\n  We also, in this budget, ensure that working families with children \nhave access to affordable childcare by increasing investments in the \nchildcare development block grant by over $2 billion. It is a national \noutrage that all over this country working families cannot find good, \nquality affordable childcare. Single moms are going off to work, and \nthey are worried. They worry deeply about the quality of care their \nchildren are receiving. It is a major crisis. This legislation provides \nthe funds to address that crisis.\n  Head Start has been a successful program. This legislation provides \nthe funding to allow every qualified child in America to receive early \neducation, nutrition, and health services by fully funding the Head \nStart Program.\n  In my State of Vermont and, again, all over this country, higher and \nhigher property taxes are causing very serious problems for middle-\nclass families, splitting communities apart. This legislation will \nlower property taxes by keeping the Federal commitment to provide 40 \npercent of the cost of special education for about 7 million children \nwith disabilities. Mainstreaming kids with disabilities is a good idea. \nIt is the right thing to do. The Federal Government has not kept the \npromises it has made to school districts all over this country. We have \nto increase funding substantially for special education, not, as the \nPresident wants, cut funding for special education. This bill does \nthat.\n  This bill provides an additional 330,000 students with Pell grants \nand increases its purchasing power for over 5.4 million other students \nby doubling the maximum Pell grant. In other words, we want our young \npeople to be able to go to college. We do not want them to come out in \ndebt. This legislation does that.\n  This legislation instills low-income high school students with the \nskills and opportunity they need to go to college by increasing the \nTRIO and GEAR UP education programs by 50 percent.\n  This legislation creates more than 200,000 jobs by increasing \ninvestments in renewable energy, energy-efficient appliances, public \ntransportation, and\n\n[[Page S2913]]\n\nhigh-speed rail. By making our environment cleaner, by attacking and \nreversing global warming, we can create hundreds of thousands of jobs. \nThat is what this legislation does.\n  This legislation addresses the crisis in affordable housing by \ncreating 180,000 jobs in constructing, preserving, and rehabilitating \naffordable housing rental units.\n  This legislation reduces taxes by $400 to $1,134 per year for 10 \nmillion American workers and families with children by expanding the \nearned-income tax credit.\n  This legislation reduces the deficit by $30 billion.\n  To be very honest, I do not expect this legislation to be passed \ntomorrow, probably not even the next day. What this legislation is \ndoing, though, is providing the Congress with a blueprint, and it is a \nvery simple blueprint. It says: Which side are you on? It says that \nwhen those people who come before us and say: Yes, we understand there \nis a health care crisis; we just can't afford to do anything about it; \nwe understand there is a childcare crisis, there is a housing crisis, \nthere is a crisis in terms of the affordability of higher education, \nbut we just can't do anything about it. We just don't have the money. \nWhat this legislation does is say: Yes, we do have the money. We do \nhave the money if we rescind the tax breaks that go to millionaires and \nbillionaires, if we ask the Pentagon to preserve, to make sure we \ncontinue to have all the resources we need for our soldiers and the \nstrongest military in the world but take a hard look at waste, fraud, \nabuse, and weapons systems we don't need. If you do those two things, \nwe can come up with $130 billion. With that $130 billion, we can \naddress the major problems facing our country, and we can lower our \ndeficit.\n  I hope that my fellow colleagues will give serious thought to this \nlegislation and that we can move it forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Smith, Mr. \n        Schumer, Mrs. Lincoln, and Mr. Coleman):\n  S. 819. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \ntax-free distributions from individual retirement accounts for \ncharitable purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I'm pleased to be joined by Senators \nSnowe, Kerry, Smith, Schumer, Lincoln and Coleman in re-introducing \nlegislation we call the Public Good IRA Rollover Act. This legislation \nallows taxpayers to make tax-free distributions from their individual \nretirement accounts (IRAs) for gifts to charity.\n  Last summer, the Congress passed and the President signed into law a \nmajor bill to reform our pension laws. This 392-page bill contained a \nlittle noticed but important new charitable giving tax incentive. For \nthe first time, taxpayers who have reached age 70\\1/2\\ are allowed to \ngive money directly from their IRAs to qualifying charities on a tax-\nfree basis without worrying about complicated adjusted gross income and \nother restrictions that otherwise apply to tax deductible charitable \ncontributions. The charitable IRA rollover provision in H.R. 4 applies \nonly for direct IRA gifts, is capped and it is available for a limited \ntime--expiring at the end of this year.\n  In fact, the charitable IRA rollover provision in H.R. 4 adopted the \nsame general approach of legislation for direct IRA gifts I have been \nworking on called the Public Good IRA Rollover Act with several of my \nSenate colleagues for a number of years.\n  Before I authored this legislation, I was told by many charities that \npotential donors frequently asked about using their IRAs to make \ncharitable donations but decided against such gifts after they were \ntold about the potential tax consequences under then-current tax law. I \nam pleased to report that the charitable community is already feeling \nthe positive impact of the new charitable IRA rollover measure. \nAccording to a limited survey conducted by the National Committee on \nPlanned Giving thousands of IRA gifts totaling nearly $60 million have \nbeen made to eligible charities since the tax-free IRA rollover \nprovision was enacted into law last August.\n  I'm told that the IRA rollovers have resulted in significant gifts in \nNorth Dakota. It reportedly inspired a donor to Lutheran Social \nServices of North Dakota to contribute $15,000, an amount higher than \nthe donor's typical gift. This charitable gift will help the \norganization to continue its diverse programs in such areas as adoption \nservices, counseling for at-risk youth, economic self-sufficiency for \nrefugees, and services for farmers and ranchers. Lutheran Social \nServices believes that the IRA rollover provision encourages people to \ngive more and to continue giving. University of Mary reportedly \nreceived IRA gifts of over $250,000 in 2006. The Theodore Roosevelt \nMedora Foundation received an IRA gift of $80,000. Ducks Unlimited \nreceived eleven IRA gifts in 2006 totaling nearly $190,000 and expects \neven more in 2007. Jamestown College reportedly received nine IRA gifts \nin 2006 totaling over $112,000. Other North Dakota charities, including \nCatholic Health Services for Western North Dakota, have benefited from \nIRA gifts as well.\n  The charitable IRA rollover has resulted in similar stories across \nthe Nation. For example, Goodwill Industries of West Michigan has \nreceived several contributions as a direct result of the rollover \nprovision and believes the provision is resonating with donors. A local \nphysician made the single biggest IRA rollover donation of $10,000. The \nphysician was not previously a Goodwill donor. This $10,000 donation \nwill completely support a homeless family for up to six months in the \norganization's transitional housing and employment program for homeless \nfamilies. This is just one example illustrating the success of the \ncharitable IRA rollover but there are dozens of similar stories across \nthe country.\n  The results are undeniable: the temporary charitable IRA rollover \nincentive is working well and making a difference in the lives of \npeople who are assisted by the Nation's charities. And the Public Good \nIRA Rollover Act that we are re-introducing today builds upon last \nyear's temporary measure by removing its current dollar cap, expanding \nit to allow taxpayers who have attained age 59\\1/2\\ to make life-income \ngifts and by making it a permanent part of the Tax Code.\n  As a Nation, we depend on a strong, active network of charities, \nsmall and large, to offer financial and other support to families and \nindividuals who need help when government assistance is unavailable. \nThat is why I think it's critically important for Congress to do \neverything possible to help encourage the work of worthy charities. \nPermanently extending and expanding the temporary charitable IRA \nrollover in current law will go a long way in that direction.\n  A senior official from a major charity once said the charitable IRA \nrollover would be ``the single most important piece of legislation in \nthe history of public charitable support in this country.'' The reason \nis the Public Good IRA Rollover Act eliminates major tax obstacles to \ncharitable giving. Specifically, our bill would allow individuals to \nmake tax-free distributions to charities from their IRAs at the age of \n70\\1/2\\ for direct gifts and age 59\\1/2\\ for life-income gifts. These \nchanges to the Tax Code will put billions of additional dollars from a \nnew source to work for the public good in the years ahead.\n  The charitable IRA rollover approach in this legislation has been \nendorsed by over 530 charitable organizations operating in 46 States \nand the District of Columbia, including: AARP, the American Cancer \nSociety, the American Red Cross and American Heart Association, \nAmerica's Second Harvest, American Association of Museums, Big Brothers \nBig Sisters of America, Ducks Unlimited, Easter Seals, Goodwill, \nLutheran Services of America, March of Dimes, the Salvation Army, \nUnited Jewish Communities, United Way of America, Volunteers of \nAmerica, YMCA of the USA, Prairie Public Broadcasting, the North Dakota \nCommunity Foundation and many others. In addition, the U.S. Senate is \npreviously on record in support of the Public Good IRA Rollover Act. In \ndoing so, the Senate recognized that the charitable IRA rollover is an \nimportant tool for charities to use to raise the funds they need to \nserve those in need, especially when government assistance is not \navailable.\n  The Bush Administration supports charitable IRA rollovers. In his \nfiscal year 2008 budget submission, President Bush has proposed making \npermanent the limited tax-free charitable IRA distribution provision \npassed last summer\n\n[[Page S2914]]\n\nthat is scheduled to expire at the end of this year. While the \nPresident's charitable IRA proposal has merit, the Public Good IRA \nRollover Act is superior in one important respect: by allowing tax-\nfavored life-income gifts from an IRA whose owner has attained the age \nof 59\\1/2\\.\n  In addition to direct IRA gifts, many charities use life-income gifts \nto secure funding commitments today to meet their future needs. Life-\nincome gifts involve the donation of assets to a charity, where the \ngiver retains an income stream from those assets for a defined period. \nMany people would like to give part or all of their IRAs to charity, \nbut need the retirement income from their IRAs. Allowing them to roll \nover their IRAs at age 59\\1/2\\ or older to a charity's life-income plan \nwould allow them to secure retirement income and make a charitable \ncommitment. The charities could plan on receiving the gift after the \nlife interest terminates.\n  The benefit of allowing life-income gifts at an earlier age is two-\nfold. First, the life-income gift provision in our bill would stimulate \nadditional charitable giving. Second, the evidence also suggests that \npeople who make life-income gifts often become more involved with \ncharities. They serve as volunteers, urge their friends and colleagues \nto make charitable gifts and frequently set up additional provisions \nfor charity in their life-time giving plans and at death.\n  Life-income gifts are an important tool for charities to raise funds, \nand would receive a substantial boost if they could be made from IRAs \nwithout adverse tax consequences. But life-income gifts are not part of \nthe Administration's proposal. Again, the Public Good IRA Rollover Act \npermits individuals to make tax-favored life-income gifts at the age of \n59\\1/2\\.\n  In closing, I urge my Senate colleagues to review and consider \ncosponsoring this bill. With your help, we can permanently enact into \nlaw tax-free IRA rollover provisions that charities say is needed to \nencourage billions of dollars in new giving that will provide \nassistance to those who need it most.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill and a letter \nfrom charitable organizations that have endorsed the Public Good IRA \nRollover Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    March 8, 2007.\n     Hon. Byron L. Dorgan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Olympia J. Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Dorgan and Snowe: We, the undersigned \n     organizations, representing millions of volunteers, donors, \n     and recipients of services who are part of America's \n     nonprofit community, strongly support the ``Public Good IRA \n     Rollover Act of 2007.''\n       Since it was enacted in August 2006, the current IRA \n     Charitable Rollover has helped nonprofits enrich lives and \n     strengthen communities across the country and around the \n     world. By eliminating the barrier in the tax law that had \n     previously discouraged transfers from Individual Retirement \n     Accounts to charities, the rollover has enabled Americans to \n     make millions of dollars of new contributions to the \n     nonprofits--including hospitals, museums, educational \n     institutions, and religious organizations--that benefit \n     people every day.\n       The IRA Charitable Rollover is scheduled to expire at the \n     end of 2007. It permits eligible IRA owners to make direct \n     gifts to eligible charities from their IRAs without suffering \n     a tax penalty. Beginning at age 70\\1/2\\, all IRA owners are \n     required to take annual minimum distributions, even if they \n     do not need the income. With the charitable rollover, those \n     who have accumulated more assets than they need in their IRAs \n     can use the distribution and other money in their accounts to \n     support the services and programs of nonprofits. The IRA \n     Rollover is particularly helpful for older Americans who do \n     not itemize their tax deductions and would not otherwise \n     receive any tax benefit for their charitable contributions.\n       These advantages are the reason we appreciate your \n     sponsorship of the ``Public Good IRA Rollover Act of 2007'' \n     and why we ask that you aggressively push this critical \n     legislation. It would build on the success of the current IRA \n     Rollover by making it permanent, removing the current dollar \n     limit on donations per year, making all charities eligible to \n     receive donations, and providing IRA owners with a planned \n     giving option starting at age 59\\1/2\\.\n       Thank you for your leadership in sponsoring the ``Public \n     Good IRA Rollover Act of 2007.'' We intend to work in \n     partnership with you to push for passage of this critical \n     legislation.\n           Respectfully,\n     Diana Aviv,\n       President and CEO, Independent Sector.\n     Tanya Howe Johnson,\n       President and CEO, National Committee on Planned Giving.\n       With the Undersigned Organizations.\n\n  Organizations in Support of The Public Good IRA Rollover Act of 2007\n\n       AACA Museum, Inc., Hershey, PA; AARP, Washington, DC; \n     Acadiana Outreach Center, Lafayette, LA; AFL-CIO Community \n     Services Agency, St. Joseph, MO; Alameda Hospital Foundation, \n     Alameda, CA; Alamo Community College District Foundation, \n     Inc., San Antonio, TX; Alaska Planned Giving Council, \n     Anchorage, AK; Alberta Bair Theater for the Performing Arts, \n     Billings, MT; Albion Volunteer Service Organization, Albion, \n     MI; Allegany Franciscan Ministries, Clearwater, FL; Allegheny \n     College, Meadville, PA; ALL-GA, Atlanta, GA; Alliance for \n     Children and Families, Milwaukee, WI; Aloha United Way, \n     Honolulu, HI; American Arts Alliance, Washington, DC; \n     American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, \n     Washington, DC; American Association of Museums, Washington, \n     DC; American Association on Intellectual and Developmental \n     Disabilities, Washington, DC; American Autoimmune Related \n     Diseases Association, E.

A bill to establish demonstration projects to provide at-home \ninfant care benefits; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, last month marked the 14th anniversary \nof the enactment of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. This law \nhas enabled workers to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to attend to \nan ailing family member or to care for a newborn baby. Since this \nlandmark legislation was signed into law, more than 50 million working \nAmericans have been able to take critical time off when necessary \nwithout putting their jobs on the line.\n  The Family and Medical Leave Act was a critical first step in \nrecognizing the challenges that Americans face in achieving a family-\nwork balance. For nearly a decade and a half, it has provided the most \nbasic protections for workers who can afford to take unpaid leave. Yet, \n40 million workers cannot use the FMLA because they can't go without a \npaycheck. Throughout my career as a lawyer, mother, First Lady and \nSenator, I have sought solutions to the difficult challenges that \nworking parents face.\n  That is why I am pleased to reintroduce legislation, the Choice in \nChild Care Act of 2007, to meet the child care needs of working \nfamilies. My bill provides a modest and important option for families \nwho have none: the chance to stay home with their infants when there is \nno childcare available to them. This is the critical next step to \nensure low-income families welcoming children in their lives are \nafforded more economic security than they would have otherwise.\n  Bringing a new child into the world is one of the greatest joys a \nparent can experience, yet we also know that in the reality of today's \neconomy, most parents must work to provide economic security for their \nnewborns. In fact, 55 percent of women with infants younger than one \nyear of age are in the workforce. As a result, working parents are \nfaced with trying to provide economic security for their family while \nsimultaneously ensuring that their infant receives the quality of care \nthat he or she needs.\n  Research shows that the quality of caretaking in the first months and \nyears of life is critical to a newborn's brain development, social \ndevelopment and well-being. Yet there is currently a severe shortage of \nsafe, affordable, quality care for infants. The number of licensed \nchild care slots for infants meets only 18 percent of the need. The \nshortage is particularly acute in rural areas, and especially in rural \nareas that have many low-income residents.\n  Ideally, I think we would all agree that parents who need affordable, \nhigh-quality care for their infant would provide that care themselves. \nHowever we know that, in many low- and moderate-income families, having \na parent quit his or her job or reduce work hours to care for an infant \nis not financially viable. Doing so would plunge the family into an \neconomic crisis. Rather, parents should have the choice and greater \nflexibility in providing safe, quality care for their infants.\n  My legislation is modeled on creative programs States have \nestablished to provide low-income parents of infants a choice between \nreturning to work and using a State child care subsidy to care for \ntheir infant and caring for their infant themselves with a monthly \nchild care stipend. The Choices in Child Care Act would make these \nprograms available to families across the country.\n  My bill amends the Child Care Development Block Grant so that low- \nand moderate-income parents have the option of forgoing a State \nchildcare subsidy for infant care outside the home and instead \nreceiving a comparable stipend to provide the care themselves while \nkeeping the family economically stable. The bill would help parents \nbalance work and family, help meet the critical shortage of infant \nchild care, provide cost savings to state child care programs, support \nquality care for the critical first years of a child's development, and \nvalue parenting as a form of work.\n  This legislation supports families when they need it the most by \nproviding options for low and moderate income families when they need \nto care for an infant. In order to truly value families we need to make \nsure families at all income levels have options to do what is best for \nthem. The Choices in Child Care Act promotes family security by \nensuring low-income families have the chance to care for their infants \nat home and receive some, albeit modest, financial assistance.\n  As we move forward from the celebration of the 14th anniversary of \nthe Family and Medical Leave Act let us\n\n[[Page S2918]]\n\nrecognize the challenges Americans face in balancing work and family \nlife today. The time has come, with the new 110th Congress, to give \nparents additional resources and options in helping them address these \nchallenges. I urge my Senate colleagues from both sides of the aisle to \njoin me in supporting the Choices in Child Care Act of 2007.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Cardin, \n        and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 821. A bill to amend section 402 of the Personal Responsibility \nand Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 to provide for an \nextension of eligibility for supplemental security income through \nfiscal year 2010 for refugees, asylees, and certain other humanitarian \nimmigrants; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by my \ncolleague Senator Kohl, to reintroduce this important piece of \nlegislation. This legislation will work to ensure the United States \ngovernment does not turn its back on political asylees or refugees who \nare the most vulnerable citizens seeking safety in this great country \nof ours.\n  As many of you know, Congress modified the Supplemental Security \nIncome (SSI) program to include seven-year time limit on the receipt of \nbenefits for refugees and asylees. This policy was intended to balance \nthe desire to have people who emigrate to the United States to become \ncitizens, with an understanding that the naturalization process also \ntakes time to complete. To allow adequate time for asylees and refugees \nto become naturalized citizens, Congress provided the seven-year time \nlimit before the expiration of SSI benefits.\n  Unfortunately, the naturalization process often takes longer than \nseven years. Applicants are required to live in the United States for a \nminimum of five years prior to applying for citizenship. In addition to \nthat time period, their application process often can take three or \nmore years before resolution. Because of this time delay, many \nindividuals are trapped in the system faced with the loss of their SSI \nbenefits.\n  Many of these individuals are elderly who fled persecution or torture \nin their home countries. They include Jews fleeing religious \npersecution in the former Soviet Union, Iraqi Kurds fleeing the Saddam \nHussein regime, Cubans and Hmong people from the highlands of Laos who \nserved on the side of the United States military during the Vietnam \nWar. They are elderly and unable to work, and have become reliant on \ntheir SSI benefits as their primary income. To penalize them because of \ndelays encountered through the bureaucratic process seems unjust and \ninappropriate.\n  The administration in its fiscal year 2008 budget acknowledged the \nnecessity to correct this problem by dedicating funding to extend \nrefugee eligibility for SSI beyond the seven-year limit. While I am \npleased that they have taken the first step in correcting this problem, \nI am concerned the policy does not go far enough. Data shows that most \npeople will need at least an additional two years to navigate and \ncomplete the naturalization process. Therefore, my colleagues and I \nhave introduced this bill, which will provide a two-year extension. We \nbelieve this will provide the time necessary to complete the process.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this bill, and I look \nforward to working with Chairman Baucus and other members of the \nFinance Committee to secure these changes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 821\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``SSI Extension for Elderly \n     and Disabled Refugees Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SSI EXTENSION FOR HUMANITARIAN IMMIGRANTS.\n\n       Section 402(a)(2) of the Personal Responsibility and Work \n     Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (8 U.S.C. 1612(a)(2)) \n     is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(M) SSI extension through fiscal year 2010.--\n       ``(i) In general.--With respect to eligibility for benefits \n     for the specified Federal program described in paragraph \n     (3)(A), the 7-year period described in subparagraph (A) shall \n     be deemed to be a 9-year period during the period that begins \n     on the date of enactment of the SSI Extension for Elderly and \n     Disabled Refugees Act and ends on September 30, 2010.\n       ``(ii) Aliens whose benefits ceased in prior fiscal \n     years.--\n\n       ``(I) In general.--Beginning on the date of the enactment \n     of the SSI Extension for Elderly and Disabled Refugees Act, \n     any qualified alien rendered ineligible for the specified \n     Federal program described in paragraph (3)(A) during fiscal \n     years prior to the fiscal year in which such Act is enacted \n     solely by reason of the termination of the 7-year period \n     described in subparagraph (A) shall be eligible for such \n     program for an additional 2-year period in accordance with \n     this subparagraph, if such alien meets all other eligibility \n     factors under title XVI of the Social Security Act.\n       ``(II) Payment of benefits.--Benefits paid under \n     subparagraph (I) shall be paid prospectively over the \n     duration of the qualified alien's renewed eligibility.''.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator Smith \nto introduce the SSI Extension for Elderly and Disabled Refugees Act. \nThis is the third year that a bipartisan group of Senators will come \ntogether in support of this legislation to serve the individuals in our \nsociety who most need our help.\n  Due to short-sighted policy passed in the 1990's, elderly and \ndisabled humanitarian immigrants face a time limit of seven years on \neligibility for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits. Refugees \nand asylees have seven years to become citizens--an inadequate amount \nof time, given the bureaucratic delays and hurdles these individuals \nface. Thus, thousands have already lost their benefits, and tens of \nthousands more will lose this important benefit if Congress does not \nenact our legislation.\n  It is estimated that in the next decade, more than 40,000 elderly or \ndisabled humanitarian immigrants will lose their SSI benefits. This \nprogram is a safety net for those who need it; in 2007, the maximum SSI \nbenefit is $623 for an individual and $934 for a couple--barely enough \nto afford basic necessities. The program is structured to help those \nwith severe barriers to work or elderly individuals with little or no \nretirement income. To allow these benefits to expire is to take away a \nlifeline from the neediest individuals.\n  In Wisconsin, these individuals are often of Hmong descent. Many \nfought with the U.S. in Laos during the Vietnam War, providing critical \nassistance to U.S. forces. After the fall of Saigon, thousands of Hmong \nfled Laos and its communist Pathet Lao government. The United States \nremains indebted to these courageous individuals and their families.\n  In addition to the Hmong, America serves as a shelter for those faced \nwith persecution or torture in their own countries. Across the country, \nwe have heard their stories; whether Jews and Baptists fleeing \nreligious persecution in the former Soviet Union or Iraqis and Cubans \nescaping tyrannical dictatorships. Our policy toward refugees and \nasylees embodies the best of our country--compassion, opportunity, and \nfreedom.\n  Our legislation will bring the SSI program in line with our other \npolicies towards these humanitarian immigrants. This legislation \nextends the amount of time that refugees and asylees have to become \ncitizens to nine years. In addition, the bill contains a ``reach back'' \nprovision: it retroactively restores benefits to those individuals who \nhave already lost them for an additional two years. This provision \nhelps the individuals who need it most; humanitarian immigrants who are \ntrapped in the system and have lost this important income source.\n  I believe we must act now to protect these individuals--we cannot let \nanother year go by without action. Our country has long been a symbol \nof freedom, equality and opportunity. Our laws should reflect that. \nEvery day that goes by could result in the loss of a refugee's support \nsystem--I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and restore \nthe principles we were put here to protect.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n        Bunning, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Coleman, Mr.\n\n[[Page S2919]]\n\n        Smith, Mr. Allard, and Mr. Cornyn):\n  S. 822. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to improve \nand extend certain energy-related tax provisions, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation with \nSenators Feinstein, Kerry, Bunning, Bingaman, Salazar, Coleman, Smith, \nAllard and Cornyn that addresses the critical issue of the Nation's \nenergy policy, the EXTEND the Energy Efficiency Incentives Act of 2007. \nThe Senators have come together--given where we are as a Nation in \nterms of reliance on foreign oil . . . the historically high costs of \nenergy . . . the state of our environment . . . and the status of our \ntechnological know-how--to introduce realistic, doable legislation that \nrepresents one of the best opportunities for developing bipartisan \nconsensus on tax policy to further securing our nation and its future.\n  The EXTEND Act takes a comprehensive and practical approach to assure \nthat the United States targets the maximum possible energy savings on \nthe customer side of the meter and relief from high energy prices at \nthe lowest cost. It builds on the incentives for efficient buildings \nadopted in Energy Policy Act of 2005, EPAct 2005, and modifies them \nwhere necessary to achieve these policy goals.\n  The bill extends the temporary tax incentives for energy efficiency \nbuildings established in EPAct 2005, providing four years of assured \nincentives for most situations, and some additional time for projects \nwith particularly long lead times, such as commercial buildings. A \nsufficient length of time is needed by the business community to make \nrational investments as these buildings will be in use for at least 50 \nto 100 years. The bill is meant to incentivize not discourage. I want \nto encourage large and small businesses alike to make investments to \nqualify for energy efficiency tax incentives. Commercial buildings and \nlarge residential subdivisions have lead times for planning and \nconstruction of 2 to 4 years. This is why the EXTEND Act provides four \nyears of assured incentives for most situations, and some additional \ntime for projects with longer lead times.\n  Also, the EXTEND Act makes modifications to the EPAct 2005 incentives \nso that the incentives are not based on cost but based on actual \nperformance. These are measured by on-site ratings for whole buildings \nand factory ratings for products like solar water heaters and \nphotovoltaic systems as well as air conditioners, furnaces, and water \nheaters. The EXTEND bill provides a transition from the EPAct 2005 \nretrofit incentives, which are based partially on cost and partially on \nperformance, to a new system that can provide larger dollar amounts of \nincentives based truly on performance.\n  The bipartisan legislation also extends the applicability of the \nEPAct 2005 incentives so that the entire commercial and residential \nbuilding sectors are covered. The current EPAct 2005 incentives for new \nhomes are limited to owner-occupied properties or high rise buildings. \nOur bill extends these provisions to rental property and offers \nincentives whether the owner is an individual taxpayer or a \ncorporation. This extension does not increase costs significantly, but \nit does provide greater fairness and clearer market signals to builders \nand equipment manufacturers.\n  I have worked hard over the past six years for performance-based \nenergy tax incentives for commercial buildings--one third of energy \nusage is from the building sector, so there are great energy savings to \nbe made with the extension of these incentives. It is reasonable to \nexpect many annual benefits after 10 years if we put into place the \nappropriate incentives. For instance, direct savings of natural gas \nwould amount to 2 quads per year or 7 percent of total projected \nnatural gas use in 2017. And, to this figure must be added the indirect \ngas savings from reduced use of gas as an electricity generation fuel. \nTotal natural gas savings would be 35 quads per year, or 12 percent of \nnatural gas supply. Total electric peak power savings would be 115,000 \nmegawatts; almost 12 percent of projected nationwide electric capacity \nfor the year 2017.\n  In addition, reduction in greenhouse gas emissions would be 330 \nmillion metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, about 16 percent of the \ncarbon emissions reductions compared to the base case necessary to \nbring the U.S. into compliance with the Kyoto Protocol; or roughly 5 \npercent of projected U.S. emissions in 2017. Also, importantly, the \nbill will result in the creation, on net, of over 800,000 new jobs.\n  The value of energy savings should not be overlooked as both business \nand residential consumers will be saving over $50 billion annually in \nutility bills by 2018, as a direct result of the reductions in energy \nconsumption induced by the appropriate incentives. Also, the projected \ndecrease in natural gas prices will be saving businesses and households \nover an additional $30 billion annually.\n  The EXTEND Act is synonymous with the security of America's future. \nThe bill is a piece of an overall national energy picture that we need \nto address now. Consumers throughout the United States, from small \nbusinesses to families, are demanding leadership on energy prices. \nCongress should advance past rhetoric, gimmicks, and photo-ops and move \nto substantive energy policy legislation such as the EXTEND Act. It is \nimperative that Congress begin these policy discussions--we cannot wait \nfor yet another crisis.\n  I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues and the \nAdministration to provide the American people the leadership they \ndeserve on these issues. And I would like to add some of the \norganizations and industries that support this legislation as it is a \nformidable list: Alliance to Save Energy; American Public Power \nAssociation; American Standard Companies; American Chemistry Council; \nAmerican Council for an Energy-Efficient Commission; Anderson Windows, \nInc.; Building Owners and Managers Association International; \nCalifornia Energy Commission; Cardinal Glass Industries; The Dow \nChemical Company; DuPont; Edison Electric Institute; Environmental and \nEnergy Study Institute; Exelon Corporation; 3M Company; Manufactured \nHousing Institute; National Association of State Energy Officials; \nNational Electrical Manufacturers Association; Natural Resources \nDefense Council; New York State Energy Research and Development \nAuthority; North American Insulation Manufacturers Association; \nNortheast Public Power Association; Owens Corning; Pacific Gas & \nElectric Company; Plug Power, Inc.; Polyisocyanurate Insulation \nManufacturers Association; Public Service Electric and Gas Company; The \nReal Estate Roundtable; Residential Energy Services Network; Retail \nIndustry Leaders Association; Sacramento Municipal Utility District; \nSan Diego Gas and Electric Company; Southern California Gas Company; \nUnion of Concerned Scientists.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. OBAMA (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. \n        Clinton, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 823.

We have come a long way in equality for women since \nthat first International Women's Day in 1909. Yet, even as we celebrate \nthese victories, we must acknowledge and increase awareness of the \nmyriad struggles that women continue to face today. The battle against \nHIV/AIDS is one such struggle, and one that women in this Nation and \nacross the world are losing. And that is why today, I am reintroducing \nthe Microbicide Development Act, to help women protect themselves \nagainst deadly HIV infection.\n  The devastation that HIV/AIDS is causing around the world is, sadly, \nnot news to any of us. During a visit to Africa last August, I was \nreminded of this tragedy. I visited an HIV/AIDS hospital in South \nAfrica that was filled to capacity with people who walked hours--even \ndays--just for the chance to seek help. I saw just a few of the 15 \nmillion orphans in Africa who lost their parents to this epidemic. All \nthe while, I\n\n[[Page S2920]]\n\nremembered in the back of my mind that in some areas, 90 percent of \nthose infected with HIV are unaware of their status, and this epidemic \nwill only continue to get worse.\n  But what we don't always focus on is the particular devastation HIV/\nAIDS is bringing to women worldwide. As of 2006, nearly half of the \nover 37 million adults living with HIV/AIDS worldwide were women. In \nsub-Saharan Africa, the prevalence of HIV/AIDS is 3 times higher among \nwomen ages 15 to 24 than among men of that age group. The severity of \nthe problem hits close to home as well, with HIV/AIDS being the leading \ncause of death for African American women ages 25 to 34.\n  Women have unique biological vulnerabilities that make them twice as \nlikely as men to contract HIV from an infected partner during \nintercourse. And for many women, particularly in the developing world, \nsocial and cultural norms deny them the ability to insist on mutual \nmonogamy or condom use, thus limiting their tools for prevention. In \nmany situations, women who become infected have only one partner--their \nhusband. In fact, studies in India have shown that among women infected \nwith HIV, 93 percent were married, and 91 percent overall had only one \npartner--their husbands. Focusing solely on ABC's--abstain, be \nfaithful, use condoms--is clearly failing these women. There is a \nnaivety in thinking that abstinence and fidelity are real options for \nall men and women around the world, and so we have a moral obligation \nto expand prevention tools.\n  Yet despite the fact that women have been increasingly devastated by \nthis disease, female-initiated methods of prevention are limited and \ncurrent prevention options are not enough.\n  Topical microbicides represent a woman-initiated method of prevention \nthat would put the power of prevention in the hands of women. \nMathematical models predict that even a partially effective microbicide \ncould prevent 2.5 million infections over 3 years and that gradual \nintroduction of newer and better microbicides could ultimately save a \ngeneration of women. Topical microbicides, therefore, represent a \ncritical element in a comprehensive strategy to fight the HIV/AIDS \npandemic.\n  A number of groups, including the International Partnership for \nMicrobicides, the Alliance for Microbicide Development, the National \nWomen's Health Network, the Global Campaign for Microbicides, and the \nGates Foundation, have led the effort to develop a prevention tool for \nuse by women. The National Institutes of Health has invested in \nmicrobicides research, including support for the newly formed \nMicrobicides Trial Network. I would be remiss if I did not also \nrecognize the efforts of the CDC and USAID in microbicide development. \nWith 10 microbicide candidates currently in clinical development and \nover 30 in preclinical development, we are making headway in this \nfield.\n  But we cannot let this momentum slow. We must continue to prioritize \nmicrobicide research and development. Increased Federal support and \ncoordination, which is provided for in the Microbicide Development Act, \nwill give a clear sign that the Federal Government is willing to put \nforth the effort critical to the development of an effective product to \nprotect our mothers, daughters, sisters, and other loved ones. I echo \nthe words of Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of \nAllergy and Infectious Diseases, who said that, ``with leadership, \ncollaborative effort, sufficient financial resources, and product \ndevelopment expertise, a microbicide is within reach.'' Congress should \nsupport our Federal health agencies and their partners in their \nefforts, and passage of the Microbicide Development Act would give an \nunambiguous indication that this work is a priority for all of us.\n  In closing, I point out that we have made tremendous strides in \nmedical treatment for individuals infected with HIV/AIDS. But this \ntreatment comes with a price tag that is unsustainable. Between 2003 \nand 2005, for every one person receiving anti-retroviral treatment, ten \nmore individuals became infected. We are not able to treat all of those \ncurrently infected let alone this exponentially growing number of \nindividuals who will need treatment down the line. Universal treatment \ntoday would cost roughly $7 billion. Given that we only fund PEPFAR and \nthe Global Fund at $2 billion, that $7 billion price tag, which is only \ngoing to grow, appears rather daunting. This financial situation serves \nto underscore the moral obligation we have to invest in microbicides \nand other prevention tools. Let us hope that during International \nWomen's Days to come, we will be celebrating tremendous success in the \nfight against HIV/AIDS rather than the loss of yet another generation \nof women.\n  I thank you for this time, and I urge my colleagues to support the \nMicrobicide Development Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 830. A bill to improve the process for the development of needed \npediatric medial devices; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Pediatric \nMedical Device Safety and Improvement Act of 2007. This legislation \nprovides a comprehensive approach to ensuring that children are not \nleft behind as cutting-edge research and revolutionary technologies for \nmedical devices advance. Like drugs, where for too long children were \ntreated like small adults and could just be given reduced doses of \nadult products, many essential medical devices used extensively by \npediatricians are not designed or sized for children. In fact, the \ndevelopment of new medical devices suitable for children's smaller and \ngrowing bodies can lag 5 or 10 years behind those for adults.\n  While children and adults suffer from many of the same diseases and \nconditions, their device needs can vary considerably due to differences \nin size, rates of growth, critical development periods, anatomy, \nphysiological differences such as breathing and heart rate, and \nphysical activity levels. To date, because the pediatric market is so \nsmall and pediatric diseases relatively rare, there has been little \nincentive for device manufacturers to focus their attention on \nchildren. The result has been that pediatric providers must resort to \n``jury-rigging'' or fashioning make-shift device solutions for \npediatric use. When that is not an option, providers may be forced to \nuse more invasive treatment or less effective therapies.\n  For example, at present, left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) do \nnot exist in the U.S. for children less than 5 years old. An LVAD is a \nmechanical pump that helps a heart that is too weak to pump blood \nthrough the body. So, infants and children under five years of age who \nhave critical failure of their left or right ventricles have to be \nsupported through extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). An ECMO \nconsists of a pump, an artificial lung, a blood warmer and an arterial \nfilter, which is installed by inserting tubes into large veins or \narteries located in the right side of the neck or the groin. While \nECMOs can help children for short periods of time, they are \nproblematic. They can cause dangerous clots and the blood thinners that \nprevent these clots may lead to internal bleeding. In addition, \nchildren must remain bedridden while using the device.\n  For young children needing to be on a ventilator to assist their \nbreathing, the lack of non-invasive ventilators with masks that \nsuitably fit babies has led to respiratory treatments that are \ninadequate or invasive treatment options such as placing a tube in the \nbaby's throat.\n  Children needing prosthetic heart valves face a disproportionately \nhigh failure rate. Because of the biochemistry of children's growing \nbodies, prosthetic heart valves implanted in children calcify and \ndeteriorate much faster than in adults. Typically, children with a \nheart valve implant who survive to adulthood will need four or five \noperations. Additionally, devices currently available for children must \nbe better able to expand and grow as the child grows.\n  Over the past several years, efforts have been launched to better \nidentify barriers to the development of pediatric devices and to \ngenerate solutions for improving children's access to needed medical \ndevices.\n  Beginning in June 2004, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the \nElizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, the\n\n[[Page S2921]]\n\nNational Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD), the National \nAssociation of Children's Hospitals, and the Advanced Medical \nTechnology Association (AdvaMed) hosted a series of stakeholders \nmeetings that yielded recommendations for improving the availability of \npediatric devices. In October 2004, in response to a directive in the \nMedical Devices Technical Corrections Act of 2004, the Food and Drug \nAdministration (FDA) released a report that identified numerous \nbarriers to the development and approval of medical devices for \nchildren. And in July 2005, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) issued a \nreport on the adequacy of postmarket surveillance of pediatric medical \ndevices, as mandated by the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization \nAct of 2002. The IOM found significant flaws in safety monitoring and \nrecommended expanding the FDA's ability to require post-market studies \nof certain products and improve public access to information about \npost-market pediatric studies.\n  This legislation seeks to address the equally important issues of \npediatric medical device safety and availability. To begin with, the \nbill creates a mechanism to allow the FDA to track the number and types \nof medical devices approved specifically for children or for conditions \nthat occur in children. It also allows the FDA to use adult data to \nsupport a determination of reasonable assurance of effectiveness in \npediatric populations and to extrapolate data between pediatric \nsubpopulations.\n  The market for pediatric medical devices simply isn't what it is for \nadults. Therefore, many device manufacturers have been reluctant to \nmake devices for children. The bill creates an incentive for companies \nby modifying the existing Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) provision \nto allow manufacturers to profit from devices that are specifically \ndesigned to meet a pediatric need.\n  To prevent abuse, the bill reverts to current law which allows no \nprofit on sales of devices that exceed the number estimated to be \nneeded for the approved condition. This provision is modeled after the \nexisting Orphan Products Division designation process. Under no \ncircumstances can there be a profit on sales if the device is used to \ntreat or diagnose diseases or conditions affecting more than 4,000 \nindividuals in the U.S. per year which is the same number allowed under \ncurrent law. Already approved adult HDEs upon date of enactment are \neligible for the HDE profit modification but only if they meet the \nconditions of the bill. The lifting of the profit restriction for new \npediatric HDEs sunsets in 2013 and the FDA is required to issue a \nreport on its impact within five years.\n  In order to encourage pediatric medical device research, the bill \nrequires the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to designate a point \nof contact at the agency to help innovators and physicians access \nfunding for pediatric medical device development. It also requires the \nNIH, the FDA, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) \nto submit a plan for pediatric medical device research that identifies \ngaps in such research and proposes a research agenda for addressing \nthem. In identifying the gaps, the plan can include a survey of \npediatric medical providers regarding unmet pediatric medical device \nneeds.\n  To better foster innovation in the private sector, the bill \nestablishes demonstration grants for non-profit consortia to promote \npediatric device development, including matchmaking between inventors \nand manufacturers and Federal resources. These demonstration grants, \nwhich are authorized for $6 million annually, require the federal \ngovernment to mentor and help manage pediatric device projects through \nthe development process, including product identification, prototype \ndesign, device development and marketing. Under the bill, grantees must \ncoordinate with the NIH's pediatric devices point of contact to \nidentify research issues that require further study and with the FDA to \nhelp facilitate approval of pediatric indications.\n  Finally, in its 2005 report on pediatric medical device safety, the \nIOM found serious flaws in the postmarket safety surveillance of these \ndevices. The legislation allows FDA to require postmarket studies as a \ncondition of clearance for certain categories of devices. This includes \n``a class II or class III device the failure of which would be \nreasonably likely to have serious adverse health consequences or is \nintended to be (1) implanted in the human body for more than one year, \nor (2) a life sustaining or life supporting device used outside a \ndevice user facility.''\n  The legislation also gives the FDA the ability to require studies \nlonger than three years with respect to a device that is to have \nsignificant use in pediatric populations if such studies would be \nnecessary to address longer-term pediatric questions, such as the \nimpact on growth and development. And, it establishes a publicly \naccessible database of postmarket study commitments that involve \nquestions about device use in pediatric populations.\n  The legislation I am introducing today has been many years in the \nmaking. Last year, I introduced this legislation with Senator DeWine \nand I thank him for working with me on it and many other initiatives to \nimprove children's health. I would like to also thank the Elizabeth \nGlaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, the American Academy of Pediatrics, \nthe American Thoracic Society and the National Organization for Rare \nDisorders for their tireless work and support for this legislation. The \nbill I am introducing today is supported by the Advanced Medical \nTechnology Association (AdvaMed) and its member company Stryker and I \nthank them for their support. The bill reflects many of the comments \nthey provided throughout the development of this legislation and I am \npleased that they join me today in supporting its passage. Several \nother device manufacturers including Respironics, Seleon, and Breas \nMedical AB have previously supported this legislation and I would like \nto recognize and thank them for their continued support of the bill.\n  I look forward to working with patient groups, physicians, industry \nand my colleagues--including the Chairman and Ranking Member of the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Senators Kennedy and \nEnzi--to move this legislation when the Committee considers medical \ndevice-related legislation. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation and I am hopeful that it will become law as soon as \npossible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 830\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize States and local governments to prohibit \nthe investment of State assets in any company that has a qualifying \nbusiness relationship with Sudan; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to again raise the issue of \nDarfur. I may not match the tenacity of former Senator William \nProxmire. You see, he came to the Senate floor every day--every day--\nfor 19 years urging the Senate to ratify the 1948 Convention on \nGenocide. Finally, Senator\n\n[[Page S2924]]\n\nProxmire prevailed. Finally, the United States became a signatory to \nthis historic international agreement. We were one of the last, but we \nwere on board.\n  The reason I come to the Chamber today to speak is because having \nnoted the presence of the need for an international agreement on \ngenocide, having acknowledged that a genocide is taking place in Darfur \nin the Sudan, a simple honest answer is we have done little or nothing \nabout it.\n  I have tried each week to come to the Chamber to again highlight the \nsituation and to propose what the United States can do. It is worth \nputting this matter in context. Several times in the history of this \nworld, we have witnessed genocides of horrific proportion. One of the \nmost recently noted tragedies, of course, involved 6 million Jews and \nothers who were killed in the Holocaust in World War II.\n  When I was a young college student in Washington at Georgetown \nUniversity, my first year I had an amazing professor whose name was Jan \nKarski. Karski was born in Poland. He was a member of the Polish \nunderground resisting the Nazis in World War II. He used to come to our \nclasses ramrod straight with military bearing, always dressed \nimpeccably in starched white shirt and tie and would speak to us about \ngovernment. He would intersperse his lectures with stories of his life.\n  I was fascinated with Dr. Karski. He told the story as a young man \ncoming to Washington, DC, in the midst of World War II. He came here \nbecause he knew what was happening. He knew about the Holocaust, he \nknew about the concentration camps, and he knew something had to be \ndone. So he came to war-weary Washington and tried to find someone \nreceptive to his message.\n  He went from office to office, finally securing a meeting with \nPresident Roosevelt but never quite convincing the highest level of our \nGovernment in those days, trying to tell them, yes, there are \nconcentration camps; yes, innocent people were being killed; yes, there \nwas a Holocaust and something needs to be done.\n  Dr. Karski told us in these lectures that he left Washington empty-\nhanded and despondent. Unfortunately, he never convinced America to \nact, and, unfortunately, the Holocaust continued.\n  I used to puzzle over this and imagine: How could it be? How could \nthe people of a great Nation such as America stand back and not do \nanything if people were alerting them to the reality of genocide, the \nkilling of innocent people? Sadly, I have come to understand it now \nbecause 4 years ago we declared a genocide was taking place in Darfur \nin Sudan. It was an amazing declaration, it was a courageous \ndeclaration by this Bush administration. The President, along with \nSecretary of State Colin Powell, and now Secretary of State Condoleezza \nRice, have been unsparing in their criticism of the Sudanese \nGovernment, and they have used that word, ``genocide.'' But the sad \nreality is, having made this declaration, we have done nothing--\nnothing.\n  The President said early on he would not allow a genocide to occur on \nhis watch. I have reminded him--and I am sure it is painful to hear--\nthat his watch is coming to an end and the genocide continues and \nAmerica continues to do nothing.\n  Today I am joined by my colleagues, Senator John Cornyn of Texas, \nSenator Specter of Pennsylvania, and Senator Lieberman of Connecticut \nin introducing the Sudan Divestment Authorization Act of 2007. This \nbill is designed to support the actions of seven States that have \nalready passed divestment laws and the dozens more that are considering \nlegislation.\n  The first of these States, I am proud to say, is the home State of \nthis Senator and the Presiding Officer, the State of Illinois. Our \nfriend and your former colleague, Mr. President, Jackie Collins, has \nled this fight. She is tenacious, and she is great to have on your \nteam.\n  Over 50 universities and municipalities have also chosen to divest \ntheir portfolios of companies that directly or indirectly support the \ngenocidal Sudanese Government. Countless individual Americans have made \nthis same choice. These States, universities, and individuals have said \nthey do not want their pensions or other investments to support a \ngovernment that is carrying out mass atrocities against its own people.\n  In this morning's Washington Post, there is a graphic story written \nby Travis Fox of a visit to a refugee camp at Chad. I know the \nPresiding Officer has visited the refugee camps in Chad and has seen \nfirsthand what is happening there: 230,000--230,000--Darfur refugees \nhave streamed across the border and live in 12 United Nations-\nadministered camps.\n  This heartbreaking story shows an emaciated young boy being fed by \nhis mother. It goes on to say that so many of these children are dying \nof malnutrition, even in the refugee camps. They are trying to get this \npoor little boy to eat some food, which he thinks is horrible and spits \nout. He would rather go hungry than eat what he is being given.\n  These children are dying in these refugee camps and, sadly, more \npeople are streaming to these camps because of the ongoing genocide in \nDarfur.\n  As many as 450,000 people, according to Human Rights Watch, have died \nfrom disease and violence in this genocide; 2.5 million people have \nbeen displaced since the fighting began. The United Nations reports \nthat in the second half of the year 2006, 12 humanitarian workers were \nkilled and 38 compounds were attacked.\n  This morning's paper also includes a report that members of the \nAfrican Union and the peacekeepers who are valiantly trying to bring \npeace to this area are now being killed as well. Mr. President, 7,000 \nmembers of the African Union are there; 7,000 troops are policing an \narea as large as the State of Texas. Imagine, if you will, trying to \ncontain the violence of a militia who is hellbent on killing innocent \npeople, raping and pillaging with 7,000 soldiers. Even the best \nsoldiers couldn't rise to that challenge. That is why America must rise \nto this challenge.\n  As I mentioned, divestment is one tool. It is not what I would \nprefer, but it is a move in the right direction. Our bill recognizes \nthat divestment should be undertaken only in rare circumstances, but \ndeclarations of genocide by both the President and the Congress provide \nall the justification needed for these State and local efforts which \nour bill will support.\n  This bipartisan bill affirms it is the sense of Congress that States \nand other entities should be permitted to provide for the divestment of \nassets as an expression of opposition to the genocide and policies of \nthe Khartoum Government.\n  It also expresses the sense of Congress that such State divestment \nlaws are consistent with our Constitution and that, for example, they \ndo not run afoul of the foreign commerce clause of the Federal foreign \naffairs power. The bill recognizes that nongovernmental organizations \nworking in Sudan on humanitarian efforts or companies that are \noperating under Federal permit or to promote health or religious \nactivities, for example, should not be classified as supporting the \nSudanese Government.\n  We do not want to hinder the fine work that is being done by \nnongovernmental organizations, humanitarian organizations. What we want \nto do is put pressure on this Government in Khartoum to change this \ndeadly policy which they have followed now for years.\n  This is a targeted bill. It is aimed at supporting State and local \nefforts in America to do the right thing.\n  Along with my colleague, Senator Brownback, last fall I sent a letter \nto every Governor in the country whose State had not divested urging \nthem to do so. I sent a similar letter to every university president in \nmy State making the same request. I am proud to say that Northwestern \nUniversity in Evanston, IL, and its president, Henry Bienen, had \nalready quietly taken steps to divest of major companies operating in \nSudan. President Bienen has been to Sudan. He has had a life experience \nthere. He understands this on a personal basis. I met with him. I \napplaud him for his leadership.\n  Sadly, some universities have said no. Incredibly, they have said no. \nOne university president of a major university in Illinois called me to \nexplain why they could not bring themselves to divest of their \ninvestments in Sudan where this genocide is taking place. He gave a \nlong, tortured explanation\n\n[[Page S2925]]\n\nabout university policy. I asked him one question: Do you believe there \nis a genocide taking place in Darfur? There was a long silence. Then he \nsaid: Well, I guess I don't know. I said: Until you can answer that \nquestion, you shouldn't make this decision. Others have looked at the \nfacts, and they have decided that genocide is taking place. I ask you: \nIf you come to that same conclusion that a genocide is taking place, my \nnext question is very simple and straightforward: What are you going to \ndo about it?\n  I believe we have a moral responsibility. It goes beyond any \npolitical debate and any partisanship. I am glad the cosponsors of this \nlegislation, which I am now putting before the Senate, are bipartisan \nin nature.\n  When I sent out these letters, incidentally, I had a wake-up call \npersonally. A reporter called and said: So you are all for divestment, \nare you, Senator Durbin? Oh, yes, I am committed to it. Guess what, \nSenator. We went through the handful of mutual funds you and your wife \nown and one has investments in Sudan. I was stunned. I said: I will \nsell immediately, which I did. It wasn't very painful to my portfolio, \nbut I felt a little better when it was done.\n  It doesn't take much, but it is a reminder that change begins at \nhome. Eleanor Roosevelt, who helped create and serve as the first chair \nof the United Nations Human Rights Commission once posed that famous \nquestion:\n\n       Where, after all, do universal human rights begin?\n\n  She answered:\n\n       Human rights begin in small places, close to home--so close \n     and so small that they cannot be seen on any maps of the \n     world. Yet they are the world of the individual person; the \n     neighborhood he lives in; the school or college he attends; \n     the factory, farm, or office where he works. Such are the \n     places where every man, woman, and child seeks equal justice, \n     equal opportunity, equal dignity without discrimination. \n     Unless these rights have meaning there, they have little \n     meaning anywhere. Without concerted citizen action to uphold \n     them close to home, we shall look in vain for progress in the \n     larger world.\n\n  That statement embodies the spirit that drives the divestment \nmovement.\n  The Darfur movement in this country was born on college campuses with \nidealistic youth, but it has now spread across the Nation. The effort \nto divest is a struggle that students are continuing to have with the \nadministrators in my home State and across the country.\n  These students are carrying on a legacy, a legacy of those students \nwho came before them, who led the movement to divest from South Africa \nin order to starve apartheid, the rank discrimination and bigotry of \nour time in the great country of South Africa.\n  South Africa changed because of the courage and capabilities of \npeople such as Nelson Mandela, who led one of the most remarkable \nrevolutions of my time. Change will come in Sudan when Sudanese leaders \nare convinced or compelled to change. But the divestment movement \nhelped to drive the process in South Africa, and it can help drive the \nprocess in Sudan today.\n  This bill is only a start, but it isn't the end of the discussion. \nDivestment is a useful tool but just that--only one tool among many we \nshould be considering.\n  Yesterday, the Special Envoy to Sudan, Andrew Natsios, met with \nPresident Bashir in Khartoum. The press reported that it was a 20-\nminute meeting. I don't know how productive it was. It wasn't the first \ntime they have met and, sadly, all the previous times have not led to \nany decision by the Khartoum Government to bring the militia under \ncontrol, which is wreaking havoc and causing this genocide which is \nkilling thousands and displacing hundreds of thousands of people.\n  Special Envoy Natsios has talked about what now has publicly been \ndisclosed and described as Plan B. The biggest export of Sudan, no \nsurprise, is oil. How is the oil exported? Through different \ncompanies--including companies owned by the Chinese, India, and \nMalaysia. Special Envoy Natsios told us that if the Sudanese Government \ndid not respond by allowing U.N. peacekeepers to come in and protect \nthese innocent people living in their villages by January 1 of this \nyear, he would encourage the administration to move on Plan B, which \ncalls for economic sanctions against the oil transactions coming out of \nSudan.\n  January 1 has come and gone. According to the press reports, the \nPresident has ordered the Treasury Department to prepare a menu of \noptions that would directly affect the Khartoum Government. I believe \nthe President should use this list of options to enact additional \nmeaningful sanctions immediately.\n  I have spoken to the President twice personally. I have spoken to \nSecretary of State Condoleezza Rice. I have tried to raise my voice on \nevery occasion to urge them to do something and do it now. People are \ndying, people are starving to death. This genocide continues on our \nwatch, America.\n  Today's sanctions program is based on Executive orders signed by \nPresident Clinton in 1997 and President Bush in 2006 and on the Darfur \nPeace and Accountability Act and a host of other laws that provide \nadditional mechanisms. The menu of options is there.\n  Sudan produces 500,000 barrels of oil a year, 40 percent of which is \nexported. We can find a way to stop the revenue stream leaving Sudan \nand the money coming back into that country. I hope that is on the menu \nbeing presented to the Government.\n  New laws are not required for the President to enact these sanctions. \nHe doesn't have to wait on Congress or a long debate. He has the power. \nIt might, however, speed action along if Congress passed legislation to \nencourage him.\n  This week, the State Department released its annual Country Reports \non Human Rights Practices. Imagine that, the United States each year \nboldly announces a report card on the rest of the world and how well \nthey are doing in the area of human rights. Let me read a portion of \nthat report on Sudan, a report from our own State Department, and I \nquote:\n\n       While all sides in Darfur violated international human \n     rights and humanitarian law, the government and the Janjaweed \n     militia continue to bear responsibility for genocide that \n     occurred in Darfur. During the year the government, Arab \n     militia forces, and Darfur rebel groups reportedly killed \n     several thousand civilians.\n       By year's end, there were more than 2 million internally \n     displaced persons in Darfur, and another 234,000 that fled \n     into Chad, a neighboring country, where the U.N. High \n     Commissioner for Refugees coordinated a massive refugees \n     relief effort. According to the United Nations, more than \n     200,000 persons have died since 2003 as a result of the \n     violence and forced displacement. The government continues to \n     support the largely Arab nomad Janjaweed militia, which \n     terrorized and killed civilians, raped women, and burned and \n     pillaged the region.\n       During the year, the government resumed aerial bombardment \n     of civilian targets, including homes, schools, and markets. \n     There were no reports that the government of Sudan prosecuted \n     or otherwise penalized attacking militias or made efforts to \n     protect civilian victims from attacks. Government forces \n     provided logistic and transportation support, weapons, and \n     ammunition to progovernment militias throughout the country.\n\n  That is the report of our Government about ongoing genocide to which \nwe have not responded.\n  The report goes on to detail attacks by helicopter gunships and \nbombers as well as ground assaults by both Janjaweed militia and \nuniformed soldiers. It also describes widespread and systemic sexual \nviolence against women and children, often carried out by men in \nuniform. Some women who reported these rapes to the Sudanese police \nwere then arrested for reporting them. During this year of violence, \nthe Sudanese Government conducted only one single successful \nprosecution of a rapist, a man who was convicted of assaulting an 11-\nyear-old girl. It is unclear how many violations have been prosecuted.\n  The report from the State Department also describes how the Sudanese \nGovernment systematically restricts humanitarian access to Darfur. The \nGovernment denies and delays visas and harasses and arrests \nhumanitarian workers. This is all part of an effort to cut off the food \nand medicine humanitarian groups are bringing into Darfur.\n\n  The mere presence of international aid workers helps safeguard people \nin the camps as well. That is one more reason Khartoum tries to keep \nthem out. Rebel groups add to the violence by attacking humanitarian \nworkers as well, stealing their vehicles and supplies. According to the \nreport, both the rebel groups and the government-supported militias use \nchild soldiers to help fight their battles.\n\n[[Page S2926]]\n\n  The State Department's Human Rights Report is just the latest \ntestament to the atrocities that continue to unfold in Darfur.\n  Mr. President, it is time the world brought these crimes against \nhumanity to a halt. We do that by taking steps that we can in the \nUnited States--starting with supporting divestment and imposing tougher \nsanctions, and we should go to the United Nations and demand a vote. We \nhave been told over and over again that if we ask the United Nations to \nget involved, it is likely that one country on the Security Council--\nand many point to China--will veto that request. Well, so be it. Let us \nhave this vote, let us be on the record, let us say that in the midst \nof genocide, we forced the issue to a vote and the United States voted \non the side of compassion and humanity. Let those countries threatening \na veto explain their position.\n  I thank my colleagues, Senator Cornyn, Senator Specter, and Senator \nLieberman for joining me in this step we take today to support State \nand local divestment. Many people wonder what one or two Senators can \naccomplish. We are fortunate in the State of Illinois to have a legacy \nof some great people who have served in the Senate, from both political \nparties. The Presiding Officer and I were fortunate to count as a \nfriend a former U.S. Senator, the late Paul Simon.\n  In 1994, when the Rwanda genocide was unfolding, Paul Simon saw it, \nand he went to Jim Jeffords, a Republican Senator from Vermont, and he \nsaid: We have to do something; innocent people are being hacked to \ndeath in Rwanda. He and Senator Jeffords then called Romeo Dallaire, \nthe U.N. Peacekeeping General in Rwanda at the time in 1994, and they \nasked: What will it take to stop the killing? He said: It will take \n5,000 equipped soldiers, and I can stop this massacre--only 5,000. So \nSenator Simon and Senator Jeffords called down to the Clinton White \nHouse and said: We need to talk to somebody about getting 5,000 \nsoldiers in to stop a massacre. Their call went unheeded. There was no \nresponse. President Clinton now apologizes today, saying it was one of \nthe worst foreign policy decisions of his administration. I respect his \nhonesty and candor, but the fact is, no soldiers were sent.\n  Recently, a little over a year ago, I visited Rwanda for the first \ntime. I went to Hotel Rwanda, made famous by the movie, Hotel des Mille \nCollines, where a brave little hotel manager played the role of Oscar \nSchindler in his time. He started harboring people who otherwise would \nhave been killed in the streets of Kigali, Rwanda. It was harrowing to \nwalk through the hotel and imagine what life was like; to know that 11 \nyears before, people huddled, afraid they were about to be pulled out \nand killed in the streets. You would look down at this beautiful, \ncrystal-clear swimming pool and realize it was the water in that pool \nthat sustained them during that period.\n  I went down the hill from that hotel to a red brick Catholic church, \nknown as Ste. Famille. I looked inside during the early morning, and I \nwent back to the hotel. Someone in the hotel said: That is a famous \nchurch. A thousand people sought asylum as refugees in that church but, \nunfortunately, the doors were opened and a thousand people were hacked \nto death in that church.\n  That is the reality of genocide. It is the reality of Rwanda, and it \nis the reality of Darfur. It is a reality we cannot ignore. We have the \npower. The question is, Do we have the will?\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 831\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Sudan Divestment \n     Authorization Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On July 22, 2004, the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives passed concurrent resolutions declaring that \n     ``the atrocities unfolding in Darfur, Sudan, are genocide''.\n       (2) On June 30, 2005, President Bush affirmed that ``the \n     violence in Darfur region is clearly genocide [and t]he human \n     cost is beyond calculation''.\n       (3) The Darfur Peace and Accountability Act of 2006, which \n     was signed into law on October 13, 2006, reaffirms that ``the \n     genocide unfolding in the Darfur region of Sudan is \n     characterized by acts of terrorism and atrocities directed \n     against civilians, including mass murder, rape, and sexual \n     violence committed by the Janjaweed and associated militias \n     with the complicity and support of the National Congress \n     Party-led faction of the Government of Sudan''.\n       (4) Several States and governmental entities, through \n     legislation and other means, have expressed their desire, or \n     are considering measures--\n       (A) to divest any equity in, or to refuse to provide debt \n     capital to, certain companies that operate in Sudan; and\n       (B) to disassociate themselves and the beneficiaries of \n     their public pension and endowment funds from directly or \n     indirectly supporting the Darfur genocide.\n       (5) Efforts of States and other governmental entities to \n     divest their pension funds and other investments of companies \n     that operate in Sudan build upon the legal and historical \n     legacy of the anti-apartheid movement in the United States, a \n     movement which contributed to the end of apartheid in South \n     Africa and the holding of free elections in that country in \n     1994.\n       (6) Although divestment measures should be employed \n     judiciously and sparingly, declarations of genocide by \n     Congress and the President justify such action.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) States and other governmental entities should be \n     permitted to provide for the divestment of certain State \n     assets within their jurisdictions as an expression of \n     opposition to the genocidal actions and policies of the \n     Government of Sudan; and\n       (2) a divestment measure authorized under section 5 does \n     not violate the United States Constitution because such a \n     measure--\n       (A) is not preempted under the Supremacy Clause;\n       (B) does not constitute an undue burden on foreign or \n     interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause; and\n       (C) does not intrude on, or interfere with, the conduct of \n     foreign affairs of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 4.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Border Law Enforcement \n     Relief Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. __02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) It is the obligation of the Federal Government of the \n     United States to adequately secure the Nation's borders and \n     prevent the flow of undocumented persons and illegal drugs \n     into the United States.\n       (2) Despite the fact that the United States Border Patrol \n     apprehends over 1,000,000 people each year trying to \n     illegally enter the United States, according to the \n     Congressional Research Service, the net growth in the number \n     of unauthorized aliens has increased by approximately 500,000 \n     each year. The Southwest border accounts for approximately 94 \n     percent of all migrant apprehensions each year. Currently, \n     there are an estimated 11,000,000 unauthorized aliens in the \n     United States.\n       (3) The border region is also a major corridor for the \n     shipment of drugs. According to the El Paso Intelligence \n     Center, 65 percent of the narcotics that are sold in the \n     markets of the United States enter the country through the \n     Southwest Border.\n       (4) Border communities continue to incur significant costs \n     due to the lack of adequate border security. A 2001 study by \n     the United States-Mexico Border Counties Coalition found that \n     law enforcement and criminal justice expenses associated with \n     illegal immigration exceed $89,000,000 annually for the \n     Southwest border counties.\n       (5) In August 2005, the States of New Mexico and Arizona \n     declared states of emergency in order to provide local law \n     enforcement immediate assistance in addressing criminal \n     activity along the Southwest border.\n       (6) While the Federal Government provides States and \n     localities assistance in covering costs related to the \n     detention of certain criminal aliens and the prosecution of \n     Federal drug cases, local law enforcement along the border \n     are provided no assistance in covering such expenses and must \n     use their limited resources to combat drug trafficking, human \n     smuggling, kidnappings, the destruction of private property, \n     and other border-related crimes.\n       (7) The United States shares 5,525 miles of border with \n     Canada and 1,989 miles with Mexico. Many of the local law \n     enforcement agencies located along the border are small, \n     rural departments charged with patrolling large areas of \n     land. Counties along the Southwest United States-Mexico \n     border are some of the poorest in the country and lack the \n     financial resources to cover the additional costs associated \n     with illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and other border-\n     related crimes.\n       (8) Federal assistance is required to help local law \n     enforcement operating along the border address the unique \n     challenges that arise as a result of their proximity to an \n     international border and the lack of overall border security \n     in the region\n\n     SEC. __03.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This part may be cited as the ``Global Pathogen \n     Surveillance Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 1642. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The frequency of the occurrence of biological events \n     that could threaten the national security of the United \n     States has increased and is likely increasing. The threat to \n     the United States from such events includes threats from \n     diseases that infect humans, animals, or plants regardless of \n     whether such diseases are introduced naturally, accidentally, \n     or intentionally.\n       (2) The United States lacks an effective and real-time \n     system to detect, identify, contain, and respond to global \n     threats and also lacks an effective mechanism to disseminate \n     information to the national response community if such \n     threats arise.\n       (3) Bioterrorism poses a grave national security threat to \n     the United States. The insidious nature of a bioterrorist \n     attack, the likelihood that the recognition of such an attack \n     would be delayed, and the underpreparedness of the domestic \n     public health infrastructure to respond to such an attack \n     could result in catastrophic consequences following a \n     biological weapons attack against the United States.\n       (4) The ability to recognize that a country or organization \n     is carrying out a covert biological weapons program is \n     dependent on a number of indications and warnings. A critical \n     component of this recognition is the timely detection of \n     sentinel events such as laboratory accidents and community-\n     level outbreaks that could be the earliest indication of an \n     emerging bioterrorist program in a foreign country. Early \n     detection of such events may enable earlier \n     counterproliferation intervention.\n       (5) A contagious pathogen engineered as a biological weapon \n     and developed, tested, produced, or released in a foreign \n     country could quickly spread to the United States. \n     Considering the realities of international travel, trade, and \n     migration patterns, a dangerous pathogen appearing naturally, \n     accidentally, or intentionally anywhere in the world can \n     spread to the United States in a matter of days, before any \n     effective quarantine or isolation measures could be \n     implemented.\n       (6) To combat bioterrorism effectively and ensure that the \n     United States is fully prepared to prevent, recognize, and \n     contain a biological weapons attack or emerging infectious \n     disease, measures to strengthen the domestic public health \n     infrastructure and improve domestic event detection, \n     surveillance, and response, while absolutely essential, are \n     not sufficient.\n       (7) The United States should enhance cooperation with the \n     World Health Organization, regional international health \n     organizations, and individual countries, including data \n     sharing with appropriate agencies and departments of the \n     United States, to help detect and quickly contain infectious \n     disease outbreaks or a bioterrorism agent before such a \n     disease or agent is spread.\n       (8) The World Health Organization has done an impressive \n     job in monitoring infectious disease outbreaks around the \n     world, particularly with the establishment in April 2000 of \n     the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network.\n       (9) The capabilities of the World Health Organization \n     depend on the quality of the data and information the \n     Organization receives from the countries that are members of \n     the Organization and is further limited by the narrow list of \n     diseases (such as plague, cholera, and yellow fever) on which \n     such surveillance and monitoring is based and by the \n     consensus process used by the Organization to add new \n     diseases to the list. Developing countries, in particular, \n     often are unable to devote the necessary resources to build \n     and maintain public health infrastructures.\n       (10) In particular, developing countries could benefit \n     from--\n       (A) better trained public health professionals and \n     epidemiologists to recognize disease patterns;\n       (B) appropriate laboratory equipment for diagnosis of \n     pathogens;\n       (C) disease reporting systems that--\n       (i) are based on disease and syndrome surveillance; and\n       (ii) could enable an effective response to a biological \n     event to begin at the earliest possible opportunity;\n       (D) a narrowing of the existing technology gap in disease \n     and syndrome surveillance capabilities, based on reported \n     symptoms, and real-time information dissemination to public \n     health officials; and\n\n[[Page S2940]]\n\n       (E) appropriate communications equipment and information \n     technology to efficiently transmit information and data \n     within national, international regional, and international \n     health networks, including inexpensive, Internet-based \n     Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and relevant telephone-\n     based systems for early recognition and diagnosis of \n     diseases.\n       (11) An effective international capability to detect, \n     monitor, and quickly diagnose infectious disease outbreaks \n     will offer dividends not only in the event of biological \n     weapons development, testing, production, and attack, but \n     also in the more likely cases of naturally occurring \n     infectious disease outbreaks that could threaten the United \n     States. Furthermore, a robust surveillance system will serve \n     to deter, prevent, or contain terrorist use of biological \n     weapons, mitigating the intended effects of such malevolent \n     uses.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this part are as follows:\n       (1) To provide the United States with an effective and \n     real-time system to detect biological threats that--\n       (A) utilizes classified and unclassified information to \n     detect such threats; and\n       (B) may be utilized by the human or the agricultural \n     domestic disease response community.\n       (2) To enhance the capability of the international \n     community, through the World Health Organization and \n     individual countries, to detect, identify, and contain \n     infectious disease outbreaks, whether the cause of those \n     outbreaks is intentional human action or natural in origin.\n       (3) To enhance the training of public health professionals \n     and epidemiologists from eligible developing countries in \n     advanced Internet-based disease and syndrome surveillance \n     systems, in addition to traditional epidemiology methods, so \n     that such professionals and epidemiologists may better \n     detect, diagnose, and contain infectious disease outbreaks, \n     especially such outbreaks caused by the pathogens that may be \n     likely to be used in a biological weapons attack.\n       (4) To provide assistance to developing countries to \n     purchase appropriate communications equipment and information \n     technology to detect, analyze, and report biological threats, \n     including--\n       (A) relevant computer equipment, Internet connectivity \n     mechanisms, and telephone-based applications to effectively \n     gather, analyze, and transmit public health information for \n     infectious disease surveillance and diagnosis; and\n       (B) appropriate computer equipment and Internet \n     connectivity mechanisms--\n       (i) to facilitate the exchange of Geographic Information \n     Systems-based disease and syndrome surveillance information; \n     and\n       (ii) to effectively gather, analyze, and transmit public \n     health information for infectious disease surveillance and \n     diagnosis.\n       (5) To make available greater numbers of public health \n     professionals who are employed by the Government of the \n     United States to international regional and international \n     health organizations, international regional and \n     international health networks, and United States diplomatic \n     missions, as appropriate.\n       (6) To expand the training and outreach activities of \n     United States laboratories located in foreign countries, \n     including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or \n     Department of Defense laboratories, to enhance the public \n     health capabilities of developing countries.\n       (7) To provide appropriate technical assistance to existing \n     international regional and international health networks and, \n     as appropriate, seed money for new international regional and \n     international networks.\n\n     SEC. 1643.
