But on these votes, everyone \nshould be here on time. We are getting a little out of the habit of \nbeing here on time.

Mr. President, the one point that I would like to make \nbefore we vote later this morning on the various amendments to the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act--a law that is aimed at helping \nus stop terrorists before they can hurt us--is the most important point \nof all. It also happens to be a fairly straightforward one: adopting \nany one of these three amendments would kill the underlying bill.\n  It would risk putting us right back where we were last July, with the \nAugust recess approaching, and the authorizations for monitoring \nforeign terrorist targets set to expire. In that case, if a member of \nal-Qaida were to call, our ability to monitor his communications would \nbe seriously handicapped, and it may even be impossible for us to do \nso, at least on a real-time basis.\n  So the question before the Senate is really quite simple: we either \npass this delicately balanced bipartisan bill which gives our \nintelligence officials the tools they need to find foreign terrorists \noverseas--which is itself a compromise on the bill the Senate already \npassed this year by a vote of 68-29, and which will garner a \nPresidential signature--or we scrap it altogether and end up right back \nwhere we were a year ago.\n  That is our choice. Fix the problem now--finally--or allow the \nproblem that intelligence officials alerted us to more than a year ago \ncontinue indefinitely, regardless of the threat.\n  Just yesterday the White House reiterated its intention to veto any \nFISA bill that is amended to strip or weaken liability protection for \nthe telecommunication companies that may have helped the Government in \nthe wake of the September 11 attacks.\n  This means that the adoption of any one of these amendments will take \ndown the entire bill, unraveling more than a year of delicate \nbipartisan negotiations.\n  We're not doing these companies any special favors. The U.S. \nGovernment wouldn't even have a foreign surveillance program without \nthem. The intelligence community relies on their cooperation to do its \njob. And any law that makes it less likely that these companies \ncooperate with us in the future is a law that makes it harder to \nprotect Americans from terrorist attacks.\n  That is not just my view or the view of Senator Bond on the \nRepublican side. Let me remind my colleagues of what the chairman of \nthe Intelligence Committee told us, quite bluntly, about our \nresponsibilities in this area on the floor of the Senate last February. \nThis is what Senator Rockefeller said:\n\n       What people have to understand around here, he said, is \n     that the quality of the intelligence we are going to be \n     receiving is going to be degraded. It is going to be \n     degraded. It is already going to be degraded as \n     telecommunications companies lose interest. Everybody tosses \n     that around and says: Well, what do you mean? I say: Well, \n     what are they making out of this? What is the big payoff for \n     the telephone companies? Do they get paid a lot of money? No. \n     They get paid nothing. What do they get for this? They get \n     $40 billion worth of suits, grief, trashing, but they do it. \n     But they don't have to do it, because they do have \n     shareholders to respond to, to answer to.\n       There is going to be a degrading of intelligence in some \n     very crucial areas, because we will go right back to where we \n     were last August, and that will be a further jolt to the \n     telecommunications companies, because they will understand \n     that you cannot count on the Congress, you cannot count on us \n     to make policy which will give [them] stability.\n\n  Those are the words of the Democratic chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee. And I would only add to them that it is our job to make \npolicy in this area. The Senate--and especially its Intelligence \nCommittee--has been examining this issue for over a year. The committee \nof jurisdiction conducted extensive oversight and concluded that the \ntelecommunications companies acted in good faith in answering the \nadministration's call to help protect the country from terrorist \nattack.\n  The Intelligence Committee then passed an overwhelmingly bipartisan \nbill, 13-2, that protected these companies from potentially crippling \nlawsuits, which would terminate the program. The full Senate made the \nsame policy judgment, defeating the Feingold-Dodd amendment to strike \nimmunity 67-31, as well as the Specter-Whitehouse substitution \namendment 68-30, on its way to passing the bill by a lopsided vote of \n68-29.\n  Further modifications were made to the bill in negotiations with the \nHouse, including to the liability provisions. The House leadership--\nwhich had been holding up enactment of a FISA modernization law because \nof the liability question--then voted for this compromise bill, and the \ncompromise cleared the House with almost 300 votes.\n  Now, after all this legislative time and effort and contemplation, \nthe Bingaman amendment would have us say, ``Just kidding.'' This \namendment would punt our oversight and legislative responsibilities \nover to inspectors general in the executive branch so they can look at \nthe same program that the Intelligence Committee and the Congress have \nbeen considering for over a year.\n  It is ironic that those who are concerned about preserving \ncongressional prerogatives and congressional responsibilities, \nespecially in relation to the executive branch, would have us rely on \nthe judgment of employees of the executive branch before we can make \npolicy, especially after all the work that Congress has done on this \nsubject. We should not kick the can down the road for another 15 months \nand in the process abdicate our role in this area.\n  An acceptable bipartisan solution to our intelligence problem has \nalready been reached. That solution has been endorsed by majorities in \nboth houses of Congress. If that solution is compromised by adopting \nany of these amendments, this bill would not become law, current \ntargeting orders would expire, and the Senate would fail today to do \nits basic duty of protecting Americans to the fullest extent possible \nfrom terrorist attack.\n  Americans have a right to expect Congress to give our intelligence \nofficials what they need to do their jobs. And the only way we fulfill \nthat trust is by voting against each of these amendments to the FISA \nmodernization bill.\n  Mr. President, before turning to another subject, I wish to \nparticularly commend the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Bond, who has done \nan incredibly effective job at trying to traverse the various currents \nthat have surrounded this extraordinarily difficult piece of \nlegislation.\n  First he established a very good working relationship with Senator \nRockefeller, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee. He was an \nintegral part of negotiating and, as I say, kind of dealing with the \ncurrents that were going on through the last year.\n  I just wish to say through the Chair to him how much America owes the \nSenator from Missouri for his extraordinary work on this subject. \nAmerica will be safer in the future as a result of the work of the \nSenator from Missouri. We here in the Senate are deeply grateful for \nhis extraordinary job, and the people of Missouri have every right to \nbe very proud of him.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/09/senate-section/article/S6452-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6452-S6453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEMORIAL SERVICE OF SENATOR JESSE HELMS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on one other item, yesterday we said \ngoodbye to our former colleague, Senator Jesse Helms. A significant \nnumber of our colleagues were in attendance at the funeral in Raleigh. \nSince his passing was expected, we certainly did not suffer from shock. \nIt was anticipated that our friend and colleague would soon pass away, \nso in many respects it was a celebration of the life of a unique and \ngreat American.\n  I was honored by Mrs. Helms to be asked to do one of the eulogies at \nthe funeral yesterday. I ask that my remarks be printed in the Record \nfor any of our colleagues who might want to see what I had to say on \nbehalf of our friend and colleague yesterday as we bid him farewell.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have those remarks printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Memorial Service of Senator Jesse Helms\n\n\n Remarks of U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, July 8, 2008\n\n       Dot, Jane, Nancy, Charles, members of the Helms family, Mr. \n     Vice President, Senate colleagues, Reverend Bodkin, \n     distinguished guests, and friends of Jesse Alexander Helms.\n\n[[Page S6453]]\n\n       Many good things have been said about Jesse Helms since he \n     left us early Friday morning. And none, I think, was more \n     true than a note that was sent to the Helms Center over the \n     weekend. ``He was caring about those he knew and didn't \n     know,'' it said. ``He wanted others to succeed.''\n       In the Senate, he always sought them out. Whether it was \n     the schoolchildren that he met with by the thousands; the \n     staff members he didn't call staff, but family--the Helms \n     Senate family; or the Senate pages he would always stop to \n     talk to, and who would send him notes later on in life to \n     thank him for a kindness, a word of encouragement, or to show \n     him pictures of a newborn baby.\n       Over the years, anyone who passed by Jesse Helms in the \n     Capitol, or worked in his office, would remember him as one \n     of the kindest men they ever knew. No matter who you were, he \n     always had a thoughtful word and a gentle smile. He put duty \n     above all else--duty to God, to country, and to family, yes--\n     but also a duty that's often overlooked: the simple duty of \n     treating other people well.\n       He never let the seriousness of his job in the Senate \n     become an excuse for pretense.\n       Just ask the Senators who always had to make room for \n     Jesse's constituents on the senators-only elevators. Or the \n     tourists from all the other states who noticed that Senator \n     Helms always put visitors from North Carolina at the front of \n     the Senate subway car when he rode with them. Or the \n     constituents who weren't even from North Carolina, but who \n     could always count on the Helms Senate family to help if \n     their own representatives didn't. Their boss always made sure \n     of it.\n       One of the more notable features of being a member of the \n     U.S. Senate is that you get to see how different the public \n     image of certain well-known senators is from the men and \n     women you actually get to know as colleagues and as friends. \n     No one seemed to suffer more from this peculiar disconnect \n     than Jesse Helms. And no one seemed to care about it less.\n       I remember walking into his office for the first time and \n     being disarmed by his kindness, and then stepping into his \n     private office and being disarmed again at seeing an entire \n     wall covered with some of the nastiest political cartoons I'd \n     ever seen. Every one was critical of Jesse. And he loved \n     them. Visitors would come into his office, look at the wall, \n     look back at Jesse, and he'd just smile.\n       There was a lesson here: you can let your adversaries beat \n     you down, or you can let it roll off your back. Jesse taught \n     many of us to do the latter, and we were grateful for the \n     advice.\n       Staffers learned how to deal with the critics too. One \n     time, after a particularly harsh editorial in the New York \n     Times, a new Helms staffer dashed off a harsh response and \n     brought it in to the boss for his review. Jesse read it, \n     patted the young man on the shoulder, and said, ``Son, just \n     so you understand: I don't care what the New York Times says \n     about me.''\n       He had a kind of preternatural calm about what other people \n     said. But for Jesse, standing on principle and fighting back \n     in defense of one's views was never to be confused with \n     animosity for ones adversaries. Political disagreements were \n     never a reason to treat others badly. As one of his \n     Democratic colleagues put it over the weekend: ``He was \n     always a gentleman.''\n       When he fought back, he did it in the most effective way he \n     knew how. Nobody knew the rules of the Senate better than \n     Jesse Helms, and no one used them against his adversaries to \n     more frustrating effect. There's a saying in Washington: \n     Whenever a member of Congress looks into the mirror, he sees \n     a future president. But Jesse Helms was always an exception \n     to the rule. He never saw himself as anything other than a \n     senator. And he played the role masterfully.\n       Of course, there was one person whose opinion did matter. \n     And, as I recall, she was never one to hold back. If Jesse \n     gave a speech that was a little too long, he'd be sure to \n     hear about it in the car ride home. And, unlike the editorial \n     writers, Jesse always took Dot's wise counsel to heart.\n       It's ironic, of course, that Jesse Helms would find his \n     wife in a newsroom--ironic that someone who had so little use \n     for newspapers would have started out at one. But he always \n     remembered those early days at the News & Observer fondly. He \n     remembered that the best path to his desk was the path that \n     led him past Dorothy Coble's [COE-BULL] desk.\n       He took that path often. And soon enough, he and Dot were \n     covering the news together, and becoming close friends over \n     late-night steak dinners at the Hollywood Cafe. Decades \n     later, looking back on all the state dinners and all the \n     visits from various dignitaries and world leaders, Jesse \n     would say those dinners with Dot at the Hollywood Cafe were, \n     for him, the most memorable.\n       Dot, you had the perfect partnership. We miss you in \n     Washington. And we honor you today too, for your devotion and \n     your strength, especially in these last years, which haven't \n     been easy, we know.\n       Jesse Helms was not above sharing the secret of his success \n     with anyone who asked.\n       One time, a college student who admired him called his \n     office on a whim to see if Senator Helms would be willing to \n     speak to a college group he ran. The boy was shocked when \n     Senator Helms himself cut in on the phone line and said, \n     ``I'll do it.'' But he was shocked even more when, on the day \n     of the speech, he asked Senator Helms for the one piece of \n     advice he'd give a young man just starting out in politics. \n     ``Son, find yourself a good wife.''\n       It has been noted by many others how fitting it should be \n     for a man who spent his entire adult life talking about the \n     ``Miracle of America'' to pass away on Independence Day. It \n     was no less fitting, I should think, for a man who did so \n     much to promote the vision of the American Founding to have \n     come from as modest a background as so many of the men who \n     secured it in battle.\n       That too, of course, has always been a part of the Miracle \n     of America: that an army of castaways, one third of whom \n     didn't even have shoes, could defeat the British Army. That a \n     boy from Kentucky whose father couldn't even sign his own \n     name would go on to write the words of the Gettysburg \n     Address. Or that a policeman's son from Monroe, North \n     Carolina, could, in his own time, have such a powerful effect \n     on the course of human events. Jesse Helms rose the way so \n     many others in our country have from its earliest days, not \n     by inheriting something, but by building something.\n       He was a product of the public schools, but his most \n     important education came from the home. In the Helms \n     household, Jesse said, it was not uncommon for him to wake up \n     and find his mother cooking breakfast for the hobos that his \n     father had rounded up the night before. And on Sundays, the \n     whole family would worship together at the First Baptist \n     Church on Main Street in Monroe.\n       It was the kind of home where a young boy could learn a \n     boundless hope in the promise of America. It was the kind of \n     place where a young boy could learn about the importance of \n     strong principles, and the importance of fighting for them, \n     regardless of the personal cost.\n       I remember once, as a young senator, walking into the \n     Republican cloakroom, and seeing what that kind of tenacity \n     looked like: a lone senator, sitting in the corner. Jesse had \n     put the rest of us in some parliamentary tangle about one \n     thing or another. He'd ground the place to a halt. And he was \n     completely comfortable with the whole situation. It was truly \n     something to behold.\n       Once, after a disastrous early battle in the Revolutionary \n     War, John Adams was asked for an explanation. ``In general,'' \n     he said, ``their generals outgeneralled our generals.'' For \n     the last three decades of the 20th Century, the same would \n     never be said of a certain North Carolina lawmaker whenever \n     he decided to take on an issue in the U.S. Senate. Jesse \n     Helms always held his ground.\n       Many others who never saw Jesse Helms on the Senate floor \n     have noted with admiration the same qualities over these past \n     days. One man from Florida wrote that Cuban Americans will \n     never forget his staunch opposition to the Castro Regime. And \n     one of Jesse's many unlikely friends on the international \n     stage, Bono, left a tribute at the Helms Center that many men \n     could only dream of.\n       ``Give Dot and the family my love,'' it said. ``And tell \n     them there are two million people alive today in Africa \n     because Jesse Helms did the right thing.''\n       Today, we are sad at the passing of our friend, but we are \n     consoled by the promises of a God he loved. Jesse Helms was \n     once asked whether he had any ambitions beyond the Senate. \n     ``The only thing I am running for,'' he said, ``is the \n     Kingdom of Heaven.''\n       Now that day which comes to all of us has come for Jesse \n     Helms. And we are confident that he has heard those words he \n     longed to hear: ``Well done, good and faithful servant . . . \n     Come and share in your Master's joy.''\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wanted to build upon the remarks of the \nSenator from Kentucky. He commended and applauded Senator Bond, and \nthat certainly is appropriate. But I also want to recognize, as the \nRepublican leader did, the work they have done together. I may disagree \nwith the result of what we have on the floor today, and the outcome of \nwhat is going to happen today, but I want everyone to know that Senator \nRockefeller is a man who works hard. There is no Senator who works any \nharder than Jay Rockefeller. He spends, with his counterpart and \ncounterparts, Members of the Intelligence Committee, days, days each \nweek in a place that is secure, away from the press, staff, and the \nrest of the Senate, in trying to figure out what is going on in the \nworld as it relates to bad people trying to do bad things.\n  They also have to keep on top of what is going on around the world as \nthe administration advises them. So when the history books are written \nabout this institution, one of the people they will have to write about \nis the good man of West Virginia, a man of wealth who decided to be a \npublic servant. He has done that for the people of West Virginia for \ndecades. There are a lot of great Senators who have come from the State \nof West Virginia, and two of them are serving now, but I\n\n[[Page S6454]]\n\nwant everyone to know that my appreciation, my affection, and my total \nadmiration for Jay Rockefeller is like no other Senator. He is a \nwonderful human being. I so appreciate his willingness to do this job. \nNot everyone runs and tries to get to be chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee, but he does it because he thinks it is the right thing to do \nfor the country. We in the Democratic caucus think there is no one \nbetter to lead us in that behalf.\n  I will simply say that the relationships with Senator Bond and \nSenator Rockefeller have been extremely pleasant, and that makes this \nmost difficult job better for all of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/09/senate-section/article/S6454-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I thank the distinguished leader who has \ndone a remarkable job of helping us to get to this point in what has \nbeen, let us say, a challenging 15-month debate. And I concur with him \nin the very kind and generous words he said about my friend and \ncolleague, the chairman of the committee, Senator Rockefeller.\n  I expressed my appreciation to the Republican leader for his very \nkind words, and I agree with him that it is absolutely essential that \nwe defeat these amendments today. But, finally, after sporadic \nfilibuster attempts over a period of 15 months by several Members, \nMembers whom I respect for their tenacity and conviction in this \nmatter, we are poised today to conclude work on the FISA Amendments Act \nof 2008.\n  Yesterday I detailed my views on aspects of this legislation, and I \nwalked through six tweaks to the legislation that were made to the \nbipartisan Senate bill that the Senate passed in February, earlier this \nyear, that have resulted in the bill before us today.\n  I am happy that the tweaks to the bill did not change the bill much. \nI am proud to negotiate with the House to bring back to the Senate \nessentially the same bipartisan bill today that both the chairman and I \ncrafted with the help of an overwhelming bipartisan majority of our \nIntelligence Committee.\n  This ensured that today we have a major bipartisan victory of which \nall sides can be proud, exemplifying what can be accomplished in \nWashington when there is bipartisan negotiation.\n  I thank all of those who worked so hard to bring us to the cusp of \nsending this legislation to the President. I appreciate the hard work \nof House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, who was critical in the House; \nRepublican Whip Roy Blunt, and Congressmen Pete Hoekstra and Lamar \nSmith, as well as the efforts of my colleagues in the Senate, Senators \nOrrin Hatch, Saxby Chambliss, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, \nand Chairman Rockefeller for his strong support and leadership.\n  Further, we could not be here today without the hard work of staff, \nfrom the House, Jen Stewart from House Minority Leader Boehner's \noffice; Brian Diffel from House Minority Whip Blunt's office; Chris \nDonesa from Mr. Hoekstra's office; Caroline Lynch from Mr. Smith's \noffice; Mariah Sixkiller with the House Majority Leader's office; and \nJeremy Bash from Mr. Reyes' office, along with an assortment and large \nnumber of deputies and others who assisted them in producing the \nlanguage that their Members would support.\n  As to my own staff, I thank my staff director Louis Tucker and \nstaffer Jacqui Russell from the Intelligence Committee; a very special \nthanks to two FISA counsels, Jack Livingston and Kathleen Rice, who \nbrought invaluable expertise into this process as lawyers who \nparticipated in the FISA process from the executive branch perspective \nwhile working in the FBI.\n  Thanks to Senator Rockefeller's counsels, Mike Davidson, Christine \nHealey, and Alissa Starzak, as well as to Jesse Baker with Senator \nHatch; to Tom Hawkins and John Abegg with Leader McConnell's office; \nand to the many other staff who helped make this happen, too many to \nname now in the short time we have before we vote on the upcoming \namendments.\n  I believe it is necessary to reinforce a few points that Senator \nRockefeller and I made yesterday in urging our colleagues to defeat the \nthree amendments before us that would kill this bill by altering the \ntitle II liability protections, and potentially putting us in the \ndisastrous situation we faced a year ago.\n\n  First, yesterday we heard from supporters of these amendments that \ndecimating the title II civil liability protections for our \ntelecommunications providers would have no effect on the title I \nportion of the bill that modernizes FISA collection methodologies \nbecause title I contains directives that are enforceable by court \norder.\n  Such statements demonstrate a lack of understanding about the \nintelligence community's dependence upon our third-party partners. We \nknow from our experience when the Protect America Act expired in \nFebruary that is simply not the case. We lost days' worth of \nintelligence while the partners ceased cooperating momentarily until \nthey were assured that authorizations and corresponding immunity tie \nwould last until August. If we do not have their voluntary cooperation \nby giving them liability protection, then it is much harder and we get \nmuch less in trying to compel them.\n  Second, we heard yesterday that it is ``bad lawyering'' to apply the \nsubstantial evidence standard to the title II liability. The Senate's \nbill had an abuse of discretion standard for title II liability, which \nI believe was the appropriate standard, but House Democrats offered \nthis other standard.\n  It is an appellate standard, not a factual standard, as my colleague \nfrom\n\n[[Page S6455]]\n\nRhode Island asserted yesterday. The court will not be holding a trial \nor hearing from witnesses. There is no adversarial process in the true \nsense of the word. These steps and safeguards are necessary to ensure \nthat our intelligence sources and methods remain protected.\n  Third, while my colleague from Rhode Island asserted that the TSP is \na cause for deep anger at the administration, I submit that deep anger \nshould be redirected away from tearing down experienced, dedicated \nAmerican officials and toward tearing down our foreign enemies who are \nintent on destroying our Nation and our way of life.\n  The TSP enabled our intelligence community to prevent further attacks \non our homeland, and I and the leaders of the intelligence community \nbelieve it is the key reason why we have not been attacked for nearly 7 \nyears since September 11.\n  Despite what some far-left editorial writers say, the TSP only \nallowed warrantless interception of phone calls from terrorists \nreasonably believed to be overseas.\n  Intercepts of Americans and other U.S. persons in the United States \nrequired a warrant from the FISA Court.\n  To suggest yesterday, as was suggested on the floor, that it enabled \ncollection of communications among innocent American citizens is flat \nwrong. The bill before us will keep us safe and protect civil \nliberties. So it should not be a moment of anger but, rather, one of \nbipartisanship and pride that we worked together to produce the best \nlegislation possible to keep America safe and to protect her rights \nfurther.\n  Others assert that leaking the program was good. Well, I dispute \nthat. The intelligence agencies noticed a significant drop in \ncollection when the terrorists found out we could listen in on them. \nThe CIA Director, at his confirmation hearing, when I asked him how \nbadly the intelligence community had been hurt, said: We are applying \nthe Darwinian theory to terrorists; we are only intercepting the dumb \nones.\n  Both Democratic and Republican leaders were read in on this program \nearly on, the Big Eight, and had the opportunity through congressional \noptions to delay or scrutinize the program, if necessary.\n  I understand they advised the administration it would take too long \nto go through the legislative process to modernize FISA. From what I \nhave seen over the past 15 months in how long it has taken us to get \nhere today, that seems to have been very good advice.\n  My colleague from Pennsylvania asserted earlier that only 30 Senators \nhave been read in. But the chairman did a little quick math and said 37 \nhave been read in. It is unusual to have more than one-third of the \nSenate briefed on some of our most sensitive intelligence collection \nstrategy.\n  Oversight of these areas is why the Senate created the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence. We on the committee oversee hundreds of \nprograms that the rest of our colleagues know little about. And even \nthough we invite them over for briefings, they usually have too many \nother responsibilities to have time to accept our invitation.\n  Finally, my colleague from Pennsylvania asserted we do not know what \nwe are granting immunity for, and only courts can decide that matter. \nThat is simply not true. The committee's bipartisan review makes it \nclear to whom retroactive civil liability protection is being granted. \nAnd the courts are not the appropriate standard to make those \njudgments.\n  The Senator's statements clearly indicated that he wants to challenge \nthe Government, the President's use of the TSP. Well, we do not block \nsuits against the Government, against Government employees or \nofficials. It would be unfair and potentially disastrous to use the \npatriotic electronic carriers as punching bags to try to get at the \nadministration. That will destroy our intelligence community's ability \nto collect with their assistance, and it would potentially lead to a \nserious gap in the program. It would put the people of the collecting \nagencies at great risk, civilians who do not go into battle with \nprotection, with gear and with training.\n  That is an absolutely outrageous assertion that they should be \nwilling to undergo the hazards of war in matters of national security. \nIt is appropriate and imperative that the oversight committees act as \nthey have in reporting such legislation to the entire body.\n  My friend repeatedly inquired if Congress had ever done anything such \nas this before. But, in fact, we only need to look back to 2005 when \nCongress passed the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. It \nessentially granted immunity to gun manufacturers, distributors, \ndealers, and others against lawsuits seeking money damages and other \nrelief for harm caused by misuse of firearms.\n  It still allowed those defendants to be sued for their own \nnegligence, violation of sale and marketing statute, breach of contract \nor warranty, design defect, et cetera. The immunity provision was held \nto be constitutional, not a violation of due process, equal protection, \nor takings, in Ileto v. Glock, a 2006 California court case. So beyond \nthe rhetoric in opposition to the legislation before us, I believe \nSenators need to take a fair look at what is before us today.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues to vote down the three amendments \nbefore us and to support this bill. This bill gives our intelligence \noperators and law enforcement officials the tools they need to conduct \nsurveillance on foreign terrorists in foreign countries planning to \nconduct attacks inside the United States against our troops and allies. \nIt is the balance we need to protect our civil liberties without \nhandcuffing intelligence professionals. Let's do the right thing, pass \nthis bill without amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it was Kierkegaard, a number of years ago, \nwho said that venture causes anxiety, but not to venture is to lose \none's self.\n  From the outset let me be crystal clear in voicing my strong \nopposition to all three pending amendments to H.R. 6304. But before I \ndiscuss these amendments, let me address a few things said on this \nfloor yesterday. One of my colleagues said the Congress shouldn't ``jam \nthis bill through.'' If working on a bill for over 440 days is jamming \nit through, then Webster's dictionary should prepare a new definition \nfor the word. We also heard comments yesterday which were critical of \nthe fact that not every Senator has been fully briefed on the \nactivities of the intelligence community. I guess since this same \nargument didn't stick the first time it was offered back in December, \nmore desperate attempts would be made. If at first you don't succeed, \ntry, try again.\n  Memories are short around here, and we should appreciate that the \nvery creation of the Intelligence Committee was controversial. The \ncommittee was created so a limited number of Members would have \noversight of our intelligence agencies. During the 10 days of debate on \nthe resolution creating this committee, numerous Senators openly \nworried about possible leaks in providing highly classified material to \na large number of individuals. Here is what Senator Milton Young said \nin May of 1976:\n\n       It is my understanding that on this new committee, staff \n     would have access to the most sensitive information. Human \n     nature is such that when too many people have access to this \n     information, someone is bound to leak parts of it to an \n     ambitious and inquisitive press.\n\n  Also, in 1976, here is what another Senator said. This is Senator \nWalter Mondale on the need for a Senate Intelligence Committee on May \n13, 1976:\n\n       We have the worst possible system for congressional \n     oversight of intelligence. Responsibility and authority are \n     fragmented in several cases; it is impossible to look at \n     intelligence as a whole; because authority and responsibility \n     are not welded together, we are incapable of dealing with \n     problems privately, and there is the inevitable temptation to \n     deal with them through leaks.\n\n  Thirty two years later, these statements contain points that are \nstill vitally important to this discussion. Is this the system of \noversight that we should go back to? Those that argue that we should \nnot vote until every Member gets some sort of vague access are \nessentially saying that all 535 Members of Congress, plus hundreds of \ncleared staff, should be read into all highly classified programs whose \njurisdiction is otherwise limited to the Intelligence Committees. If \nyou want to guarantee future leaks, this would be a good approach.\n\n[[Page S6456]]\n\n  This sort of logic begs the question: Why do we have the Intelligence \nCommittee? The answer is obvious, and I urge my colleagues to remember \nthe extensive efforts of our predecessors which created a committee \nwith the authority to review these materials.\n  While the issue of civil liability protection for telecoms has been \ndebated extensively over the last 9 months, the three final amendments \nbefore us all attempt to alter or remove the carefully crafted \nbipartisan civil liability provision. I agree with the comments from \nboth sides of the aisle in opposition to these amendments.\n  The Bingaman amendment, for example, would needlessly delay the \nliability provision. I believe the amendment is unwise, as its purpose \ndisregards the extensive work that Congress has already conducted on \nthis issue. By my last count, Congress has conducted over 27 hearings \non the TSP and FISA over the last few years.\n  Let there be no doubt; the IG review will not, and cannot, determine \nthe legality of the terrorist surveillance program. Any suggestion that \nthe review will do so is absolutely incorrect. Inspectors general are \nnot qualified and lack jurisdiction to review the legality of \nintelligence programs. As further evidence of this obvious point, let's \nlook at this quote by the DOJ inspector general on conducting legal \nanalysis:\n  That's not our role as the Inspector General.\n  In addition, the IG review will not publicly reveal which companies \nelected to participate in this program, as that information remains \nhighly classified. Simply put, attempts to alter the FISA compromise \nbased on a misperception of the eventual IG review should be strongly \nrejected, and we should do so this morning.\n  Close inspection of the lawsuits against the telecoms reveals quite \ndubious claims. As has previously been stated, the plaintiffs \npersistently confuse speculative allegations and untested assertions \nfor established facts.\n  It is very simple, Congress should not condone oversight through \nlitigation.\n  The lawsuits seize on the President's brief comments about the \nexistence of a limited program to go on a fishing expedition of NSA \nactivities. But this is really worse than a fishing expedition; this is \ndraining the Loch Ness to find a monster. Sometimes what you are \nlooking for just doesn't exist.\n  Yet we consistently hear as justification for the apparent paranoia \nthat some wiretaps were warrantless. But lest we forget, the fourth \namendment does not proscribe warrantless searches, it proscribes \nunreasonable searches.\n  Here's a quick example from a few blocks from here: Waiting for \nwarrantless searches at the National Archives; waiting to be served \nbefore viewing the fourth amendment itself. That is a warrantless \nsearch.\n  The fact is that the President created an early warning system to \nprevent future attacks; essentially a terrorist smoke detector. But \nrather than appreciate the protection it offered, critics rushed to \npull out the batteries so that it could not work.\n  My feelings of admiration and respect for the companies who did their \npart to defend America are well known. As I have said in the past, any \ncompany who assisted us following the attacks of 9/11 deserves a round \nof applause and a helping hand, not a slap in the face and a kick to \nthe gut.\n  When companies are asked to assist the intelligence community based \non a program authorized by the President himself and based on \nassurances from the highest levels of government that the program has \nbeen determined to be lawful, they should be able to rely on those \nrepresentations.\n  In the over 40 outstanding civil lawsuits, is there any proof that \nany litigant was specifically targeted by the government? Can any of \nthe plaintiffs show that they are ``aggrieved persons'' under the \ndefinition of FISA? The answer to both questions is no. Rather, many of \nthe lawsuits utilize the following logic: I have long distance service, \nso I am going to sue because I think you listened to my calls. Even \nthough they have no proof; even though the government has more \nimportant things to do than listen to their random phone calls, they \npush on in their desire to justify their view of self-importance and \nirrational belief in government conspiracy. I don't want to bruise \nanyone's ego, but if al-Qaida is not on your speed dial the government \nis probably not interested in you.\n  The possible disclosure of classified materials from ongoing court \nproceedings is a grave threat to national security, and the very point \nof these lawsuits is to prove plaintiffs' claims by disclosing such \nclassified information. Simply put, you do not tell your enemies how \nyou track them. This is why the NSA and other government agencies will \nnot say what they do, how they do it, or who they watch. Nor should \nthey. To confirm or deny any of these activities, which are at the \nheart of the civil lawsuits, would harm national security. We should \nnot discuss what our capabilities are.\n  If the identities of the companies are revealed and officially \nconfirmed through litigation, they will face irreversible harm; harm in \ntheir business relations with foreign governments and companies, and \npossible physical harm to their employees both here and abroad, who are \ntruly soft targets for attackers.\n  I have come to this floor on numerous occasions during the last year \nto discuss the issue of FISA modernization and am hopeful that the need \nto continue to do so will finally end tomorrow. I am confident that \nwhen the Congress considers this issue, we will finally send this \nvitally important legislation to the President to be signed into law.\n  I compliment the distinguished chairman and vice chairman of the \ncommittee, Senators Rockefeller and Bond. They have had to handle this \nmatter through all kinds of vicissitudes and false logic. They have \ndone an exceptionally good job. They and their staff have stood and \ntried to let America know what is involved.\n  The fact is, these two leaders have done a great job on this \ncommittee. They have previously passed bipartisan legislation \noverwhelmingly. This original Senate FISA modernization bill would have \npassed the House pretty much overwhelmingly, had it been brought up, \nand, of course, hopefully this version will be passed today without any \nof these three amendments which would cause a veto.\n  I thank those who vote for this bill and those who have been \nconsiderate enough to look at all the important arguments and support \nthis legislation which is much needed, certainly much needed before \nAugust and should have been passed a long time ago.\n  I thank all those who have stood up on this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nLeahy be recognized following my remarks, to be followed by Senator \nSpecter for 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume. Before I get into my formal remarks, let me react a bit to the \nremarks of the Senator from Utah. He is a great colleague, a very \ncordial man. I have enjoyed the 16 years I have served with him, \nespecially on the Judiciary Committee. But I will use an unsenatorial \nword for one of the arguments he made. The word is ``wow.'' The notion \nthat roughly 70 Senators would not be briefed on something we are \nvoting on and the notion that the briefing of the Intelligence \nCommittee, which, of course, I am a member of and which I support, is a \njustification for having 70 Senators not knowing what they are voting \non is a very bizarre interpretation of why the Intelligence Committee \nwas created. It was not created as a replacement for the Senate when it \ncomes to voting on the laws governing the fundamental rights of the \nAmerican people. If that is the best they can come up with, when 70 \nSenators don't even know the fundamentals of the program that this \nimmunity issue is addressing, it is incredible. Let me get into the \nmerits, but first I should also address that we have apparently been \nlumped in as part of the black helicopter crowd. I assure you the \ncoalition in this country that has concerns about this bill is much \nbroader than any such characterization.\n  A number of Senators came to the floor prior to the Fourth of July \nrecess to debate the FISA legislation, and more debate has occurred \nthis week.\n\n[[Page S6457]]\n\nWe heard arguments for and against this legislation, and Senators have \ncited a variety of reasons for their positions.\n  Several have defended the bill by arguing the legislation includes \nimprovements compared to the Senate bill we passed earlier this year. \nOf course, I was not surprised to hear that line of argument. I agree, \nthere are some improvements to the Senate bill contained in the \nlegislation we are now considering. But Mr. President, those changes, \nas you well know, are not nearly enough to justify supporting the bill, \nas I will explain in a few moments.\n  I was, however, surprised to hear several Senators still defending \nthe legality of the President's warrantless wiretapping program and \nstill arguing that Congress had somehow signed off on this program \nyears ago because the so-called Gang of 8 group was notified.\n  I thought we were well past these arguments. Two and a half years \nafter this illegal program became public, I cannot believe we are still \ndebating the legality of this program on the Senate floor and that \nanyone--anyone--seriously believes that merely notifying the Gang of \n8--eight Senators and Congressmen--while keeping the full Intelligence \nCommittees in the dark, somehow represents congressional approval.\n  It could not be clearer that this program broke the law and that this \nPresident--this President--broke the law. Not only that, but this \nadministration affirmatively misled the Congress and the American \npeople about it for years before it finally became public. So if we are \ngoing to go back and discuss these issues that I thought had long since \nbeen put to rest, let's take a few minutes to cover the full history.\n  Here is the part of this story that somehow seems to have been \nforgotten. In January 2005, 11 months before the New York Times broke \nthe story of the illegal wiretapping program, I asked then-White House \nCounsel Alberto Gonzales at his confirmation hearing to be Attorney \nGeneral whether the President had the power to authorize warrantless \nwiretaps in violation of the criminal law. Neither I nor the vast \nmajority of my colleagues knew it then, but the President had \nauthorized the NSA program 3 years before, and Mr. Gonzales was \ndirectly involved in that issue as White House Counsel.\n  At his confirmation hearing, he first tried to dismiss my question--\nif you can believe it--as ``hypothetical,'' though he knew exactly what \nwas going on. He then testified:\n\n       [I]t's not the policy or the agenda of this President to \n     authorize actions that would be in contravention of our \n     criminal statutes.\n\n  The President's wiretapping program was in direct contravention of \nour criminal statutes. Mr. Gonzales knew that, but he wanted the Senate \nand the American people to think the President had not acted on the \nextreme legal theory that the President has the power as Commander in \nChief to disobey the criminal laws of this country.\n  The President, too, misled the Congress and the American public. In \n2004 and 2005, when Congress was considering the reauthorization of the \nUSA PATRIOT Act, the President went out of his way--I remember this \nvery clearly--to assure us that his administration was getting court \norders for wiretaps, all the while knowing full well that his \nwarrantless wiretapping program was ongoing.\n  Here is what the President said on April 20, 2004:\n\n       Now, by the way, any time you hear the United States \n     government talking about [a] wiretap, it requires--a wiretap \n     requires a court order. Nothing has changed, by the way. When \n     we're talking about chasing down terrorists, we're talking \n     about getting a court order before we do so.\n\n  Those are the words of the President of the United States to the \nAmerican people.\n  Again, on July 14, 2004:\n\n       The government can't move on wiretaps or roving wiretaps \n     without getting a court order.\n\n  And listen to what the President said on June 9, 2005:\n\n       Law enforcement officers need a federal judge's permission \n     to wiretap a foreign terrorist's phone, a federal judge's \n     permission to track his calls, or a federal judge's \n     permission to search his property. Officers must meet strict \n     standards to use any of these tools. And these standards are \n     fully consistent with the Constitution of the U.S.\n\n  So please, let's not pretend that the highly classified notification \nto the Gang of 8, delivered while the President himself was repeatedly \npresenting a completely different picture to the public, suggests that \nCongress somehow acquiesced to this program. As the Members of this \nbody well know, several Members of the Gang of 8 at the time raised \nconcerns when they were told about this, and several have since said \nthey were not told the full story. And, of course, all of them--all of \nthem--were instructed not to share what they had learned with a single \nother person.\n  I also cannot leave unanswered the arguments mounted in defense of \nthe legality of the NSA program. I will not spend much time on the \nargument that the authorization for use of military force that Congress \npassed on September 18, 2001, authorized this program. That argument \nhas been thoroughly discredited. In the AUMF, Congress authorized the \nPresident to use military force against those who attacked us on 9/11, \na necessary and justified response to the attacks. We did not authorize \nthe President to wiretap American citizens on American soil without \ngoing through the judicial process that was set up nearly three decades \nago precisely to facilitate the domestic surveillance of spies and \nterrorists.\n  Senators have also dragged out the same old, tired arguments about \nthe President's supposed inherent Executive authority to violate the \nFISA statute. They argue that a law passed by Congress cannot trump the \nPresident's power under the Constitution. Now, that argument may sound \ngood, but it assumes what it is trying to prove--that the Constitution \ngives the President the power to authorize warrantless wiretaps in \ncertain cases. You cannot simply say that any claim of Executive power \nprevails over a statute--at least, not if you are serious about the \nrule of law and about how to interpret the Constitution.\n\n  The real question is, when a claim of Executive power and a statute \narguably conflict, how do you resolve that conflict?\n  Fortunately, this is not something the Supreme Court has been silent \nabout. The Supreme Court has told us how to answer that question. We \nare talking about the President acting in direct violation of a \ncriminal statute. That means his power was, as Justice Jackson said in \nhis famous and influential concurrence in the Steel Seizure cases half \na century ago, ``at its lowest ebb.'' The Presidential power, Justice \nJackson said, in that circumstance was ``at its lowest ebb.'' In other \nwords, when a President argues that he has the power to violate a \nspecific law, he is on shaky ground.\n  That is, obviously, not just my opinion. It is what the Supreme Court \nhas made clear. No less an authority than the current Chief Justice of \nthe United States, John Roberts, repeatedly recognized in his \nconfirmation hearings--over and over again--that Justice Jackson's \nthree-part test is the appropriate framework for analyzing questions of \nExecutive power.\n  In early 2006, a distinguished group of law professors and former \nexecutive branch officials wrote a letter pointing out that ``every \ntime''--every time--``the Supreme Court has confronted a statute \nlimiting the Commander-in-Chief's authority, it has upheld the \nstatute.'' It has upheld the act of Congress over the claims of \nExecutive power that overreach and conflict with the power of this \nCongress to make the laws in this country.\n  The Senate reports issued when FISA was enacted confirm the \nunderstanding that FISA overrode any preexisting inherent authority of \nthe President. The 1978 Senate Judiciary Committee report stated that \nFISA ``recognizes no inherent power of the President in this area'' and \n``Congress has declared that this statute, not any claimed Presidential \npower, controls.''\n  Contrary to what has been said on this floor, no court has ever \napproved warrantless surveillance in violation of FISA based on some \ntheory of article II authority. The Truong case that is so often hauled \nout to make this argument was a Vietnam-era case based on surveillance \nthat occurred before FISA was enacted, so it could not have decided \nthis issue. And the issue before the FISA Court of Review in 2002 had \nnothing to do with inherent Presidential authorities. Yet these cases \nare repeatedly cited by supporters of the President, complete with \nlarge charts\n\n[[Page S6458]]\n\nof the supposedly relevant quotations. But the fact is, not a single \ncourt--not the Supreme Court or any other court--has considered \nwhether, after FISA was enacted, the President nonetheless somehow has \nthe authority to bypass it and authorize warrantless wiretaps.\n  In fact, as the Senator from Pennsylvania and I discussed on the \nSenate floor yesterday, just last week a Federal district court \nstrongly indicated that were it to reach that issue, it would find that \nthe President must in fact follow FISA. The court was considering \nwhether the state secrets privilege applies to claims brought under the \nFISA civil liability provisions, and it found that it does not. Its \nreasoning was based on the conclusion, again, that Congress had spoken \nclearly that it intended FISA and the criminal wiretap laws to be the \nexclusive means--the exclusive means--by which electronic surveillance \nis conducted, and it fully occupied the field in this area, replacing \nany otherwise applicable common law.\n  Now, here is what the court said:\n\n       Congress appears clearly to have intended to--and did--\n     establish the exclusive means for foreign intelligence \n     surveillance activities to be conducted. Whatever power the \n     Executive may otherwise have had in this regard, FISA limits \n     the power of the executive branch to conduct such activities \n     . . .\n\n  And another court, a district court in Michigan, has also held that \nthe President's wiretapping program was unconstitutional, although that \ndecision was reversed on procedural grounds by the Sixth Circuit. So to \nthe extent there is any case law that actually addresses this issue, it \ntotally undercuts the administration's arguments. And, of course, it \ncertainly does nothing to support those arguments.\n  We have also heard that past American Presidents have cited Executive \nauthority to order warrantless surveillance. But, of course, those past \nPresidents--Presidents Wilson and Roosevelt are often cited--were \nacting before the Supreme Court decided in 1967 that our communications \nare protected by the Fourth Amendment and before Congress decided in \n1978 that the executive branch can no longer unilaterally decide which \nAmericans to wiretap. So those examples are simply not relevant to this \ndebate.\n  In sum, the arguments that the President has inherent Executive \nauthority to violate the law are baseless. It is not even a close case. \nAnd the repeated efforts in the Senate to pretend otherwise are very \ndiscouraging.\n  It may seem that I am going over ancient history because this program \nis no longer operating outside the law. But this is directly relevant \nto the current debate. The bill the Senate is considering would \nactually grant retroactive immunity to any companies that cooperated \nwith a blatantly illegal program that went on for more than 5 years and \nabout which the administration repeatedly misled Congress.\n  So if Congress short-circuits these lawsuits, we will have lost a \nprime opportunity to finally achieve accountability for these many \nyears of lawbreaking. That is why the administration has been fighting \nso hard for this immunity. It knows that the cases that have been \nbrought directly against the Government face much more difficult \nprocedural barriers and are unlikely to result in rulings on the merits \nthat would allow us to get to this direct question of the legality of \nthe President's warrantless wiretapping program.\n  These lawsuits involving the telephone companies may be the last \nchance to obtain a judicial ruling on the lawfulness of the warrantless \nwiretapping program. It is bad enough that Congress abdicated its \nresponsibility to hold the President accountable for breaking the law. \nNow it is trying to absolve those who allegedly participated in his \nlawlessness. This body should be condemning this administration for its \nlawbreaking--not letting the companies that allegedly cooperated off \nthe hook.\n  This body certainly should not grant the Government new, \noverexpansive surveillance authorities, which brings me now to the part \nof the bill that in some ways concerns me even more than the immunity \nprovision. Let me explain why I am so concerned about the new \nsurveillance powers granted in this bill and why the modest \nimprovements made to this part of the bill do not even come close to \ngoing far enough.\n  First, the FISA Amendments Act would authorize the Government to \ncollect all--all--communications between the United States and the rest \nof the world. Now, that could mean millions upon millions of \ncommunications between innocent Americans and their friends, families, \nor business associates overseas could be legally collected. Parents \ncalling their kids studying abroad, e-mails to friends serving in \nIraq--all these communications could be collected, with absolutely no \nsuspicion of any wrongdoing at all, under this legislation.\n  Second, like the earlier Senate version, this bill fails to \neffectively prohibit a practice known as reverse targeting; namely, \nwiretapping a person overseas when what the Government is really \ninterested in doing is listening to an American here at home with whom \nthe foreigner is communicating. This bill does have a provision that \npurports to address this issue. It prohibits intentionally targeting a \nperson outside the United States without an individualized court order \nif ``the purpose'' is to target someone reasonably believed to be in \nthe United States.\n  But this does not do the job. At best, this prevents the Government \nfrom targeting a person overseas as a complete pretext for getting \ninformation on someone in the United States. But this language would \nallow a lot more. The language would permit intentional and possibly \nunconstitutional warrantless surveillance of an American so long as the \nGovernment has any interest--any interest at all--no matter how small, \nin the person overseas with whom the American is communicating. The \nbill does not include language that had the support of the House and \nthe vast majority of the Senate's Democratic caucus that would have \nrequired the Government to obtain a court order whenever a significant \npurpose of the surveillance was to acquire the communications of an \nAmerican in the United States. The administration's refusal to accept \nthat reasonable restriction on its power is quite telling.\n\n  Third, the bill before us imposes no meaningful consequences if the \nGovernment initiates surveillance using procedures that have not been \napproved by the FISA Court, and the FISA Court later finds that those \nprocedures were unlawful. Say, for example, the FISA Court determines \nthat the procedures were not even reasonably designed to wiretap \nforeigners outside the United States rather than Americans at home. \nUnder this bill, all that illegally obtained information on Americans \ncan be retained and used. Once again, as seems to recur over and over \nagain in this sordid tale, there are no consequences for illegal \nbehavior by the Government of the United States. That is just wrong.\n  Unlike the Senate bill, this new bill does generally provide for FISA \nCourt review of surveillance procedures before surveillance begins, and \nthat is one of the changes that has been touted by supporters of the \nbill. But the bill also says if the Attorney General and the Director \nof National Intelligence certify they don't have time to get a court \norder, and that intelligence important to national security may be lost \nor not timely acquired, then they can go forward without traditional \napproval. This is a far cry from allowing an exception to FISA Court \nreview in a true emergency because, arguably, all intelligence is \nimportant to national security and any delay at all might cause some \nintelligence to be lost. So I am concerned that this so-called \n``exigency'' exception could very well swallow the rule and undermine \nany presumption at all of prior judicial approval. That could result in \nno prior court review. No prior judicial review. Let's just trust an \nadministration--including this administration--rather than having the \nchecks and balances that clearly the Founders of our country understood \nto be central in any situation such as this.\n  Fourth, this bill doesn't protect the privacy of Americans whose \ncommunications will be collected in vast new quantities. The \nadministration's mantra has been: Don't worry, we have minimization \nprocedures. But minimization procedures are nothing more\n\n[[Page S6459]]\n\nthan unchecked executive branch decisions about what information on \nAmericans constitutes ``foreign intelligence.'' That is why on the \nSenate floor I joined with Senator Webb and Senator Tester earlier this \nyear to offer an amendment to provide real protections for the privacy \nof Americans, while also giving the Government the flexibility that it \nneeds to wiretap terrorists overseas.\n  This bill relies solely on inadequate minimization procedures to \nprotect innocent Americans, and they are simply not enough.\n  As I said at the outset, some supporters of this bill have pointed to \nimprovements made since the Senate passed the bill earlier this year. I \nappreciate that some changes have been made, but those changes are \neither inadequate or they do not go to the core privacy issues raised \nby this bill. In fact, as the distinguished Senator from Missouri, the \nvice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said just \nyesterday, the bill before us is ``basically the Senate bill all over \nagain'' with only ``cosmetic fixes.'' That is what the Republican vice \nchairman of the committee said. Any Democrat who suggests that this is \nsomehow a big change, I don't think they read the bill, because it \ndoesn't do the job.\n  For example, I am pleased the bill provides for FISA Court review of \ntargeting minimization procedures, but as I mentioned, there is a \npotentially gaping loophole allowing the executive branch to go forward \nwith surveillance without court review--an exception that could swallow \nthe rule. The bill also now explicitly directs the FISA Court to \nconsider whether the Government's procedures comply with the fourth \namendment, but that is an authority it should have had anyway.\n  The bill includes an inspector general review of the illegal program, \nwhich is a positive change, but that doesn't make up for the lawsuits \nthat are going to be dismissed as a result of this legislation. I \nstrongly support the strengthened exclusivity language which, perhaps, \nmay defer a future administration from engaging in lawless behavior, \nbut let's not lose sight of the fact that FISA, as originally enacted, \nclearly stated already that it and the criminal wiretap laws were the \nexclusive means for conducting electronic surveillance. This was \nconfirmed in the strongest terms possible by a Federal district court \njust last week.\n  The idea that we would simply trust this administration, especially, \nto follow this exclusivity language when they have taken such a \ndismissive attitude with respect to the current exclusivity language is \nabsurd. Only under the unprecedented legal theories of this \nadministration could that clear language be ignored, requiring Congress \nto pass language that effectively says: No, we really mean it. If this \nbill is enacted, I am by no means reassured that this administration, \nwhich repeatedly broke the law and misled the public over the past 7 \nyears, will now respect the exclusivity of FISA.\n  Now, the bill does contain a key protection for Americans traveling \noverseas. It says if the Government wants to intentionally target \nAmericans while they are outside of the country, it has to get an \nindividualized FISA Court order based on probable cause. That is a \ngreat victory, and it is one we should be proud of, but it does not \noverride the greatly expanded authorities in this bill to collect other \ntypes of communications involving Americans.\n  In sum, these improvements are obviously not enough. They are nowhere \nclose. So I must strongly oppose this bill.\n\n  When you consider how we got here, this legislation is particularly \ndiscouraging. We discovered in late 2005 that the President had \nauthorized an illegal program in blatant violation of a statute and \nthat Congress and the public had been misled in a variety of ways \nleading up to this public revelation. Congress, to its credit, held \nhearings on the program, but was largely stonewalled by the \nadministration for many months until the administration grudgingly \nagreed to brief the intelligence committees and, more recently, the \njudiciary committees. Nonetheless, the vast majority in the House and \nSenate have never been told what happened. In 2006, when the \nRepublicans tried to push through legislation to grant massive new \nsurveillance authority to the executive branch, we stopped it. But now, \nin a Democratic-controlled Congress not only did we pass the Protect \nAmerica Act, but we are now about to extend for more than 4 years these \nexpansive surveillance powers, and we are about to grant immunity to \ncompanies that are alleged to have participated in the administration's \nlawlessness.\n  I sit on the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees. I am one of the \nfew Members of this body who has been fully briefed on the warrantless \nwiretapping program. Based on what I know, I can promise that if more \ninformation is declassified about the program in the future, as is \nlikely to happen either due to the inspectors general report, the \nelection of a new President, or simply the passage of time, Members of \nthis body will regret that we passed this legislation. I am also \nfamiliar with the collection activities that have been conducted under \nthe Protect America Act and will continue under this bill. I invite any \nof my colleagues who wish to know more about these activities to come \nspeak to me in a classified setting. Publicly, all I can say is that I \nhave serious concerns about how those activities may have impacted the \ncivil liberties of all Americans. If we grant these new powers to the \nGovernment and the effects become known to the American people, we will \nrealize what a mistake it was. Of that, I am sure.\n  So I hope my colleagues will think long and hard about their votes on \nthis bill and consider how they and their constituents will feel about \nthis vote 5, 10, or 20 years from now. I am confident that history will \nnot judge this Senate kindly if it endorses this tragic retreat from \nthe principles that have governed government conduct in this sensitive \narea for 30 years. I urge my colleagues to stand up for the rule of law \nand defeat this bill.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I applaud the Senator from Wisconsin for \nhis statement. I concur with it.\n  The Senate has before it three amendments to bring accountability to \nthis legislation: the Dodd-Feingold-Leahy amendment, the Specter \namendment, and the Bingaman alternative. I intend to vote in favor of \neach of these three amendments.\n  As I noted at the outset of this debate and consistently throughout \nthe course of Senate consideration of these matters, I oppose \nlegislation that does not provide accountability for the 6 years of \nillegal, warrantless wiretapping initiated and approved by the Bush-\nCheney administration. The bill, if it is adopted without amendments, \nseems intended to result in the dismissal of ongoing cases against the \ntelecommunications carriers that participated in the warrantless \nwiretapping program without allowing a court ever to review whether the \nprogram itself was legal. None of us are out to punish the \ntelecommunications carriers, but we worry if anybody is going to be \nheld accountable. As it is now, the bill would have the effect of \nensuring that this administration is never called to answer for its \nactions and never held accountable in a court of law. I do not support \na result that says the President of the United States, whomever he or \nshe is, is above the law and, therefore, I would not support the bill \nunless it is amended.\n  It is now almost 7 years since this President began efforts to \ncircumvent the law. In violation of the provisions of the governing \nstatute, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, this President and \nhis administration engaged in a program of warrantless wiretapping. I \nbelieve that conduct was illegal. In running its program of warrantless \nsurveillance, the administration relied on ends-oriented legal opinions \nprepared in secret and shown only to a tiny group of like-minded \nofficials.\n  Basically, the administration said: This is what we want for legal \nadvice, now give it to us. This is what we want to do to step outside \nthe law; now you go tell us we can do that. As chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, of course I oppose that.\n  A former head of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel \ndescribed this program as a ``legal mess.'' This administration wants \nto make sure that no court ever reviews that\n\n[[Page S6460]]\n\nlegal mess. The bill before us seems to guarantee they get their wish.\n  As Senator Specter and I have both confirmed during the course of \nthis debate, the administration worked hard to ensure that Congress \ncould not effectively review the legality of the program. Since the \nexistence of this program became known through the press, the Judiciary \nCommittee repeatedly tried to obtain access to the information its \nmembers needed to evaluate the administration's legal arguments. \nIndeed, Senator Specter, when he was chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, prepared subpoenas for the telecommunications carriers to \nobtain information, simply because the administration would not tell us \ndirectly what it had done, but those subpoenas were never issued; Vice \nPresident Cheney intervened to undercut Senator Specter and prevent the \ncommittee from voting on them.\n  There are public reports that at least one telecommunications carrier \nrefused to comply with the administration's request to cooperate with \nthe warrantless wiretapping. Surely that objection raised a red flag \nfor all involved. It is clear that the administration did not want the \nSenate to evaluate the evidence and draw its own conclusions. Again, it \nsought to avoid accountability.\n  If we look at the publicly available information about the \nPresident's program, it becomes clear that title II is designed to tank \nthese lawsuits, pure and simple, and allow for the administration to \navoid accountability. The Senate Intelligence Committee said in a \nreport last fall that the providers received letters from the Attorney \nGeneral stating that the activities had been ``authorized by the \nPresident'' and ``determined to be lawful.'' Guess what. These are \nprecisely the ``magic'' words that will retroactively immunize the \nproviders under title II of this bill. So the fix is in. The bill is \nrigged, based on what we already know, to ensure that the providers get \nimmunity and the cases get dismissed.\n\n  So what if Americans' rights were violated. So what if laws were \nviolated. This bill makes the Federal courts the handmaiden to a \ncoverup. That is wrong.\n  Make no mistake. If title II becomes law, we would take away the only \navenue for Americans to seek redress for harms to their privacy and \ntheir liberties, and there will likely be no judicial review of this \nadministration's illegal actions. Those who claim that American \ncitizens can still pursue their privacy claims against Government, they \nknow that sovereign immunity is a roadblock. They know that cases \nagainst Government have been dismissed for lack of standing. They know \nabout the Government's ability to assert the state secrets doctrine. \nThey know the Michigan case that held the President's warrantless \nwiretapping program illegal was later vacated on appeal for lack of \nstanding. Indeed, for all of the talk about holding the Government \naccountable, they have chosen to do nothing to make any case against \nthe Government more viable. This is a red herring if ever there was \none. We are telling Americans we are closing the door. We are telling \nAmericans--law-abiding, honest, good, hard-working Americans--that we \nare closing the courthouse door in their face because we have to \nprotect the President and those around him who may have done something \nillegal.\n  Last week, a Federal judge in San Francisco ruled that FISA's \nprovisions trump the state secrets privilege. But that same judge was \nconstrained to hold that plaintiffs still must prove that they are \n``aggrieved'' under FISA to maintain standing to sue the Government. It \nis not at all clear whether these plaintiffs, or any others, can make \nthis showing. Absent congressional action to facilitate judgments on \nthe merits, these cases against the Government are unlikely to survive.\n  The report of the Senate Committee on Intelligence in connection with \nits earlier version of the bill that also included retroactive immunity \nis telling. The committee wrote:\n\n       The Committee does not intend for this section to apply to, \n     or in any way affect, pending or future suits against the \n     Government as to the legality of the President's program.\n\n  And later wrote:\n\n       Section 202 makes no assessment about the legality of the \n     President's program.\n\n  But neither that bill nor this one makes any allowance for such suits \nagainst the government to proceed to a decision on the merits. That is \nprecisely what is lacking in this measure--an avenue to obtain \nmeaningful judicial review and accountability.\n  Those who support retroactive immunity for the telecommunications \ncarriers without providing an effective avenue to challenge the program \nor obtain judicial review of its legality, support unaccountability, \npure and simple. I would have supported the efforts of the Government \nto indemnify the telecommunications carriers if we could substitute the \nGovernment to have accountability. I also support alternative efforts \nby Senator Specter and Senator Whitehouse to substitute the Government \nin those cases so that the cases could proceed to a judgment on the \nmerits. That would have allowed judicial review and provided for \naccountability.\n  The Senate is going to vote on a bill today which does not allow \nthat. All the years I was growing up in Vermont we were told nobody is \nabove the law. All my time in law school we were told nobody is above \nthe law. We take an oath of office when we are sworn into this body \nwhere there are only 100 of us to represent 300 million Americans, but \nwe are also told no one is above the law. We are about to vote on a \nbill that says, well, the President and those people around him are \nabove the law.\n  Just as Vice President Cheney is not supposed to control the \nCongress, the administration is not supposed to control the Federal \ncourts. In this democracy of coequal branches in which not even the \nPresident is above the law, judicial review is an important mechanism \nto correct the overreaching and excesses of the Executive. Since the \nlandmark case of Marbury v. Madison, the principle of judicial review \nhas been firmly established. Unfortunately, that principle is being \nsacrificed to this administration's claim that it, outside of all other \nadministrations in this Nation's history--this administration, the \nBush-Cheney administration--should be able to act with absolute \nimpunity and act outside the law.\n  On the other hand, I believe a Federal court could well find that the \nlimitations this bill, if enacted, would place on the courts' ability \nto rule on the legality of this program are themselves \nunconstitutional.\n  Under the strictest read of the language of the bill, the cases in \nquestion will most certainly be dismissed. Attorney General Mukasey \nmust simply certify to the court that the ``alleged'' activity was the \nsubject of a written request from the Attorney General, which indicated \nthat the activity was authorized by the President and ``determined to \nbe lawful.'' This process gives me, and I would hope the Federal \ncourts, pause.\n  If the judicial review provided by the bill is intended to be \nmeaningful, the only way for that to happen is if the courts, in fact, \nreview the legality of the warrantless wiretapping program. Surely, a \ncourt might find that it cannot dismiss an American's claim of a \ndeprivation of rights based on the mere assertion by a party in \ninterest that it told another party that what they were doing was \n``determined to be lawful.'' In this setting, in fact, the current \nAttorney General is not certifying or representing to the court that \nthe warrantless wiretapping program was lawful. All the bill requires \nis that the Attorney General certify that the phone company acted at \nthe behest of the administration and that the administration \n``indicat[ed]'' that the activity was ``determined to be lawful''--by \nsomebody, at some time.\n  A court might reason that Congress could not have intended for the \ncourt to abdicate its judicial review role and become a mere rubber \nstamp. The court might nevertheless engage in ``meaningful'' judicial \nreview. Wouldn't that be great.\n  How else, the court might reason, is it to assure itself that the \nAttorney General's certification is valid and worth affirming as a \njustification for closing the court house doors to Americans claiming \ndeprivation of their constitutionally guaranteed rights? That is the \nonly way to provide any real meaningful judicial review.\n  Indeed, the reasoning would go, any other reading would be an \nunconstitutional rule of decision. See United States v. Klein, 13 Wall. \n128 (U.S. 1872). Congress simply does not have authority to tell the \ncourts, a coequal branch,\n\n[[Page S6461]]\n\nhow it must decide a case. So, in order not to reach that \nconstitutional predicament, the court could interpret the statute to \nallow it to review the legality of the President's warrantless \nwiretapping program.\n  Another recent model for such meaningful review is that of the Court \nof Appeals for the District of Columbia in the Parhat v. Gates case. \nThere, the appellate court invalidated a Combatant Status Review \nTribunal's decision that petitioner Huzaifa Parhat, a member of a \nChinese Muslim minority group called Uighurs, was properly designated \nas an ``enemy combatant.''\n  Under the restrictive language of the Detainee Treatment Act, the \ncourt's review in the Parhat case was expressly limited to \nconsideration whether the status determination of the CSRT was \n``consistent with the standards and procedures'' specified by the \nSecretary of Defense for CSRTs, and whether ``to the extent the \nConstitution and laws of the United States are applicable, whether the \nuse of such standards and procedures to make the determination is \nconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.''\n  The Parhat decision shows that in order to make its review \nmeaningful, the court interpreted its role as reviewing the probity and \nreliability of the evidence in order to reach its conclusion on the \nvalidity of CSRT's designation of Parhat as an ``enemy combatant.'' In \nso doing the court noted that to do otherwise would be ``perilously \nclose to suggesting that whatever the government says must be treated \nas true, thus rendering superfluous both the role of the Tribunal and \nthe role that Congress assigned to this court.'' It noted that ``[t]o \ndo otherwise would require the courts to rubber-stamp the government's \ncharges'' rather than engage in meaningful judicial review.\n  I believe that independent judicial review would reject the \nadministration's claims to authority from the Authorization for the Use \nof Military Force to engage in warrantless wiretapping of Americans in \nviolation of FISA. I believe that the President's claim to an inherent \npower, a Commander-in-Chief override, derived somewhere from the \ninterstices or penumbra of the Constitution's Article II, would not \nprevail over the express provisions of FISA.\n  Indeed, Chairman Rockefeller seemed to concede as much yesterday \nmorning when he asserted that nothing in his bill should be taken to \nmean ``that Congress believes that the President's program was legal.'' \nHe characterized the administration as having made ``very strained \narguments to circumvent existing law in carrying out the President's \nwarrantless surveillance program.''\n  At various points, Senator Rockefeller alluded to the \nadministration's argument that the Authorization for the Use of \nMilitary Force was some sort of statutory override authority and the \nadministration's claim that the President has what Senator Rockefeller \ncalled ``his all-purpose powers,'' which I understand to be the \nadministration's argument that inherent authority from Article II of \nthe Constitution creates a commander-in-chief override, and said that \nthese are not justifications for having circumvented FISA.\n  Consistent with Justice Jackson's now well-accepted analysis in the \nYoungstown Sheet & Tube case, when the President seeks to act in an \narea in which Congress has acted and exercised its authority, the \nPresident's power is at it ``lowest ebb.'' So I believe that the. \nPresident's program of warrantless wiretapping contrary to and in \ncircumvention of FISA will not be upheld based on his claim of some \noverriding Article II power. I do not believe the President is above \nthe law.\n  What is most revealing is that the administration has worked so \nfeverishly to subvert any judicial review. That sends a strong signal \nthat the administration has no confidence in its supposed legal \nanalysis or its purported claims to legal authority. If it were \nconfident, the administration would not be raising all manner of \ntechnical legal defenses but would work with Congress and the courts to \nallow a legal test of its contentions and of its actions.\n  One Federal district judge in Detroit has already declared the \nPresident's warrantless wiretapping program to have been \nunconstitutional. Another in San Francisco just last week cast grave \ndoubt on the legality of the President's warrantless wiretapping \nprogram, finding that the exclusivity provisions in FISA left no doubt \nthat operating outside of the statute's framework was unlawful.\n  I urge the courts to exercise their rightful role to ensure justice \nis done.\n  As I have said, I recognize that this legislation also contains \nimportant surveillance authorities. I support this new authority, and \nhave worked for years to craft legislation that provides that important \nauthority along with appropriate protections for privacy and civil \nliberties. The Judiciary Committee reported such a bill last fall. I \ncommend House Majority Leader Hoyer and Senator Rockefeller, who \nnegotiated this legislation, for incorporating several additional \nprotections that bring the bill the Senate previously passed closer to \nthe Judiciary Committee's bill. While I would seek even greater civil \nliberties protections in Title I, there is no doubt that this bill \nprovides stronger protections than the Senate bill I previously \nopposed.\n  I note, in particular, the requirement of an Inspector General review \nof the President's warrantless wiretapping program. It is a provision I \noffered and insisted upon when the Judiciary Committee reported its \nversion of the FISA legislation. I had previously sought to add this \nprovision to the Senate Intelligence Committee's bill. This review will \nprovide for a comprehensive examination of the facts of that program \nand should prove useful to the next President.\n  I believe still more protections for privacy and civil liberties are \nnecessary, and if this bill becomes law, I will work with the next \nadministration on additional protections.\n  I should emphasize that while the Inspector General provision serves \nimportant purposes, its inclusion in this bill is no substitute for a \nlegal review of the President's warrantless wiretapping program. \nFederal judges and Inspectors General perform different functions. \nInspector General reviews can be very useful for factual review of past \nactions, and I expect the inspectors general to undertake a probing and \ncomprehensive review. But Inspectors General are not well-suited to \ndetermine whether the President's warrantless wiretapping program was \nlegal. In fact, this bill prevents the Inspectors General from engaging \nin that kind of legal review.\n  Courts, on the other hand, are well-suited to make these kinds of \nlegal determinations. They do it all the time. Federal judges make \nconclusions of law every day in this country based on facts found by a \njury or, if the right to jury trial is waived, based on their own \nfactual conclusions. But this administration doesn't want this kind of \nreview. It has fought for years to avoid a determination by our courts \nof the legality--or more precisely the illegality--of the President's \nprogram. If the administration gets its wish through passage of this \nbill, there will likely be no conclusive judgment on the lawfulness of \nthe President's program--ever--and no accountability.\n  I, therefore, cannot support this legislation without amendment. I do \nnot believe Congress should seek to take away the only viable avenue \nfor Americans to seek redress for harms to their privacy and liberties, \nand the only viable avenue of accountability for the administration's \nlawlessness. This administration violated FISA by conducting \nwarrantless surveillance for more than five years. They got caught. The \napparent purpose of this bill is to ensure that they will not be held \nto account. That is wrong. I will vote to support the amendments before \nus today to bring accountability to this legislation, but I will vote \nno in opposition to the effort to secure immunity for this \nadministration's illegal activity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator has 30 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to make the \nfinal argument in support of my amendment pending on a very vital issue \nfacing this body.\n  We are asked today to do two things that I believe are unprecedented \nin the\n\n[[Page S6462]]\n\nhistory of the Senate. First, we are called upon to vote on legislation \nwhere most of the Members admittedly don't know what we are voting on; \nsecond, we are stripping the Federal court of jurisdiction on some 40 \ncases that have been pending for more than 3 years and are in the \nprocess of litigation.\n  On point 2, we are flying in the face of the most fundamental \ndecision in the history of the United States on constitutional law, \nMarbury v. Madison, going back to 1803, 205 years, and Chief Justice \nMarshall saying that it is emphatically the province and duty of the \njudicial department to say what the law is.\n  But the Congress is now being asked by the administration to grant \nretroactive immunity to the telephone companies, where the judge who is \npresiding on the case, Chief Justice Vaughn Walker, in the Federal \ncourt in San Francisco, has declared that the terrorist surveillance \nprogram put into effect by the President violates the Constitution and \nexceeds his constitutional authority in directly violating the \nstatutory provision that the exclusive way to wiretap is with court \napproval.\n  Here we have a situation where it is admitted that most Members of \nthe House of Representatives, according to the House leadership, have \nnot been briefed on the program. What we have are allegations in the \nlegal papers as to having the telephone companies act at the request of \nthe Government to invade privacy, without going through the customary \njudicial process of securing a warrant.\n  On the floor yesterday, after extended argument, it is plain that \nmost Members of the Senate have not been briefed on this program. There \nis an old expression, ``buying a pig in a poke.'' It means buying \nsomething and you don't know what it is you are buying. Well, that is \nwhat the Senate is being asked to do today--to grant retroactive \nimmunity to a program where the Members don't know what the program is. \nHow does that comport with our reputation that we in the Senate so \npride ourselves on, being the world's greatest deliberative body?\n  I suggest that this may be a historical embarrassment, where we are \nvoting on matters where everybody knows we don't know what we are \nvoting on. The fact may be that we vote with some frequency on matters \nthat we don't know what we are voting on, where we have voluminous \nreports that are impossible for any Senator to go through. But here we \nare caught redhanded. Everybody knows we don't know what this program \nis; yet we are granting retroactive immunity to the telephone \ncompanies.\n  I believe the telephone companies have been good citizens. There is a \nway to have the telephone companies protected without giving up the \nprogram. That would be by substituting the Government as a party \ndefendant, so you could both have the program and have the telephone \ncompanies protected.\n  Yesterday, in an extended discussion with the chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee and other Members on the floor, I pressed to see \nif anybody knew of any case that had been pending for more than 3 \nyears, where Chief Judge Walker has handed down a lengthy opinion, \nrunning some 27 pages, on the issue of state secrets on this electronic \nsurveillance. Just a week ago today, he handed down a 59-page opinion \ndeclaring that the Presidential power exceeded the constitutional \nauthorization of article II. The first opinion is on appeal to the \nCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. And here we are stripping the \ncourt of jurisdiction. I posed the question, Has that ever happened \nbefore? And it hasn't happened before.\n  I intend to support the amendment and cosponsor the amendment by \nSenator Bingaman, which would follow up on what the inspectors general \ndo, to have it returned to Congress to see if the program is working. \nThat is a good remedial step, but it doesn't go far enough. It has too \nmany ifs, ands, and buts in it. I think it is a good fallback position, \nand I will support it. I urge my colleagues not to take Senator \nBingaman's amendment as a substitute for my amendment because it \ndoesn't go as far and it doesn't reach the constitutional issues.\n  We are dealing here with a matter that is of historic importance. I \nbelieve that years from now, historians will look back on this period \nfrom 9/11 to the present as the greatest expansion of Executive \nauthority in history--unchecked expansion of authority. The President \ndisregards the National Security Act of 1947 mandating notice to the \nIntelligence Committee; he doesn't do it. The President takes \nlegislation that is presented by Congress and he signs it, and then he \nissues a signing statement disagreeing with key provisions. There is \nnothing Congress can do about it.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States has gone absent without leave \non the issue, in my legal opinion. When the Detroit Federal judge found \nthe terrorist surveillance program unconstitutional, it was affirmed by \nthe Sixth Circuit on a 2-to-1 opinion on grounds of lack of standing. \nThen the Supreme Court refused to review the case. But the very \nformidable dissenting opinion laid out all of the grounds where there \nwas ample basis to grant standing. Now we have Chief Judge Walker \ndeclaring the act unconstitutional.\n  The Congress ought to let the courts fulfill their constitutional \nfunction. It is understandable that Congress continues to support law \nenforcement powers because of the continuing terrorist threat. No one \nwants to be blamed for another 9/11. My own briefings on the telephone \ncompanies' cooperation with the Government have convinced me of the \nprogram's value, so I voted for it even though my amendment to \nsubstitute the Government for the telephone companies was defeated in \nthe Senate's February vote.\n  Similarly, with great reluctance, I am prepared to support it again \nas a last resort, even if it cannot be improved by providing for \njudicial review. However, since Congress has been so ineffective in \nproviding a check and balance, I am fighting hard today again to secure \npassage of my amendment to keep the courts open.\n  When the stakes are high, as they inevitably are, when Congress \naddresses civil liberties and national security, Members frequently \nmust choose between the lesser of two imperfect options. Unfortunately, \nwe too often back ourselves into these corners by deferring legislation \nuntil there is a looming deadline. Perhaps this is why so many of my \ncolleagues have resigned themselves to accepting the current bill \nwithout seeking to improve it further.\n  Although I am prepared to stomach this bill, if I must, I am not yet \nready to concede that the debate is over. Contrary to the conventional \nwisdom, I don't believe it is too late to make this bill better. \nPerhaps the Fourth of July holiday will inspire the Senate to consider \nits independence from the executive branch now that we have returned to \nWashington.\n  These issues are extraordinarily complex. It is my hope that my \ncolleagues will focus on these two unprecedented acts where we are \ncalled upon to vote for something we admittedly do not know what we are \nvoting for because we don't know what this program is; secondly, to \ntake the unprecedented step of intervening in the judicial process on a \ncase pending for more than 3 years in the Federal courts.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Senator Leahy has yielded me his remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Leahy only has 30 seconds.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Yes. Mr. President, international terrorism is a serious \nissue, and every Member of this body has pledged to protect the \nAmerican people, and we will do that. But we will and must do it within \nthe context of the Constitution of the United States and the law of the \nland. No individual, no President, is above the law. This President, \nperhaps more than any other in history, has abdicated the Constitution \nof the United States. The time is now to stand up and say: No more.\n  Let's defeat this legislation. Let's assure the American people that \nin fact we are a nation of laws, not individuals.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask that I be allowed to speak for up \nto 10\n\n[[Page S6463]]\n\nminutes. I don't expect to use all that time. And then my colleague \nfrom Connecticut, Senator Dodd, be allowed to speak for up to 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is part of the previous order.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, first, let me comment on the statement \nSenator Specter of Pennsylvania made about his own amendment. I support \nhis amendment. I wish to make it very clear that the amendment I am \noffering is not intended as a substitute for his amendment. I favor his \namendment. I favor the amendment I am offering as well. And, of course, \nI favor Senator Dodd's amendment as well, which he is going to speak \nabout in a few moments. I wished to make that clear.\n  Let me describe the amendment very briefly. I did that yesterday. \nThis amendment is cosponsored by Senators Casey, Specter, Clinton, and \nNelson of Florida. It is based on the simple proposition that we ought \nto conduct a thorough investigation before we grant any retroactive \nimmunity to telecom companies.\n  In my view, the structure of this bill has it backward. As currently \ndrafted, it would grant immunity first, and then after those companies \nare shielded for any potential liability for their past actions, the \nlegislation requires a comprehensive investigation regarding the \ncompany's participation in the President's warrantless surveillance \nprogram.\n  The amendment I am offering would fix the problem by putting in place \nwhat I believe is a more logical process.\n  As I discussed yesterday, the amendment would do three things. First, \nit would stay all the civil cases against the telecom companies as soon \nas the legislation is signed into law. Second, it would allow time for \nthe inspectors general to investigate the circumstances surrounding \nthis warrantless surveillance program. And third, it would give \nCongress 90 days to review the findings of that investigation before \nthe companies could ask a court to dismiss the cases pending against \nthem.\n  I believe this is a very modest proposal. It would not change any of \nthe substantive provisions in the immunity title. The amendment only \nmodifies the timing of when these companies may seek immunity.\n  The amendment would not prejudice or harm the telecom companies while \nthe investigation is being conducted. All the civil cases would be on \nhold and neither side would be incurring litigation expenses.\n  It would not create any risk whatsoever of sensitive information \nbeing leaked during the remainder of the litigation process. There \nwould be no evidence submitted to the court during this period of stay. \nThere would be no discovery. There would be no classified information \nbeing discussed. As I have stated, the cases would be stayed, would be \non hold.\n  Lastly, the amendment would not hamper our Nation's ability to \ncollect necessary intelligence. The amendment does not limit any of the \nauthority being provided to the Government under this legislation to \nconduct foreign intelligence gathering. It would not discourage telecom \ncompanies from assisting the Government in the future. Under this \nlegislation, companies would still be required to comply with lawful \ndirectives and would receive liability protection for any help they \nprovide.\n  But the amendment does do something that I believe is very important. \nIt would ensure that before these cases may be dismissed, Congress has \nan opportunity to know exactly what illegal acts, if any, it is \nforgiving. The Senator from Pennsylvania made a very strong case that \nMembers of the Senate do not know what it is we are granting immunity \nfor at this stage.\n  I believe the American people expect Congress to act in an informed \nmanner. Quite frankly, other than select members of the Intelligence \nand Judiciary Committees, this Congress has not been fully informed \nabout the circumstances surrounding this program. That is precisely why \nthe investigation that is required under the legislation is so \nimportant and precisely why it is so important that we get the results \nof that investigation before we proceed.\n  We are talking about a program that was not conducted in accordance \nwith the law and from what we do know may have violated the \nconstitutional rights of many innocent Americans. I hope my colleagues \nwill agree it is reasonable to keep these suits from being dismissed \nuntil at least we have a complete picture of what actions we are \nshielding from liability.\n  I yield the floor and yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me first, as I did last evening, begin \nby commending our colleague from West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, \nwho has the unenviable task of chairing the Intelligence Committee, a \ncomplex committee with very serious issues before it. Whatever \ndifferences we have should not in any way suggest a lack of \nappreciation for what he and his staff and others do to try and bring \nforth legislation to allow us to balance the needs of our security as \nwell as our rights as citizens.\n  It is that very question which draws me to this amendment I offered \nwhich will be subject to a vote in a few minutes. This is a debate that \nhas gone on for the last 7 months, beginning with the Judiciary \nCommittee's reports of last fall, a debate last December and that \ncontinued into January and has been going all winter and spring and \nabout to be culminated with the decisions we are about to make over the \nnext hour or so, including the amendment being offered by Senator \nSpecter and Senator Bingaman, both amendments I intend to support.\n  The amendment I have offered, along with Senator Feingold and a \nnumber of our colleagues, simply strikes title II of this bill. Title \nII of this bill is the title that grants retroactive immunity to the \ntelecommunications industry.\n  The facts are very clear. The telecommunications industry, based on \nsome documents, possibly a letter or others, decided it was appropriate \nfor them to gather virtually all the e-mails, telephone conversations, \nand the like, of millions and millions of Americans, over a period of 5 \nor 6 years in the wake of 9/11. As I said repeatedly, had this gone on \na month or a year or so, I would not have raised objections, given the \nemotion surrounding the attack on our country. But this program, I \nsuggest, would still be ongoing had it not been for a whistleblower who \nhelped identify the program.\n  This is not an issue of whether we disagree at all with revising the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act to comply with the needs as our \nenemies gather more sophisticated means by which they can do us harm. \nIt is the age-old question which has confronted this Republic of ours \nfor 232 years. And that is: How do we balance security with \nsimultaneously protecting the rights under our Constitution? Every \ngeneration who has preceded us has wrestled with this question.\n  The one issue we do not subscribe to is the notion that to be more \nsecure, you have to give up rights. That is a fundamentally flawed \nidea. Every generation who has suggested and adopted it has regretted \nit in one case after another. Whether it was internment of Japanese \nAmericans out of fear and other such cases, in every instance when we \nabandoned rights for security, we have come to regret it deeply.\n  I come, again, to offer this idea to allow the judiciary to do their \njob. That is what they exist for, that is why the Founders created \nthree coequal branches of Government--the executive, legislative, and \njudicial branches.\n  We are not deciding the case. We are merely saying the courts ought \nto do that. Retroactive immunity for companies that may have broken the \nlaw may well soon become the law. That is the danger. As certain as it \nappears the outcome of the votes will be, equally certain, in my view, \nis that this matter will not end today regardless of what we do. This \nwill end up in the courts, and there, not only the wisdom of granting \nretroactive immunity to these companies will be questioned but the \nconstitutionality of that decision.\n\n  I have spoken at length about this legislation. It subjugates the \nrole of the courts. But even as this body moves forward with this bill, \nopponents of retroactive immunity can take some solace in knowing it \nwill still ultimately be the judiciary that decides the \nconstitutionality of this action, as the Framers intended.\n  I can hardly see how it would have passed muster with our Founders. \nIt was, after all, James Madison who said:\n\n\n[[Page S6464]]\n\n\n       I believe there are more instances of the abridgment of the \n     freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments of \n     those in power than by violent and sudden usurpations.\n\n  He spoke those words at the Virginia Convention to ratify the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  I can hardly see how men who did not simply utter such sentiments, \nbut rather sacrificed everything in the name of them, could have \nenvisioned America ceding her hard-fought liberty in a moment of fear \nor weakness.\n  Is this bill constitutional? This is not for me or any one of us to \ndecide. I am not a judge. None of us are. We are not a jury in this \ncase. None of us are. We are Senators who treasure the document we have \nsworn to uphold. I have kept a copy with me every day, going back the \n27 years I have served in this body.\n  What is for this body is to decide how we best safeguard our Nation's \nsecurity. Greater security for our citizens is what, of course, all of \nus want from this bill. But if we have learned anything from this \nadministration, it is that there is a right way to protect our Nation \nand a wrong way.\n  We learned that when even those of us in this body act with the best \nof intentions, we can still do lasting damage because we are not acting \nwith foresight and prudence but with an impulsiveness and, in too many \ncases, out of fear.\n  No one doubts for a moment the gravity of the threats we face or \ncontinue to face. No one suggests we do not have an obligation to \nmonitor terrorists' communications with the utmost of vigilance. I wish \nto make sure the Government has every tool it needs to do so. I have no \ninterest whatsoever in denying our Government what it needs to make our \ncountry safe. I want our President to have the capabilities to stop \nterrorists before they act, before they inflict harm on our country, \nour communities, and our families. I think we can and must do that in a \nway that balances national security with our rights and liberties.\n  But for reasons I have described at length in previous debates, this \nso-called compromise strikes no balance at all, in my view.\n  Let us be very clear, the courts have continuously shown an ability \nto handle cases with sensitive security issues. Chief Judge Vaughn \nWalker, a Ronald Reagan appointee to the District Court to the Northern \nDistrict of California, who has virtually overseen all the cases \nchallenging the NSA's warrantless wiretapping program, demonstrated \nthis once again.\n  In a case against the Government, Judge Walker recently ruled ``FISA \npreempts the state secrets privilege in connection with electronic \nsurveillance for intelligence purposes . . . '' This ruling suggests \nthat in suits against the telecommunications companies, they will be \nable to defend themselves and not be hamstrung by the state secrets \nprivilege. At the very least, this decision highlights how premature it \nwould be for Congress to grant retroactive immunity at this time.\n  The sum and substance of our argument is very simply this: Now is not \nthe time to close the courthouse doors on this issue. I cannot say it \nenough. My trust remains in the courts in cases argued openly and \njudges presiding over them and juries of American citizens who decide \nthem. Our courts should be a source of our pride, not our \nembarrassment. They deserve the chance to do the job the Framers \nintended them to do.\n  As complex, as diverse, as relentless as the assault on the rule of \nlaw has been, our answer to it is a simple one. Far more than any \nPresident's lawlessness, the American way of justice remains deeply \nrooted in our character as a people that no President can disturb. That \nis why, even on this day, I remain full of hope and faith that we can \nunite security and justice because we already have over the \ngenerations.\n  I harbor no illusions about what is about to happen with this \nlegislation or its consequences. But even as this long fight draws to a \nclose, it is worth pausing for a moment to recognize those who have \njoined us in writing its many chapters. They have not been written by \nany one hand alone.\n  Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin has fought this battle with me \nfrom the very beginning. His leadership has been articulate, his \ncommitment unwavering and unyielding.\n  The Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, fought valiantly to bring the Senate Judiciary Committee \nversion of this bill that he crafted to the floor of this body. He has \nbeen a staunch opponent of retroactive immunity.\n  The majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, has stood with us on this \nfight. I thank him for it as well. It has not been easy to have been \nthe majority leader taking the position he has and also managing this \nbill to move forward. Even as he fought and sought to balance his \npersonal opposition to retroactive immunity with his responsibility to \nmove this legislation as leader, he has given us every opportunity to \nspeak out against this legislation. He has worked hard to make sure the \nworld's foremost deliberative body, as it is often called, would, \nindeed, be given a chance to deliberate over a matter that goes to the \nvery core of who we are as a republic. In Congresses past, I cannot \nsay, with certainty, that my colleagues and I would have been afforded \nthe opportunity the majority leader has given each and every one of us, \nand I thank him for it.\n  Lastly, I thank the thousands who joined with us in this fight around \nthe country, those who took to the blogs, gathered signatures for \nonline petitions, created a movement behind the issue, men and women, \nyoung and old, who stood up, spoke out, and gave us the strength to \ncarry on in this fight. Not one of them had to be involved, but they \nchose to be involved for one reason and one reason alone: their deep \nlove for this country, the Constitution, and its liberties. They remind \nthat the silent encroachment of those in power, as Madison spoke of, \ncan, in fact, be heard if only we are willing to listen.\n  All of us, my colleagues and citizens around the country, share a \nfundamental belief in our Constitution. We believe our constitution \nisn't incidental to our security, rather it is its very foundation. \nThis notion that it is the rule of law that keeps us safe should not be \ncontroversial. There should not be a partisan divide. I take no \nbackseat, as no one does, when it comes to protecting America's safety \nand security. But if history has taught us anything, it simply doesn't \nrequire sacrificing our freedoms to do that.\n  I do not believe history will judge this President kindly for his \ncontempt of the rule of law. But will history be any kinder to those of \nus who have served as these transgressions have occurred on our watch? \nI have two young daughters. Their generation is going to ask their \nparents and grandparents some very pointed questions:\n  Where were you when the President asked you to repudiate the Geneva \nConventions and strip away the rights of habeas corpus? Where were you \nwhen stories of secret prisons and outsourced torture first began to \nsurface and then became impossible to deny? And of today, they will \nask: Where were you when Congress was persuaded to shield wealthy \ncorporations that may well have knowingly acted outside of the law to \nspy on our fellow citizens? Where were we in that debate?\n  History will not forget. It will not forget our role in any of this. \nAnd just as surely as subsequent generations will ask all of us those \nquestions, what will be clear is that we will have failed to ask \nourselves one very fundamental question: Does America stand for the \nrule of law or for the rule of men? That question never goes away. It \nhas been the same question asked for more than two centuries. It has \nbeen with us, of course, these past 7 years in very strong and poignant \nways. It will haunt us long after this bill passes, long after this \nadministration recedes into history, long after we all have passed into \nhistory ourselves. Indeed, generations of leaders and free societies \nhave struggled to answer the question for thousands of years.\n  That is the question every generation must answer for themselves. It \nis a battle for the American soul, waged between our better angels and \nour worst fears. Our Founders answered the question correctly. I ask \nthe question: Will we?\n  Mr. President, allow me to close with one of my favorite quotations, \none I have recited many times on the floor of this Chamber. It is from \nJustice Robert Jackson's opening statement at the Nuremberg trials in \nthe summer of July of 1945. He said . . .\n\n\n[[Page S6465]]\n\n\n       That four great nations, flushed with victory and stung \n     with injury, stay the hand of vengeance by voluntarily \n     submitting their captive enemies to the judgment of the law \n     is one of the most significant tributes that Power has ever \n     paid to Reason.\n\n  The tribute that Power owes to Reason is as clear today as it was \nwhen those words were spoken more than half a century ago. That America \nstands for a transcendent idea; the idea that laws should rule, not \nmen; the idea that the Constitution does not get suspended for \nvengeance; the idea that when this Nation begins to tailor its eternal \nprinciples to the conflict of the moment, it risks walking in the \nfootsteps of the very enemies we despise. As Margaret Thatcher said: \n``When law ends, tyranny begins.''\n  Today, let us pay the tribute that Power owes to Reason today--in \nthis moment, with these votes. I implore my colleagues to vote against \nretroactive immunity, against cloture, and above all, for the rule of \nlaw.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, yesterday, we heard some discussion \nof last week's decision in the district court in California. In that \ncase, the court ruled that FISA limits the power of the executive \nbranch to conduct foreign intelligence surveillance activities and \nlimits the executive branch's authority to assert the state secrets \nprivilege. That opinion, however, is only minimally relevant to the \ndebate before us today for three reasons.\n  First, the decision was in a case against the U.S. Government. In \ncontrast, title II applies only to cases against telecommunications \ncompanies, not to suits brought against the Government. The case will \ntherefore be unaffected by title II.\n  Furthermore, because a provider could be entitled to protection from \nsuit under existing law even if the Government acted \nunconstitutionally, this decision does not resolve the question of \nwhether telecommunications companies acted lawfully or should be \nentitled to immunity.\n  Second, the decision in the case is only one step in a lawsuit that \nmay continue in the district court and which will likely be appealed. \nThis decision, which is a long way from being final, does not affect \nthe need for the Congress to act on this legislation.\n  Third, the court found that the civil liability provisions of FISA \ntrump the state secrets privilege only to the extent that those civil \nliability provisions apply. This is not a broad exemption to the state \nsecrets privilege. The opinion does not change the fact that the \ncompanies are and, unless we pass title II, will continue to be unable \nto assert their statutory defenses because of the Government's \nassertion of the state secrets privilege.\n  The one thing that the decision shows us is that the court can \nconsider the issue of constitutionality in those suits being brought \nagainst the Government. Congress therefore does not need to require the \ncourts to consider that issue in suits against private companies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, is there a time set for the beginning \nof the votes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not. There is approximately 30 \nminutes of debate remaining.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. This Senator wanted to be clear about that because \nSenator Bond will be coming. I will speak shortly, and then he will \ncome down to speak also.\n  Mr. President, we are at quite a remarkable period now, because we \nare actually closing the debate on something which we have been \ndiscussing in this Chamber, in committees, around the Congress, in the \npress, in general, for quite a long time. It has been an amazing \ndebate, and today we close debate on the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act Amendments of 2008.\n  I wish to thank all of my colleagues for engaging in this critically \nimportant debate, both on and off the Senate floor, whether for or \nagainst whatever amendments we will be voting on today. People have \nexpressed their principles, they have been articulate, they have spoken \nwith restraint and dignity and eloquence, and I respect that very much. \nI think that is the essence of senatorial behavior. We have vigorously \ndebated the appropriate controls for electronic surveillance to collect \nforeign intelligence information since the disclosure was made 2\\1/2\\ \nyears ago about the President's wireless surveillance program, which is \na travesty--a travesty from 2001 to 2007. An absolute travesty. And \nbecause of the contributions not only of those who have supported \nearlier versions of this legislation but also of those who have opposed \nvarious provisions to deal with those issues, we have moved forward to \ncraft, in this Senator's judgment, a strong bipartisan, bicameral \ncompromise that is supported not just by the Senate but also by the \nHouse, which was unwilling to support it before at all, but also by the \nAttorney General and the Director of National Intelligence, both of \nwhom are entirely relevant to what is in this bill and what is to be \nsaid about what is in this bill.\n  This final product is critical to the Nation's security. I am aware \nof both our rights and our security. In my job as chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee, I have to look at both. I was brought up in a \ntradition, in a family which worried about rights, and I have fallen \ninto a position where I am in a position to see what goes on in this \nworld. In a post-9/11 situation, it is very different. It is like \ncomparing fighting wars against the Soviets as opposed to against al-\nQaida, the Taliban, or whatever it is. It is a very different world. \nYou can't tell who anybody else is, you can't tell what their \nintentions are, you can't tell what is in a suitcase which might be \nlying anywhere in this building or anywhere else.\n  When you walk around this Capitol, you see levels of security which \nyou have never seen before. We frequently evacuate this building and \nour offices, all because of what happened on 9/11, and what had been \nplanned well before that. So it is serious. And not that it makes any \ndifference--it makes us no more important than any other citizen in the \nUnited States--but we do know that United Airlines 93 was headed for \nthis building and for this complex. So there is an instinct to \nunderstand that those who oppose us and who would have us change our \nway of life and punish us for what they see as our sins are very \nserious in their work, patient in their work, and willing to wait to \ncontinue their work.\n  The final product is, therefore, critical to the Nation's security, \nand it sets forth a legal framework to reflect the enormous changes in \ntelecommunications technology over the last 30 years. The bill couples \nthis improvement in foreign intelligence collection against foreign \ntargets overseas with important protections for civil liberties, \nincluding the review by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of \nthe targeting and minimization procedures governing these collection \nactivities.\n  In addition, the bill ensures that when Americans overseas are the \ntarget, that a FISA Court judge, rather than the Attorney General--in a \nvery important change--decide that there is clear authority and \nprobable cause for intelligence agencies to target such an individual.\n  The bill also requires the Attorney General to develop guidelines to \nprevent prohibited activities, such as reverse targeting. That was put \nbefore us by Senator Feingold, who is in opposition to this bill but \nwho made that contribution to this bill, along with others, to ensure \nindividual FISA Court orders are obtained, when required.\n  You can't do anything these days without a FISA Court review if you \nare in the Government. You can't do anything. That is only title I of \nthe bill, not title II.\n  There are new oversight and reporting requirements to Congress in the \nagreement and a sunset date that means these issues will be addressed \nduring the next administration. And I think that is very important, \nbecause some people said: Well, let this law be permanent and forever.\n  There were those of us who didn't want that to happen. We said: We \nare in new territory here. It is a post-9/11 world. It is very \ndifferent. So we need to put down into law what we believe, but we also \nneed to go back and review that, to make sure we have done it \ncorrectly. So in a period of 4\\1/2\\ years, during the administration of \nthe next President, he will be able to review, along with us, what we \nhave done and\n\n[[Page S6466]]\n\ndecide if we need to make any changes. I like that. I think that is \nfair. I think that is democratic.\n  Certainly the most controversial aspect of this legislation has been \nthose provisions that set standards and procedures that allow the \ncourts to find limited immunity protection for electronic communication \nservice providers alleged to have assisted the Government in the \nPresident's warrantless surveillance program. Under this agreement, \nhowever, these provisions are not the blanket immunity that the \nadministration first proposed, nor are they a statement by the Congress \neither pro or con on the legality of the program.\n  We have debated these liability protection provisions in great depth \nover the past 2 days--over the past 2 years, really. As I have said in \nopposition to the amendments that were offered to strike or amend the \nlimited liability provisions, I am convinced the bill takes the right \napproach. We did have efforts to have substitution rather than \nimmunity, and they were defeated. They were defeated in the Judiciary \nCommittee, they were defeated on the floor of the Senate, and it was \nthought if they would be brought up again, they would have been \ndefeated again. So we have been through this. The Senate has worked its \njudgment on that approach.\n  I believe the requirement in the bill for the inspectors general to \ncomplete a comprehensive review of the President's program is much more \nlikely to provide the American people a complete set of facts about the \nprogram on a timely basis, to the extent that classification permits, \nthan would continuation of the pending litigation. In other words, we \nhave improved it.\n  And to be quite honest, we passed this 13 to 2 in committee, and then \nwith 68, 69 votes, whatever it was in the Senate, we passed the Senate \nbill that came out of the Senate Intelligence Committee, but the House \nhad not. They were not happy. They had their reasons. And so we went to \nthem, the vice chairman, Christopher Bond, and myself and our staff, \nand we worked with them endlessly. We worked with the White House, to \nsome extent; with the DNI, the Director of National Intelligence, the \nAttorney General's office, extensively working through individual ways \nof compromising to make sure that we could protect companies that \nprovide the intercept and the collection of communications we need to \nget, but to do so in a way which made it clear that the Government was \nthe issue, not them. And we have done that.\n  Finally, with this agreement, we settle the issue of whether past or \nfuture congressional authorizations for the use of military force that \ndo not include a reference to surveillance may be used to justify the \nconduct of warrantless electronic surveillance. This was an \nextraordinarily important thing to do, and Senator Feinstein deserves a \nlot of credit for that--the exclusivity amendment. We have said you \ncannot conduct any of this collection outside of FISA. You have to have \na warrant. You cannot go outside. You cannot use what the President \nlikes to refer to as inherent powers to do anything he wants. You can't \ndo that. You have to have authorization from the Congress in order to \ndo that. That is clear--for the first time in this bill. That is huge. \nThat restricts some of the comments we have been hearing earlier.\n\n  FISA remains the exclusive means by which electronic surveillance or \ninterception will be conducted from this point forward unless the \nCongress sees some reason to make it either stronger or whatever. With \nenactment of this bill, there will be no question that Congress intends \nthat only an express statutory authorization for electronic \nsurveillance or interception may constitute an additional exclusive \nmeans for that surveillance or interception. In other words, you cannot \ndo anything more without congressional authorization. That is \noversight. That is what we ought to be doing. It is what we should have \ndone but we didn't do. The world changed. We didn't change quickly \nenough. But we have changed enormously in this bill.\n  This is buttressed further with the clarification that criminal and \ncivil penalties can be imposed for any electronic surveillance that is \nnot conducted in accordance with FISA or specifically listed provisions \nof title 18.\n  In closing, I would like to address my colleagues who would have \npreferred a different result than the agreement before us today. I urge \nthem not so much now--there being not much time--but I urge them in the \ncoming days, weeks, and months to look at this legislation in its \nentirety; not to think about a single point here or a single point \nthere but to look at the whole texture of it. This is what we are \ndoing. That is why we have a sunset date, so we will again be looking \nat it, looking at the larger picture, seeing what the balance really is \nand are we keeping it properly as between safety and civil rights, \nindividual rights. That is very important.\n  This is a bill which provides a framework and stability within the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act for a collection system that will \nwork well for national security. That is very important to this Nation. \nThat is very important to this body and to every single American. This \nbill is vastly better than the Protect America Act, obviously, enacted \nlast August, and much preferred to any additional short-term extension \nof that flawed statute--which was one approach. This is a bill which \ncontains important safeguards for civil liberties and effective \nmechanisms for oversight.\n  I do not think any of the committees that deal with these measures \nwill ever be the same again, nor have they been in the last year and a \nhalf with respect to oversight. The vigor, the passion with which we \nsought, leveraged, coerced in some cases, the administration to make \nmore people read into the program, to make more people a part of the \ndiscussion, make more people a part of the knowledge which they held so \nclosely to themselves--I remember at one point I was one of 4 out of \n535 people who were briefed on the program, and they kept saying on \ntelevision: The Congress is briefed. And this was a joke, this was a \nfarce. I will not go into it further but, believe me, it was. They did \nnot do that, they did not want to do that. That is their nature. Now it \nis different. Now we are all over them. And we have a lot more to do \nbefore this Congress gets out with respect to the oversight factor of \nCongress, which is so important to us and to the Nation.\n  Support for the agreement says to the intelligence professionals who \nwill implement the new authority that Congress takes seriously its \noversight responsibilities. Some of them do not like that fact. They do \nnot want us to. They want to be able to do what they have always done \nbecause they could do what they always wanted to do--before the world \nchanged. Now they cannot. Yes, we have had intelligence committees for \na long time, and, yes, they have done work for a long time, but there \nhas never been a greater need for tough oversight.\n  Sometimes when the Director of the CIA calls me--and I don't think I \nam saying anything privileged here--and he wants to tell me about \nsomething good that has happened--it is a secure conversation on a \nsecure phone--I say: Look, when I hear from you, I want to hear what \nyou want to tell me that is good, and I also want to hear from you \nabout something that is not working right.\n  That is the pattern which is developing. They are a little more timid \nabout coming up to us. We have to negotiate more to have them come \nbefore us, but we do it because we need them and they need our \noversight. They are not free to do entirely what they want to do, but \nwe have to give them the full right to keep us safe, yet balance, as I \nbelieve we do in this bill, civil liberty protections.\n  I simply close by congratulating all people involved. I think for a \nsubject which was meant to be understood by so few in this body, many \npeople have expressed views on the floor and to many of us in private. \nIt has been the subject of caucus discussions.\n  It is a major piece of legislation, and I urge my colleagues to \noppose the three remaining amendments, and I urge my colleagues to vote \nyes on final passage. They will serve their Nation well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, is there an order established \nhere under unanimous consent?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3 minutes remaining for the Senator\n\n[[Page S6467]]\n\nfrom Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, and 9 minutes for the Senator from \nMissouri, Mr. Bond.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator allow me to have a couple of \nmoments?\n  Mr. BOND. Off Senator Feingold's time.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. What is the procedure? Since Senator Feingold \nis not here, is that locked in as such for him?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, might I inquire whether that was \nentirely necessary--or, rather, of the Parliamentarian--is that \nentirely necessary? The Senator does wish to speak. We are not starting \nvotes quite yet. There does not seem to be a total limit on that, a \ntime set for that, and the Senator has been wanting to speak for a \nnumber of days. I would be happy if he would be able to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is only 3 minutes on the majority side \nfor Senator Feingold. It would require unanimous consent.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. What about leader time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Only the leader has leader time.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. And that is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \ndisappointment with the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, H.R. 6304. While \nproponents of this bill have claimed this bill was designed to monitor \nforeign-to-foreign communications that pass through the U.S. without a \nwarrant, the bill actually goes much further--providing a broad \nexpansion of authority to conduct domestic surveillance.\n  We all want to protect our country's national security interests and \nprotect Americans from those who would do us harm, but to do so without \naccountability or without adequate checks and balances is contrary to \nthe vision of our Founding Fathers.\n  I recognize that some changes have been made to this bill over the \npast 6 months but those cosmetic changes have failed to adequately \nprotect the privacy rights of innocent Americans.\n  This bill permits the Government to collect all Americans' \ninternational communications, even communications of innocent Americans \nwith no connection to terrorism or other national security concerns. \nThis bulk collection of innocent Americans' private communications is \nunacceptable and contrary to American values and fundamental \nConstitutional protections.\n  While this administration has ignored the congressional mandate that \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is the exclusive means for \nconducting wiretapping activities on American citizens, Congress can \nnot ignore the weighty constitutional issues being decided here today.\n  I am also very troubled that telecom companies will not be held \naccountable for participation in the Bush administration's warrantless \nsurveillance program. Congress should not be providing blanket immunity \nfor telecommunications companies that cooperated with the \nadministration's warrantless wiretapping programs. We don't know \nprecisely what those companies did or the full extent of what they did.\n  This bill effectively grants retroactive immunity to companies that \naided the Bush administration's warrantless wiretapping over the last 7 \nyears. It would effectively dismiss 40 cases pending against the \ntelecommunications companies that are undergoing judicial review. \nJudicial review is a critical component of our Government to check \npotential overreaching by the executive branch.\n  This administration wants to ensure that no court has the opportunity \nto review potential illegal activity, effectively slamming the door \nshut before the judicial system can determine whether American \ncitizens' rights were violated.\n  This is why I voted in support of Senator Dodd's amendment to strike \nthe immunity provision today, and I am disappointed that it was not \nadopted. Congress should respect judicial review and not take away the \nonly opportunity for redress available to American citizens for \npotential overreaching by this administration.\n  According to public documents and media reports, a telecom company \nallegedly split off a copy of the Internet traffic transported over \nfiber-optic cable running though its San Francisco office and diverted \nit to another room under the supervision of a Federal Government \nagency, where the copy was transported to equipment that could review \nand select out the contents and data mine call patterns of \ncommunications.\n  The reason I say allegedly is because all the details are classified, \nsources and methods, and those who do not know can at best only make \neducated guesses while those who do know can not or will not say.\n  Now the Electronic Frontier Foundation believes that the telecom \ncompany has deployed similar facilities in 15 to 20 different locations \naround the country, implying a significant fraction of the \ncommunications to and from the telecom firm's domestic customers could \nhave been examined illegally. And it is critical that we get to the \nbottom of this.\n  Congress would be acting even though only last week Judge Walker \nissued a key ruling holding that held that the government could not \nprevent plaintiffs from submitting unclassified evidence to support \ntheir claims against telecommunications companies. Congress should \nrespect the judiciary's role and allow it to move forward with these \ncases.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. I yield a minute and a half to my distinguished colleague \nfrom Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I am grateful to the vice chairman. I wish to \nsay--and I will do it in a minute and a half--how much I appreciate the \nchairman and vice chairman being able to come up with a product that we \nneed so we get some certainty about the court review of this process so \nwe can balance this interest of going after the terrorists but at the \nsame time protecting the civil liberties of American citizens and \nAmerican persons who are here legally in the country. I think the bill \ndoes that. We have struggled with it for a year and a half in our \ncommittee. I am certainly going to support the final product.\n  There are obviously some matters we have had in the Intelligence \nCommittee that we are not able to discuss here. I am sure the people \nlistening understand that. I just want to say on the controversial \nissue of immunity that I do not believe in blanket immunity for the \nphone companies, and that is why, when this issue was in front of our \nIntelligence Committee, I offered language to deny them immunity. But \nit failed, my amendment, and it failed miserably. So when it came to \nthe floor, I offered a compromise to the full Senate, along with \nSenator Feinstein, that would have required a special court to review \nthe phone companies' action, but that failed as well.\n  Now I am backing an amendment by Senator Bingaman that would at least \ndelay immunity until the inspectors general of the U.S. Government \ncomplete their investigation of the President's warrantless wiretapping \nprogram. Upon completion of the report, the Senate will have 90 days to \nact before immunity is granted to the telecommunications companies. \nThis will allow us time to change some minds if real wrongdoing is \nfound.\n  Overall, I believe this legislation significantly improves civil \nliberties protections for Americans while enabling our intelligence \ncommunity to listen in on terrorists. This is an important step forward \nand I will support this legislation.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nFlorida, who has been a hard-working member of the Intelligence \nCommittee and has been a great contributor. I am sorry he does not \nagree with the compromise we reached with the House to have the \ndistrict courts make a review. I think that is important. That \nsatisfies our needs.\n  Several points made on the floor today and previously need to be \nanswered. It has been said that the new surveillance powers allow the \nGovernment to collect all communications between the United States and \nthe rest of the world, millions and millions of communications between \ninnocent Americans, parents calling children\n\n[[Page S6468]]\n\nabroad, people serving in Iraq. There is no prohibition on reverse \ntargeting.\n  A plain reading of the bill shows us that this statement is simply \ninaccurate. As the Senator from Utah said earlier today: Unless you \nhave al-Qaida on your speed dial, you are not going to be collected \nagainst. There are safeguards in place to ensure that any conversations \nthat do not have foreign intelligence information will not be kept or \nshared, they will be minimized or suppressed.\n  Americans either inside or outside the United States may not be \ntargeted without court order. That ``outside of the U.S.'' protection \nwas something we added on a bipartisan basis in the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee.\n  In addition to approving any collection against Americans, anybody in \nthe United States, an American overseas, the FISA Court will review all \nprocedures used to target foreign communications and make sure that \ncommunications with innocent Americans are minimized or suppressed.\n  As far as reverse targeting goes, I refer my colleagues to section \n702(B) of the bill which says:\n\n       An acquisition authorized under subsection 8 may not \n     intentionally target a person reasonably believed to be \n     located outside the United States if the purpose of such \n     acquisition is to target a particular known person reasonably \n     believed to be in the United States.\n\n  I can assure you that I and other members of the Intelligence \nCommittee have reviewed the procedures, have seen the operations, know \nthe supervision, and know the very tight constraints under which these \nprofessionals operate. They are overseen by supervisors, by higher \nlevel authorities, by inspectors general, by lawyers, their own \nlawyers, and lawyers from the Department of Justice. Somebody made an \nerror and collected some criminal information a year or so ago and that \nwas dealt with appropriately. There is no ability for somebody, even a \nrogue who happens to get in, to get away with targeting innocent \nAmerican communications.\n  There has been a lot of debate also about the Senators having access \nto all of the information. As I pointed out earlier, we set up the \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence to provide the most highly \nclassified information to members of the committee. I have worked hard \nwith the chairman, and we have opened to the full Intelligence \nCommittee far more information than we ever got before, because I \nbelieve the Intelligence Committee has a heavy responsibility to make \nsure that what is being done stays within the law, stays within the \nguidelines, and protects the rights of American citizens.\n  But if you say that every intelligence matter should be briefed to \nthe entire Congress, where does that stop? Should we then brief the New \nYork Times directly so they can publish a story and decide whether the \nintelligence activity is acceptable? I think not. I think we have seen \nthe problems that occur when leaks have compromised our intelligence. \nThey have done it too often.\n  Some people still want to debate the legality of the TSP, saying it \nis blatantly illegal. Well, they persist in their belief that the \nPresident lacks the constitutional authority to conduct warrantless \nforeign intelligence surveillance, even though article II has not \nchanged in over 200 years.\n  The FISA Court itself, en banc, In re: Sealed Case, has noted the \nPresident has that authority, and if the Congress tried to pass a law \nsaying the President does not have that authority, it would be found to \nbe unlawful.\n  The intelligence community has been overseen by the Intelligence \nCommittee, and we have found clearly that the companies acted in good \nfaith. Regardless, however, of the legality of the President's TSP, it \nis a matter of fundamental fairness. These providers should not be \npunished by forcing them to litigate frivolous claims or by delaying \nthis much needed relief.\n  Without these companies, without their active participation on this \nand many other matters, the intelligence community is fearful and has \nlost cooperation in the past. They are taking risks by being good \npatriotic Americans, and there are some who want to punish them. They \nwant to kick them to get at the administration. Well, this bill does \nnot prohibit lawsuits against the Government or Government officials.\n  I believe the time has come for us to pass a bill after 15 months. We \nnow know that we have before us the ability to give clear authority, \ndirection, and guidelines to the intelligence community to operate to \nkeep us safe. We have added new protections, and if the President had \nnot followed the advice of the ``gang of eight'' and had tried to \nreform the FISA rather than using article II, we would not only be \ndebating September 11, there would be many others.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote down all these amendments and pass this \nbadly needed modernization of intelligence collection, electronic \nsurveillance, and the provisions of the additional privacy rights and \nprotections for American citizens.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5064\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote on the amendment offered by the Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Dodd.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. All time has been yielded. I ask unanimous consent, \nen bloc, that the vice chairman and I ask for the yeas and the nays on \nall of the upcoming votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the yeas and nays may be \nrequested on all three amendments.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. There is 2 minutes equally divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this has been a long debate. It started last \nfall. Again, let me commend the two members here, the chair and ranking \nmember of the committee. I respect their efforts. But my friend from \nMissouri has made my case. This is a matter for the courts to decide, \nnot for the legislative branch to decide. It is why we have three \ncoequal branches of Government.\n  It is not our business as a juror and judge to determine the legality \nof what occurred here. This much we do know through published reports: \nSince 1978, 18,748 requests for warrants from the FISA Court have been \ngranted; 5 have been rejected.\n  Why did this administration not proceed with the normal course of \nevents here and seek justification and legal authority for the \nvacuuming up of private information of American citizens? All of us \nhere want our agencies to do everything they can to protect our \nsecurity. But all of us equally care about the liberties of our \ncountry.\n  The false dichotomy that is being suggested by what is in this bill, \nthat in order to be more secure we have to give up rights, is a \ndangerous dichotomy. It is a false choice.\n  Previous generations have made it. We should not. Let's strike this \ntitle, allow the courts to determine whether what occurred was legal \nand then proceed.\n  Some of the companies did not do what others did because they felt it \nwas not legal, what they were being asked to perform. Clearly there was \nsome doubt in the minds of people as to justification. So I happen to \nbelieve the best way to proceed, as did Judge Walker, appointed by \nRonald Reagan to the district court which has handled most of these NSA \ncases in the past, that the secret privilege will be protected, the \ncourt can do its job and determine the legality here. It is not the \nplace for the Senate to act as the judicial branch of Government. That \nis why the Founders created three coequal branches of Government. That \nis what the issue is, the rule of law or the rule of men. That is what \nthis amendment does by striking this title and allowing these matters \nto go before the court. I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Permit me to relieve the Senator from Connecticut, a good \nfriend and a good legislator, of some of his concerns. No. 1: During \nthe President's terrorist surveillance program, even though it was \noperating under article II, he went to the FISA Court to get warrants \nfor listening in on American communications, the same procedure we have \noutlined in this bill\n\n[[Page S6469]]\n\ntoday. But what he was able to do was to listen in on terrorists \nreasonably believed to be abroad, which is now included in our bill.\n  Article II is clear that he has that right. Article II was used by \nPresident Bill Clinton for a physical search, a physical search of \nAldridge Ames' home; and the Congress responded by giving him more \npower.\n  Secondly, it is said that the article II should be challenged. I \npoint out that there is no ban, no ban on lawsuits such as a lawsuit \nbefore Judge Walker, on lawsuits going forward against the Government \nor Government officials.\n  The Intelligence Committee conducted a comprehensive review of the \nTSP. We determined, on a strong bipartisan basis, that the providers \nacted in good faith pursuant to representations from the highest level \nof the Government that the TSP was lawful. It is not right to punish \npatriotic Americans who step forward and help their Government by \nsubjecting them to harassment of lawsuits.\n  I urge the defeat of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote for the \npending amendment to avoid two unprecedented actions. One is that the \nSenate is being called upon to vote on retroactive immunity for a \nprogram that most of the Members do not know and have not been briefed \non. We frequently vote on matters that we do not know about but not \nwhen it is so blatant, when it is on the record that we do not know \nabout it, we are caught red-handed. We ought not to be giving \nretroactive immunity on a program where most of the Members have not \nbeen briefed.\n  The second unprecedented act would be to intervene in a court \ndecision which has been pending for 3 years, where a judge has found \nthe terrorist surveillance program unconstitutional, where it is on \nappeal to the Ninth Circuit. And Marbury v. Madison, which is the \ncornerstone of this democracy, says the courts have to interpret the \nConstitution.\n  Mr. BYRD. Right.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Vote for this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair, especially for securing order. It is \nunprecedented. There is another unprecedented act today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment, which would \nrequire the district court to assess the constitutionality of the \nPresident's program--which is not what this is about--before it could \ndismiss cases against any telecommunications companies which \nparticipated in it.\n  The amendment unnecessarily puts the burden of constitutionality--a \nburden that lies squarely on the shoulders of the Government--on the \nshoulders of telecommunications companies that cooperated with the \nGovernment in good faith. This is unfair.\n  Because the Government requires prompted cooperation from \ntelecommunications companies, we do not ask those companies to make \ndetailed legal assessments prior to cooperating with the Government. \nTheir protection from suit should not be limited based upon \nconstitutional questions they had no obligation to assess.\n  The significant constitutional question of whether the President's \nprogram was constitutional or lawful is properly addressed in cases \nagainst Government officials who are not immune. These cases can and \nshould continue, without regard to this legislation.\n  I ask that people oppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote on the amendment offered by the Senator from \nNew Mexico, Mr. Bingaman.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, first, I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Feinstein be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the bill that is pending before us has \nthe sequence of events in the wrong order. It provides that once the \nbill is enacted, companies can go into court and get the lawsuits \ndismissed. After that, there is an investigation provided for\n\n[[Page S6470]]\n\nby the inspectors general to determine what was going on in this \nprogram and what, in fact, we are providing immunity for. That is the \nwrong sequence.\n  What we ought to do is to stay the cases, stay any proceedings on \nthese cases, keep them in court, have the investigation done--a 1-year \ninvestigation, which is provided for in the bill, and then have 90 days \nin which Congress can review that investigation and the results of it. \nOnly after that would the companies be able to go into court and seek \nimmunity. That is a much more realistic way to proceed. I am glad we \nhave cosponsors of this amendment who support the final bill, we have \ncosponsors who oppose the final bill.\n  I hope all Senators will look at this and see this as something they \ncan support. It would improve the legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the simple fact is, the IGs have already \nreviewed this bill. I agreed to a limited inspectors general overall \nreview, even though the Senate Intelligence Committee has reviewed the \nprogram on a bipartisan basis. At a time when we are urging more \ncongressional oversight, why would we again turn over the question of \nthe executive branch's actions to an executive branch agency when the \ncommittee has clearly said there is no reason to deny retroactive \nliability protection to these areas?\n  Now, there are some who don't like the program at all. There are some \nwho don't like the administration. They want to kick the administration \nby penalizing the companies, by dragging the companies through a \ncontinuing stretch of frivolous lawsuits. The Senator from Pennsylvania \nadmitted that there is going to be no recovery. The lawsuits are \ndesigned to kill it. This amendment would get a veto, and we would have \nto start all over. Please vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for Members here, we are going to do this \nvote now, and then the Republican caucus--because of Senator Helm's \nfuneral--is going to be today. So when the Republican caucus is \ncompleted, at 2, 2:15, we will have the final two votes before a 4 \no'clock vote today on Medicare. So we will have two votes this \nafternoon starting at about 2 or 2:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, some opponents of this legislation claim \nthat Congress is usurping the authority of the courts and that their \ntrust lies in single, lifetime appointed judges in the judicial branch. \nI strongly disagree.\n  The Constitution set up three coequal branches of Government. Our \nConstitution gives Congress the ability to determine the jurisdiction \nof Federal courts. This power is particularly important and necessary \ntoday in sensitive matters of national security.\n  Further, the courts, including the FISA Court, have recognized the \nexecutive branch's expertise in matters of national security. They have \nstated that national security matters are not within their purview. It \nis entirely appropriate for this Congress to end this litigation and \nnot entrust this matter any further to the courts with respect to the \nliability of particular participants in the program in the private \nsector. They can still sue the Government. We think a matter of \nfairness requires we protect those who assisted.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does anyone seek time in \nopposition? If not, all time is yielded back.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that the debate on \nH.R. 6304, the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, shall be brought to a \nclose?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN, I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, I rise to engage the distinguished chairman \nof the Select Committee on Intelligence in a brief colloquy.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Senator. Today we have been debating the merits \nof title II of this bill, the title that contains the carrier liability \nprotection provisions. I know that we both agree that title II is \ncritically necessary to protect our national security.\n  I would like us to focus for a moment on a small but important point \nrelated to the meaning of the term ``electronic communication service \nprovider'' in title II. This is a term that was contained in the \nbipartisan Senate bill and was carried over in the current compromise \nbill.\n  The term ``electronic communication service provider'' was \nintentionally drafted to encompass the full spectrum of entities being \nsued in a covered civil action. For example, if a provider received a \nwritten request or directive and the only assistance provided to the \nGovernment by that provider's related corporate entities was pursuant \nto that written request or directive, the related corporate entities \nshould be entitled to the protections of section 802 as long as any \nassistance they provided meets the requirements of that section.\n  Senator Rockefeller, do we share this common understanding of the \nmeaning of the term ``electronic communication service provider''?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Thank you, Senator Bond. I completely agree with \nyour description of the meaning of ``electronic communications service \nprovider.''\n  The definition itself makes clear that the term is intended to \ninclude entities that are telecommunications carriers, providers of \nelectronic communications service, providers of remote computing \nservices, and any other communication service provider that has access \nto transmitted or stored wire or electronic communications. \nSignificantly, the definition also includes any parent, subsidiary, \naffiliate, successor, or assignee of such entities, as well as any \nofficer, employee or agent of such entities.\n  Mr. BOND. Thank you Mr. Chairman.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as the debate over the FISA \nlegislation comes to a conclusion, and as a member of the Intelligence \nCommittee for 7\\1/2\\ years, I would like to comment once again on why I \nsupport this bill.\n  Let there be no doubt: 7 years after \n9/11, our country continues to face serious threats. There are some who \nseek to do us grave harm.\n  So there is no more important need than obtaining accurate, \nactionable intelligence to help prevent such an attack.\n  At the same time, there have to be strong safeguards to ensure that \nthe Government does not infringe on Americans' constitutional rights.\n  I believe this bill strikes an appropriate balance. It protects \nAmericans and their privacy rights.\n  This legislation is certainly better than the Protect America Act in \nthat regard and makes improvements over the 1978 FISA law.\n  This bill provides for repeated court review of surveillance done for \nintelligence purposes. It ends, once and for all, the practice of \nwarrantless surveillance. It protects Americans' constitutional rights \nboth at home and abroad. It provides the Government flexibility to \nprotect our Nation. It makes it crystal clear that FISA is the law of \nthe land--and that this law must be obeyed.\n  For more than 5 years, President Bush ran a warrantless surveillance \nprogram--called the terrorist surveillance program--outside of the law.\n  The administration did not have to do this. This specific program \ncould have been carried out under FISA--and I believe it should have \nbeen.\n  With this bill, we codify and clarify that this limited, intelligence \nprogram will be carried out under the law.\n  This legislation allows the Government to collect information from \nmembers of specific terrorist groups or specific foreign powers. It is \nfocused on collecting the content of communications from specific \npeople. If those people are Americans, a warrant is required. Period.\n  So today, we are faced with three options:\n  No. 1. We can pass this bill. It is comprehensive and improves \nprotections for U.S. persons and updates the FISA law to meet today's \nnational security challenges; or\n  No. 2. We can extend the Protect America Act. This bill was a stop-\ngap measure passed last August for a 6-month temporary period to \nprovide time to develop this legislation. It was meant to be temporary, \nand it should be only temporary.\n  No. 3. We can do nothing. If we do not pass legislation before mid-\nAugust, America will essentially be laid bare--unable to gather the \ncritical intelligence that we need.\n  We will lose the ability to collect information on calls into and out \nof the United States from specific terrorist groups. The fact is, like \nit or not, the collection of signals intelligence is indispensable if \nwe are to prevent another attack on our homeland.\n  Given these three options, I think the choice is clear.\n  The legislation is a significant improvement over the Protect America \nAct and over the 1978 FISA legislation.\n  Let me indicate certain substantial improvements:\n  This bill ends warrantless surveillance. Except in rare emergency \ncases, all surveillance has to be conducted pursuant to a court order.\n  The FISA Court reviews the Government's procedures and applications \nbefore surveillance happens.\n  This bill strengthens the court's review. Not only must the FISA \nCourt approve any surveillance before it is started, this court is \ngiven more discretion, with a higher standard of review, over the \nGovernment's proposals. The Protect America Act limited the court to a \nrubberstamp review. This bill changes that.\n  This bill requires that surveillance be subject to court-approved \nminimization.\n  In 1978, Congress said that the Government could carry out \nsurveillance on U.S. persons under a court warrant but required the \nGovernment to minimize the amount of information on those Americans who \nget included in the intelligence reporting. In practice, this actually \nmeans that the National Security Agency only includes information about \na U.S. person that is strictly necessary to convey the intelligence. \nMost of the time, the person's name is not included in the report. That \nis the minimization process.\n  If an American's communication is incidentally caught up in \nelectronic surveillance while the Government is targeting someone else, \nminimization protects that person's private information.\n  Now, the Protect America Act did not provide for court review over \nthis minimization process at all. But this bill requires the court in \nadvance to approve the Government's minimization procedures prior to \ncommencing with any minimization program. That is good. That is the \nthird improvement.\n  This bill prohibits reverse targeting. There is an explicit ban on \nreverse targeting. Now, what is reverse targeting? That is the concern \nthat the National Security Agency could get around the warrant \nrequirement.\n  If the NSA wanted to get my communications but did not want to go to \nthe FISA Court, they might try to figure out who I am talking with and \ncollect the content of their calls to get to me. This bill says you \ncannot do that. You cannot reverse target. It is prohibited. This was a \nconcern with the Protect America Act, and it is fixed in this bill.\n  This bill goes further than any legislation before it in protecting \nU.S. person privacy rights outside of the\n\n[[Page S6472]]\n\nUnited States. It requires the executive branch to get a warrant \nanytime it seeks to direct surveillance of collected content from a \nU.S. person anywhere in the world. Previously, no warrant was required \nfor content collection outside the United States.\n  Finally, there are numerous requirements in the bill for various \nreview of the surveillance activities by agency heads and by inspectors \ngeneral. The FISA Court and the Congress will be kept fully informed on \nthe operations of this program in the future.\n  Finally, exclusivity. Mr. President, I have spoken multiple times on \nthis floor about the importance of FISA's exclusivity provisions.\n  Before 1978, there was no check on the President's ability to conduct \nelectronic surveillance. However, in 1978, Congress passed FISA, \nintending it to be the only way. Congress intended that FISA would be \nthe only way--the exclusive means--to conduct surveillance on U.S. \npersons in the United States for foreign intelligence purposes. \nPresident Carter acknowledged that when he signed the bill.\n  Nonetheless, this administration took the position that FISA was not \nexclusive. First it stated that FISA didn't apply to these particular \nsurveillance activities. Then it said that Congress gave it authority \nthrough the Authorization for the Use of Military Force in Afghanistan. \nThen it said that the President couldn't be bound by an act of Congress \nbecause he had his own authority under the Constitution.\n  I reject all of these arguments. And now a Federal court has \naddressed the subject of exclusivity head-on.\n  On July 2, Chief Judge Vaughn Walker of the U.S. District Court for \nthe Northern District of California delivered a decision in a case \nbrought against the U.S. Government for its surveillance. Judge Walker \nwrote:\n\n       Congress appears clearly to have intended to--and did--\n     establish the exclusive means for foreign intelligence \n     surveillance activities to be conducted. Whatever power the \n     executive may otherwise have had in this regard, FISA limits \n     the power of the executive branch to conduct such activities \n     and it limits the executive branch's authority to assert the \n     state secrets privilege in response to challenges to the \n     legality of its foreign intelligence surveillance activities. \n     (M:06-cv-01791-VRW, p. 23)\n\n  These are powerful words in the opinion.\n  So it is not just clear legislative intent, it is the current \njudicial position that FISA was and is exclusive.\n  Yet, before the recess, it was asserted on the floor that the \nPresident has authority under article II of the Constitution to go \naround FISA. He does not, in my view.\n  Moreover, they claim that the exclusivity language in the bill \nacknowledges the President's constitutional authority to conduct \nelectronic surveillance outside of FISA. It does not.\n  As the author of this language, let me state emphatically that the \nclear intent of the language is to bind the Executive to this law.\n  Now, certain Senators are contending that this exclusivity language \nwould allow the President to go outside of FISA.\n  Let me be clear: this provision is not intended to, nor does it, \nprovide or recognize any new authority to conduct electronic \nsurveillance in contravention of FISA.\n  It was drafted very carefully with input and agreement from people \nfrom both sides of the Intelligence Committee and the Judiciary \nCommittee, the Department of Justice, and the Office of the Director of \nNational Intelligence.\n  The only way the President can move outside of FISA will be with \nanother specific statute, passed by both Houses and signed by the \nPresident.\n  In summary, the exclusivity language in this bill absolutely does not \nrecognize the President's claimed ``Article II'' authorities to conduct \nsurveillance in contravention of FISA or any other law.\n  The bottom line is that FISA has always been the exclusive means to \nconduct electronic surveillance, and it continues to be the exclusive \nmeans. And no President, now or in the future, has the authority to \nmove outside the law.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to set straight who in Congress was \nnotified about the program and when. Some are saying that the Congress \nwas briefed.\n  This is not true.\n  Eight Members of the House and Senate were briefed on the program \naround the time of its inception, shortly after September 11, 2001: the \nHouse and Senate leadership and the chairmen and ranking members of the \nIntelligence Committees.\n  The 13 rank-and-file members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, \nwho by law are to be kept ``fully and currently informed'' of \nintelligence activities, were not briefed until well after the program \nwas publicly disclosed in the New York Times in December 2005--4 years \nlater. I want to make this crystal clear.\n  The chairman and the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee--which \nshares jurisdiction over FISA--were not briefed until a significant \nperiod of time after the full membership of the Intelligence Committee \nwas notified.\n  Finally, I want to say a few words about immunity.\n  Let me be clear, this particular immunity language is not ideal. I \nwould have approached this issue differently.\n  When the legislation was before the Senate in February, I moved an \namendment to require that the FISA Court conduct a review of whether \nthe telecommunications companies acted lawfully and in good faith. \nUnfortunately, my amendment was not adopted, but I continue to believe \nit is the appropriate standard.\n  I have cosponsored an amendment by Senator Bingaman that would stay \naction on all pending lawsuits until 90 days after Congress receives a \nreport, required elsewhere in this bill, by the relevant inspectors \ngeneral on the President's surveillance program. That would give \nCongress a chance to decide on immunity based on a third-party review. \nIf lawmakers took no action within 90 days, the provisions would go \ninto effect.\n  I have spent a great deal of time reviewing this matter. I have read \nthe legal opinions written by the Office of Legal Counsel at the \nDepartment of Justice. I have read the written requests to \ntelecommunications companies. I have spoken to officials inside and \noutside the Government, including several meetings with the companies \nalleged to have participated in the program.\n  The companies were told after 9/11 that their assistance was needed \nto protect against further terrorist acts. This actually happened \nwithin weeks of 9/11. I think we can all understand and remember what \nthe situation was in the 3 weeks following 9/11.\n  The companies were told the surveillance program was authorized and \nthat it was legal.\n  I am one who believes it is right for the public and the private \nsector to support the Government at a time of need. When it is a matter \nof national security, it is all the more important.\n  I think the lion's share of the fault rests with the administration, \nnot with the companies.\n  It was the administration who refused to go to the FISA Court to seek \nwarrants. They could have gone to the FISA Court to seek these warrants \non a program basis, and they have done so subsequently.\n  So I am pleased this bill includes independent reviews of the \nadministration's actions to be conducted by the inspectors general of \nthe relevant departments.\n  This bill does provide a limited measure of court review. It is not \nas robust as my amendment would have provided, but it does provide an \nopportunity for the plaintiffs to be heard in court, and it provides an \nopportunity for the court to review these request documents.\n  Mr. President, this is not a perfect bill. It is the product of \ncompromise designed to make sure that it provides the needed \nintelligence capabilities and the needed privacy protections.\n  I think the bill strikes that balance and that the Nation will be \nmade more secure because of it.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Amendments Act of 2008. As one of the \ncosponsors of FISA in 1978, I am fully aware of the importance of \ngiving the administration the surveillance tools it needs to keep us \nsafe. This is a very difficult vote and I do not question the judgment \nof those who have chosen to support the bill. But because I am \nconcerned that this bill authorizes surveillance that is broader than \nnecessary to\n\n[[Page S6473]]\n\nprotect national security at the expense of civil liberties and because \nit gives blanket retroactive immunity to the telephone companies, I \nhave decided not to support it.\n  One of the defining challenges of our age is to combat international \nterrorism while maintaining our national values and our commitment to \nthe rule of law and individual rights. These two obligations are not \nmutually exclusive. Indeed, they reinforce one another. Unfortunately, \nthe President's national security policies have operated at the expense \nof our civil liberties. The examples are legion, but the issue that \nprompted the legislation before us today is one of the most notorious--\nhis secret program of eavesdropping on Americans without congressional \nauthorization or a judge's approval.\n  After insisting for a year that the President was not bound by the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act's clear prohibition on \nwarrantless surveillance of Americans, the administration subjected its \nsurveillance program to FISA Court review in January of 2007.\n  Then, last August, citing operational difficulties and heightened \nthreats that required changes to FISA, Congress passed the Protect \nAmerica Act--over my objection and that of many of my colleagues. I am \nsubmitting with this statement the objections I made at that time.\n  The Protect America Act, which sunset last February, amended FISA to \nallow warrantless surveillance, even when that surveillance intercepted \nthe communications of innocent American citizens inside the United \nStates.\n  The administration identified two problems it faces in conducting \nelectronic surveillance under FISA. First, the administration wanted \nclarification that it did not need to obtain a FISA warrant in order to \nconduct surveillance of calls between two parties when both of those \nparties are overseas. Because of the way global communications are now \ntransmitted, many communications between people all of whom are \noverseas are nonetheless routed through switching stations inside the \nUnited States. In other words, when someone in Islamabad, Pakistan \ncalls someone in London, that call is likely to be routed through \ncommunications switching stations right here in the United States. \nCongress did not intend FISA to apply to such calls, and I support a \nlegislative fix to clarify that point.\n  The second problem the administration identified is more difficult. \nEven assuming that the Government does not need a FISA warrant to tap \ninto switching stations here in the United States in order to intercept \ncalls between two people who are abroad--between Pakistan and England, \nfor example--if the target in Pakistan calls someone inside the United \nStates, FISA requires the government to get a warrant, even though the \ngovernment is ``targeting'' the caller in Pakistan.\n  The administration wants the flexibility to begin electronic \nsurveillance of a ``target'' abroad without having to get a FISA \nwarrant to account for the possibility that the ``foreign target'' \nmight contact someone in the United States. I agree with the \nadministration's assessment of the problem, but this bill would go far \nbeyond what is necessary to meet these new technological challenges.\n  This bill's approach would significantly expand the scope of \nsurveillance permitted under FISA by exempting entirely from the \nwarrant requirement any calls to or from the United States, as long as \nthe Government is ``targeting'' someone reasonably believed to be \nlocated outside the United States.\n  The Government could acquire these communications regardless of \nwhether either party is suspected of any wrongdoing and regardless of \nhow many calls to innocent American citizens inside the United States \nwere intercepted in the process.\n  Although the bill gives the FISA Court a greater role than earlier \nbills did, it still fails to provide for a meaningful judicial check on \nthe President's power. The FISA Court's role would be limited to \nreviewing the Government's targeting procedures and its minimization \nprocedures--the procedures it uses to limit the retention and \ndissemination of information it has required. But it would be required \nto approve them as long as they met the general requirements of the \nstatute, which is written broadly.\n  In addition, unlike the Judiciary Committee version of the bill I \nsupported earlier this year, this bill neither limits the Government's \nuse of information collected under procedures the FISA Court later \ndeems inadequate, nor does it expressly give the FISA Court authority \nto enforce compliance with orders it issues.\n  I am concerned that because of the way this bill is drafted, it could \nbe interpreted to preclude the FISA Court from ordering the Government \nto destroy all communications of innocent Americans that it \nincidentally collects during its surveillance. If I were certain that \nthe FISA Court had the power to order the destruction of the \ncommunications of innocent Americans, it might tip the balance in favor \nof my supporting the bill, even though I oppose blanket retroactive \nimmunity.\n  As for immunity, although I can understand why in the immediate \naftermath of the attacks on September 11 the telephone companies would \nhave cooperated with the Government, I believe it is inappropriate for \nCongress to grant blanket retroactive immunity without knowing what it \nis granting immunity for.\n  Furthermore, cases against the carriers are already making their way \nthrough the courts and I have every confidence in the court's ability \nto interpret and apply the law. Retroactive immunity would undermine \nthe judiciary's role as an independent branch of government.\n  When the Senate passed FISA, after extensive hearings, thirty years \nago by a strong bipartisan vote of 95 to 1, I stated that it ``was a \nreaffirmation of the principle that it is possible to protect national \nsecurity and at the same time the Bill of Rights.'' I still believe \nthat is possible, but not if we enact this bill.\n  Mr. President, I am in support of Senator Rockefeller's proposal to \naddress shortcomings in our intelligence collection authorities. I have \nstudied Senator Rockefeller's bill closely and believe that it is an \nappropriate, temporary fix that adequately protects both our national \nsecurity and Americans' privacy and civil liberties. It includes \nimportant safeguards against executive abuse--safeguards that are \nessential for an administration that has demonstrated so frequently \nthat it simply cannot be trusted.\n  The Rockefeller bill is narrowly tailored to address the two problems \nthe administration has said it faces in conducting electronic \nsurveillance under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, as that \nlaw is currently written.\n  First, the administration wants clarification that it does not need \nto obtain a FISA warrant in order to conduct surveillance of calls \nbetween two parties when both of those parties are overseas. Because of \nthe way global communications are now transmitted, many communications \nthat take place entirely overseas are nonetheless routed through \nswitching stations inside the United States. In other words, when \nsomeone in Islamabad, Pakistan, calls someone in London, England, that \ncall may well be routed through communications switching stations right \nhere in the United States. FISA was never intended to apply to such \ncalls, and I support a legislative fix to clarify that point.\n  The second problem the administration has identified is more \ndifficult. Although neither FISA nor the Constitution requires the \nPresident to get a warrant if the target of surveillance is in Pakistan \ncalling London, or anywhere else outside the United States, if the \ntarget in Pakistan calls someone in the United States, FISA requires \nthe Government to get a warrant, even though the Government is \n``targeting'' the caller in Pakistan.\n  Senator Rockefeller's bill would give the Government great \nflexibility to conduct surveillance of targets abroad, with prior \napproval of the FISA Court, while protecting the privacy of innocent \nAmericans in the United States.\n  Under this bill, the FISA Court would be required to issue a warrant \nupon a minimal showing that the targets of surveillance are overseas \nand not in the United States. The bill provides protection for innocent \nAmericans in the United States--if the foreign target's communications \nbegan to involve a significant number of calls\n\n[[Page S6474]]\n\ninto the United States, the Government would be required to end \nsurveillance pending receipt of a new FISA Court order that the target \noverseas was a suspected terrorist.\n  Senator Rockefeller's approach also ensures robust oversight. \nCongress would get the actual FISA Court orders, and, every 60 days, \nCongress would receive the list of targets who turned out to be in the \nUnited States and the number of persons inside the United States whose \ncommunications were intercepted. This is more information than Congress \nreceives today, and it would enable us to verify the administration's \nclaim that they are targeting suspected terrorists without \nunnecessarily violating the privacy of law-abiding Americans.\n  Senator Rockefeller's bill sunsets in 6 months, at which point \nCongress can, if necessary, craft a permanent, sensible, and \nConstitutional fix to FISA that ensures the American people are \nprotected from terrorism and from encroachments on their civil \nliberties and individual freedoms. The President has asked that we go \nfurther, that we give him more unchecked power and discretion to \neavesdrop on Americans' conversations without a warrant and without \ncongressional oversight. His request raises many concerns, and Congress \nshould deny it.\n  The President's proposal would significantly expand the scope of \nsurveillance permitted under FISA by exempting entirely any calls to or \nfrom the United States, as long as the Government is directing its \nsurveillance at someone reasonably believed to be located abroad. The \nAttorney General and the Director of National Intelligence would make \nthis determination on their own, and they would merely certify, after-\nthe-fact, to the FISA Court that they had reason to believe the target \nis outside the United States, regardless of how many calls to innocent \nAmerican citizens inside the United States were intercepted in the \nprocess. This would be a breathtaking and unconstitutional expansion of \nthe President's powers and it is wholly unnecessary to address the \nproblems the administration has identified.\n  Furthermore, the administration would not even limit this unchecked \nsurveillance to persons suspected of involvement in international \nterrorism--it would cover the collection of any foreign intelligence \ninformation, which can include the collection of trade secrets and \nother information unrelated to the threat posed by al-Qaida.\n  I have said before that one of the defining challenges of our age is \nto effectively combat international terrorism while maintaining our \nnational values and our commitment to the rule of law, individual \nrights, and civil liberties. Unfortunately, the President has attempted \nto protect America by unnecessarily betraying our fundamental notions \nof constitutional governance and individual rights and liberties.\n  I will support giving the administration the tools it needs to track \ndown terrorists, but I will not give the President unchecked authority \nto eavesdrop on whomever he wants in exchange for the vague and hollow \nassurance that he will protect the civil liberties of the American \npeople. This administration has squandered the trust of Congress and \nthe American people.\n  The administration's approach is constitutionally infirm and it is \nunnecessary to address the specific problems it has identified. The \nRockefeller bill is a carefully calibrated approach that protects the \nAmerican people from both terrorism and violations of their civil \nliberties.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in 1771, Samuel Adams observed:\n\n       The liberties of our country, the freedom of our civil \n     Constitution, are worth defending at all hazards; and it is \n     our duty to defend them against all attacks. We have received \n     them as a fair inheritance from our worthy ancestors; they \n     purchased them for us with toil and danger and expense of \n     treasure and blood, and transmitted them to us with care and \n     diligence. It will bring an everlasting mark of infamy on the \n     present generation, enlightened as it is, if we should suffer \n     them to be wrested from us by violence without a struggle, or \n     to be cheated out of them by the artifices of false and \n     designing men.\n\n  Under the artifice of defending our nation from terrorists, President \nBush would have Congress surrender our liberties and the freedom of our \ncivil Constitution. This bill, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance, \nFISA, Amendments Act of 2008, is supposed to correct unconstitutional \nauthorities contained in last year's ``Protect America Act'' that \npermitted widescale warrantless Government surveillance of innocent \nAmericans' private international communications, much of it facilitated \nby telecommunications companies in a manner that is under court review. \nHowever, this bill undercuts that judicial review and, in effect, \ngrants complete retroactive immunity to those companies for anything \nillegal they might have done for the last 6 years. That provision \nundermines the Constitution's fourth amendment protections.\n  This bill continues Government surveillance of communications coming \ninto and out of the United States without full fourth amendment \nprotections. Remember the fourth amendment? It reads:\n\n       The right of the people to be secure in their persons, \n     houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches \n     and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall \n     issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or \n     affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be \n     searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\n\n  The President would have you believe that this bill would provide \nadditional powers to prevent another 9/11. But 9/11 did not happen for \nwant of these powers. It was not a failure of Government to monitor \nprivate communications. Rather, it was a failure of the Government to \nmonitor the reports of the FBI and of the intelligence community. It \nhappened because the administration did not take seriously reports \nsuggesting that what actually happened was being planned by al-Qaida. \nJust as he exploited 9/11 to lead us to war in Iraq, President Bush now \nwants to exploit his failures to attack our fundamental freedoms--\nfreedoms that formed the foundations of this Nation.\n  There is no doubt that certain accommodations need to be made to \naddress advances in technology. However, this bill goes too far. If the \nGovernment can collect all communications coming into or out of the \nUnited States, using powerful computers to shop among them without \nprobable cause that the person making or receiving the communication is \ninvolved in anything illegal, and without any court providing a check \nupon the abuse of that power, that does not meet my ``reasonable \nman's'' definition of fourth amendment compliance. And that is not the \n``fair inheritance'' won for us by our Founders at such a great price.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, one of the great challenges before us as \na nation is remaining steadfast in our fight against terrorism while \npreserving our commitment to the rule of law and individual liberty. As \na Senator from New York on September 11, I understand the importance of \ntaking any and all necessary steps to protect our Nation from those who \nwould do us harm. I believe strongly that we must modernize our \nsurveillance laws in order to provide intelligence professionals the \ntools needed to fight terrorism and make our country more secure. \nHowever, any surveillance program must contain safeguards to protect \nthe rights of Americans against abuse, and to preserve clear lines of \noversight and accountability over this administration. I applaud the \nefforts of my colleagues who negotiated this legislation, and I respect \nmy colleagues who reached a different conclusion on today's vote. I do \nso because this is a difficult issue. Nonetheless, I could not vote for \nthe legislation in its current form.\n  The legislation would overhaul the law that governs the \nadministration's surveillance activities. Some of the legislation's \nprovisions place guidelines and restrictions on the operational details \nof the surveillance activities, others increase judicial and \nlegislative oversight of those activities, and still others relate to \nimmunity for telecommunications companies that participated in the \nadministration's surveillance activities.\n  While this legislation does strengthen oversight of the \nadministration's surveillance activities over previous drafts, in many \nrespects, the oversight in the bill continues to come up short. For \ninstance, while the bill nominally calls for increased oversight by the \nFISA Court, its ability to serve as a meaningful check on the \nPresident's power is debatable. The clearest example of this is the \nlimited power given to\n\n[[Page S6475]]\n\nthe FISA Court to review the government's targeting and minimization \nprocedures.\n  But the legislation has other significant shortcomings. The \nlegislation makes no meaningful change to the immunity provisions. \nThere is little disagreement that the legislation effectively grants \nretroactive immunity to the telecommunications companies. In my \njudgment, immunity under these circumstances has the practical effect \nof shutting down a critical avenue for holding the administration \naccountable for its conduct. It is precisely why I have supported \nefforts in the Senate to strip the bill of these provisions, both today \nand during previous debates on this subject. Unfortunately, these \nefforts have been unsuccessful.\n  What is more, even as we considered this legislation, the \nadministration refused to allow the overwhelming majority of Senators \nto examine the warrantless wiretapping program. This made it \nexceedingly difficult for those Senators who are not on the \nIntelligence and Judiciary Committees to assess the need for the \noperational details of the legislation, and whether greater protections \nare necessary. The same can be said for an assessment of the telecom \nimmunity provisions. On an issue of such tremendous importance to our \ncitizens--and in particular to New Yorkers--all Senators should have \nbeen entitled to receive briefings that would have enabled them to make \nan informed decision about the merits of this legislation. I cannot \nsupport this legislation when we know neither the nature of the \nsurveillance activities authorized nor the role played by \ntelecommunications companies granted immunity.\n  Congress must vigorously check and balance the president even in the \nface of dangerous enemies and at a time of war. That is what sets us \napart. And that is what is vital to ensuring that any tool designed to \nprotect us is used--and used within the law--for that purpose and that \npurpose alone. I believe my responsibility requires that I vote against \nthis compromise, and I will continue to pursue reforms that will \nimprove our ability to collect intelligence in our efforts to combat \nterror and to oversee that authority in Congress.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I wish to spend a few minutes discussing why \nI vote against final passage of H.R. 6304, the House companion to S. \n2248, the FISA Amendments Act of 2008. I would like to begin by \ncommending Senators Rockefeller and Bond who have negotiated this bill, \nliterally for months, in order to reach the compromise that we voted on \ntoday.\n  I believe that many aspects of this bill are an improvement, not only \nto the Protect America Act which passed last August, but also to S. \n2248, the bill we voted on in February. I opposed both of those bills. \nThis compromise bill specifies that FISA and certain other statutes are \nthe exclusive means for conducting surveillance on Americans for \nforeign intelligence purposes. It requires the inspectors general of \nthe Department of Justice, the Department of Defense, the National \nSecurity Agency, and the Director of National Intelligence to conduct a \ncomprehensive review and issue a report on the President's surveillance \nprogram. It requires the intelligence community to create reverse \ntargeting guidelines so that the National Security Agency cannot \nconduct surveillance of a U.S. citizen without a warrant by targeting a \nforeigner. Finally, it sunsets this legislation in 4\\1/2\\ half years \nrather than the 6 years called for in the original bill. All of these \nmeasures increase oversight and help protect civil liberties and are \nhelpful changes.\n  However, title II of this bill still grants retroactive immunity to \ntelecommunications companies for actions they may or may not have taken \nin response to administration requests that may or may not have been \nlegal. As I have stated before, the administration has had years to \nprovide the written legal justification that they gave the \ntelecommunications companies when they requested their cooperation in \nthe aftermath of September 11. A few of my colleagues on the Judiciary \nCommittee and Intelligence Committee were allowed to read certain \ndocuments related to this matter after extensive negotiations with the \nadministration. However, I, and the rest of my Senate colleagues who \nare not on those committees, were denied access to those documents. In \naddition, the telecommunications companies who have been named in \nseveral lawsuits have been prohibited by the administration from \nproviding any information regarding this issue to the courts, to the \nplaintiffs, to Members of Congress, or to the public. In good \nconscience, I could not simply trust with blind faith that the \nadministration and telecommunications companies took proper, lawful \nactions.\n  I therefore supported three attempts to strip or limit this immunity \nduring today's debate. First, Senator Dodd offered an amendment to \nstrike title II. When that failed, Senator Specter offered an amendment \nto require a Federal district court to assess the constitutionality of \nthe terrorist surveillance program before granting retroactive immunity \nto the companies alleged to have assisted the program. This amendment \nalso failed. As a final effort, Senator Bingaman offered an amendment \nwhich would have stayed all pending cases against the telecommunication \ncompanies related to the Government's warrantless surveillance program \nand delayed the effective date of the immunity provisions until 90 days \nafter Congress receives the required comprehensive report of the \ninspectors general regarding the program. If Congress took no action in \nthat time, the telecommunications companies would receive immunity. \nUnfortunately, that amendment also failed.\n  The Senate had three opportunities to implement sensible measures to \nensure that the grant of immunity to the telecommunication companies \nwas appropriate. But these amendments were voted down. I believe the \nresult sets a dangerous precedent. We must take the steps necessary to \nthwart terrorist attacks against our country, but these steps must also \nensure that the civil liberties and privacy rights that are core to our \ndemocracy are protected. This bill fails to meet this threshold. For \nthese reasons, I oppose the passage of this bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is now 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, we have been on this bill now for in \neffect a year.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will suspend. Will \nSenators please take their seats.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. And we have improved enormously the Senate bill that \nwe voted out last year with a veto-proof majority. The House had not \nreacted to this bill well, particularly the immunity part, as well as \nthe title I part. We went at them aggressively, Vice Chairman Bond and \nmyself, to try to get the Senate to move toward the House position. We \nwere successful in that.\n  As I have said, Speaker Pelosi, who didn't want anything to do with \nthe bill at the beginning, actually went to the floor of the House \nbefore they voted on it to pass it out and said: This may not be a \nperfect bill, but it is a bill that I certainly am going to vote for, \nand that is why I am here asking you to join me in so doing.\n  I, in my lesser role, am doing the same thing.\n  This is a historic bill. It has the particular virtue that over the \ncourse of the next 4 years, the next President of the United States \nwill have a chance to review the bill and see if any changes need to be \nmade.\n  I strongly hope, on what I consider to be a very major piece of \nnational security and civil liberties legislation, that my colleagues \nwill vote to support the bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does anyone seek time in \nopposition?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second? There \nis a sufficient second.\n  The bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall the \nbill pass?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Arizona (Mr. McCain) and the Senator from Alabama (Mr. Sessions).\n\n[[Page S6476]]\n\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Alabama (Mr. \nSessions) would have voted ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill).

What is the matter now before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the motion to \nproceed to the motion previously entered to reconsider the vote whereby \ncloture on the motion to proceed to H.R. 6331 was not agreed to, is \nagreed to and the time until 4 p.m. will be evenly divided before the \ncloture vote.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that there be 1 hour prior to the \nvote, which is now set for 4 o'clock, that the time be divided, with \nthe last 20 minutes for Senator McConnell and Senator Reid of Nevada; \nthat I have the last 10 minutes; that the other 40 minutes be equally \ndivided and controlled between the chairman of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Baucus, and the ranking member of the committee, Senator \nGrassley.\n  That means there will be 20 minutes for Senator McConnell and me, and \nthere will be 40 minutes remaining, equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, may I inquire, what is the pending \nbusiness before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On reconsideration of cloture on the motion to \nproceed to H.R. 6331.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, the Prophet Isaiah urged:\n\n     Cease to do evil,\n     learn to do good;\n     seek justice,\n     correct oppression;\n     defend the fatherless,\n     plead for the widow.\n\n  Since 1965, Medicare has been about defending the disabled. Medicare \nhas been about providing for the elderly. From its beginning, Medicare \nhas been about doing good. Before Medicare, old age was very much about \nwidows.\n  In 1960, a man could expect to live a little more than 66 years, \nwhereas a woman could expect to live past 73. Now, with the help of \nMedicare providing health care for the elderly, men can expect to live \nbeyond 75 and women can expect to live beyond 80.\n  Before Medicare, in 1959, more than 35 percent of the elderly lived \nin poverty. When President Johnson signed the Medicare Act into law, he \nsaid of the elderly:\n\n       Most of them have low incomes. Most of them are threatened \n     by illness and medical expenses that they cannot afford.\n\n  Thus, before Medicare, the elderly received poorer health care. They \nendured more pain. They met early death. But then, 43 years later, in \nJuly 1965, with my fellow Montanan Mike Mansfield looking on, President \nJohnson signed the Medicare Program into law. This chart to my left \nshows the picture of that day.\n  That day President Johnson said:\n\n       No longer will older Americans be denied the healing \n     miracle of modern medicine. No longer will illness crush and \n     destroy the savings they have so carefully put away over a \n     lifetime so they might enjoy dignity in their later years. No \n     longer will young families see their own hopes eaten away \n     simply because they are carrying out their deep moral \n     obligations to their parents.\n\n  Further quoting President Johnson:\n\n       And no longer will this Nation refuse the hand of justice \n     to those who have given a lifetime of service and wisdom and \n     labor to the progress of this country.\n\n  Thus, from its beginning, Medicare has been a moral issue. Medicare \nhas been about doing good, about doing what is right. I come to the \nfloor today to speak in defense of Medicare. I come to plead for the \nwidow. I come to fight for the disabled.\n  Today Medicare is threatened. Health care costs have been growing \nrapidly. Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke told the Finance Committee's \nhealth care summit:\n\n       Health care has long been and continues to be one of the \n     fastest growing sectors in the economy. Over the past 4 \n     decades, this sector has grown, on average, at a rate of \n     about 2.5 percentage points faster than the gross domestic \n     product.\n\n  But the fruits of the 1997 law threaten to cut--yes, cut--payments to \ndoctors who treat Medicare beneficiaries unless we act. If we do not \nact, the law will force cuts in payments to doctors by 10.6 percent. We \nhave to stop that cut.\n  That cut threatens access to care for America's seniors. Already some \nproviders are declining Medicare patients. My colleagues hear that \nconstantly. Fewer and fewer doctors are taking Medicare; more and more \nare dropping. Why? Because reimbursement rates are already too low, and \nunless we act today, those reimbursement rates will be much lower.\n  Doctors know about these cuts. My colleagues in their home States \nhear this constantly. I am sure, over the July 4 break, they heard over \nand over that the doctors are very concerned about Medicare \nreimbursement. The share of doctors accepting new Medicare patients has \nbeen falling. It is falling for those who accept and do not accept \nMedicare. It is falling for those military personnel in TRICARE who \nseek services from doctors as well because TRICARE payments are tied to \nMedicare.\n  Unless we act, those patients in the TRICARE system, our military \nservice men and women, will also find that their doctors are not \ntreating them either. That trend will accelerate if we do not act. An \nAmerican Medical Association survey found if the scheduled cuts stay in \neffect, 60 percent of doctors will have to limit the number of new \nMedicare patients whom they treat; 60 percent would have to limit, \nunless we restore these cuts.\n  These cuts also threaten access to health care for our military men \nand woman. As I mentioned, TRICARE uses the Medicare formula to pay \ntheir doctors. Those cuts could endanger health care for military \nretirees and even for those on Active Duty.\n  I do not think that is well understood, that TRICARE is tied to \nMedicare. If we cut Medicare, we cut TRICARE. That means about 9 \nmillion American service men and women, Active Duty and retirees, the \ndoctors who service them will no longer provide that service; a 60-\npercent reduction.\n  The Military Officers Association of America reports that declining \nparticipation of providers due to low reimbursements is already one of \nthe most serious health care problems facing military families.\n  Real and threatened cuts in the level of Medicare reimbursements have \ncaused many providers to stop accepting new TRICARE patients.\n  Since 1965, there have been those few who did not think that Medicare \nwas good. There have been those who have sought to call it evil. In the \n1960s, there were those on the fringe who called it socialized \nmedicine. In 1995, there were those who said it was going to wither on \nthe vine, those who wanted to do away with Medicare. But the truth is, \nfrom the start Medicare has had broad,\n\n[[Page S6477]]\n\nvery broad, bipartisan, very bipartisan, support. The original Medicare \nAct passed the House of Representatives with a vote of 307 to 16. It \npassed the Senate by a vote of 70 to 24. That broad support was evident \nagain on June 24 of this year before the break. That day the House of \nRepresentatives passed the Medicare Improvements for Patients and \nProviders Act. That bill would stop those cuts in doctors' payments. \nThe House passed that bill with an overwhelming vote of 355 to 59; 355 \nHouse Members voted for it. That is better than a 6-to-1 margin. Even \namong Republican Members of the House, more than twice as many voted \nfor it than against it.\n  On June 26, the Senate fell one vote short of invoking cloture on the \nmotion to proceed to that bill. But today the Senate will reconsider \nthat vote, and we should. The Senate should take up and pass this \nMedicare bill. The Senate should pass this Medicare bill because there \nis no alternative. If we fail to enact this bill, millions of America's \nseniors will be worse off. We cannot let that happen. This bill can \nprevent that. The House-passed bill is very similar to the Baucus-Snowe \nbill the Senate considered earlier in June, but the House made three \nnoteworthy changes. First the House-passed bill includes legislation to \ndelay the competitive acquisition program for durable medical \nequipment. Congress needs to ensure that these savings do not harm \nbeneficiary access to care. We need to take a closer look at \ncompetitive bidding before it goes forward. Passage of this Medicare \nbill would allow that. The House-passed bill also does not include cuts \nin funding for oxygen supplies and equipment, and it does not include \ncuts in funding for powered wheelchairs. Those who support these \nreforms make a good case. But ultimately, the cuts could not be \nincluded as part of this must-pass legislation.\n  This bill is a balanced package. It is a compromise. It makes modest \nchanges. When the House passed its children's health bill last year, \nthe House made major changes to the Medicare Advantage Program. Last \nyear's House CHIP bill would have significantly restructured the \nprogram. This House Medicare bill, however, would not do that. This \nbill includes a reduction in the double payment for medical education \ncosts to private plans in Medicare, and this bill would protect seniors \nfrom unscrupulous marketing practices by private health plans. This \nbill would require so-called private fee-for-service plans to form \nprovider networks. It would make sure that there are doctors behind \nthose plans. Currently, those private fee-for-service plans do not have \nto do that. By fiat, they deem it to be the case. But it is not \naccurate. This bill would make sure there will be doctors behind those \nplans.\n  This bill does not include deep cuts due to the Medicare Advantage \nProgram. Some suggest it does. It does not at all. It does not cut \nprivate fee-for-service plan payments at all. I wish to go further on \nMedicare Advantage. I think we should do more. But this is not the \ntime, and this is not the legislation on which to do so. This, however, \nis the time to avert the pending cut in payments to doctors. That \npayment cut would devastate access to care for America's seniors. We \ncannot let that happen.\n  For Medicare beneficiaries, this Medicare bill would expand access to \nservices. We all talk about greater access to preventive services. It \nwould eliminate the discriminatory copayment rates for seniors with \nmental illnesses. We all talk about that. We want mental health parity. \nWe do it in this Medicare legislation. And it will provide additional \nneeded help for low-income seniors. We all talk about that need too.\n  This Medicare bill would take important steps to shore up our health \ncare system in rural areas. It includes provisions from the Craig \nThomas Rural Hospital and Provider Equity Act. Let's do this for Craig \nThomas.\n  This bill also includes important relief for ambulance providers, \ncommunity health centers, and primary care physicians. Primary care \ndoctors represent the backbone of our health system. We all hear from \nhome that primary care doctors are especially vulnerable and we give \nadditional help to them. This Medicare bill would make important \nimprovements in pharmacy payments. It would make payments under the \nPart D drug benefit fairer and more timely to those who dispense drugs \nto our Nation's senior citizens. We have all heard that pharmacists \nneed this help because they are in a disadvantageous position in \ndispensing Part D drugs.\n  This bill would save money by providing a single bundled payment for \nall the services related to treating end-stage renal disease, and that \nwill help reduce costs. For the first time, dialysis facilities would \nreceive a permanent, market-based update to their payments each year, \ngiving them a little bit of predictability. This would ensure that \nMedicare payments keep up with costs.\n  The bill would expand emergency health care for veterans in rural \nareas. It would increase payments for doctors who work in rural areas. \nIt would stop the payment cut to providers. It would give them a decent \nincrease in reimbursement. All of this would help to ensure that \nseniors and military families would be able to keep seeing the doctors \nthey need to see.\n  On July 30, 1965, President Truman watched President Johnson sign the \nMedicare Act. That is what is shown in this photograph to my left. \nPresident Truman at that point said:\n\n       Mr. President, I am glad to have lived this long and to \n     witness today the signing of the Medicare bill, which puts \n     this Nation right where it needs to be, to be right.\n\n  Yes, from its beginning, Medicare has been a moral issue. Medicare \nhas been about doing good. So let us defend the elderly. Let us defend \nthe disabled. Let us provide for our military families, and let us \nenact this important Medicare bill.\n  I know others are waiting to speak on the other side of the aisle. In \na moment I will yield the floor, but before doing so, I yield half of \nthe time remaining under my control to Senator Schumer and half of the \ntime to Senator Durbin for their use when they are recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Duly noted.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise to oppose cloture on the motion to \nproceed to H.R. 6331, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and \nProviders Act.\n  I am beginning to feel like the character from the movie ``Groundhog \nDay'' who wakes up every morning to the same day. Here we are again, \nhaving the same debate about the same Medicare bill that will not be \nsigned into law.\n  I believe that our time would be better spent working on a bill to \nrestore physician payments instead of having a partisan vote just to \nmake some political points. It would be better to work in a bipartisan \nway. We could do it in 10 minutes, if we just sit down and do it. I \nknow the distinguished chairman and ranking member could do it.\n  But it is obvious that some in this body would rather have a \npolitical battle and put Medicare beneficiaries and their doctors at \nrisk.\n  In the last month, I stood on the Senate floor, not once, but twice \nemphasizing that I want to work on a bipartisan Medicare bill that will \nbe signed into law. In fact, we had a bipartisan agreement in the \nSenate.\n  Unfortunately, Senate Democrats are still not permitting a vote on a \ncompromise measure or even the Republican alternative.\n  The bipartisan compromise bill would have passed overwhelmingly, and \nthis issue would be behind us.\n  And, quite frankly, H.R. 6331, essentially, the Baucus Medicare bill, \ncontains many provisions that both sides strongly support.\n  It is troubling that only the Democrat Medicare bill is being given a \nvote on the Senate floor, especially when there is a Republican \nalternative that restores physician payments as well, especially since \nI believe Senators Baucus and Grassley would have worked it out long \nbefore now without all the hoopla and politicization.\n  In addition, when the Democrat Medicare bill failed to get cloture a \nfew weeks ago, the minority leader asked for unanimous consent to pass \na 31 day extension of the December Medicare law. The purpose of this \nextension was to prevent the Medicare physician cuts from going into \neffect until we were able to work out our differences.\n  But Senator Reid objected to this unanimous consent request for \npolitical reasons and told the Senate that\n\n[[Page S6478]]\n\nhe wanted the Republicans who voted against cloture to feel the heat \nwhen they went home for the Fourth of July recess. I was a little \nshocked at that.\n  Fortunately, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, is \ndelaying the Medicare reduction for physicians for 10 business days to \ngive us more time. Unfortunately, we do not agree on one key issue--the \nMedicare Advantage Program. This program was created in the Medicare \nModernization Act of 2003. I was on the conference committee and spent \nmonths working on Medicare Advantage.\n  Today, Medicare Advantage provides beneficiaries with many health \ncare choices in addition to traditional Medicare.\n  Medicare Advantage plans are very similar to private health plans \noffered to those under 65 years of age. One out of five people in \nMedicare are on Medicare Advantage, and they love the program.\n  The Democrat Medicare bill includes reforms to the Medicare Advantage \nProgram that are unacceptable to both the White House and many of us \nwho support the Medicare Advantage Program.\n  Those of us who support Medicare Advantage feel that the provision in \nthe Democrat Medicare bill will limit plan choices currently offered to \nbeneficiaries.\n  Beneficiaries participating in the Medicare Advantage Program are \nhappy with their health care coverage.\n  Every month, I receive hundreds of letters from my constituents \ntelling me how much they like their Medicare Advantage plans.\n  Medicare Advantage is working across the country.\n  On the other hand, the Medicare+Choice program, which was the \nprecursor to the Medicare Advantage Program, did not work very well, \nespecially in rural areas.\n  That was because the Federal Government did not pay plans enough \nmoney to operate in rural areas.\n  The Utah Medicare+Choice plans left our State because plans could not \nfunction and they were losing money.\n  At that point, Utah Medicare beneficiaries only had one choice--\ntraditional Medicare. And once we start disassembling the Medicare \nAdvantage Program, as some in this body want to do, I believe that \nhealth care choices for beneficiaries will diminish. Through the \nMedicare Modernization Act, we finally figured out how to provide \nchoice to Medicare beneficiaries in both rural and urban areas and how \nto pay plans appropriately.\n  But my friends on the other side cannot leave a good thing alone and \ninsist on making changes to a program that works well today and that 90 \npercent of beneficiaries in Medicare Advantage are satisfied with.\n  The Democrat Medicare bill, if signed into law, will no longer allow \nprivate fee-for-service plans to deem.\n  Deeming allows beneficiaries in private fee-for-service plans to see \nany Medicare provider.\n  Deeming has been important to those living in rural areas where it is \ndifficult for network-based plans to persuade providers to contract \nwith them. It is also helpful to employer groups which provide retiree \nhealth coverage to those living in rural areas across the country.\n  The elimination of deeming could take away health care coverage \nchoices for Medicare beneficiaries living in rural States.\n  In addition, the elimination of deeming could cause some retirees to \nlose their health benefits because the retirement plan cannot establish \nnetworks in all 50 States.\n  According to America's Health Insurance Plans, known as AHIP, 21,000 \nUtah beneficiaries may be dropped from their current Medicare Advantage \nprivate fee-for-service plans if the provision to eliminate deeming \nbecomes law.\n  In fact, AHIP believes that 1.7 million seniors across the country \ncould lose their existing health coverage if H.R. 6331 becomes law.\n  A few weeks ago, I mentioned that one Utah employer has said that the \nelimination of deeming will force the company to stop offering health \ncare coverage to almost 12,000 retirees, and that is probably the tip \nof the iceberg.\n  I fear that the impact of this provision could be devastating, \nespecially to beneficiaries living in rural States.\n  We truly do not know the full effect of this policy and how it will \naffect Medicare beneficiaries across the country.\n  Therefore, I simply cannot support this policy and it is the main \nreason that I am going to vote against cloture.\n  Do not be fooled--the bill we are considering today will not be \nsigned into law.\n  The President has said he will veto the bill and there will not be \nenough votes to override his veto. I suppose some on the other side \nthink they have a great political advantage if he vetoes the bill and \nwe can't override it. They can use that against Republicans.\n  This motion must be defeated for the third time. We should not have \nhad to go to three votes.\n  Hopefully, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will want to \nwork with us on a bill that can be signed into law because it would be \nbipartisan.\n  We must move forward so Medicare beneficiaries will no longer worry \nabout their doctors dropping out of the Medicare Program.\n  We must move forward so physicians participating in the Medicare \nProgram will not be cut by 10.6 percent. I don't think anybody in this \nbody believes that we will allow that cut to occur; certainly, I will \nnot.\n  We must move forward because the American people are getting tired of \na do-nothing Congress where Members are not able to work out their \ndifferences.\n  Why don't we put all our differences aside? We could solve this in 10 \nminutes without making it a political fiasco which is what it has \nbecome. I think in the end everybody would be better off. Certainly, \nseniors who are on Medicare Advantage would continue to be better off \nthan they would be if this very partisan bill passes through this body \nand is vetoed by the President and that veto is sustained.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. How much time remains on the Democratic side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 7 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield myself 3\\1/2\\ minutes and reserve 3\\1/2\\ minutes \nfor the Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this debate is about an important bill \nfor 40 million Americans. It is about Medicare. It is about whether the \ndoctors who provide benefits under Medicare will have a 10.3 percent \ncut in their reimbursement. Those of us who are for Medicare don't want \nto see that happen. It means fewer doctors treating senior citizens. It \nmeans fewer doctors who will be part of the program. So we are trying \nto stop this cut from happening. But we are running into resistance \nfrom the Republican side of the aisle.\n  The bill before us is a bipartisan bill that passed the House of \nRepresentatives by a margin of 6 to 1. Two-thirds of the Republicans in \nthe House voted for this measure. It is a very bipartisan approach. But \nunfortunately, on the other side of the aisle, the Republicans are \ndetermined to oppose this bill.\n  Why? Why would they want to see fewer senior citizens with doctors \nthey need under Medicare? Why would they want to see fewer doctors in \nthe program? Because the way we pay for the doctors' compensation is by \ncutting back on the private health insurance companies currently trying \nto offer Medicare benefits. Now, why would we do that? Because, \nunfortunately, they are overcharging the Government--from 12 to 17 \npercent more than what the Medicare Program is charging for the same \nservices. We believe they can cut back on their profits, they can \nreduce their costs, and they can still help seniors.\n  Remember when we started with private health insurance companies? The \nRepublicans said: We want them to be able to play in Medicare. They can \ndo a much better job than the Government. They will cut the costs \ndramatically. They will bring it down to 95 percent of what the \nGovernment charges. Exactly the opposite has occurred. The private \nhealth insurance companies have increased their costs over the years, \nand the Republicans who oppose this bill want to protect those \ncompanies. They do not want to see those private health insurance \ncompanies take\n\n[[Page S6479]]\n\na hit, get a reduction in the amount of money paid by the Government. \nSo they continue to refuse to vote for this measure to help Medicare \nphysicians.\n  The last time we had this vote, we had 59 Senators who voted for it. \nWhat do we need today at 4:05 to strengthen Medicare? We need one more \nRepublican vote, one more Republican Senator. Madam President, 9 of the \n49 voted with us last time. With 10, we have the 60 votes, and Medicare \nwill have a bright future.\n  For those who argue, well, President Bush just might not like the \nbill, I am sorry, but this bipartisan bill which passed overwhelmingly \nin the House should pass overwhelmingly in the Senate, and we should \nsay to President Bush: It is much more important for us to protect 40 \nmillion seniors under Medicare and, incidentally, about 9 million \nmilitary families under TRICARE from these kinds of cuts in physician \nreimbursement.\n  I have listened to the debate on the other side of the aisle, and it \nreally comes down to a difference of philosophy. When Medicare was \ncreated, the Republicans, by and large, opposed it: Oh, it is a big \nGovernment program. It is socialized medicine. What did Medicare do for \nAmerica? It gave peace of mind to seniors that the next illness would \nnot wipe out all their savings. It gave them access to the best doctors \nand the best hospitals.\n  Do you know what? Seniors are living longer today than when they \nsigned that Medicare bill into law in 1965. That is the proof of its \nsuccess. But many on the Republican side of the aisle have never \naccepted it. They always want to go to the private health insurance \ncompanies, even when it costs too much for the seniors and for our \nGovernment.\n  This is our chance. One more Republican vote means the Medicare \nProgram will be strong for years to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 12 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, will you tell me when 5 minutes is \nconsumed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, Congress should be embarrassed to have \ndoctors and seniors come hat in hand every 6 months, every 12 months, \nevery 18 months, and say: Please don't cut reimbursement rates for \nphysicians. It is just a terrible way to do business. It puts people in \nfear that Congress will not act. It also provides opportunities for \npolitical gamesmanship that we have seen in an abundance on this \nparticular temporary patch.\n  The fact is, Congress has only on one previous occasion allowed these \ncuts to go into effect, in 2002. Every year since it has acted. The \nfact is, we will. But what we need is a permanent solution, not a \ntemporary patch. This is a terrible way to do business. The fact is, \nMedicare is a deeply troubled program. In fact, it will go bankrupt--\nparts of it--by the year 2019. But Congress is just whistling past the \ngraveyard--whistling past the graveyard.\n  We need a permanent solution to this broken Medicare system. The fact \nis, many Medicare beneficiaries, many seniors cannot even find a doctor \nwho will accept new Medicare patients because reimbursement rates are \nbelow market in many parts of the country. The fact is, the majority \nleader, by objecting to a 30-day extension of current law to allow a \nbipartisan compromise between the chairman and ranking member of the \nFinance Committee, is doing nothing but playing partisan politics with \nsomething that should be above partisan politics. We need a permanent \nsolution.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2729\n\n  That is why, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nCommittee on Finance be discharged from further consideration of S. \n2729, the Ensuring the Future Physician Workforce Act, and that the \nSenate proceed to its immediate consideration; that the bill be read a \nthird time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, \nand that any statements relating to the measure be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I have \nlooked at the Senator's bill, and I must say that any objective \nobserver would know that this is not a serious effort. It is a big warm \nkiss on doctors to show to them that they love doctors when, in fact, \nthis is going nowhere. It is a $380 billion bill unpaid for. It is not \na serious effort whatsoever. I regret the Senator from Texas has the \naudacity to bring this up.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I take exception to the chairman of the \nFinance Committee's insulting remarks. I would say to him that on this \nbill I have worked in consultation with the Texas Medical Association, \nwhich has endorsed it heartily, and what people should be insulted by \nare these temporary patches every 6 months that do nothing to solve the \nproblem, that provide a political football for the majority party to \nplay to try to take advantage in the next election, to put seniors in \ndoubt as to our seriousness at keeping our commitment for Medicare.\n  I think it is the chairman of the Finance Committee and the majority \nleader who should be embarrassed by their objection to sensible and \ngood-faith efforts to try to fix on a permanent basis this broken \nsystem. I regret Congress, once again--no wonder the U.S. Congress has \na single-digit approval rating, with only 9 percent of the country \nbelieving it is doing a good or excellent job.\n  It is no secret that people are absolutely disgusted with the \npartisan politics that do not permit real solutions to serious \nproblems, such as fixing Medicare once and for all, and particularly \nthis part that is broken, the payment reimbursement system.\n  So I take very grave exception to the remarks of the chairman of the \nFinance Committee. It is he who is not serious about solving the \nproblem. It is he who insists on partisan gamesmanship rather than real \nsolutions. And I think it is a very sad day for the Senate.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I rise in support of this legislation and \nwant to thank the senior Senator from Montana for his leadership and \ncommitment to ensuring a strong Medicare Program.\n  Medicare is one of the twin pillars of the retirement security \ncompact we have with our seniors. It says that after a lifetime of hard \nwork and paying taxes, seniors deserve the dignity of a secure \nretirement. That includes quality, accessible health care. At a time of \nskyrocketing health care and prescription drug costs, this bill \nstrengthens our commitment to our seniors by eliminating the scheduled \n10.6 percent fee cut for Medicare physicians while providing a 1.1-\npercent update in payments. Why is that so important, Mr. President? \nBecause it directly impacts how we care for seniors. Because doctors \nare already facing this payment cut because we were prevented from \nacting on this legislation before recess. Because my State of \nConnecticut could be looking at a loss of $190 million over the next 18 \nmonths--funds that would otherwise help pay for the care of elderly and \ndisabled patients. Nearly a half million seniors in my State alone \nwould be affected. And because military families will also benefit from \nthis bill because they rely on TRICARE which ties its payments to \nMedicare. Indeed, absent this action, we could be putting at risk \nhealth care for not only military retirees but even for those on Active \nDuty. For all they have given to this country, we absolutely cannot let \nthat happen. More than 50,000 TRICARE patients in Connecticut alone are \ndepending on us.\n  There are other components of this bill I strongly support as well. \nIncluded among the $4 billion in improvements for Medicare \nbeneficiaries is assistance for low-income seniors, who need this \nassistance the most. This legislation also protects access to therapy \nservices, reduces out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries who seek mental \nhealth care, and provides important improvements for our Nation's \npharmacies and rural providers.\n  Ultimately, this legislation sends a message to our seniors and those \nwho serve our country--it says that a promise made will be a promise \nkept. With this bill, we are keeping our word to\n\n[[Page S6480]]\n\nthese men and women that there is no higher priority than ensuring our \nseniors and military families receive the quality health care they \ndeserve.\n  Lastly, it is particularly appropriate that we move to deepen our \ncommitment to Medicare on the day one of its biggest champions returns \nto the Senate. Throughout our history, there has been no greater \nadvocate for our seniors and for health care than Senator Kennedy. He \nis a friend to me, but more importantly he is a friend to every \nAmerican who struggles to receive the affordable, quality health care \nthey deserve, and we are thrilled to welcome him back.\n  Again, I want to thank Chairman Baucus as well as the majority leader \nfor their leadership and dedication.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the Medicare Improvements for Patients \nand Providers Act, H.R. 6331, makes a number of needed changes related \nto Medicare reimbursement, including reimbursement for physicians' \nservices. Due to the unwise filibuster by the minority, we missed our \nchance to pass this legislation before July 1, when reimbursement cuts \nwere scheduled to take place. We now have another opportunity to do the \nright thing. I strongly urge the Senate to pass this legislation \npromptly.\n  Medicare physician fee schedule payments are updated each year \naccording to a complex formula based on a Sustainable Growth Rate--SGR. \nUnfortunately, because of the way the formula is calculated, even if \nCongress prevents the cuts in a given year, scheduled reimbursements \ncuts are likely to increase in subsequent years unless Congress takes \nadditional action, such as developing a permanent alternative to the \nSGR formula.\n  I support efforts to ensure that physicians receive adequate \nreimbursement for their services. If they do not, some physicians will \nnot continue to provide services to Medicare beneficiaries. As a \nresult, allowing reimbursement cuts to go into effect could pose \nsignificant access problems for many Medicare beneficiaries.\n  While I believe past measures to alleviate this burden on physicians \nhave been helpful, I know from my discussions with health care \nproviders throughout Michigan that Congress must find an alternative to \nthe SGR. The SGR is linked not to the cost of providing health \nservices, but to the performance of the overall economy. The cost of \nhealth care has been rising much faster than inflation. Our nation \nshould address the rising costs of health care as part of a larger \ndiscussion on health care reform. Until and unless we discover a way to \ncontain health care costs to inflation, we should decouple Medicare \nreimbursement for physicians' services from the performance of the \noverall economy. Reimbursement should more accurately represent the \ncost of providing services.\n  In the meantime, we need to pass this legislation, which includes, \namong other important provisions, an 18 month delay on Medicare \nreimbursement cuts for physicians' services and replaces the cut with a \n1.1 percent increase in 2009. I am hopeful that the minority will end \ntheir filibuster, that the Senate will pass this legislation, and that \nthe President will heed the will of Congress and the American people \nand sign this bill into law before the cuts are implemented and cause \nmany Medicare beneficiaries to lose access to health care providers.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, this Medicare legislation is very \nimportant. I believe that it is vital for the Senate to take up this \nimportant measure to have open debate to give Senators an opportunity \nto offer amendments and to have the Senate work its will on these \nimportant questions.\n  As noted in previous floor statements, I have been concerned about \nMajority Leader Reid's practice of employing a procedure known as \nfilling the tree, which precludes Senators from offering amendments. \nThis undercuts the basic tradition of the Senate to allow Senators to \noffer amendments. Regrettably, this has been a practice developed in \nthe Senate by majority leaders on both sides of the aisle, so both \nRepublicans and Democrats are to blame.\n  On June 12, 2008, I voted in favor of cloture on the motion to \nproceed on S. 3101, legislation similar to H.R. 6331, the Medicare \nImprovements for Patients and Providers Act, to prevent the reduction \nin Medicare payments to physicians. At that time, I was assured by \nMajority Leader Reid that he would not make a procedural motion to fill \nthe tree. Following the failure to obtain cloture on the motion to \nproceed to S. 3101, Finance Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley \nbegan to negotiate a bipartisan bill that could be brought before the \nSenate. I have concerns with some provisions that may have been \ncontained in such an agreement. However, the prospect of the Senate \nworking its will and allowing other Senators and me to offer amendments \nto such a bill is more favorable than filling the amendment tree.\n  On June 26, 2008, the majority leader brought up H.R. 6331. The \nposture of the Senate was such that for the majority leader to complete \naction on H.R. 6331 and send it to the President before the physician \npayment reduction was scheduled to go into effect at the end of June, \nthe Senate must pass the same legislation the House of Representatives \npassed. This is the case because the House of Representatives adjourned \nfor the Independence Day recess prior to the Senate vote on cloture on \nthe motion to proceed to H.R. 6331. Since the House went out of \nsession, there was no possibility for the House to consider a Senate-\namended Medicare bill. To guarantee that the same Medicare legislation \nwould be passed by the Senate, no amendments to the legislation were \npermitted. By bringing this legislation up at the last minute after the \nHouse of Representatives adjourned, the majority leader prevented the \nopportunity to offer amendments and undermined Senate procedure.\n  If cloture were to have been obtained on the motion to proceed to \nH.R. 6331 the legislation would have been vetoed by President Bush. \nThat veto would have resulted in a further delay, since the House would \nnot be in session to override the veto and the scheduled physician \npayment reductions would go into effect at the end of June. There was \nan expectation that the Senate would extend the current physician \npayment rate for 30 days and prevent the pending reduction from going \ninto effect. However, when this legislative extension was offered by \nSenate Republican Leader McConnell it was objected to by Majority \nLeader Reid. The majority leader was aware of this issue for some time \nand scheduling should have accommodated the amendment process. I voted \nagainst cloture because there was no opportunity to amend the \nlegislation that came before the Senate.\n  On June 28, 2008, I wrote to President Bush requesting that he use \nhis constitutional authority to call the Congress back into session so \nthat the Senate could act on H.R. 6331 with appropriate amendments and \nsend it back to the House for its concurrence. This would have allowed \nfor prompt action on this important matter and prevented the payment \nreduction from going into effect.\n  On Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of this week, I spoke with Majority \nLeader Reid regarding today's vote on cloture on the motion to proceed \nto H.R. 6331. During those conversations I requested that he allow \nSenators to offer amendments to the legislation. On those occasions he \nsaid he would not allow amendments. During the vote, when more than 60 \nSenators had voted for cloture, it was not possible to preserve the \nprinciple of Senators' rights to offer amendments so I voted for \ncloture because I agreed with the objectives of this legislation.\n  I have a strong history of preventing reduced payments to physicians. \nIn April 2003, as Chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation Appropriations Subcommittee; I worked to reverse a 4.4 \npercent cut in physician fees which had gone into effect in January of \nthat year. This $54 billion effort also provided a 1.6 percent \nincrease. In June 2003, I introduced an amendment to the Medicare \nModernization Act to provide an increase in physician payments for 2 \nyears. This provision was agreed to and was included in the bill. This \nprevented decreases in physician payments in 2004 and 2005, and \nincreased payments by 1.5 percent in each of those years. I have \nconsistently voted in favor of increasing Medicare physician payments \nand will continue to support the policy, but Senators must be allowed \nto offer amendments and let the Senate work its will.\n\n[[Page S6481]]\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise to discuss the Medicare \nImprovements for Patients and Providers Act, H.R. 6331. This bill makes \nmuch needed changes to the Medicare program, and will pay doctors at a \nrate that will allow them to continue to participate in this vital \nprogram.\n  Medicare is a great success story, providing retirees with a health \ncare safety net, but the formula that determines physicians' payment \nlevels is seriously flawed. Unless Congress takes action immediately, \ndoctors will receive a 10.6 percent cut in their reimbursements.\n  The consequences of such cuts would be dire. According to the \nCalifornia Medical Association, more than 60 percent of California \nphysicians say they would be forced to either stop taking new Medicare \npatients or leave the Medicare program altogether if these reductions \noccur.\n  The same payment rate reductions will apply for health care provided \nto our servicemembers and their families who receive coverage through \nthe TRICARE program. Over 870,000 Californians and at least 8.9 million \nAmericans depend on TRICARE for their health care. We owe these \nfamilies, who have sacrificed so much for our country, access to \nphysicians and medical care when they need it.\n  I voted to consider and pass this bill, because we need to block \nthese cuts and make improvements for beneficiaries.\n  However, much to my dismay, this bill contains a delay on a program \nto competitively bid for durable medical equipment. Can you believe it? \nA block on competitive bidding of commonly available medical goods.\n  Let me tell you what this means. Medicare began a competitive bidding \nprogram for durable medical equipment on July 1 in 10 metropolitan \nareas across the country--including the Riverside-San Bernardino area \nin my home State of California.\n  The program enabled medical supply companies to bid on 10 products, \nincluding wheelchairs, diabetic supplies, oxygen concentrators, walkers \nand hospital beds, in those 10 metropolitan areas. Companies that \noffered the best prices were awarded contracts to supply Medicare \nbeneficiaries with medical equipment.\n  As a result, seniors on Medicare in these areas can expect to pay a \nlot less for some of their medical supplies.\n  In Riverside, CA, diabetic test strips, once $37 will now be $18, and \nportable oxygen, which cost Riverside Medicare patients $77 per month, \ncan now be bought for $61.\n  The bid prices are an average of 26 percent lower than prices set by \nthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid before the enactment of the \ncompetitive bidding program.\n  Because beneficiaries pay copayments equal to 20 percent of the cost \nof their healthcare and medical equipment, that savings is also felt by \nthe elderly and disabled Americans who rely on Medicare.\n  Competitive bidding makes sense, because there is no good reason why \nMedicare or seniors should pay above-market prices for medical \nequipment--especially as other health care costs continue to skyrocket.\n  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid discovered that it was paying \n$1,825 for a hospital bed that can be bought for $754 online. On the \nInternet, you can purchase a power wheelchair for $2,174--far less than \nthe $4,023 Medicare pays out for the same product. z\n  Competitive bidding forces Medicare suppliers to compete for their \ncustomers--much like retailers do. It also helps to control costs while \nproviding the elderly and the disabled with quality healthcare and \nmedical supplies. Participating companies must be accredited, to ensure \nthat Medicare beneficiaries receive high quality equipment and service.\n  Allowed to continue, the program is expected to save $125 million in \nits first year. Expanded nationwide, that number would grow to $1 \nbillion in savings for taxpayers and Medicare beneficiaries.\n  But just as this pilot program gets off the ground--another 70 \nmetropolitan areas are expected to be added in 2009--this bill \nendangers the program's future.\n  Losing bidders have complained that the selection process was flawed \nand have convinced some of my colleagues to support a delay of the \nprogram for another 18 months and start the selection process over.\n  The bill before us today would terminate the existing competitively-\nbid contracts and delay the program launch for a year and a half.\n  This should not be permitted to happen. Seniors and taxpayers deserve \nto pay fair prices for their medical equipment. Medicare beneficiaries \nin Riverside, in Cleveland, in Dallas, learned about this new program, \nselected new providers, and are already saving money. Stopping this new \neffort midstream will only lead to confusion.\n  We all agree that entitlement programs like Medicare need to be \nreformed, but if we can't change a small portion of this sprawling \nentitlement program, how will we ever succeed in making major reforms?\n  Competitive bidding is a smart way to ensure that Medicare pays \nreasonable rates for medical equipment at a time when medical costs are \nsoaring. We should not ask taxpayers to fund someone else's cash cow.\n  While I will vote to consider and pass this bill today, I will \ncontinue to work to see that competitive bidding moves forward, and I \nurge my colleagues do the same. This is a matter of common sense.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, today we are voting on a piece of \nlegislation that has the potential to make a real difference for \nseniors, Americans with disabilities, physicians, hospitals, and \npharmacies. We are voting to ensure that doctors who care for the 44 \nmillion people in Medicare and the millions of people who rely on \nTRICARE, the military health care system, do not see a sudden and \ndramatic cut in reimbursements. And we are voting to implement a series \nof reforms to improve our capacity to provide preventive care, to use \nmore health information technology in our medical system, and to \nmeasure the quality of care patients receive.\n  We hear a lot of talk about our broken health care system in this \nChamber--and on the campaign trail--by Members on both sides of the \naisle. However, all too often, there have been some all too willing to \nlament the crisis until it comes time to address it. But the fact is, \nall that matters--to seniors, to people with disabilities, to our men \nand women in uniform--is whether we deliver on the rhetoric. That is \nour test in this Chamber. And that is our test with this vote.\n  The choice is simple. How will we address the crisis in our health \ncare system, as costs skyrocket, coverage declines, and quality \nsuffers? Do we continue in this race to the bottom--or do we choose a \nnew course?\n  I believe we must take immediate steps to modernize and reform our \nhealth care system to control costs, increase coverage, and improve \ncare. The goal--as I have proposed, advocated, and championed my whole \nadult life--is quality, affordable health care for everyone, no \nexceptions, no excuses. And we all look forward to the return of our \nfriend, Senator Kennedy, one of America's great health care champions, \nto help us reach this goal.\n  The solution will not be to cut corners while cutting funding that \nwill drive more and more people and providers out of the health care \nsystem. The solution has not been and will never be to stick our heads \nin the sand to avoid the tough work of dragging our system of care into \nthe 21st century.\n  The solution is tougher--and more complex--but no less real: \ncomprehensive reform to provide coverage for every American that \nemphasizes prevention, measurable improvements in quality, and a \nmodernized system to dramatically improve efficiency and reduce errors. \nAnd we will achieve it by asking everyone to be part of this solution: \npatients, providers, insurance companies, employers, and, yes, the \ngovernment.\n  That is why I hope more of my Republican colleagues will join the \ngrowing bipartisan majority in the House and Senate to support this \nlegislation and end this Medicare blockade--an obstruction that \nsurvived by a single vote--which stands between patients and their \nphysicians, and between this chamber and demonstrable progress in \nMedicare.\n  Here is why this legislation is so critical. First, unless we act, \nthe 10.6 percent cut in payment to physicians will\n\n[[Page S6482]]\n\ncompromise care for seniors, Americans with disabilities and--though \nthis is largely unknown--men and women who have served in our Nation's \nmilitary. TRICARE sets its physician reimbursement rates according to \nMedicare. So a 10.6-percent cut in Medicare is a 10.6-percent cut in \nTRICARE.\n  The consequences may be catastrophic. A recent survey by the American \nMedical Association found that 60 percent of physicians would limit new \nMedicare patients if this cut is allowed. Almost 9 million people who \nhave served in the military would face the prospect of newly limited \naccess to medical care, including more than 180,000 in New York.\n  The answer is not haphazard cuts and temporary formula fixes. The \nanswer is a comprehensive, permanent solution which reflects the costs \nof doing business for providers--as well as the goals we all share for \nfixing the incentives in the health care system and controlling costs \nby improving care--not limiting it.\n  And preventing this cut is only the beginning. I am proud that we \nhave included a number of important reforms I have championed that will \nhelp us chart a new course for Medicare and our health care system: We \nhave included a provision to cover new preventive care recommended by \nthe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a proposal for which I have \nadvocated and which I believe should be part of our solution to achieve \nhealth care for everyone. Coverage for screenings for osteoporosis, \nbreast cancer, or high blood pressure, for example, will help detect \nillness at the earliest stages, before becoming life-threatening and \nmore costly.\n  I am proud that we have taken an important step in health information \ntechnology, requiring electronic prescribing by 2011. That will reduce \nerrors dramatically. If all hospitals used a computerized order entry \nsystem we would reduce adverse drug reactions by an estimated 200,000 \neach year and save $1 billion annually. Health information technology, \nwhich I have proposed and hope to pass through the Senate soon, will \nallow us to make giant leaps in our health care system to cut errors, \nimprove care, and discover new treatments--while protecting patient \nprivacy and safety and dramatically reducing costs.\n  The bill also extends the Medicare Physician Quality Reporting \nInitiative and provides for the endorsement of quality measures, as I \nhave long championed. In fact, the first bipartisan health IT \nlegislation I introduced with Senator Bill Frist in 2005 included this \nidea and it remains in the legislation that I have cosponsored with \nChairman Kennedy, Senator Enzi, and Senator Hatch. Linking quality with \ncoverage is essential. Today, we don't know what we don't know. With \nnew data we can find new ways to treat illnesses and new ways to \nimprove the care we provide.\n  We have previously failed by one vote. One vote between improving \ncare or undermining it. One vote that can make the difference between \nsolving problems in our health care system or making matters worse. \nThis is not about politics. This is about the real people whose health \nand lives will be affected by our votes today. This is about the far \nreaching consequences of our decision in this Chamber.\n  I have met people across New York and our country who cannot find the \nmedical care--or afford the health care--they need.\n  Mothers who whisper to me in tears, terrified that their children \nwill get sick because they lost their insurance. Nurses who feel like \neach day is a deluge, as patient loads rise. Doctors forced to see more \nand more patients--with less and less time to do their jobs and more \nand more paperwork piling up. Seniors with multiple chronic illnesses \nwho have trouble juggling the recommendations and medications from \nmultiple health care providers.\n  And hospitals like A.O. Fox Memorial Hospital in Oneonta, NY, which \nstands to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars it cannot afford to \nlose. Or Bassett Healthcare in Cooperstown, NY, that stands to lose \nabout a million dollars.\n  These are local hospitals struggling to provide care as that care is \nassaulted on all sides: rising costs, declining reimbursements, more \nuninsured patients walking through the emergency room doors. It would \nbe a disgrace if these hospitals looked to us for solutions--and found \nthat with these cuts, we were part of the problem.\n  These are the stakes and this is our test. I am grateful to my \ncolleagues who have labored on this legislation and I urge my \nRepublican colleagues to join us. And I will continue to do all I can \nto be champion for the people across New York and the country who feel \nlike they do not have a voice, who look to us, who are counting on us, \nwho depend upon us. I will always stand with them--and I urge my \ncolleagues to stand with us.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, we must enact the Medicare Improvements \nfor Patients and Providers Act of 2008. This legislation is vital to \nensuring that Medicare and TRICARE beneficiaries have continued access \nto health care. The bill will also enhance Medicare benefits. In \naddition, the legislation will provide additional support for Hawaii \nhospitals that care for the uninsured and Medicaid beneficiaries.\n  I hope that my colleagues who previously opposed this legislation had \nan opportunity to meet with their physicians, beneficiaries, and \nmilitary families during the recess. If so, I hope my colleagues now \nunderstand how tremendously important it is to seniors, individuals \nwith disabilities, and members of our armed services and their families \nthat this legislation be enacted to protect their access to health \ncare.\n  The act will maintain Medicare physician payment rates for 2008 and \nprovide a slight increase in 2009. If this legislation again fails to \npass, doctors will be subject to a 10.6 percent cut in Medicare \nreimbursements for the rest of the year. This dramatic cut could \nseverely limit access to health care for our troops and their families \nbecause TRICARE reimbursement rates are linked to Medicare \nreimbursement rates. Rising costs and difficulty in recruiting and \nretaining qualified health professionals make it essential that we \nimprove reimbursements to ensure that Medicare and TRICARE \nbeneficiaries have access to health care services.\n  The act will enhance Medicare benefits. It increases coverage for \npreventive health care services and makes mental health care more \naffordable. In addition, the act provides additional help for low-\nincome seniors to obtain the health care services that they need.\n  Finally, the legislation will provide much needed relief for Hawaii \nhospitals. The legislation will extend Medicaid Disproportionate Share, \nDSH, allotments for Hawaii until December 31, 2009.\n  Hawaii hospitals are struggling to meet the increasing demands placed \non them by a growing number of uninsured patients and rising costs. \nHawaii and Tennessee are the only two States that do not have permanent \nDSH allotments. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created specific DSH \nallotments for each State based on their actual DSH expenditures for FY \n1995. In 1994, Hawaii implemented the QUEST demonstration program that \nwas designed to reduce the number of uninsured and improve access to \nhealth care. The prior Medicaid DSH program was incorporated into \nQUEST. As a result of the demonstration program, Hawaii did not have \nDSH expenditures in 1995 and was not provided a DSH allotment.\n  The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection \nAct of 2000 made further changes to the DSH program, which included the \nestablishment of a floor for DSH allotments. States without allotments \nwere again left out.\n  The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of \n2003 made additional changes to the DSH program. This included an \nincrease in DSH allotments for low DSH States. Again, States lacking \nallotments were left out.\n  In the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, DSH allotments were \nfinally provided for Hawaii and Tennessee for 2007. The act included a \n$10 million Medicaid DSH allotment for Hawaii for 2007. The Medicare, \nMedicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 extended the DSH allotments \nfor Hawaii and Tennessee until June 30, 2008. This provided an \nadditional $7.5 million for a Hawaii DSH allotment.\n  This additional extension in the Medicare Improvements for Patients \nand Providers Act of 2008 authorizes\n\n[[Page S6483]]\n\nthe submission by the State of Hawaii of a State plan amendment \ncovering a DSH payment methodology to hospitals which is consistent \nwith the requirements of existing law relating to DSH payments. The \npurpose of providing a DSH allotment for Hawaii is to provide \nadditional funding to the State of Hawaii to permit a greater \ncontribution toward the uncompensated costs of hospitals that are \nproviding indigent care. It is not meant to alter existing arrangements \nbetween the State of Hawaii and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices, CMS, or to reduce in any way the level of Federal funding for \nHawaii's QUEST program. This act will provide $15 million for Hawaii \nDSH allotments through December 31, 2009.\n  These DSH resources will strengthen the ability of our providers to \nmeet the increasing health care needs of our communities. All States \nneed to benefit from the DSH program. This legislation will make sure \nthat Hawaii and Tennessee continue to have Medicaid DSH assistance.\n  I will continue to work with Chairman Baucus, Ranking Member \nGrassley, Senators Alexander, Corker and Inouye to permanently restore \nallotments for Hawaii and Tennessee. However, we need to enact this \nlegislation to continue to help our struggling hospitals.\n  We must enact this legislation. It will protect access to health care \nfor seniors, individuals with disabilities, and members of our armed \nservices and their families. The bill will improve Medicare benefits \nand provide much needed financial assistance for hospitals in Hawaii \nthat care for the uninsured and Medicaid beneficiaries.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, our vote today on H.R. 6331 carries real \nand immediate consequences for people who depend on Medicare. Action on \nthis legislation is mandatory now because, 8 days ago, the temporary \nfix we passed at the end of last year expired. The cuts are in effect.\n  Next Tuesday, when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \nbegins paying claims for services rendered after June 30, 2008, \npayments will be cut unless we pass this measure.\n  Because I return home every evening to my State, I interact \nfrequently with Maryland providers. They cannot sustain a nearly 11-\npercent cut in their Medicare payments; they and many of their \ncolleagues will stop accepting new Medicare patients unless we pass \nthis bill.\n  The pending cuts are the result of a flawed system that pegs provider \nreimbursement to the growth of the Nation's GDP. It was created by the \n1997 Balanced Budget Act as a way to rein in dramatic growth in \nMedicare spending on physician services. But this system, known as SGR, \nhas not worked as intended. In fact, every year since 2001, Congress \nhas had to act to prevent the cuts from going into effect. We know that \nthe SGR formula must be repealed.\n  I have introduced legislation in past years to eliminate SGR and \nreplace it with a system that reimburses based on the actual reasonable \ncosts of providing care. The bill that was passed overwhelmingly by the \nHouse, H.R. 6331, provides another temporary fix through December 31, \n2009. That is sufficient time for the next Congress, working with a new \nadministration and the provider community, to develop a new mechanism.\n  But although ``doctor fix'' is the shorthand often used, this bill is \nfar more than that, and our failure to pass it has repercussions far \nbeyond physician offices. Another provision that expired on June 30 is \nthe exceptions process for outpatient rehabilitation services. The 1997 \nBalanced Budget Act imposed dollar limits of $1,500 on Part B therapy \nservices--one cap for physical and speech-language therapy, and another \nfor occupational therapy. They are adjusted annually for inflation and \nare now at $1,810. I was a member of the Ways and Means Health \nSubcommittee at the time. Congress held no hearings on this issue to \nexamine how the caps might affect patient care. The authors of the \nprovision had no policy justification for imposing them, and the dollar \namount was arbitrary. These caps were imposed for purely budgetary \nreasons. They were a crude budget-cutting measure designed to deliver \nsavings--$1.7 billion over 5 years.\n  This misguided policy ignored clinical needs and it restricted care \nfor the most frail patients--such as those who are recovering from \nstroke or hip fracture, and those with multiple injuries in a given \nyear.\n  And because the dollar limits are not adjusted for cost variations \nacross the country, seniors in high cost areas reach their caps even \nsooner.\n  The University of Maryland's Shock Trauma Center was the first such \nunit in the Nation. It is a world-renowned leader in caring for \ncritically injured patients. They see patients with extensive \nfractures, severe burns, spinal cord and brain injuries, and other \ndebilitating conditions. These patients require lengthy therapy \nsessions to restore basic functioning. They cannot be rehabilitated for \n$1,810 a year.\n  The therapy caps actually went into effect once before, on January 1, \n1999, and they had serious consequences for beneficiaries. By April, \nmany patients in skilled nursing facilities had exceeded the limits and \nwere unable to receive necessary care. The administration recognized \nthe danger of this provision, stating:\n\n       The limits will reduce the amount of therapy services paid \n     for by Medicare. The patients most affected are likely to be \n     those with diagnoses such as stroke and amputation, where the \n     number of therapy visits needed by a patient may exceed those \n     that can be reimbursed by Medicare under the statutory \n     limits.\n\n  That year, I joined the now-junior Senator from Nevada, John Ensign, \nto introduce a bill to repeal the caps. We had significant bipartisan \nsupport and at the end of 1999, Congress delayed implementation for 2 \nyears. Since that time, Congress has acted several times to prevent the \ncaps from taking effect.\n  In 2006, Congress created an exceptions process that would allow \nbeneficiaries needing care above the statutory caps to receive those \nservices. It was the right thing to do. This process has worked well. \nMedicare is saving money and patients are getting needed care. In \nFebruary, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released a \nstudy concluding that:\n\n       The exception process that allows beneficiaries who need \n     therapy to get that therapy, even if the cost goes beyond the \n     cap, has worked to control cost growth. This study reveals \n     that from Calendar Year 2004 through 2006, although the total \n     number of therapy users continued to increase by 3.5 percent \n     the overall expenditures actually decreased by 4.7 percent.\n       This suggests that the exceptions process in CY 2006 may \n     have satisfied to some extent the Congressional intent to \n     assure access to medically necessary services while \n     controlling the growth in expenditures.\n\n  The CMS study shows that the exceptions process works to control \ncosts, yet still assures access for the more than 4.4 million \nbeneficiaries who need additional care. The exceptions process allowed \nthem to get the therapy they need to recover, function optimally, and \nlive more productive lives. It allowed them to learn to cook, clean, \nand care for themselves after a stroke, to walk correctly and strongly \nafter a hip replacement, and to speak and communicate after cancer \nsurgery. But as of Tuesday, July 1, the process has expired. Section \n141 of the bill we are voting on today continues the exceptions process \nthrough December 31, 2009.\n  This provision takes up just two lines of the bill. It is a small \nprovision, but it has a major impact on seniors.\n  The story of Steve Kinsey and his patients illustrates why we must \npass this bill without further delay.\n  Steve operates Hereford Physical Therapy in Baltimore County. He is \nanxious to know what the Senate will do this afternoon and so are the \nseniors he cares for. Steve's practice has about 9,500 patient visits \neach year, and one-fifth of them are covered by Medicare. He told me \nabout two patients who are waiting for the Senate to act.\n  The first is a 72-year-old gentleman. He is a wheelchair-bound \nquadriplegic who needs physical therapy to keep up his strength. He \nqualified through the exceptions process, and so, although he exceeded \nthe $1,810 cap in March, he has been able to receive therapy 2 days \nevery other week to maintain his level of function.\n  The second patient is an 83-year-old woman who had a total knee \nreplacement earlier this year. She received 20 visits and was under the \ncap, until a few weeks later when she fell and fractured her hip.\n  The cost of her care exceeded the cap 6 weeks ago, but after \nqualifying through the exceptions process, she has been able to \ncontinue treatment.\n\n[[Page S6484]]\n\n  Because of the actions of a few Senators, as of Tuesday, July 1, \nthese two Medicare beneficiaries can no longer receive care.\n  On July 1, CMS told providers: (1), that the exceptions process \nexpired on June 30, 2008; (2), not to submit any claims with the code \nfor exceptions because they will be automatically rejected; (3), that \nproviders can check a CMS Web site to determine the amount of services \ntheir patients have received so far this year; and; (4), that patients \nwho have reached the caps can go to an outpatient hospital department \nfor care or pay out-of-pocket.\n  Because the exceptions process was in place for the first 6 months of \nthis year, patients who have already gone beyond the cap--the patients \nmost in need of care--must stop therapy or pay for it themselves. The \naverage charge is about $80 for a 45-minute session. This is wrong.\n  If we do not reinstate the exceptions process as the bill before us \nwould do, these individuals who need more care will be harmed. They \nreceived appropriate therapy under appropriate rules, but that does not \nmatter: On July 1, they were effectively cut off from services that 8 \ndays ago they were deemed eligible for. This is unfair and it is \nharmful.\n  Let's not forget that therapy services are also paid under the \nMedicare fee schedule, so the 10.6 percent cut will also apply to these \nservices as well.\n  Now, as CMS stated, there is a last resort--to go to the outpatient \ndepartment of a hospital for additional care. But Steve has learned \nthat the two hospitals near his practice--GBMC and St. Joseph's--are \nturning away new patients because they don't have the capacity to see \nthem.\n  Because of the shortage of therapists in Maryland and in other \nStates, hospitals are already overloaded. So, Steve has 10 patients who \nare waiting at home for him to call and say they can come back in for \ntherapy. They have no where else to go for treatment unless they pay \nout-of-pocket. They can't afford that.\n  Outpatient therapy services are paid under Medicare Part B. The \npeople waiting for Steve's call are seniors who worked hard to qualify \nfor Part A coverage and who are paying premiums for Part B. Working \nAmericans--taxpayers--who do not yet qualify for Medicare, are paying \nto subsidize Part B premiums. The American people as a whole, not only \nproviders and beneficiaries, should be outraged that a minority of the \nSenate is preventing us from moving forward on this legislation.\n  The 43 million seniors and persons with disabilities who rely on \nMedicare deserve a program that meets their health care needs. Our goal \nshould be to ensure that Medicare provides comprehensive, affordable, \nquality care.\n  The bill also includes important beneficiary improvements. In 1997, I \nworked in a bipartisan way to add to the Balanced Budget Act the first-\never package of preventive benefits to the traditional Medicare \nProgram. That was 11 years ago. At that time, the members of the Ways \nand Means Committee recognized what medical professionals had long \nknown--that prevention saves lives and reduces overall health care \ncosts.\n  Preventive services such as mammograms and colonoscopies are vital \ntools in the fight against serious disease. The earlier that breast and \ncolon cancer are detected, the greater the odds of survival. For \nexample, when caught in the first stages, the 5-year survival rate for \nbreast cancer is 98 percent. But if the cancer has spread, the survival \nrate drops to 26 percent. If colon cancer is detected in its first \nstage, the survival rate is 90 percent, but only 10 percent if found \nwhen it is most advanced.\n  Seniors are at particular risk for cancer. In fact, the single \ngreatest risk factor for colorectal cancer is being over the age of \n50--when more than 90 percent of cases are diagnosed.\n  Sixty percent of all new cancer diagnoses and 70 percent of all \ncancer-related deaths are in the 65 and older population. Cancer is the \nleading cause of death among Americans aged 60 to 79 and the second \nleading cause of death for those over age 80. So preventing cancer is \nessential to achieving improved health outcomes for seniors. Screenings \nare crucial in this fight.\n  In addition to improving survival rates, early detection can reduce \nMedicare's costs. Under Chairman Conrad's leadership on the Budget \nCommittee, we have had fruitful debates about the long-term solvency of \nMedicare. A more aggressive focus on prevention will help produce a \nhealthier Medicare Program.\n  Medicare will pay on average $300 for a colonoscopy, but if the \npatient is diagnosed after the colon cancer has metastasized, the costs \nof I care can exceed $58,000.\n  There is no question that these vital screenings can produce better \nand more cost-effective health care.\n  The 1997 law established place improved coverage for breast cancer \nscreenings, examinations for cervical, prostate, and colorectal cancer, \ndiabetes self-management training services and supplies, and bone mass \nmeasurement for osteoporosis. Since then, Congress has added screening \nfor glaucoma, cardiovascular screening blood tests, ultrasound \nscreening for aortic aneurysm, flu shots, and medical nutrition therapy \nservices. In addition, in 2003, a Welcome to Medicare Physical \nexamination was added as a one-time benefit for new Medicare enrollees \navailable during the first 6 months of eligibility.\n  But we can only save lives and money if seniors actually use these \nbenefits. Unfortunately, the participation rate for the Welcome to \nMedicare physical and some of the screenings is very low. I have spoken \nwith primary care physicians across my State of Maryland about this. \nOne problem is the requirement to satisfy the annual deductible and co \npays for these services.\n  Most colonoscopies are done in hospital outpatient departments, where \ntheir copay is 25 percent or approximately $85. Our seniors have the \nhighest out-of-pocket costs of any age group and they will forgo these \nservices if cost is a barrier.\n  The other barrier to participation is the limited 6-month eligibility \nperiod for the one-time physical examination. By the time most seniors \nbecome aware of the benefit, the eligibility period has expired. In \nmany other cases, it can take more than 6 months to schedule an \nappointment for the physical exam and by that time, the patients are no \nlonger eligible for coverage.\n  I have introduced legislation to eliminate the copays and deductibles \nfor preventive services and to extend the eligibility for the Welcome \nto Medicare physical from 6 months to 1 year. My bill would also \neliminate the time consuming and inefficient requirement that Congress \npass legislation each time a new screening is determined to be \neffective in detecting and preventing disease in the Medicare \npopulation.\n  It would empower the Secretary of Health and Human Services to add \n``additional preventive services'' to the list of covered services. \nThey must meet a three part test: (1) they must be reasonable and \nnecessary for the prevention or early detection of an illness; (2) they \nmust be recommended by the U.S. preventive Services Task Force, and (3) \nthey must be appropriate for the Medicare beneficiary population.\n  H.R. 6331 incorporates several elements of my bill in the very first \nsection. It will waive the deductible for the physical examination, \nextend the eligibility period from 6 months to 1 year, and allow the \nSecretary to expand the list of covered benefits.\n  This bill will also help low income seniors by raising asset test \nthresholds in the Medicare savings programs and targeting assistance to \nthe seniors who most need it. It extends and improves assistance \nprograms for seniors with incomes below $14,040 a year, including the \nQI program, which pays Part B premiums for low-income seniors who don't \nqualify for Medicaid.\n  As this Congress continues to make progress toward passing a \ncomprehensive mental health parity bill, this bill provides mental \nhealth parity for Medicare beneficiaries, moving their copayments from \n50 percent to 20 percent gradually over 6 years. Depression, bipolar \ndisorder, and other mental illnesses are prevalent among seniors, and \nyet fewer than half receive the treatment they need. This provision \nwill help them get that treatment.\n  It will also ensure that a category of drugs called \n``benzodiazepines'' are covered by Medicare Part D. When Part D took \neffect on January 1, 2006, millions\n\n[[Page S6485]]\n\nof beneficiaries found that the medicines they took were not covered by \nthe new law. A little-known provision in the bill actually excluded \nfrom coverage an entire class of drugs called benzodiazepines. These \nare anti-anxiety medicines used to manage several conditions, including \nacute anxiety, seizures, and muscle spasms. The category includes \nXanax, Valium, and Ativan. Most are available as generics.\n  The current-law exclusion has led to health complications for \nbeneficiaries, unnecessary complexity for pharmacists, and additional \nred tape for the States. Beneficiaries who are not eligible for \nMedicaid have had to shoulder the entire cost of these drugs or \nsubstitute other less effective drugs. In 2005, I first introduced \nlegislation that would add benzodiazepines to the categories of \nprescription drugs covered by Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage \nplans.\n  This provision is essential for our seniors; without it, dual \neligibles would have to rely on continued Medicaid coverage for \nbenzodiazepines. Medicare beneficiaries who are not eligible for \nMedicaid will have to continue to pay out-of-pocket for them. For those \nwho cannot afford the expense, their doctors would have to use \nalternative medicines that may be less effective, more toxic, and more \naddictive. This is a significant improvement for our seniors who are \nenrolled in Part D and for the fiscal health of our States.\n  This bill will also help our community pharmacies. I have heard from \npharmacies throughout Maryland who cannot receive prompt reimbursement \nfrom private plans. This bill requires plans to pay them within 14 days \nof receiving a clean claim. It also requires plans to update their \nprice lists weekly so that pharmacies have accurate data about what \nthey should be reimbursed.\n  H.R. 6331 is paid for by small reforms to the Medicare Advantage \nprogram, in particular to private fee-for-service plans. The \nnonpartisan Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, MedPAC, has \nrecommended that we equalize payments between Medicare Advantage and \ntraditional Medicare.\n  As we discuss the solvency of the Medicare Program, we must take note \nthat private health plans are not saving the Federal Government money. \nIn fact, they are costing us money. I was a member of the Ways and \nMeans Committee when health plans approached us with an offer.\n  If the Federal Government would pay them 95 percent of what we were \nspending on the traditional Medicare Program, they would create \nefficiencies through managed care--efficiencies that they said were \nlacking in traditional Medicare--that would save the Federal Government \nbillions of dollars each year. They promised to provide enhanced \ncoverage, meaning extra benefits as well as all the services covered by \ntraditional Medicare, for 95 percent of the cost of fee for service. \nCongress gave them a chance to do just that.\n  Instead, what we saw across the country was cherry-picking of \nyounger, healthier seniors. Each time Congress indicated that it would \nroll back their overpayments to a more reasonable level, they responded \nby pulling out of markets. In Maryland, the number of plans declined \nover a 3-year period from eight to one, abandoning thousands of \nseniors. Since 2003, when payments were substantially increased, the \nnumber of plans has steadily increased as well, but at too high a cost \nto beneficiaries, taxpayers, and the future of the Medicare Program.\n  Right now, these plans are paid up to 19 percent more than the amount \nthat we would pay if these seniors were in fee-for-service Medicare. \nOver 10 years, we are overpaying them by more than $150 billion.\n  That is enough money to fund significant valuable improvements in the \noverall Medicare Program, or to permanently repeal the sustainable \ngrowth rate formula. It is time, for the health of the Medicare \nProgram, to pay these plans appropriately. This bill would make small \nadjustments to these overpayments as well as prohibit the abusive \nmarketing practices, such as cold calling, door-to-door sales, and \noffering incentives such as free meals, which have led to many seniors \nbeing enrolled in private plans without their knowledge or consent.\n  Mr. President, this is a balanced and responsible bill that addresses \nimmediate reimbursement concerns while setting the foundation for a \nhigher quality, more cost-effective Medicare Program.\n  The time to act is now. With the support of just one more Senator, we \ncan pass an urgently needed bill and restore the promise of improved \naccess, adequate reimbursement, low-income assistance, and additional \nneeded benefits to the seniors who depend on Medicare. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation,\n\n\n                       Medical Home Demonstration\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I rise today in support of legislation that will avert \na 10.6 percent reduction in payments to providers who care for our \nNation's Medicare beneficiaries. It is critical that we pass this \nlegislation today in order to ensure that seniors, who rely on \nMedicare, will continue to have access to high quality health care.\n  I also wanted to take this opportunity to engage briefly in a \ncolloquy with Senators Harkin, Murkowski, and Collins about a provision \nin this bill relating to an expansion of the medical home \ndemonstration.\n  This bill contains a provision that gives the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services discretion to expand the Medicare medical home \ndemonstration initially enacted as part of the Tax Relief and Health \nCare Act of 2006. I am troubled that the current demonstration does not \npermit nurse practitioners and other non-physician providers to lead \nmedical home demonstrations. I believe Congress must include these \nproviders in the demonstration.\n  In my home State of New Mexico, nurse practitioners have been able to \npractice independently and with full prescriptive authority since 1993. \nThis recognition of their ability to function as independent primary \ncare providers has allowed them to provide care for the most needy of \nour citizens. New Mexico is a very rural State. In some parts of my \nState, nurse practitioners are the only primary care providers \navailable. They already serve as medical home providers for many of our \ncitizens and without them many families would have no health care at \nall.\n  A June 2008 MedPAC report on primary care includes a discussion of \nthe value of medical home demonstrations, stating ``Medical practices \nled by physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants are a \nlogical place to turn for these services, particularly practices with \nstrong nursing and other dedicated staff support . . .'' In that \nreport, MedPAC recommended seven requirements for a primary care \nprovider wishing to lead a medical home demonstration. The provider \nmust: furnish primary care, including coordinating appropriate \npreventive, maintenance, and acute health services; conduct care \nmanagement; use health information technology for active clinical \ndecision support; have a formal quality improvement program; maintain \n24-hour patient communication and rapid access; keep up-to-date records \nof beneficiaries' advance directives; and maintain a written \nunderstanding with each beneficiary designating the provider as a \nmedical home.\n  I firmly believe that nurse practitioners, or other non-physician \nproviders meeting these standards should be able to lead a medical home \ndemonstration. Furthermore, nurse practitioners epitomize the delivery \nof high quality, cost-effective primary care that is crucial to the \nmedical homes model.\n  At a time when primary care providers are so greatly needed, the \nexclusion of more than 700 nurse practitioners in New Mexico--and more \nthan 137,000 nurse practitioners across this country runs counter to \nthe need for more qualified primary care providers.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I want to thank my distinguished colleague for raising \nthis issue, which is also a great concern of mine. I am also pleased to \nsupport the legislation pending before the Senate today, which will \nensure that Iowa's seniors continue to have access to their health care \nprofessionals. Iowa, like New Mexico, is a rural State where \napproximately 1,300 nurse practitioners provide critical access to care \nin Iowa's underserved areas. As you know, rural America has a higher \nproportion of elderly Americans than nonrural areas. In addition, \nMedicare providers face several unique challenges in rural America that \nmake ensuring access to health care even more difficult. As part\n\n[[Page S6486]]\n\nof our expansion of the Secretary's authority, I would encourage the \nSecretary to allow nurse practitioners to fully participate and lead \nmedical home demonstrations.\n  Approximately 90 percent of nurse practitioners in rural areas do \nprimary care. Approximately one-third of nurse practitioners have \npractices where more than 50 percent of patients would be classified as \n``vulnerable populations''.\n  This year, Iowa's State legislature passed legislation to use the \nmedical home model to reduce disparities in health care access, \ndelivery and health care outcomes and, ultimately, allow each Iowan to \nhave access to health care. This legislation includes nurse \npractitioners as medical home leaders who are responsible for providing \nfor appropriate patient care, coordinating specialty care and \nguaranteeing a quality of care based in evidence, and fully coordinated \nwith patient and family.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I want to thank my colleagues for engaging in this \ncolloquy and raising this issue, which is also of importance to my home \nState of Alaska. Like New Mexico and Iowa, Alaska is a rural State \nwhere approximately 600 nurse practitioners provide critical access to \ncare in Alaska underserved areas. As a matter of fact some areas of \nAlaska are so rural and isolated they are primarily served by providers \nwho use airplanes as their mode of transportation. Among these \nproviders are nurse practitioners, who often are the most accessible \nproviders in certain areas in Alaska.\n  Alaska has one of the highest numbers of nurse practitioners per \ncapita of any other State. Nurse practitioners function as partners in \nthe healthcare of their patients, so that, in addition to clinical \nservices, nurse practitioners focus on health promotion, disease \nprevention and health education and counseling, guiding patients to \nmake smarter health and lifestyle choices.\n  NPs provide healthcare to people of all ages, all over the State of \nAlaska, in diverse healthcare settings such as private offices, \ncommunity clinics, hospitals, long-term care facilities, schools, and \nhealth departments, and about 40 percent of nurse practitioners in \nAlaska practice in rural settings, outside the major cities in Alaska, \nand an estimated 25 percent practice in medically underserved areas of \nAlaska.\n  For these reasons and to allow Alaskans the easiest access to a \nprovider in the medical home demonstration, I would encourage the \nSecretary to allow nurse practitioners to fully participate and lead \nmedical home demonstrations.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the \noutstanding work of our Nation's nurse practitioners--most especially \nthe 850 or so nurse practitioners in Maine who have practiced \nindependently since the mid-1990s. Nurse practitioners in Maine are \ncredentialed as participating providers and serve as primary care \nproviders in managed care organizations in my State.\n  Similar to my colleagues from New Mexico, Iowa and Alaska, a large \npercentage of Mainers live in rural areas. As such, residents are often \na considerable distance from health care facilities and may be hindered \nfrom getting care because of transportation and other obstacles. Nurse \npractitioners fill the void for high quality primary health care in our \nunderserved areas.\n  We need to encourage medical home demonstrations that allow nurse \npractitioners to fully participate in these models.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank my fellow Senators for joining me to discuss \nthis important issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I will yield 3 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, as a practicing physician in the Senate, \nI remember the last time a Medicare fix came through and we had the \nproblems associated with it. I would make four points about what is \ngoing on here.\n  No. 1, if this bill goes through, 2.3 million senior citizens who are \non Medicare Advantage will lose Medicare Advantage. Madam President, \n2.3 million will lose. Not only will that happen, but also all Medicare \npatients will pay $200 million more per year in copays for durable \nmedical equipment. So we have a bill that is supposedly going to do the \ndoctor fix, but under the sleight of hand in the dark of night we are \ngoing to raise the fees on Medicare patients by $200 million for \ndurable medical equipment, and we are going to tell 2.3 million \nMedicare patients who are very pleased with the program they have now \nthat they cannot have that anymore.\n  We have two choices in health care in this country. We can let the \nGovernment run it all--which this is a step toward moving toward that--\nor we can allow the ingenuity and creativity of this country through a \nmarket-based phenomenon--which is what Medicare Advantage is going to--\nto create an allocation of scarce resources on the basis of quality, \ngreat outcome, and patient choice. There is very limited patient choice \nnow because doctors do not want to take Medicare patients because the \nreimbursements are so low. Well, guess where they will take it. Where \nthe reimbursements are higher because their costs are going like this, \nand their reimbursements are going down.\n  So remember this: If, in fact, you vote for this bill, 2.3 million \nMedicare patients on Medicare Advantage will lose that coverage, and \n$200 million in additional copays will fall to all Medicare patients \nacross the board in terms of their copay for durable medical equipment.\n  We can fix this problem. We ought to fix it right. This is not the \nway to fix it.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, are we in a quorum call?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, we are not.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise in strong support of this \nlegislation vitally needed from one end of the country to the other. \nAsk doctors who will face a significant cut, ask pharmacists who are \ngoing bankrupt because they are not being paid appropriately, and ask, \nmost of all, our Medicare patients who will not have the ability to \nvisit doctor after doctor after doctor.\n  This legislation is essential, and it is compromise legislation. The \nother side says ``compromise''? Sixty percent of the cuts come from \nmedical education--something near and dear to me and my State. Only 40 \npercent comes from fee for service. Yet they say: Compromise. Do you \nknow what compromise is to the other side, those opposed here? They \nwant it all. All the money should come out of IME, none out of fee for \nservice, or they will not budge.\n  Who is hurt when they play this political game? Millions of senior \ncitizens. I would prefer to have all the money come out of fee for \nservice. So would Chairman Rangel. So would many others from States \nsuch as mine that have medical education. But we are willing to go part \nof the way for the seniors.\n  I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: Substantively \nand politically, this is among the worst votes that you will take if \nyou oppose this legislation; among the very worst both substantively \nbecause it hurts our seniors and cripples Medicare, and politically \nbecause people really care about this. I have never seen organizations \nsuch as the AMA, the pharmacists, and the AARP in unison.\n  So I would urge at least one of my colleagues from across the aisle \nto reconsider for the sake of those who work so hard in the health care \nfield and, most of all, for the sake of our senior citizens.\n  This bill is essential to keep things going in Medicare. I know there \nmay be some who want to get rid of Medicare, but most of us want to \nfight to preserve it. If you care about Medicare, if you care about \nseniors, if you care about fair pay for pharmacists and doctors, the \nonly vote is yes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 4\\1/2\\ minutes left of the initial \ntime that was designated for the chair and ranking member of the \nFinance Committee. Then there is 20 minutes of time divided between the \nminority leader and\n\n[[Page S6487]]\n\nthe majority leader following that time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. All right. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senator from Florida have 4 minutes of my time that is \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, this is indeed an important debate we \nare having about a very important issue to many in my State of Florida. \nThere is no doubt that my State has a large population of people who \ndepend on Medicare for their health care. This is an important matter \nto them.\n  We also have, of course, the doctors who deliver health care who also \nhave a concern, a great concern, about a potential cut at a time when \neverything else in their lives is rising--an unfair cut. The fact is, \nwe know doctors are tremendously stressed today because of many issues \nin their practice. The fact is that hard-working doctors do not deserve \na pay cut. I know whoever created this condition years ago was well-\nintentioned, but it has not worked and it does not work. Doctors should \nnot be expected to come before the Congress hat in hand each and every \nyear or 18 months to ask for yet another extension or a deferral of a \npay cut. The next cut in pay, which would come 18 months from when we \ndo the right thing and move beyond the politics and get something done, \nwill be a 20-percent cut--unsustainable.\n\n  I would say the real answer for the long term is to fix Medicare and \nto fix the doctors' pay problem. Unfortunately, we have not been able \nto come to an agreement. I daresay I don't believe we will today \neither. So I believe the real answer to the issue is to extend the \nprogram temporarily. We have not done so in the past, even though it \nhas been requested. I wonder why.\n  The fact is that to date, the Congress has passed 28 temporary \nextensions for programs where agreement has yet to be reached so these \nprograms can continue without interruption during the time those \ndifferences are ironed out. These extensions are commonplace, as \ndemonstrated by the 28 temporary extensions during this Congress alone. \nIn fact, at the time the majority objected to the first request for a \nshort-term extension, Medicare payment rates were already operating \nunder a 10-month temporary extension from last December.\n  So I would say it is time for us to stop the political ``gotcha'' \ngames and allow the doctors to be assured that they will not be \nsuffering a pay cut while we get to a bipartisan agreement because it \nis important that this be a bipartisan effort and that we come at it in \na bipartisan way with ideas from both sides of the aisle. We can do \nthat. While that takes place, I believe the only way to proceed would \nbe for there to be a 30-day extension that can allow uninterrupted \npayments to continue. The differences can be worked out, as they always \nare in this environment, although not always on a timely basis, and \nthen we can move forward.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Request\n\n  At this time, I ask unanimous consent that if cloture is not invoked \non the motion to proceed to the House-passed bill, the Senate proceed \nto the immediate consideration of a Senate bill which I will send to \nthe desk, and it is clean, a 1-month extension of the Medicare payments \nbill. I further ask unanimous consent that there be 15 minutes of \ndebate equally divided and that following the use or yielding back of \ntime, the bill be read a third time and the Senate proceed to a vote on \npassage without any intervening action or debate.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, reserving the right to object, in the 10 \nminutes I have before the vote, I will address in some detail why this \nis such a fallacious idea, and I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, the issue before us is the physician \npayment update, and on that point we don't disagree at all. Everyone \nagrees we should prevent the cut and preserve seniors' access to care \nunder the Medicare Program.\n  Republicans have been flexible on finding a solution. When it was \nclear that the Senate wouldn't move to the last partisan bill that was \nproposed, I asked my friends on the other side to work with us on a \nbipartisan compromise with Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus. Both \nhave a long history on finding workable compromises on very tough \nissues. If that wasn't possible, we proposed an 18-month extension of \ncurrent law. Then we proposed a 1-month extension. There is no good \nreason patients and physicians should suffer while Congress works out \nits disagreements. The majority objected to all of these proposals out \nof hand. They weren't interested. They even rejected the opportunity to \nhave a single amendment on the bill--no amendments.\n  So now, rather than resolving the problem in a way that is acceptable \nto everyone and in a form the President will sign, we are no closer to \na solution for seniors and their doctors than we were 2 weeks ago. \nRather than passing a short-term safety net bill while we get a good, \nbipartisan bill to protect 2 million seniors from losing their private \nMedicare Advantage plans, the majority chose an all-or-nothing \napproach.\n  It seems to me that if we can't resolve policy issues today, we \nshould at least agree to a short-term extension of existing law, which \nmy good friend from Florida just offered, including a bipartisan \nproposal to delay competitive bidding that is identical to a provision \nin the House bill that the other side has already voted for.\n  So let's sum it up. The Democrats don't want a bipartisan compromise. \nThey don't want a long-term extension of current law. They don't want a \nshort-term extension of current law. Yet they are not to blame for this \nMedicare cut going into effect? We know how to prevent this cut from \ngoing into effect, but we can't stop it. We can't protect the doctors, \nand we can't protect access of choice for seniors if the Democrats \nwon't let us.\n  How much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 8 minutes 14 seconds remaining.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I wish to review some facts.\n  At the end of last year, we agreed to a short-term Medicare extension \nso that we could complete work on a bipartisan Medicare package this \nyear that would fill out the 2 years that we previously had planned to \ndo it. We were very close to a deal then and needed time to finish that \nwork, so that is why we did the short-term extension. Both sides agreed \nthat we would work quickly to get a bill that could be signed into law. \nUnfortunately, that effort has been intentionally derailed by the \nmajority's desire to play politics with Medicare.\n  The fact is that the majority has twice walked away from good-faith, \nbipartisan negotiations. The fact is that we had been working for \nmonths before the rug was pulled. The fact is that we had actually \ncompleted that bipartisan deal 2 weeks ago yesterday, about 11 o'clock \nin the morning. It was a deal that would be signed into law--in other \nwords, not be vetoed by the President of the United States. But the \nother side thought they saw a political advantage, and they have taken \nthat into consideration. So they scuttled the deal in favor of a bill \nthat would, in fact, be vetoed by the President of the United States, \nand that is where we are again right now. Now they have spent the last \n2 weeks engaged in an effort to scare seniors and providers, and the \nworst thing yet is that it has been aided and abetted by the American \nMedical Association.\n  The bill is riddled with problems and missed opportunities. First and \nforemost, the bill we are going to be voting on would do serious harm \nto Medicare drug benefits on which millions of seniors have come to \ndepend. It would tie the hands of Medicare Part D plans, resulting in \nhigher drug prices and higher premiums for seniors.\n  Let me quote from a communication I received today from the Medicare \nOffice of the Actuary. Their conclusion is that it would ``very likely \nresult in additional Federal spending for the Part D program.'' Also, \noutside analysts have likewise concluded that this provision has the \npotential to undermine the long-term financial sustainability of the \nMedicare drug benefit.\n  This provision, which is tucked away in a seemingly harmless \nprovision intended to clarify what classes of drugs might be protected \nunder Part D, is a perfect example of why we work best in this body \nwhen we work together and\n\n[[Page S6488]]\n\nwhen we do it in a bipartisan way. When we work together, we catch \nthese little landmines tucked away in House-passed bills that could do \nreal harm to a program seniors rely on for their drug coverage.\n  Instead of writing a bipartisan bill, the majority twice walked away \nfrom the table, and now we are in a position of ``take it or leave \nit.'' The process here today does a disservice to the purpose of the \nSenate, but more than that, it does a disservice to seniors, to \ndoctors, and everyone who depends on Medicare.\n  There is a deal to be reached here. We could vote on a deal today \nthat includes many of the policies in the underlying bill but fixes \nglaring problems. We could vote today on a bill that would provide a \n1.1-percent update for physicians. We could vote on a bill today that \nwould not be vetoed.\n  To my colleagues today, I say we should vote no on this motion so we \ncan get back to something the President will sign and get it done and \nget it done quickly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I yield back the remainder of our \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, thank you very much.\n  My distinguished counterpart, the Republican leader, has often said \nthere is a right way and a wrong way to get things done here in the \nSenate. The right way, he says, is through bipartisanship. I agree with \nmy colleague.\n  Before the Fourth of July break, we saw such a stunning moment of \nbipartisanship in the House of Representatives. Democrats and \nRepublicans saw the harm our country could face if Congress did not \ntake action to pass the doctors fix. Members of Congress knew that \nwithout bipartisan leadership, doctors would face cuts in the payments \nthey receive, which would cause them to drop patients and even drop out \nof Medicare completely. Members of the Senate knew that if they sat on \ntheir hands, nothing would be done, obviously, but the House of \nRepresentatives knew that if they sat on their hands, millions of \nsenior citizens, people with disabilities, Active Duty, retired \nmilitary, and their families could all face a reduction in the quality \nof their care. So the Democrats and Republicans in the House of \nRepresentatives passed an identical bill that is now before us, the so-\ncalled doctors fix--listen to this--by a bipartisan majority of 355 to \n59. Every single Democrat voted for the measure. Two-thirds--two-\nthirds--of the Republicans joined them.\n  This is bipartisanship at its very best. When the House, by a vote of \n359 to 55, votes as they did, this is bipartisanship at its best. In \nfact, one of the small number of Republicans who voted no felt so badly \nafter the vote took place that he wrote a letter to all the physicians \nin his district and all the senior citizens in his district and said: I \nam sorry. I am sorry. I made a mistake. I didn't know it was so \nimportant. He said: If I ever have a chance to vote on it again, I will \nvote with the vast majority of the Members of the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  If Senate Republicans are looking for bipartisanship, they need to \nlook no further than the bipartisan breakthrough we saw on Medicare in \nthe House of Representatives. Republicans in the Senate should have \nseen the overwhelming support for this critical legislation from both \nsides of the aisle in the House and joined the effort here in the \nSenate.\n  As I look across this body, I see a number of us who have served in \nthe House of Representatives: the ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee, the Senator from Michigan, the Senator from Illinois, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, and others. The House of \nRepresentatives is known as a partisan body. We are not. They showed \nthat, for the good of the American people, they could set their \npartisanship aside and vote, and they did that.\n  If, in fact, the Republicans here in the Senate had looked and \nstudied what took place in the House of Representatives, this bill \nwould have passed before the break we took before Fourth of July and it \nwould have been sent to the President and we would be spending our time \ntoday focusing on other critical priorities for the American people \nsuch as gas prices, such as housing, and issues on which Republicans \nhave done a lot of talking but no legislating. Instead, though, Senate \nRepublicans have once again chosen the side of delay and obstruction.\n  The Republicans may talk about bipartisanship--and when they do, we \nagree with every word they say--but words alone won't solve the \nMedicare problem today. Words won't support doctors. Words won't keep \nsenior citizens healthy or veterans or Active military and their \nfamilies getting proper health care. This critical problem calls not \nfor words but action, and the only action the Republicans have taken on \nthis Medicare issue is delay, delay, delay.\n  What can the American people conclude, except that the Republicans \nhave chosen the side of the insurance companies--the insurance \ncompanies--and the HMOs that are already making untold fortunes. Last \nyear, the so-called Medicare Advantage, they made $15 billion. How did \nthey make it? They made it at the expense of millions of senior \ncitizens who rely on Medicare to stay healthy.\n  This morning in the Senate, the Republican leader made a very \ninteresting point, and all should listen to the point he made. He said \nthat with more than 300 Members of the House of Representatives having \nvoted in favor of the legislation, the Senate should follow suit and \npass it immediately.\n  He argued that delaying or trying to amend a bill with such strong, \nbipartisan support from the House would serve no purpose but to delay \nits implementation. Senator McConnell was talking about the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act, FISA. But it appears that the Republican \nleader and his colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to have a \ndifferent set of rules for each piece of legislation. On FISA, having \nan overwhelming 300 votes meant don't delay it and vote for it here. It \nmeans something different on Medicare, when even more voted for it.\n  If the 300-plus vote in the House was good enough on the FISA bill, \nshouldn't the 355 votes for Medicare be good enough as well? I would \nhope so.\n  In their effort to block this critical legislation, the Republicans \nhave now concocted an argument that their opposition lies in their \ninability to offer amendments.\n  Think about that. Their opposition lies in the fact that they cannot \noffer amendments.\n  If only the majority would allow amendments, they say, this bill \nwould sail through passage. But the facts are clear. The Senate \nRepublican leadership was at the table when the process of the bill was \ndiscussed. The Republican leader agreed to the process about which we \nare now engaged. This process was agreed to unanimously by every single \nSenator, Democratic and Republican alike. We are here today because of \nthat unanimous consent agreement.\n  The process--to which, I repeat, all Republicans agreed and all \nDemocrats agreed--was that after a 60-vote margin on a motion to \nproceed, the bill would go directly to the President. There was ample \nopportunity to make the case for amendments prior to the unanimous \nconsent agreement.\n  I have gotten to know Max Baucus, of Montana, very well in my 26 \nyears in the Congress. I don't know of a Senator who has more of a \nreputation for bipartisanship than the Senator from Montana. He is \nknown as a person who works with Republicans. That is why we, on the \nDemocratic side, so admire him and support his chairmanship of the \nFinance Committee. But even Max Baucus has had enough. He has had \nenough. He knows he has tried. He knows this is stalling and that this \nis obstruction. Even Max Baucus--I believe the most bipartisan Member \nof the 100 Senators here--said that is enough.\n  Well, I made it clear a long time ago to Senator Baucus and others \nthat we would have considered any reasonable proposal. But that time \nhas long since passed. If Republicans were serious about passing this \nlegislation and amendments were the only thing standing in the way, \nthat would be one thing. They would have negotiated for amendments long \nbefore the 59-vote debacle of 2 weeks ago and certainly long before \nnow.\n  It could not be clearer that the amendment argument is the latest\n\n[[Page S6489]]\n\nthinly veiled excuse for opposing this legislation to provide for \ndoctors, senior citizens, and veterans.\n  These excuses for voting the wrong way aren't convincing anyone. \nDoctors, senior citizens, military families who rely on TRICARE, and \nall Americans see these Republican tactics for what they are. The \nRepublican call for a 31-day extension is another duck and dodge. Let's \nthink a minute. Where are we going to be in 31 days? Do you think there \nmight be conventions going on, where Obama is being nominated and \nMcCain is being nominated? We are out of session. That shows how \nfallacious and foolish a 31- or 30-day extension is. What would happen \nwhen that time runs out? We would be out of session. Well, of course, \nthat would lead to nothing but redtape and confusion for Medicare \nproviders during the next 30 days.\n  This legislation that is before this body is the very same that \npassed the House of Representatives, with all the Democrats and two-\nthirds of the Republicans voting for it, and it is supported not by a \nbunch of fringe groups. For example, AARP supports this. The physician \ncommunity, including the American Medical Association, and all the \nspecialist groups, such as the internists, orthopedic surgeons, and \nbrain surgeons, all support this legislation.\n  The pharmaceutical industry supports it. My friends say this is very \nbad for seniors as it relates to pharmaceuticals. Why in the world \nwould the pharmaceutical industry support what we are trying to do? \nHospitals, the American Hospital Association, patient groups such as \nthe American Heart Association, American Cancer Society, and hundreds \nand hundreds of other organizations support this.\n  Who opposes this bill? I will tell you who. Not hundreds of \norganizations, not AARP, not the American Cancer Society. Only two \norganizations: the insurance industry, that always has the best \ninterests of the American people in mind. They always look out for us, \nas you know. Who is the other special interest group that supports \ndoing nothing? The HMOs. How many of you remember that Jack Nicholson \nmovie, when they brought up HMOs and whole theaters booed all over \nAmerica when that provision came up?\n  The American people are booing the Republicans today because they \nhave sided with the insurance industry and the HMOs. We have sided with \nsenior citizens and with the veterans and their families. We know \nPresident Bush opposes this legislation and he threatened to veto it. \nSome Republicans said: Why pass a bill now when the President is going \nto veto it? Think about this. First of all, talk to my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle. We have a government that is founded by \nour Constitution as three separate and equal branches. We have to do \nthe right thing. That is how checks and balances work.\n  We should pass this bill because we owe it to senior citizens, \nveterans, the doctors who are working hard. I remind our Republican \nfriends that the House of Representatives has more than enough votes to \noverride the veto. There is no reason we cannot do the same in the \nSenate. I also remind our colleagues of what happened to the GI bill of \nrights, one of the landmark pieces of legislation to pass this country \nin the last 50 years. When Senator Webb and others introduced that \nlegislation to give something back to our troops in the form of \neducational opportunities to help them succeed when they return home, \nPresident Bush and many Republicans, including John McCain, declared \nthe bill was too generous. The President vowed he was going to veto the \nbill.\n  Surely then, some Republicans said that if the President opposes the \nbill, the Senate has no business debating and passing it. But we did \nour job. We did what was right for our troops and veterans, and we \npassed the GI bill overwhelmingly. To his credit, President Bush \nacquiesced.\n  I believe that if the Senate Republicans follow the lead of their \nHouse counterparts by voting for cloture today and sending the Medicare \ndoctors fix bill to the President's desk with an overwhelming \nbipartisan majority, President Bush will heed the calls of the House \nand the Senate, of doctors, of patients, of advocacy groups, and of our \ntroops.\n  I, personally, support this legislation on behalf of the 320,000 \nMedicare patients in Nevada and Dr. Edward Kingsley, a cofounder of the \nComprehensive Cancer Centers in Las Vegas, who said:\n\n       Some physicians are not going to be able to afford [to \n     continue taking Medicare patients]. . . . That's ultimately \n     what we all fear--these patients are not going to have access \n     to the care they need.\n\n  I support this legislation also on behalf of the approximately \n320,000 Nevadans who are Medicare patients.\n  I support this on behalf of the almost 9 million service men and \nwomen and families enrolled in TRICARE.\n  I support this legislation on behalf of the 44 million senior \ncitizens and the people with disabilities who rely on Medicare to stay \nhealthy and live their golden years to the fullest. That is what \nMedicare is about.\n  Since President Lyndon Baines Johnson signed the Medicare law more \nthan 40 years ago, the Congress and Senate has always worked to improve \nand maintain it. Congress has never seriously threatened Medicare or \nthe benefits our senior citizens have earned.\n  Before the July 4 recess, 59 Senators voted to move toward passage of \nthe doctors fix. All Democrats voted yes--every one of us. We were \njoined by a small group of exemplary Republicans who were willing to \nstand up to the insurance companies and HMOs and the veto threats of \nthe President.\n  We needed 60 votes to pass this. We came up one short. Today, we \nremain one Republican vote away from passing this bill. As I look \nacross the aisle to my Republican friends, the 60th vote is there.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture so we can send this \nlegislation to the President with an overwhelming bipartisan vote to \nreflect overwhelming support for it among the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of \nrule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, hereby move to bring to \na close debate on the motion to proceed to H.R. 6331, the Medicare \nImprovements for Patients and Providers Act.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This position is \nconsistent with all my previous votes on the matter, and with my \nconsidered judgment that this legislation is critical to protecting our \ncountry from future terrorist attacks.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I wish to say that we have had a \nvery dramatic moment here on the floor of the Senate, and I think there \nwasn't a person in the room or the gallery who wasn't thrilled to see \nSenator Kennedy back and looking so good, to do what he always does, \nand that is have the commitment and go the extra mile to keep that \ncommitment.\n  I wanted to say, though, that I don't think this was the Senate's \nfinest hour. I want us to all remember that in the Senate we have had a \nlong tradition of bringing up legislation, having amendments, and then \nvoting on legislation. That was not the case in the bill that was \nbefore us today. There was an attempt to pass a bill that had no \nability for amendments--not one.\n  I voted for the bill. It is not the way I would have written it, but \nI thought the risk was so great that the doctor fix in Medicare might \nactually lapse and the upheaval for our senior citizens and voters \nwould be a risk too great to take. But it didn't have to be that way. \nIt did not have to be a shutout of Republicans in order to ram \nsomething through, when 100 percent of us wanted to fix the doctors; \nwhen 100 percent of us had an agreement on 90 percent of the bill that \nwas before us. But there were legitimate differences.\n  Although I chose to make sure there would not be a cut in service to \nour seniors and our veterans, I don't think we had to do it that way. \nAny of my colleagues who didn't vote that way were voting conscience, \nand it was a tough vote for them as well. They had no input. Several of \nus who voted ``yes'' believed we could have changed the bill for the \nbetter, or at least if we had the opportunity for an amendment we would \nhave known that we had our say and the majority would have ruled, and \nthe result would have been the same.\n\n  I do not think this is the way we want to continue proceeding in the \nSenate, and though it was a great victory for the Democrats, and it was \ncertainly something that is going to save a cataclysmic event, I hope \nthat going forward we will not allow this kind of tension to be in this \nbody because it is not necessary. This is not the House. The House does \noperate that way. I do not want that to happen in the Senate.\n  It is my plea to the majority leader that he is the leader of the \nSenate, not just the leader of the Democrats. I hope going forward he \nwill give us the opportunity for bipartisan solutions. That is \nsomething I think all of us would feel better about.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. DOLE.

Madam President, yesterday, hundreds of people from all \nwalks of life and across the political spectrum traveled from near and \nfar to Hayes Barton Baptist Church in Raleigh, NC, to pay their final \nrespects to United States Senator Jesse Helms and to express \ncondolences to his beloved wife, Dot, and their family.\n  In the days since Jesse's July 4 passing, we have heard it said by \nmany: You knew where Jesse Helms stood. As my husband, Bob Dole said, \n``You didn't have to look under the table. You always knew where Jesse \nwas.''\n  Even those who disagreed with Jesse on an issue could respect the \nfact that he always stood tall and firm--for his convictions, his \nfaith, his family, his home State of North Carolina, and the United \nStates of America.\n  When I announced that I was running to succeed Senator Helms--and I \nhave always said ``succeed'' him because no one could replace him--I \npledged to continue his commitment to constituent service that was \nsecond-to-none. He helped thousands upon thousands of North \nCarolinians, Democrats, Republicans, and Independents alike. No problem \nwas too small or too great for Jesse and his staff to take on during \nhis 30 years of service for the people of our State and the Nation.\n  I can still hear my father saying, ``Jesse Helms is our watchdog. \nHe's a relentless watchdog for North Carolina and for America!'' And \nJesse often recalled that my mother was on the front row at his very \nfirst rally in Rowan County. Through the years, Jesse unfailingly \nphoned my mother on her May 22 birthday, and she lived to be just 4 \nmonths short of 103 years old. In fact, Jesse would often stay late at \nhis Senate office, making thoughtful phone calls and writing personal \nletters to constituents, colleagues, and friends.\n  For all his small gestures of kindness and his great acts of service, \nJesse Helms was not driven by self-serving motives. He did not seek \nrecognition for good deeds, or public acclaim for success. Jesse \nshunned the spotlight of the Sunday morning talk shows. The people he \nserved from North Carolina, he said, weren't watching, they, like he \nand Dot, were in church.\n  In 1997, Fred Barnes wrote a piece in the Weekly Standard that \nproclaimed: ``Next to Ronald Reagan, Jesse Helms is the most important \nconservative of the last 25 years . . . and the most inner-directed \nperson in Washington.'' And Fred adds, ``No conservative save Reagan \ncomes close to matching Helms' influence on American politics and \npolicy in the quarter century since he won a Senate seat in North \nCarolina.'' Of course many have said that President Reagan might never \nhave been elected at all without the help of Jesse Helms in the 1976 \nNorth Carolina primary--a win most pundits credit with rejuvenating the \nReagan campaign--and setting Ronald Reagan up to win the nomination 4 \nyears later.\n  On the national political stage, Jesse Helms was known by both fans \nand critics as a tough-as-nails Senator who\n\n[[Page S6491]]\n\nwas a relentless fighter for the causes he believed in. A master of the \nSenate rules, he would use them to call up votes that required his \ncolleagues to go on the record on difficult issues. He believed the \nAmerican people were entitled to know their representatives' positions. \nBut it was Jesse's kindness to Senate employees, his pride in his staff \nand his love for helping youngsters that made him absolutely legendary. \nHe would ask the Senate pages, ``Would you like to go down and have \nsome ice cream in the Senate Dining Room?'' Imagine the thrill for \nthese young people when the renowned chairman of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee took time out to sit down and talk with them over \nice cream.\n  A gentleman always, Jesse was known for his civility, among his \ncolleagues, the elevator operators, the Capitol Hill police, and all \nwho worked throughout the Capitol.\n  This past Monday evening, the Senate approved a resolution--\ncosponsored by all 100 Senators--honoring the life, career and great \nachievements of Jesse Alexander Helms, Jr. His public career certainly \nyielded many notable accomplishments as a leader in the fight against \ncommunism, as a staunch protector of U.S. sovereignty, as a reformer of \nthe United Nations, and as the first legislator of any nation to \naddress the United Nations Security Council.\n  That said, in keeping with Jesse's character and his own commitment \nto himself not to become a ``big-shot senator,'' he would probably like \nfor us to consider that his greatest accomplishments were in his roles \nas husband, father, grandfather, and friend.\n  My husband Bob and I are forever grateful that we were able to call \nJesse Helms a friend and colleague for so many years, and we extend our \ndeepest sympathies to the Helms family in this difficult time.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I rise to honor a friend, a mentor, and a \ncolleague I thought was a true statesman. I mourn the passing of one of \nNorth Carolina's greatest sons, Senator Jesse Helms. Senator Helms \npassed away last Friday, the Fourth of July, a very fitting day for \nSenator Helms to leave because of his deep belief in the independence \nof this country, in the liberties and freedoms we have.\n  It says a lot when you can simply mention a man's first name in his \nhome State and everyone knows exactly who you are talking about. Jesse, \nas most North Carolinians referred to him, was a true gentleman. He was \na good man who fought hard for what he believed in. Some core \nprinciples--free enterprise, traditional values, and a strong national \ndefense--guided his 30 years of service in this institution, the \nSenate. He never relented in his pursuit to defend his beliefs or to \nstand up for his constituents, and he wouldn't shy away from an \nunpopular idea. Jesse Helms was a fearless, honest man who was \nconsidered by all who actually knew him as a true patriot. Those he \nserved with on both sides of the aisle considered him one of the most \ninfluential Members to enter service in this body. You may not have \nagreed with him on every issue or any issue, and you may have been \ndisappointed by some of the positions he took, but he was respectful, a \nsoft-spoken man with an impeccable character and a professional and \npersonal integrity that could never, ever be challenged.\n  It speaks volumes that one of his closest friends among his \ncolleagues was the late Paul Wellstone of Minnesota. Both men were, to \nborrow from Senator Helms' description of Senator Wellstone, \n``courageous defenders of what they believed.''\n  Senator Helms harbored honored qualities that today too often are \ntaken for granted. If Jesse Helms looked you in the eye and gave you \nhis word, you could count on him to deliver. Jesse's word was better \nthan any written agreement or signed contract. He was a man you could \ntrust when you shook his hand.\n  Certainly, a contributor to these qualities was his humble origins in \nthe small town of Monroe, NC. I can speak for days attempting to \ndescribe the full impact that Senator Helms had on my home State of \nNorth Carolina and the impact he had on this great Nation. But Jesse \nHelms was more than a champion of one State or one nation. He was a \nglobal force and was always willing to stand up to oppressive \ngovernments, dictatorships, and ineffective international \norganizations. Some of the more controversial positions he voiced \nduring the course of his career might have clouded the mammoth change \nhis service to our Nation brought to the entire world.\n  As chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, he wasn't afraid to \nboldly speak his mind in the interest of defeating international \ntyranny, promoting U.S. sovereignty, and solidifying our Nation's place \nas the leader of the free world. His global influence is still \nnoticeable in many ways within the international arena.\n  Among his historic accomplishments were his tireless efforts toward \nthe much needed reforms of the United Nations. For a legislator, Jesse \nwielded a unique international prominence that was proven when he was \ninvited to be the first legislator from any nation to address the \nUnited Nations Security Council. Through his service, Jesse made our \ncountry safer. But his passion for protecting our national security, \nassuring our global distinction, and preserving our valuable individual \ndemocratic freedoms ran much deeper than his broad foreign policy work \nmight suggest.\n  One of Jesse's most impressive qualities was that he never lost sight \nof his role in Washington. He knew that as Senators, we are sent here \nto serve the constituents of our home States, not with the power of the \nposition. Jesse Helms focused his most unwavering efforts toward seeing \nevery single one of the constituents who contacted his office. It is a \npath I have endeavored to follow, and I am grateful to him for having \nprovided that model. If you were from North Carolina and you had a \nquestion you wanted answered by the Federal Government, Jesse would get \nyou the answer. It didn't matter what your political affiliation \nhappened to be or who you supported in an election. Jesse Helms \nmastered the art of constituent service. It wasn't unusual for him to \npick up the phone himself, call a civil servant at a Federal agency \nworking on a particular piece of case work that was lingering \nunresolved, and directly ask for an answer himself. That is the kind of \nman Senator Helms was. He wasn't interested in the rank-and-file \nbureaucratic hierarchy of the Federal Government. He wanted answers to \nquestions, questions that his hard- working, Federal taxpaying \nconstituents had. So in his gentle and respectful tone, he would simply \nask for an answer.\n  Constituents knew they could turn to their home State Senator to \nsolve their problems. Even if they disagreed with Jesse's politics, \nthey knew he would help them. It will surprise no one who reads his \nmemoirs that he dedicates an entire chapter to constituent service. I \nread it as a tribute to those who worked for Senator Helms on behalf of \nNorth Carolina for so many years. The stories about his focus on \nconstituent service sound almost legendary. I am sure many of my \ncolleagues, and no doubt a number of North Carolinians, have heard the \none about two liberals chatting about the problem one of them was \nhaving in getting a Federal agency to respond to a question of one kind \nor another. It could have been about a problem with a Social Security \ncheck or a disability payment or any of the hundred other things that \ncongressional offices deal with on behalf of their constituents on a \ndaily basis.\n  One was complaining to the other that they were at the end of their \nrope. They are tired of everything, including their congressional \nrepresentative. The other one listened intently, nodding in sympathy \nwith the plight of their friend. When the friend was done talking, the \nother thought for a moment and finally said: I hate to say it, but it \nis time for you to call Jesse.\n  When it came to constituent service, ``Senator No,'' as he was often \nreferred to by his critics, was more often than not actually ``Senator \nYes.''\n  John Wooden, the great basketball coach, once said:\n\n       You can't live a perfect day without doing something for \n     someone who will never be able to repay you.\n\n  Jesse Helms lived his days in the Senate by that creed.\n  Senator Helms proved that you do not need to win by a landslide to \nmake policy or to make a difference. As he might put it, he campaigned \nand legislated based upon his principles rather than his preferences. \nThose principles\n\n[[Page S6492]]\n\nand his constituents guided his public service. He was successful in \nhis work, however, because of his willingness to take a stand.\n  Much has been made, of course, about Jesse Helms's stands against \nprograms and spending that he felt were misguided or were not a proper \nresponsibility of the Federal Government. Those stands had a tendency \nto be misunderstood. If you did not know where Senator Helms stood on \nan issue, it was probably because you did not ask.\n  Madam President, today I thank Jesse Helms. I thank Senator Helms for \nhis service, for his leadership, for the fact that he was willing to \ntake a stand, a stand that was not popular every time, a stand that he \nbelieved was right, not because of any political influence but because \nof what he understood this job to be about.\n  Jesse Helms today enters a house that I think he looked forward to \nbeing in. It is not the House of Congress. But truly, Jesse Helms was \ngreeted with the sound of angels and the words ``good job.''\n  Today, our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Dot and their \nentire family. His Senate colleagues miss him. But the Senate is a much \nbetter institution today for the 30 years of service of Senator Jesse \nAlexander Helms, Jr.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, back in the 1960s, Jesse Helms was the \ncommentator for WRAL radio in North Carolina, and on his radio program, \nhe offered me support and comfort for some controversial views which I \nheld at the time.\n  Although Helms had worked as a staffer for two different Senators, as \nfar as I knew, Jesse Helms and I had never met. But there he was, in \nRaleigh, NC, in a series of radio commentaries, defending my right to \ntake positions based on my personal convictions and values. He said I \nwas a Senator whose ``greatest strength'' was my ``dedicated \nindependence of thought and action.'' I was a Senator who was ``neither \neasily frightened nor intimidated.'' A Senator who always stood ``up \nfor what he regards as important.''\n  I appreciated his support during those trying times. I never forgot \nit.\n  Therefore, when Jesse Helms was elected to the Senate in 1972, it \nseemed that we were already well acquainted. We became friends as we \ncame to know each other, and to respect each other.\n  Jesse Helms was a courtly Southern gentleman of the first order, a \nproduct of the South and his beloved North Carolina, which happens to \nbe my native State. Jesse Helms was also a deeply religious man of \nintegrity, honesty, and patriotism.\n  He believed in the Constitution. He believed in the Senate as an \ninstitution and in its premier place in our government. Senator Helms \nwas one of those rare Senators who was never looking for another \noffice. He wanted to be a Senator. He was grateful to be able to serve \nthe people of North Carolina and the United States in this Chamber.\n  And he certainly made his presence felt here in the U.S. Senate. \nDuring his years in the Senate, he served as chairman of the Senate \nAgricultural Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n  More than once, Senator Helms was the singular ``no'' vote on a \nparticular matter, i.e, the Frank Carlucci nomination as Secretary of \nDefense, November 20, 1987, 91-1: Elementary and Secondary Education \nImprovement Act of 1987, December 1, 1987, 97-1, S. 373. He proudly \nwore his well earned title of ``Senator No.''\n  No matter what the press said, no matter what the pundits were \nsaying, no matter what even his colleagues were saying, he never \nwavered in his convictions. The ``paramount thing'' for political \nleaders, Senator Helms once explained, ``is whether a man believes in \n[his] principles . . . and whether he is willing to stand up for them, \nwin or lose.''\n  Consequently, we always knew where Senator Helms stood. Take an \nissue--abortion, prayer in school, presidential nominations, reducing \nthe deficit, taxes, government waste, the future of this country--if \nyou did not already know where he stood, he was always ready to tell \nyou.\n  Some of his positions were unpopular. Some of them seemed extreme and \ndoomed from the start.\n  But, his differences with his Senate colleagues were always \npolitical, not personal. They were differences of opinions, not of \nheart.\n  Madam President, I express my most heartfelt condolences to the \nfamily and friends of this extraordinary Senator.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I wish to pay tribute to the memory \nof our former colleague, Senator Jesse Helms, who passed away, \nfittingly on Independence Day, a day which meant so much to him.\n  A great deal has been written and said about Senator Helms. He was a \nman who provoked strong feelings--both pro and con--and he enjoyed \nbeing the subject of spirited discussions.\n  It is well known and well told that Senator Helms could be, and often \nwas, a tough opponent but also could be and often was an invaluable \nally.\n  He was a man of strongly held, deeply held views and was never \nhesitant to share those views with the rest of the Senate.\n  But it is less well known that Jesse Helms was a kind and considerate \ncolleague. Fifteen years ago, he welcomed a new Member from Texas into \nthe Senate. I always appreciated his advice and his love of the Senate \nas an institution.\n  Jesse Helms began as an editor at a newspaper in North Carolina and \nthen went to a television station in Raleigh. It was the notoriety \nwhich he gained from being a TV commentator which led him to the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Today we have many former colleagues who started in the U.S. Senate \nand are now TV commentators. It was typical of Jesse to do it the \nopposite way.\n  He once said of his career in the Senate, ``I would like to be \nremembered as a fella who did the best he could and didn't back down \nwhen he thought he was right.''\n  Jesse Helms was a man who had the courage to stand against the often \ntransient winds of political convenience. He wasn't always right. He \nwas right a good part of the time, but he was always Jesse.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, everyone in this Chamber is saddened by \nthe loss of our former colleague from North Carolina, Jesse Helms. Many \nof us served with him, and know how dedicated a public servant he was. \nI didn't always agree with him; in fact, we disagreed much of the time. \nBut one of the many wonderful things about working in the Senate is \nfinding ways to work together with colleagues who have very different \nbeliefs and goals for the good of the country.\n  Senator Helms and I shared a commitment to ensuring that the U.S. \nonly entered into trade agreements that are fair to the hard-working \nmen and women of this country. I appreciated his commitment to that \nissue, and I was pleased to work with him to support fair trade.\n  I also served with Senator Helms as a member of the Senate's Foreign \nRelations Committee. He served as chairman for many years, and during \nthat time we also found common ground on the issue of most favored \nnation, MFN, status for China. Senator Helms and I worked together in \nopposition to granting MFN status to a country with such gross human \nrights violations. Together, we led the fight against MFN because it \nignored the appalling human rights abuses in China, and abdicated the \nSenate's responsibility to exert pressure on the Chinese government to \nimprove its record on human rights.\n  In the wake of Senator Helms' passing, people will remember him for \nthe many different things he accomplished in his lifetime. I add these \nmemories to those remembrances of Senator Helms, who led such a full \nlife inside and outside of public service. My thoughts are with his \nfamily, and the people of North Carolina he served with such dedication \nfor 30 years.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I would like to pay tribute to a friend \nand great American Senator who, fittingly, left us on the Fourth of \nJuly--the same day as two of our Nation's Founders: Thomas Jefferson \nand John Adams--at the age of 86.\n  In terms of a U.S. Senator, Jesse Helms was a heavyweight. Jesse \nHelms was relentless in his fight to defend the ideals that embody \nAmerica. And no matter what policy Jesse Helms was defending during a \ndebate, everyone could agree on one thing: you always knew where he \nstood and that he was a man of his word. A devoted and outspoken \nconservative, his principles of\n\n[[Page S6493]]\n\nsmall government and individual freedom served as an international \nmicrophone for American creed during the Cold War and beyond.\n  While Jesse's political life was open to everyone, I had the distinct \nhonor of knowing him on a personal level. In 1998, after serving in the \nU.S. House of Representatives for over a decade, I came to the Senate \nand was quickly greeted by Senator Helms--apparently Senator Helms knew \na conservative when he saw one. As someone who shared many of the same \nphilosophical views as Jesse Helms, we would often discuss contentious \nissues that arose before the Senate. During these moments I realized \nthat, behind his hard public image, Jesse Helms was one of the most \ncompassionate and sincere men I had ever met. This affectionate and \nfriendly attitude brought out the southern gentleman whom we all loved.\n  I will miss Senator Helms's political leadership, but I am happy his \nimpact on our country lives on. Mary and I send our thoughts and \nprayers to his wife Dot and their family as they mourn for their loss \nand remember an extraordinary life.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schumer). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/09/senate-section/article/S6493-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6493]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 2731\n\n  Mr. REID.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, there is, and I would like to make a brief \nstatement. The majority leader's long unanimous consent agreement \npertains to an important bill that the President would like to get \npassed through this body.\n  I think there is strong support for a bill along these lines. The \nconsent itself, if one listened carefully, contains quite a few \nrestrictions on the number of amendments, the time for debate, and so \nforth.\n  Since there are ongoing negotiations--I am personally involved in \nsome of them--with regard to provisions of the legislation, the \nunanimous consent agreement is too restrictive at this time. I would \nhope that we could work out an agreeable substance of the provisions as \nwell as an agreeable procedure at a subsequent time.\n  In fact, I think if we can reach an agreement on the substance, the \nprocedure will be very easy to work out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken today to my staff, and they \nhave been in touch with Senator Biden's staff. Senator Biden also \nthinks that something can be worked out.\n  We have been hearing for a long time that is the problem. In \nconversations in the past with the President's people, this is \nimportant to him. It is an important piece of legislation. I would hope \nthat Senator Kyl and others, working with Senators Lugar and Biden, can \nget an agreement worked out.\n  This is a bill that should have wide-ranging support. I am going to \nfile cloture, I say to my friend, so that we can have a cloture vote on \nthis on Friday. You might want to check with your people and see if we \ncould perhaps have it tomorrow. But that is a decision that people can \nreach. If cloture is invoked, we will see if we can work out a \nprocedure for working with the amendments. Hopefully, we can do that.\n  In fact, to be candid, my staff said Senator Biden wants to hold this \noff for a couple more days. I think we are going to have to go ahead \nand try to move with this. So maybe with what Senator Biden and you \nhave said, maybe if we take a look at this either tomorrow or Friday--\nthat is, the motion to proceed--perhaps we can work something out to \nhave some way of moving forward.\n  I hope so, otherwise I would hope this will not go in the barrel of \nthings that we cannot do this year. That would be a shame. This is a \ncloture petition. I could have gotten signatures on both sides of the \naisle. So I appreciate the manner in which my friend has spoken. I hope \nthis is something we can work out.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/09/senate-section/article/S6493-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6493-S6494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J.

I actually thank the \ndistinguished Senator from New York for the help he gave me on the tax \ncredit on this bill.\n  This bill is not perfect, but it certainly improves tremendously the \nclimate in the United States for housing. For a second I want to try \nand impress upon my colleagues how important this issue is and dispel \nsome of the myths that have been put out there about this issue. First, \nunless we pass GSE reform, which means Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, \nthere is going to be little, if any, liquidity in the conventional \nmortgage market. This legislation is a good reform piece for Fannie and \nFreddie. It also provides provisions that will allow for forward \ncommitments so that mortgage companies can make mortgages and fund them \nthrough Fannie and Freddie and get housing moving in the marketplace.\n  Second, it changes the loan limits on conventional and conventional \njumbo loans to levels that are reflective of the values of housing.\n  Third, it provides for a housing tax credit, something I was proud to \nbe a part of. I proved in 1974, the last time we had a crisis like \nthis, that it is the one single thing we can do as a catalytic agent to \ndrive buyers back to the housing market. So the solution is not a \nbailout but a stimulus to get buyers in there buying the inventory that \nwas built over the last 12 months.\n  Fourth, there is a significant reform of FHA. Within that provision \nthere is the creation of moneys for the refinance of troubled subprime \nloans. There has been a lot of misinformation in the news media and \nmisinformation in speeches on this floor, frankly, on whether this is a \nbailout or whether it is a good thing to do.\n  For a second I want to explain why it is absolutely not a bailout and \nwhy it is absolutely the right thing to do. Any loan that is \nrefinanced, any subprime loan in trouble that is refinanced has to meet \nthe following qualification: Its equity has to be negative, meaning the \nhouse is worth less than what is owed against it; No. 2, the lender who \nholds the loan against that house has to agree to take the discount or \ntake the hit on whatever the differential is in that negative value; \nNo. 3, FHA will underwrite the new loan to refinance out the discounted \nbalance of the loan to the lender, provided the individual is somebody \nwho can qualify to amortize the loan. It forces the lender to take the \nhit which they are going to take eventually in a foreclosure, and it \nprevents the foreclosure. For the person in trouble, it gives them a \nchance to pay back over time and get their credit established and \nimprove themselves and build equity in the house.\n  Most importantly, it benefits the next-door neighbor. I have heard so \nmany people say we should not be helping somebody in trouble on a \nsubprime loan. What do we say to the people who are making their \npayments and are not in trouble? The answer is, in most neighborhoods \ntoday where there is a foreclosure, values are going down, not up. You \nhave John Q. Public who has made the monthly payments, has good credit. \nThe house next door to him is foreclosed on. The grass grows. The \nlender sells at a deep discount. What happens, his equity is gone or is \ngreatly reduced.\n  The combination of the housing stimulus in terms of the tax credit, \ncombined with the ability to refinance out of the difficult subprime \nloan and the requirement that the lender take the deep discount they \nare going to ultimately have to recognize anyway, is a formula for \nrebuilding the housing market.\n  I know everybody here has a difficulty. There was one amendment--we \nwill not be allowed any amendments--that I was very interested in \noffering in terms of the tax package. But I know the tree is filled up. \nThere will be a managers' amendment. We will not be able to get to it. \nBut you don't get everything you want in the Senate.\n  One thing we have to do is to improve the plight of the American \npeople economically. There are two things overriding the average \nAmerican and two things only: One is what they are paying at the pump \nfor gasoline and, secondly, is the declining value of equity in their \nhouse. With passage of this bill, we can show hope for the housing \nmarket. We may stimulate the buying public to come back and solve it \nwith good marketplace-based solutions rather than subsidies or a \nbailout and, most importantly, return to a more healthy mortgage market \nand a more disciplined mortgage market and a better underwritten \nmortgage market. Then secondly and most importantly, we can change \nattitudes. The attitudes of the buying public are pretty negative right \nnow because the lenders can't make a loan. House values are going down. \nThey want to buy, but they want to buy at the bottom. We have to send a \nsignal that the lenders are back in business making loans. Freddie Mac \nand Fannie Mae are back in business in terms of securitizing mortgage \nmoney and putting liquidity into the market, and values are \nstabilizing. So for whatever differences some Members have over the \nbill they would like to have versus the bill we do have, we should be \nreminded that every day we wait is a protraction of the current \neconomic difficulty in the housing market. We cannot afford to leave \nthis week without agreeing to the motion tomorrow and sending it to the \nHouse so the House, when they come back next week, can pass the \nlegislation and the President can sign it and, by the middle to the end \nof July, the mortgage market, the housing market, and the buying \npublic's attitude will be turned around. By doing that, we can \nhopefully have a light at the end of the tunnel that is not a \nlocomotive but, rather, is a prosperous, healthy housing market and a \ndisciplined, well capitalized, and liquid mortgage market.\n  It is critical that we pass this legislation. I urge my fellow \nSenators to come to the floor, vote for the motion, and then let us get \nit to the House and encourage House Members to do precisely the same \nthing. It is getting too late. If we wait too long, it won't matter \nwhat we do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/09/senate-section/article/S6494-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

CON. RES. 70\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, section 221(f) of S. Con. Res. 70, the \n2009 budget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee to revise the allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate \nlevels in the resolution for legislation providing economic relief for \nAmerican families, including reauthorizing the Temporary Assistance for \nNeedy Families program. In addition, section 227 authorizes the \nchairman of the Senate Budget Committee to revise the allocations, \naggregates, and other appropriate levels in the resolution for \nlegislation making improvements in health care, including within \nMedicare (subsection\n\n[[Page S6495]]\n\n(b)), Medicaid (subsection (e)), and other health areas (subsection \n(f)). The revisions are contingent on certain conditions being met, \nincluding that such legislation not worsen the deficit over the period \nof the total of fiscal years 2008 through 2013 or the period of the \ntotal of fiscal years 2008 through 2018.\n  I find that H.R. 6331, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and \nProviders Act of 2008, satisfies the conditions of the reserve funds to \nprovide economic relief for American families and improve America's \nhealth. Therefore, pursuant to sections 221(f) and 227, I am adjusting \nthe aggregates in the 2009 budget resolution, as well as the allocation \nprovided to the Senate Finance Committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following revisions to S. Con. Res. \n70 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009-S.

Madam President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share \nwith me how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they \nresponded by the hundreds. The stories, numbering over 1,000, are \nheartbreaking and touching. To respect their efforts, I am submitting \nevery e-mail sent to me through energy_prices@crapo .senate.gov to the \nCongressional Record. This is not an issue that will be easily \nresolved, but it is one that deserves immediate and serious attention, \nand Idahoans deserve to be heard. Their stories not only detail their \nstruggles to meet everyday expenses, but also have suggestions and \nrecommendations as to what Congress can do now to tackle this problem \nand find solutions that last beyond today. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave today's letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Senator Crapo, Thank you so much for all you are doing for \n     the citizens in Idaho. Most of all, thank you for your \n     assistance with my disability issues. I would like to share \n     my story. I have been a Registered Nurse for 28 years working \n     fulltime and overtime. In 2005, I developed some heart \n     issues, but, at that time, was able to return to work. In \n     August 2007, the heart condition deteriorated to the point I \n     can now no longer work. I have been denied disability twice \n     thus far. My physician has wanted me to attend cardiac \n     rehabilitation, which we do not have available in Lewiston or \n     Clarkston. The nearest is Moscow, Idaho, 30 miles away. Due \n     to being turned down on disability and the rising cost of \n     gasoline, I can no longer afford to drive to Moscow for the \n     cardiac rehabilitation I need.\n       Thank you again. You truly seem to care more about your \n     constituents than any other legislator I have ever \n     encountered. I will be campaigning very strongly for you when \n     the time comes.\n     Joy, Lewiston.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator, fuel is a big issue here in Idaho. As a lifelong \n     Republican, I am wondering why, after six years with a \n     Republican President, Senate and House, nothing was done \n     then. What we are seeing now is a result from a lack of \n     activity back then. I watched Bill Gates and the oil company \n     execs totally dominate our Congressional folks. You have \n     authorized spending billions for Iraq, but did nothing to \n     promote hydrogen fuel cell development here. I think you are \n     pandering to the oil companies. It is said that fuel for the \n     hydrogen vehicles would be too hard to dispense. Why not use \n     it for schools where the vehicles could be fueled at the home \n     base? We burn literally hundreds of thousands of gallons of \n     fuel a year just in our local school districts. When you \n     decide to act for the ``real'' future, then we will support \n     you. At this house, Obama is looking better and better every \n     day. Obama has earned his way this far. McCain has no answers \n     other than a few pennies off the gas tax. Get real, Senator.\n     Charlie, Caldwell.\n                                  ____\n\n       You asked what these fuel prices are doing to us. I live on \n     a fixed income of $650.00 a month, pay $450 a month just for \n     rent. So guess what? By the time you buy food, it is gone and \n     I cannot afford to drive 80 miles a day and make $7.00 an \n     hour. I would spend it all just for gas, but I'm sure \n     everybody else is in the same boat. But thanks for listening \n     to an old man moan. I used to like to go fishing sometimes, \n     but not this year, I guess. Thanks again.\n     Marcellus, Rupert.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator Crapo, I would love to share my story with you. I \n     have a small business that takes me out of state a lot. I \n     work on X-ray machines in hospitals around the country. It \n     has gotten to where most hospitals cannot afford to replace \n     their equipment, and my prices are going up due to travel. \n     The higher my prices go, the less work I get due to short \n     budgets, and so on. It has gotten to the point that I only \n     have one job scheduled so far this year. I do not know how I \n     am going to stay in business much longer.\n       I cannot understand how Congress can sit on their butts and \n     say we cannot pump our own oil due to environmental concerns \n     while China pumps 50 miles off of our cost. It is time we put \n     the few liberals in their place and start taking care of our \n     own before we have our own revolution, and the people take \n     back our country from the do nothing government. I hope you \n     act fast.\n     Todd.\n                                  ____\n\n       Mike, Thank you for the opportunity to share my views on \n     the energy crises.\n       First of all, I think the ethanol program is the biggest \n     boondoggle the United States has ever supported. It takes \n     almost as much energy to produce a gallon of ethanol as the \n     gallon gives back. It cost more per gallon than gasoline, and \n     gives far fewer miles per gallon than gasoline. It takes the \n     food away from the livestock and poultry that we need to eat, \n     or at least makes the feed for them more expensive. Are we \n     not going backwards here?\n       I fully support nuclear energy. It is the only way to go \n     for dependable electrical power generation. Unlike coal and \n     natural gas, there is no fuel to mine or drill for, no \n     transportation cost for that fuel and no air pollution \n     resulting from burning that fuel.\n       Wind power electrical generation is a fine resource to \n     pursue. It is very valuable in reducing the electrical load \n     on the base loaded electrical generators. The more we can \n     reduce the load on the base generators, the more energy we \n     save.\n       We also need to expand our domestic oil production. We need \n     to drill and get into production, ANWR in northeast Alaska. \n     We need to get this done before Prudoe Bay is depleted so we \n     can utilize the existing Trans-Alaska pipeline. If I recall \n     correctly, that pipeline and all related equipment has to be \n     removed once it becomes inactive.\n       While on the subject of Alaska, I understand that some of \n     the contention of the Iraqi people is how to divide up their \n     oil wealth. How about looking at the system the\n\n[[Page S6496]]\n\n     state of Alaska uses to divide up their oil wealth? Every \n     man, women and child receives a check for the same amount as \n     everyone else. The oil fund is inflation-proofed before the \n     amount of the checks is determined. Why do people think they \n     always need to reinvent the wheel? Alaska's system is fair, \n     simple and it works.\n       With the profits the oil companies are reporting, I see no \n     need for tax credits for any oil company. If they cannot get \n     done what they need to do with those kinds of profits, the \n     tax credits are not going to make the difference. I really \n     think it is time for the oil companies to be subject to a \n     pricing commission, like the electrical utilities are, only \n     on the federal level. Other commodity producers that produce \n     things that the people of the United States have to have are \n     subject to pricing commissions i.e. Public Utilities \n     Commissions, why not the oil companies? The whole United \n     States would grind to halt and a lot of our population would \n     freeze to death in the winter without oil. I would say that \n     constitutes a need for a product that should be subject to a \n     pricing commission.\n     Russ, Payette.\n                                  ____\n\n       On a fixed income and maybe only a few years to live due to \n     chronic asthma and advancing COPD, it is already making it \n     hard--doctor appointments, and to go see and help my 93-year-\n     old mother. I am 65 and have maybe 2 more years to live. What \n     kind of quality of life can I expect with the price of gas \n     going up so fast that before you can finish filling your car \n     the station attendants are out changing the price of gas? \n     This has happened twice in the last month. I have a 10-gallon \n     tank and get 35 miles to the gallon on a 1988 Toyota Corolla. \n     It takes about three tanks a month for all the running I have \n     to do. It used to cost me $55.00 a month to fill car; now it \n     cost $123.00 a month. If gas goes up to $7.00 a gallon, it \n     will cost $210.00 a month just for gas. What do I do? Do I \n     not eat so I can go to doctor's appointments or do I eat and \n     die sooner because I cannot afford to put gas in my car? \n     Thousands of people are in the same boat as I am--we either \n     forget about health concerns or eating. I knew one lady a few \n     miles from where I live that was shop lifting dog food and \n     eating it just to survive. She has died now, but there is \n     going to be a lot more of this going on. It is a shame that \n     the Congress has not got off their butts and allowed more \n     domestic drilling for oil in our country. We know where the \n     oil is; let us get to drilling and tell the oil cartels to \n     stuff it where the sun does not shine. Something else I do \n     not understand is, the other day we drove to Salt Lake City \n     and the refineries were not even working, there was no steam \n     or smoke coming from the cracking towers. Come on--get this \n     mess worked out. We are going to start dropping like sprayed \n     flies out here if Congress does not do something.\n     Russell, Heyburn.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator Crapo, A year ago I was spending around $85 a month \n     for fuel; now my monthly costs are twice that! Thirty percent \n     of the current cost for oil is due to speculation in the \n     unregulated Wall Street venue; the Enron Loophole from 2001 \n     allows this!! First, fix this problem! Next, higher fuel \n     mileage per gallon in a shorter period of time needs to be \n     mandated!! Third, a major emphasis on alternative renewable \n     fuels; not more drilling in our country or off shore for oil \n     and gas; including blowing the tops off of mountains for \n     coal!! In addition, no more nuclear reactors as they use too \n     much water and generate radioactive waste that lasts for \n     hundreds of years!! We can do this and most Idahoans and \n     Americans are demanding such a plan from our government \n     leadership! Brazil did it in five years and are we any less \n     capable than they are? I think not! You Republicans, \n     especially, are under too much influence by the oil, gas \n     and coal companies to continue doing business as usual!! \n     We need truly green changes in our country, not more of \n     the same.\n     Joy, Hayden.\n                                  ____\n\n       I, like most Americans, have been affected by the rising \n     fuel prices. My budget cannot sustain the $60 per tank cost \n     to fill my car with gas. Instead of sitting back and \n     complaining about high gas prices, I have chosen to find \n     alternate forms of transportation whenever possible. I ride \n     my bicycle to work every day, and use the public \n     transportation and carpooling whenever possible for longer \n     trips. When I am conscious of my transportation choices, I \n     can make a tank of gas last a month.\n       Our country needs to step up and take responsibility for \n     our energy choices. We need to become less dependent on \n     foreign oil, yes; but we need to do so by changing the root \n     of the problem instead of implementing a temporary band-aid \n     on our problems by drilling for oil in our country's pristine \n     and sensitive environmental areas. We need to concentrate our \n     resources on developing cleaner energy rather than looking \n     for ways to sustain our irresponsible use of energy. Better \n     public transportation options, fuel conservation incentives, \n     and increased research and investment in cleaner energy are \n     the sustainable answers. Drilling in ANWR is not. The change \n     will be a bit painful in the short term, but we need to have \n     the foresight as a country to understand that long term \n     solutions are the right ones.\n       Sincerely,\n     Ross.\n                                  ____\n\n       My son-in-law works for a large gas station corporation, \n     routing trucks to different stations and flies almost weekly \n     to Houston and Atlanta and says THERE IS NO GAS SHORTAGE, \n     just manipulation. Please tell people the truth about the oil \n     and gas reserves we could have available (example: South \n     Dakota, etc.). Our story personally: We live in a rural area, \n     13 miles from the nearest town and 2 hours from a city big \n     enough to purchase from larger retailers. Our fuel cost is \n     $35.00 to go to WalMart, round trip! We recently purchased an \n     economy car (that we couldn't really afford), and now the \n     trip will cost around $20. This is if fuel stays at $4. Our \n     daughter has Prader-Willi Syndrome, and we travel 2-4-8 hours \n     one way for medical appointments about eight times a year. We \n     do not feel the ten cents a mile from Medicaid is worth the \n     hassle for reimbursement. We are drowning in fuel extortion \n     costs. Must we be forced to move from a rural setting to the \n     city? Please help.\n     Margaret.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator Crapo, I want to thank you for taking the \n     initiative on helping Idahoans with the increasing energy \n     costs. I am fortunate enough to only have a two-mile commute \n     to and from work, but I have still noticed a considerable \n     change in the fuel cost's impact on my finances.\n       I was recently in Salt Lake City where I stopped at a gas \n     station to fill up. I noticed a different-looking pump there \n     which said ``natural gas'' on it. I had never seen such an \n     option at a fueling station before. Just as I was in awe at \n     the different option, a gentleman drove up in a vehicle and \n     began filling up with this natural gas pump. I struck up a \n     conversation with this man and discovered that natural gas is \n     a growing phenomenon in vehicles there in the Salt Lake City \n     area. The car prices are very similar to those of petroleum \n     fueled vehicles, but the cost of natural gas was about 63 \n     cents per gallon versus the $4 I was paying. This experience, \n     of course, made me consider other fueling options.\n       I know that there are many alternatives to using gasoline \n     to power vehicles such as natural gas, electric, water, and \n     others. Granted, some of these options are not feasible to \n     implement in Idaho. Is it possible to make natural gas an \n     option in this area? I do not know if it is legislation that \n     drives such changes, but I, for one, am ready for some \n     feasible alternatives. I am considering getting a Segue or a \n     GEM (global electric motorcar) as an alternative to relying \n     upon gas powered vehicles. I would appreciate any help in \n     this area, or other incentives to alternative power options \n     for the home. Thank you again for your help on our behalf. \n     Let me know if I can help in any other way.\n     Seth.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo: Regarding energy prices. We drive less, \n     plan our trips to town with lists, etc. so we know exactly \n     where we are going and in what order to make our trips more \n     efficient. We will not be taking a vacation this year. We \n     will be forced to sell (or give away) our livestock because \n     we cannot afford to pay the price of hay to sustain them over \n     the winter. We will have to buy a different furnace as our \n     current one is oil, or turn down the heat to 55 degrees most \n     of the winter and bundle up (which is what we did last \n     winter).\n       I do not like government intervention, but some tax credits \n     for alternative energy sources would be nice--credits for \n     wind power, solar power; both of which are in plentiful \n     supply in Idaho. The state government could do a lot to \n     encourage alternative energy sources as well. We all agree \n     that we need to use alternatives, but no one wants a wind \n     generator in their neighborhood. What is wrong with us? Can \n     we not see the future benefits versus our temporary eye \n     appeal?\n       Also, the government could give some large tax incentives \n     to encourage recycling of plastics, which to my \n     understanding, use over twice the percentage of our oil \n     imports than the manufacture of gasoline. In Texas, the Texas \n     Disposal Company has a recycling center set up in a lot next \n     to the local post office in Alpine (population 6,500) every \n     Saturday. They take all kinds of newspaper, magazines, junk \n     mail, plastics, metal cans, etc. There was even a man who \n     brought his pickup truck down every week to collect glass for \n     recycling. The cost of transporting all of this recycling in \n     Texas would be greater than in Idaho, so why cannot we do \n     that here? Or nationwide?\n       I noticed in Costco the last few weeks that each swimsuit \n     is set up on these clear plastic molded sheets, which are \n     then stacked one on top of the other. We are overusing \n     plastic! All of this ends up as waste in our landfills. \n     Encouraging a national recycling program would do many \n     positive things, less oil imports would be the biggest and \n     then less waste in our landfills, a huge concern as well.\n       Seems to me that recycling and a greater usage of \n     alternative energy sources is something that Republicans and \n     Democrats, conservatives and liberals could and should agree \n     upon.\n       Sincerely,\n     Lisa.\n                                  ____\n\n       I have four children, and my husband and I have good-paying \n     jobs, probably better than most. We have a low debt load, \n     have stayed away from credit cards and buy things when we \n     have the money. We have never had a vacation in the 24 years \n     that we've been married because we had other places that \n     money needed to go.\n\n[[Page S6497]]\n\n       Now, even though we have stayed out of debt and only have \n     $3,000.00 left to pay on our car, we are afraid. Food prices \n     have risen so that last year, my family of six was eating and \n     maintaining a household on $300.00 per week, and that \n     included gas for the drive my husband has to work. That \n     budget has now increased to $500.00 per week.\n       My son, a second-year electrical engineering student at \n     ISU, may not be able to go back to college this year because \n     the gas to get there is just too much on top of the increased \n     cost of tuition. My daughter, a senior this year, cannot get \n     a job because the cost of driving to work would eat up her \n     minimum wage paycheck.\n       Those of us who work hard, stay out of debt and invest our \n     money in the American way of life are now told to move our \n     money away from U.S. investments and go elsewhere where the \n     economy is more stable, but what does that say about the \n     country that we live in? We do not feel secure, we do not \n     feel safe and we do not feel any comfort in the Senate, \n     Congress or the Presidency. This is summer; when the demand \n     for fuel goes up in the winter and we do not have enough \n     money to pay for gas to go to work, let alone food for our \n     children to eat, how are we going to keep warm or live? This \n     winter, I think this country is going to see many people \n     pushed to the brink of chaos because there is no other \n     choice. Oil needs to be taken off the speculation market. \n     This doesn't just affect our way of life here in the U.S.; it \n     is also affecting world markets and food prices around the \n     globe.\n     D.S., Rigby.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/09/senate-section/article/S6497-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6497-S6498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   JOINT ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN VENTURE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the New York Times recently published an \narticle entitled ``Web Start-up a Joint Israeli-Palestinian Venture'' \nand, as the title suggests, it is a story about a group of Israeli and \nPalestinian entrepreneurs that have joined forces to start an internet \nbusiness venture. Mr. President, I will ask to have the New York Times \narticle printed in the Record. What is impressive about this story is \nthat technology, in the form of Internet-based video teleconferencing, \nhas been able to jump boundaries to allow people to work together while \napart by enabling this business, G.ho.st, to use the Internet to \ncomplete many of the day-to-day tasks that ordinarily require actual \nface-to-face contact. More importantly, this business venture is yet \nanother example of the good will that exists on both sides of the \nIsraeli-Palestinian divide.\n  In March 2005, I had the opportunity to travel with six Michiganders, \nthree Palestinian-Americans and three Jewish-Americans, to Israel and \nthe Palestinian territories to study the possibility of joint Israeli-\nPalestinian business ventures. During this visit, we met with \nentrepreneurs active in a full range of industries, from agriculture to \ntextiles to software development to manufacturing. While these joint \nbusiness ventures cannot make peace, they do help foster good will, and \nthey demonstrate the potential for effective, economic coexistence if a \nfinal peace agreement can be reached.\n  More recently, during a trip to Israel to present the Senate \nresolution commemorating the 60th anniversary of the State of Israel, I \nlearned of what I hope will be a major joint economic venture. During \nmy meeting with President Shimon Peres, I learned about the Valley of \nPeace Initiative, a large-scale undertaking to construct a tourism \ncorridor. The Valley of Peace is envisioned to stretch over the 500 \nkilometers along the Israeli-Jordanian border, from the Red Sea to the \nYarmuk River. Under the current plan, the Valley of Peace initiative \nincludes several projects, ranging from a water conduit connecting the \nRed Sea and the Dead Sea in an attempt to prevent the latter from \ndrying up, to an Israeli-Jordanian airport near Eilat and Aqaba, to a \nconnection of the Jordanian and Israeli railway systems and a mutual \nIsraeli-Palestinian Authority industrial zone. While the initiative is \nstill in the idea stage, it could offer a major opportunity for joint \neconomic cooperation between Israelis, Palestinians, and, in this case, \nJordanians.\n  Employment and economic growth are critical to fostering stability \nfor Israelis and Palestinians alike. G.ho.st is another example of a \npromising partnership that can benefit the region in ways that surpass \nthe positive economic impact. Should their business model prove to be a \nsuccess, it would bode well for building additional partnerships and \nfostering further much-needed goodwill in the region.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have The New York Times \narticle to which I referred printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 29, 2008]\n\n             Israelis and Palestinians Launch Web Start-Up\n\n                            (By Dina Kraft)\n\n       Ramallah, West Bank.--Nibbling doughnuts and wrestling with \n     computer code, the workers at G.ho.st, an Internet start-up \n     here, are holding their weekly staff meeting--with colleagues \n     on the other side of the Israeli-Palestinian divide.\n       They trade ideas through a video hookup that connects the \n     West Bank office with one in Israel in the first joint \n     technology venture of its kind between Israelis and \n     Palestinians.\n       ``Start with the optimistic parts, Mustafa,'' Gilad Parann-\n     Nissany, an Israeli who is vice president for research and \n     development, jokes with a Palestinian colleague who is giving \n     a progress report. Both conference rooms break into laughter.\n       The goal of G.ho.st is not as lofty as peace, although its \n     founders and employees do hope to encourage it. Instead \n     G.ho.st wants to give users a free, Web-based virtual \n     computer that lets them access their desktop and files from \n     any computer with an Internet connection. G.ho.st, pronounced \n     ``ghost,'' is short for Global Hosted Operating System.\n       ``Ghosts go through walls,'' said Zvi Schreiber, the \n     company's British-born Israeli chief executive, by way of \n     explanation. A test version of the service is available now, \n     and an official introduction is scheduled for Halloween.\n       The Palestinian office in Ramallah, with about 35 software \n     developers, is responsible for most of the research and \n     programming. A smaller Israeli team works about 13 miles away \n     in the central Israeli town of Modiin.\n       The stretch of road separating the offices is broken up by \n     checkpoints, watch towers and a barrier made of chain-link \n     fence and, in some areas, soaring concrete walls, built by \n     Israel with the stated goal of preventing the entry of \n     Palestinian suicide bombers.\n       Palestinian employees need permits from the Israeli army to \n     enter Israel and attend meetings in Modiin, and Israelis are \n     forbidden by their own government from entering Palestinian \n     cities.\n       When permits cannot be arranged but meetings in person are \n     necessary, colleagues gather at a rundown coffee shop on a \n     desert road frequented by camels and Bedouin shepherds near \n     Jericho, an area legally open to both sides.\n       Dr. Schreiber, an entrepreneur who has already built and \n     sold two other start-ups, said he wanted to create G.ho.st \n     after seeing the power of software running on the Web. He \n     said he thought it was time to merge his technological and \n     commercial ambitions with his social ones and create a \n     business with Palestinians.\n       ``I felt the ultimate goal was to offer every human being a \n     computing environment which is free, and which is not tied to \n     any physical hardware but exists on the Web,'' he said. The \n     idea, he said, was to create a home for all of a user's \n     online files and storage in the form of a virtual PC.\n       Instead of creating its own Web-based software, the company \n     taps into existing services like Google Docs, Zoho and Flickr \n     and integrates them into a single online computing system.\n       G.ho.st also has a philanthropic component: a foundation \n     that aims to establish community computer centers in Ramallah \n     and in mixed Jewish-Arab towns in Israel. The foundation is \n     headed by Noa Rothman, the granddaughter of Yitzhak Rabin, \n     the Israeli prime minister slain in 1995.\n       ``It's the first time I met Palestinians of my generation \n     face to face,'' said Ms. Rothman, 31, of her work with \n     G.ho.st. She said she was moved by how easily everyone got \n     along. ``It shows how on the people-to-people level you can \n     really get things done.''\n       Investors have put $2.5 million into the company so far, a \n     modest amount. Employing Palestinians means the money goes \n     farther; salaries for Palestinian programmers are about a \n     third of what they are in Israel.\n       But Dr. Schreiber, who initially teamed up with Tareq \n     Maayah, a Palestinian businessman, to start the Ramallah \n     office, insists this is not just another example of \n     outsourcing.\n       ``We are one team, employed by the same company, and \n     everyone has shares in the company,'' he said.\n       At G.ho.st's offices in Ramallah, in a stone-faced building \n     with black reflective glass perched on a hill in the city's \n     business district, employees say they feel part of an \n     intensive group effort to create something groundbreaking. \n     Among them are top young Palestinian programmers and \n     engineers, recruited in some cases directly from \n     universities.\n       The chance to gain experience in creating a product for the \n     international market--a first for the small Palestinian \n     technology community--means politics take a backseat to \n     business, said Yusef Ghandour, a project manager.\n       ``It's good we are learning from the Israeli side now,'' \n     Mr. Ghandour said. The Israelis, he said, ``are open to the \n     external world, and there is lots of venture capital \n     investment in Israel, and now we are bringing that to \n     Palestine.''\n       The departure of educated young people mostly to \n     neighboring Jordan and the Persian Gulf states is a major \n     problem for the\n\n[[Page S6498]]\n\n     Palestinian economy and has been especially damaging to its \n     technology industry. Since the Oslo peace process broke down \n     in 2000, a wave of Israeli-Palestinian business ties have \n     crumbled as well.\n       Political tensions make it somewhat unpopular for \n     Palestinians to do business with Israelis, said Ala Alaeddin, \n     chairman of the Palestinian Information Technology \n     Association. He said the concept of a technology joint \n     venture across the divide was unheard-of until G.ho.st opened \n     its doors. A handful of Palestinian tech companies handle \n     outsourced work for Israeli companies, but most focus on the \n     local or Middle Eastern market.\n       ``It's much easier to have outsourcing than a \n     partnership,'' Mr. Alaeddin said. ``A joint venture is a \n     long-term commitment, and you need both sides to be really \n     confident that this kind of agreement will work.''\n       Benchmark Capital, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm \n     with offices in Israel, invested $2 million in G.ho.st. \n     Michael Eisenberg, a general partner at the firm, said \n     Benchmark was ``in the business of risky investments,'' but \n     that G.ho.st presented entirely new territory.\n       Recalling his discussions with Dr. Schreiber, Mr. Eisenberg \n     said: ``Frankly, when he first told me about it I thought it \n     was ambitious, maybe overly ambitious. But Zvi is a \n     remarkable entrepreneur, and I started to feel he could \n     actually pull this off.''\n       The video hookup runs continuously between the offices. \n     Chatting in the Ramallah conference room, two Palestinian \n     programmers wave hello to Israeli colleagues conferring over \n     a laptop in the Modiin office.\n       ``We are doing something across cultures and across two \n     sides of a tough conflict,'' Dr. Schreiber said. ``I was \n     prepared for the possibility that it might be difficult, but \n     it hasn't been.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/09/senate-section/article/S6498-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    EAGLE'S STORE 100TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, there is a little general store \nin West Yellowstone, MT, that has been there for 100 years. Built in \n1908 when only the bravest and most determined Americans were settling \nthe West and the State of Montana was barely 20 years old, Sam and Ida \nEagle set up shop.\n  When Sam and Ida Eagle established Eagle's Store just outside \nYellowstone Park's west entrance, they were also establishing, along \nwith three other families, the town that we now call West Yellowstone, \nMT. The Eagles spent their lives in the town they helped found. They \nraised a family of 10 children, built their business and played a \npioneering role in the community.\n  Sam served as the postmaster for 25 years and helped create the West \nYellowstone airport. He also led the town's struggle to gain title to \nthe properties they had settled.\n  The Eagle family still owns and operates Eagle's Store today on the \nland their ancestors received as a Presidential land grant, in a \nvintage store on the National Register of Historic Places.\n  A lot has happened in these last 100 years, and Sam and Ida Eagle and \ntheir neighbors probably could not have imagined some of the luxuries \nwe take for granted today--coast to coast flights, television, or the \nInternet.\n  Our world is still changing, but we have got to make sure we are \ndoing what is right for small towns everywhere. Creating good paying \njobs, keeping our economy strong, and ensuring the vitality of places \nlike West Yellowstone, is essential to who we are as Americans.\n  Of course, some things have not changed all that much in West \nYellowstone. The sense of community, the small town values, and the \ncommitment to a job well done still radiate from West Yellowstone's \nresidents. They are timeless qualities still apparent everywhere around \ntown, and they represent the very best of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/09/senate-section/article/S6498-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CONGRATULATING LEWIS-CLARK STATE COLLEGE\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, today I honor and congratulate one \nof the most successful athletic programs in the Nation that few people \noutside of my home State know about: The Lewis-Clark State College \nbaseball team of Lewiston, ID.\n  This year, head coach Ed Cheff led the LCSC Warriors to yet another \nNAIA World Series championship. This year's victory makes three \nchampionships in a row for the Warriors and 16 overall, all coming in \nthe last 25 years. Those 16 titles are far and away the most in NAIA \nhistory, with the second place school having just four.\n  Despite having only 3,500 students, Lewis-Clark has grown into a \nnational baseball powerhouse under Coach Cheff's tutelage. Since Coach \nCheff took over in 1977, the Warriors have put together a winning \npercentage of 79.8 percent. This year's 58-6 record is the latest and \ngreatest example of his leadership.\n  And this success isn't just by smaller school, NAIA standards; more \nthan a hundred of Coach Cheff's players have gone on to be drafted by \nMajor League Baseball teams, including four this year.\n  Idaho does not have a franchise in any of the major sports leagues. \nWe are known for potatoes, not winning championships. But thanks to \nLewis-Clark State College baseball--and another successful Idaho \ncollege program, Boise State Bronco football--that is changing. LCSC \nbaseball has given Idahoans a team that we can hang our hat on and be \nproud to call our own.\n  While sports are perhaps the quickest way for a school to capture \nheadlines, a college or university can thrive only with sustained, \nhigh-quality education. Athletics alone do not make a school. The \nclassroom must always be the foundation, and Idaho schools--from Lewis-\nClark to Boise State to my alma mater, the University of Idaho--are all \ninstitutions of exceptional academic quality.\n  Madam President, I am proud to see more young Idahoans enjoying \nsuccess, and I wanted the Senate to be aware of the achievements of the \nWarrior baseball team.

MICHAEL MOSELEY\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, today I pay special tribute to \nGEN T. Michael Moseley, 18th Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force, who, \ncompleted 37 years of distinguished service to our Nation today. He is \nan exemplary patriot, extraordinary leader, and a close friend.\n  General Moseley began his accomplished career at Texas A and Webb \nAFB, where he earned his pilot's wings in 1973. He proceeded to a \nseries of demanding assignments as flight instructor, test pilot and \nmission commander. His peerless operational skills were honed by the \nmost prestigious positions, to include command at every level--most \nnotably the Air Force Fighter Weapons School, the 9th Air Force, and \nthe U.S. Central Command Air Forces. General Moseley led Airmen in \npeace, crisis and war--from Operation Southern Watch, through the \nharrowing days in the wake of 9/11, to victory over the Taliban in \nOperation Enduring Freedom and the destruction of Saddam Hussein's war \nmachine in Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  The breadth and depth of General Moseley's assignments and the \nprofessionalism with which he has carried them out, reflect a keen \nintellect, and an unrivaled grasp of national security policies and air \npower's role in implementing them. General Moseley tirelessly worked to \nreinvigorate the innovation, flexibility, creativity, and strategic \nthinking that have been hallmarks of America's Airmen since the dawn of \naviation. In this context, General Moseley redefined the Air Force for \nthe 21st Century, ensuring that America's guardians will continue to \nfly, fight and win in both today's and tomorrow's conflicts.\n  General Moseley has frequently testified before Congress on a wide \nvariety of issues critical not only to the Air Force but to this Nation \nand its ability to meet uncertain challenges in the future. However \ncontroversial the topic or pointed the questioning, he has always \nprovided the Members with his honest evaluation, balancing current \ncrises with future requirements. I have been impressed by his \nunwavering focus on this Nation's security and ensuring that the U.S. \nAir Force remains the preeminent Air Force in the world, preserving \nAmerica's asymmetric advantage in the air.\n  It was General Moseley's exceptional grasp of warfighters' needs, \nborn of his own combatant experience, that enabled the Air Force to \nprovide unprecedented Global Reach, Global Vigilance and Global Power \nfor both traditional and nontraditional missions. Under his\n\n[[Page S6499]]\n\nleadership, the Air Force spread its wings over America's cities, \ndelivered relief to victims of tsunamis and hurricanes, expanded \ninternational ties to reassure allies and deter enemies--all while \nflying and fighting as an indispensable part of the Joint force in \nIraq, Afghanistan and other theaters of the global war on terror.\n  His commitment to his Airmen has been peerless. In a constrained \nfiscal environment--and with lives in the balance--General Moseley's \nuncommon courage, expertise and foresight forged a set of initiatives \ntransforming the Air Force while simultaneously recapitalizing an aging \nair fleet, worn down by 18 years of continuous combat. He sought to \nprovide his Airmen with the quality of life they deserve, while seeing \nto their training, education and leadership. He has refocused the \nService on a single core mission: bolstering warrior ethos and \nfostering joint and combined synergies.\n  While many distinguished awards and decorations adorn his uniform--\nfrom his own grateful Nation as well as from such staunch allies as \nBritain, France, Korea, Brazil, Singapore, and the UAE--what stands out \nmost and what we honor him for today is his unflinching commitment to \nthe cause of freedom and justice. As the 18th Chief of Staff and a \nmember of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from September 2005 to August 2008, \nGeneral Moseley has been a trusted advisor on all aspects of airpower \nand its key role in promoting and defending America's interests at home \nand abroad. He remains to this day a staunch and consistent advocate of \ninter-Service and international cooperation as the most effective way \nof assuring allies, dissuading and deterring adversaries, and defeating \nimplacable foes.\n  General T. Michael ``Buzz'' Moseley's 37 years of distinguished \nservice epitomizes bold leadership, strategic vision, intellectual \nflexibility, innovation, honor, integrity, dignity and selfless \ndevotion. He has earned the deepest respect from all whom he has served \nduring his illustrious career--most notably this Congress and a \ngrateful Nation.\n  I offer my sincere thanks and appreciation to GEN Buzz Moseley for \nhis leadership, compassion, and service to the men and women of the Air \nForce and our country. I am honored to call you friend and pray that \nthe Lord guard and guide you and your family as you begin the next \nchapter of your life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/09/senate-section/article/S6499-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO COL DONALD A. PERSON\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I would like to recognize a great \nAmerican and true military hero who has honorably served our country \nfor 49 years.\n  Colonel Person was born in Fargo, ND, and entered the Army as part of \nthe ``Doctor Draft'' in 1964 after earning his MD from the University \nof Minnesota School of Medicine. He served as Chief, Preventive \nMedicine, Professional Standards, and Aviation Medicine, Headquarters, \nU.S. Army Southern Command and Officer in Charge of U.S. Army \nDispensary, Fort Clayton, Panama. For the next 20 years, Dr. Person \nremained active in the U.S. Army Reserve. During that time, he \ncompleted neurosurgical training, and a postdoctoral fellowship in \nmicrobiology, immunochemistry, and virology at the Mayo Clinic in \nRochester, MN. Subsequently he served on the faculty in internal \nmedicine and virology and epidemiology at Baylor College of Medicine in \nHouston, TX. He also trained in pediatrics while at Baylor.\n  Colonel Person reinterred active duty in 1987 and was assigned as \nchief and program director in pediatrics, and chief, department of \nclinical investigation at Tripler Army Medical Center. He has 265 \npublications in the medical literature and has spoken at more than 400 \nmeetings and seminars throughout the world. He is also a member of 60 \nmedical, scientific, and professional organizations. He deployed to \nmuch of Central and South America, Alaska, Papau New Guinea, the \nRepublic of the Maldives, South Korea, Micronesia, and served in \nOperation Desert Storm.\n  Additionally, Colonel Person was professor of clinical pediatrics and \nclinical public health, John A. Burns School of Medicine, University of \nHawaii at Manoa. For his leadership in the development and sustainment \nof the Pacific Island Health Care Project, he was recognized by the \nPacific Basin Medical Association by the indigenous people of the U.S. \nAssociated Pacific Islands and by the legislatures of the Republic of \nPalau, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the \nMarshall Islands.\n  Throughout his career COL Donald A. Person has served with valor and \nprofoundly impacted the entire Army Medical Department. His performance \nreflects exceptionally on himself, the U.S. Army, the Department of \nDefense, and the United States of America. I extend my deepest \nappreciation to Colonel Person on behalf of a grateful Nation for his \nmore than 49 years of dedicated military service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/09/senate-section/article/S6499-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                100TH ANNIVERSARY OF SMART MOTORS, INC.\n\n Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I would like to acknowledge the \n100th anniversary of Smart Motors, Inc., a family-owned business in \nMadison, WI. Smart Motors, Inc. began in 1908 when founder O.D. Smart \nsold his first car, an Apperson-Jackrabbit. A far cry from today's \ncomplex automobile business, the operation O.D. began was very \nstraightforward--involving little more than a handshake, a cash payment \nand a bill of sale.\n  Since those early days, Smart Motors has successfully added services \nsuch as finance and insurance as well as a service and parts department \nto satisfy their customers and to remain competitive in today's \ncompetitive car sales industry.\n  Madam President, 2008 marks a milestone for Smart Motors which not \neven O.D. Smart could have anticipated when he made his first car sale \nin 1908. But his guiding principle to ``treat people with respect, \nhonesty, equality, and integrity'' has served the company well. I am \nproud to have such a hardworking and respected family business in \nWisconsin. I congratulate their high level of performance over the past \n100 years and wish them all the best as they enter their second century \nof business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/09/senate-section/article/S6499-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6499-S6500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       U.S. MATHEMATICAL OLYMPIAD\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I would like to pay tribute to two \noutstanding Vermont students, Colin Sandon, of Essex, and David \nRolnick, of Rupert. These two high school students both placed in the \ntop 12 finishers in this country's highest precollegiate math \ncompetition, the U.S. Mathematical Olympiad, which took place in May. \nIn the 34-year history of the Olympiad, this is the first time any \nVermonter has made it this far and this year my state had two students \naccomplish this incredible achievement.\n  Colin and David, at the ages of 18 and 16 respectively, have been \npreparing to compete at this level of mathematical competition their \nentire educational careers. They have achieved this goal through their \nown hard work and perseverance, and also through the support of their \nparents and teachers. David benefited from being home-schooled by his \nparents. The Vermont State Math Coalition identified Colin in the first \ngrade, and he began tutoring outside of the classroom by engineers and \nphysicists at IBM. Three years ago, he began taking high-level math \nclasses at the University of Vermont.\n  Both students have also benefited from the dedication of Anthony \nTrono, who retired from teaching at Burlington High School in 1992, but \nhas played a key role in training Vermont's talented math students. \nAnthony directs the Governor's Institute in Mathematical Sciences, a \nweek-long residential program for students held every year at the \nUniversity of Vermont that both Colin and David attended. Anthony also \nruns the Vermont State Mathematics Coalition Talent Search. He will \nretire this year and Colin and David's success this year is a testament \nto the many years he has invested in Vermont's students.\n  This month, Colin will compete on a six-student team which will \nrepresent the U.S. in the 49th annual International Math Olympiad. In \nthe fall, both Colin and David will attend the Massachusetts Institute \nof Technology. I congratulate them and their families on their \naccomplishments and I wish\n\n[[Page S6500]]\n\nthem the best of luck in what I am sure will be bright futures.\n  Madam President, I ask to have an article from the Burlington Free \nPress detailing their accomplishments be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\nTwo Reach Apex in Math Competition, Essex, Rupert Teens Among Nation's \n                                  Best\n\n                             (By Matt Ryan)\n\n       Six congruent circles are arranged inside a larger circle \n     so that each small circle is tangent to two other small \n     circles and is tangent to the large circle. The radius of the \n     large circle is 2007 centimeters. Find the radius of the \n     small circles.\n       For Colin Sandon of Essex and David Rolnick of Rupert, this \n     problem was preparation for a series of increasingly \n     selective math competitions. The two high schoolers placed in \n     the Top 12--Sandon tied for first place--in the country's \n     highest pre-collegiate math competition last week. They will \n     try out in June for a national, six-person math team that \n     will compete internationally in Madrid.\n       Sandon, 18, and Rolnick, 16, are the first Vermont students \n     to place in the Top 12 at the U.S. Mathematical Olympiad in \n     at least a decade, according to the Mathematical Association \n     of America. Anthony Trono, who has been training Vermont's \n     math prodigies since he retired from teaching at Burlington \n     High School in 1992, said, as far as he knew, they were the \n     state's first students to accomplish the feat. The Olympiad \n     began in 1974.\n       Trono, 80, of Colchester conceived the sample problem above \n     and provided The Burlington Free Press its solution: 669 \n     centimeters. Four times a year, he mails a sample exam with \n     eight such problems to Vermont's high schools to test the \n     waters for up-and-coming whizzes. The problems, like those \n     found on exams for the American Math Competition, the \n     American Invitational Math Exam and the Olympiad--the three \n     tiers of the national math tournament through which Sandon \n     and Rolnick advanced--involve applications up to pre-\n     calculus.\n       ``Some of these problems aren't even algebra, it's just \n     arithmetic, but you gotta use your head to solve them,'' \n     Trono said. ``They usually have to prove something is true, \n     derive some kind of formula, or solve a very, very complex \n     problem.''\n       During the course of the tournament, the field narrowed \n     from 500,000 students--including some from Canada--to the 500 \n     who competed in the Olympiad.\n       Students in the competitions generally take the exams at \n     their high schools. Sandon took his at Essex High School and \n     Rolnick, who is homeschooled, took his at Middlebury College. \n     Students were allotted 4 1/2 hours on two consecutive days to \n     complete the Olympiad's six problems. The highest scorer, \n     Sandon, a senior, and Rolnick, a junior, have been accepted \n     to and plan to enroll at the Massachusetts Institute of \n     Technology in the fall.\n       ``I'm kind of nervous, because I've never been away from \n     home for more than a month, and MIT will be my home for the \n     next four years,'' Sandon said. ``On the other hand, I'll get \n     to meet new people there and take more challenging classes.''\n       Sandon has sought more challenging classes since elementary \n     school.\n       The Vermont State Math Coalition discovered Sandon when he \n     was in first grade. Engineers and physicists from IBM tutored \n     the boy for the next few years, as his capacity for math \n     exceeded that of his teachers. He finished pre-calculus in \n     sixth grade, and began taking courses at the University of \n     Vermont three years ago. His course load includes calculus \n     III, linear algebra, graph theory and number theory.\n       His goal was to crack the Top 12 in the Olympiad.\n       ``I felt like I had done pretty well, but I didn't think I \n     had done that well,'' Sandon said.\n       His parents, Peter and Maureen Sandon, an engineer at IBM \n     and a retired home economics teacher, respectively, said the \n     announcement surprised them, too.\n       ``We had a message on our answering machine,'' Maureen \n     Sandon said. ``I said, `Wait a minute, what did this message \n     say?' I must have replayed it three times.''\n       Peter Sandon said his son left him behind ``quite a while \n     ago'' in math.\n       ``I used to play chess with him, too, and I used to be able \n     to beat him,'' Peter Sandon said. ``And now I can't.''\n       Colin Sandon said he enjoys strategy games, and also likes \n     to read science fiction and fantasy.\n\n\n                          The renaissance man\n\n       Rolnick said he also enjoys strategy games--as well as \n     hiking; tennis; word play; reading; writing; talking; \n     listening to classical composers, such as Bach, Beethoven, \n     Haydn, Schubert and Tchaikovsky; and studying moths.\n       Tiny white moths are boring, Rolnick said. He prefers the \n     variety of larger moths with scarlets, violets, yellows, \n     greens, silvers and golds.\n       ``I have had the fortune to grow up in a household with \n     parents who did not cause me to be afraid of insects,'' \n     Rolnick said. He blasted the ``societal prejudice against \n     insects'' that assumes all bugs ``bite, sting or eat \n     furniture.''\n       Rolnick sees beauty in moths and math.\n       ``Geometry I find easier to talk about,'' Rolnick said. ``I \n     love the way that things that are true, really are true.''\n       ``If you have a triangle, and you join the vertices to the \n     midpoints of the opposite side, you come up with three lines. \n     Those lines will come to a point--those three lines will \n     always meet--and I find that very beautiful.''\n       Problem solving becomes increasingly important as students \n     advance through the competitions, Rolnick said.\n       ``For all the problems, there is a certain amount of \n     thinking and puzzling that is absolutely necessary,'' Rolnick \n     said.\n       ``It is absolutely hard,'' he said of the Olympiad. ``It is \n     meant to be hard, even for professional mathematicians.''\n\n\n                             Trono retires\n\n       Sandon and Rolnick attended the Governor's Institute in \n     Mathematical Sciences, a week-long residential program for \n     students held at UVM during the summer.\n       Trono has directed the institute and run the Vermont State \n     Mathematics Coalition Talent Search--for which he mails high \n     schools his sample exams--since the early 1990s. He said he \n     will retire from the institute this year.\n       ``This has been a terrific year for me to go out,'' Trono \n     said.\n       He said he has 10,000 ``super, very good problems''--those \n     that did not make the cut for previous sample exams--to give \n     his successors a head start.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/09/senate-section/article/S6500-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6500-S6501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING ROBERT LEENEY\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, New Haven has lost a friend, a \nneighbor, and a teacher, with the passing of Robert Leeney, the \nlongtime editor of the New Haven Register. In his career at the \nRegister, Bob informed, educated, and entertained us in many roles, \nincluding as an editorial writer, reporter, book editor, Broadway \ncolumnist, and theatre critic.\n  Bob's weekly column in the paper, the ``Editor's Note''--which he \nremarkably wrote from April 6, 1974 to April 7, 2007, without missing \neven a single week--was a must-read column that brightened up our \nSaturday mornings. Evident in his writing was his love of New Haven, \noften reminding us what we may have missed, and through him it is true \nto say that our love of New Haven increased.\n  In his columns, Bob rarely strayed from local nonpolitical topics, \nbut when he did it was often to remind us about the greatness of our \ncountry, the value of service, or to urge politicians to look beyond \npartisan politics. And Bob always did this with a grace and delivery \nthat ensured his words made their impact.\n  His writing often brought to life, and made us yearn for, an earlier \nage. In his last July 4th column, published on June 30, 2007, for \ninstance, Bob wrote about the celebrations in the 1920s. It was a time, \nhe wrote, when: ``In every family, the youngsters were chipping in \nlong-saved nickels and dimes to build a fireworks fund for the front \nporch displays that illuminated streets and lawns, beaches and boat \ndocks in salute to American independence and the personal freedom it \nsignified for all the world.''\n  Just as Bob's professional life was marked by his scholarship and \ntalented writing and reporting, his personal life, too, was marked by \nhis dedication to New Haven and to his being the consummate gentleman. \nHis service to our community did not end with his journalism, and in \nhis spare time he served our community in many roles. Indeed, his life \nwas twinned with that of New Haven, especially in its artistic and \nreligious life.\n  To give just a few examples of his extensive public service, Bob \nserved as vice president of the New Haven Arts Council and on the city \ncommittee that worked to reopen the Shubert. Once the theatre was \nreopened, he served on its board.\n  His interests and service was not limited to the arts. Bob served as \na director of the Greater New Haven Chamber of Commerce and was a \nmember of the State Education Commission's Connecticut Education \nCouncil. He also sat on the committee tasked with establishing a \nHolocaust memorial, as well as on other committees.\n  Bob was a religious man, and in recognition for his service to the \nCatholic Church, Pope John Paul II appointed him a Knight of St. \nGregory. Bob also received numerous other awards, including Connecticut \nAnti-Defamation League's First Amendment Freedoms Award--of which he \nwas the first ever recipient.\n  It can be said about Bob that he left our society better off for the \nwisdom\n\n[[Page S6501]]\n\nand humanity he taught us both in his writings, in his personal life of \nhonor, and in his public service.\n  Bob's wife Anne passed away in 1990, and I remember him writing that \nafter she died he went to bed and ``touched the pillow where the \nmoonlight and the memory fused and whispered, `Much ado about nothing, \nold girl'--and went to sleep.'' Hadassah and I extend our condolences \nto his family, the Register, and the entire community. We will miss \nyou, Bob.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/09/senate-section/article/S6501-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING NATIONAL LIFE GROUP OF VERMONT\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I would like to recognize the \nNational Life Group of Vermont for the impact this company is having in \nthe field of renewable energy, energy efficiency, and environmental \nstewardship in my State of Vermont. National Life, a Fortune 1000 \nfinancial services and insurance firm based in Montpelier, is actively \nmoving forward with a significant solar project at its headquarters.\n  National Life announced in May that it will install 240 300-watt \nsolar panels on the roof of its Montpelier headquarters. This will be \none of the largest, if not the largest, solar electric installations in \nVermont. The solar panels are expected to be installed and running by \nSeptember, and they estimate that the system will generate 77,767 \nkilowatt-hours a year. The 72 kW Photovoltaic, PV, system will generate \nenough electricity to power 13 average Vermont homes.\n  The $500,000 project will be financed in part through a $200,000 \ngrant from the State of Vermont's Clean Energy Development Fund, which \nis administered by the Department of Public Service.\n  National Life has contracted Solar Works of Montpelier to handle the \ninstallation. Solar Works is the leading solar electric systems \nprovider in the Northeast.\n  National Life is also working on a separate proposal to install a \nsolar hot water system at the building. Both solar projects are part of \na larger plan, begun 5 years ago, to transform the company's Montpelier \nheadquarters into a ``green'' campus. An important plan objective will \nbe realized at the end of 2008, when the company expects to win a \ncoveted LEED certification. LEED--Leadership in Energy and \nEnvironmental Design--is the nationally accepted benchmark for the \ndesign, construction, and operation of high-performance green \nbuildings. Impressively, experts say LEED certification for National \nLife's headquarters would be the first for a 50-year-old facility \nanywhere in the Nation.\n  Tom MacLeay, the CEO of National Life, has driven this entire green \ninitiative. A Vermont native who has worked at National Life for 32 \nyears, Tom recently announced that he would be retiring at the end of \nthis year. It is certainly worth noting that the company's commitment \nto environmental leadership is a testimony to his vision of the ways in \nwhich business can help achieve a secure environmental future for this \nNation.\n  Solar is not the only area in which National Life has shown its \nenvironmental stewardship. Every 10 days National Life sends its \nshredded paper to Fairmont Farms, a dairy farm in East Montpelier, to \nbe used as bedding for the cows and mixed into fertilizer for the \nfields. In 2007 they recycled 64 percent of their waste, including \npaper, plastic, shredded material, aluminum, metal, food composting, \nand computer equipment.\n  In 2007 National Life transformed the offices of its Human Resources \nDepartment into a showcase for leading-edge green technology, using \ncarpet with no volatile organic compounds, VOC, occupancy sensors, \nglass walls and automatic window blinds that allow light to pass \nthrough while keeping the heat out in the summer and the cold out in \nthe winter. The new lighting technology put in place at its \nheadquarters--with fixtures that are 95 percent efficient compared to \nthe 50-percent efficiency of existing fixtures--will cut the company's \nelectric bill in half.\n  The company's Alternate Transportation Program offers incentives such \nas free bike tuneups, gas cards, free bus passes, and shoe discounts \nfor those who carpool, bike, use bus service, or walk or run to and \nfrom work.\n  These accomplishments are not just environmentally sound, they \nillustrate smart business decisions. By reducing its greenhouse gas \nemissions, Vermont Life is cutting its electric bills and saving \nserious money too. And by pushing the boundaries of what can be done, \nit is setting an example for other companies.\n  What they are accomplishing with solar energy in Vermont, which is \nnot a particularly sunny State, demonstrates what is possible to \nachieve right now if the will is there to carry it through.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to the day when renewable energy and \nconservation have become so commonplace in our society that they are no \nlonger looked upon as being unusual or path-breaking but are seen as \ntotally ordinary, a normal part of the landscape. When that day comes, \nand I believe that it will, we will be able to look back to a handful \nof environmentally aware companies, such as National Life, that helped \nshow us the way toward our sustainable energy society.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/09/senate-section/article/S6501-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6501-S6502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING RAYE'S MUSTARD MILL\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, today I wish to recognize a small \nbusiness from my home State of Maine whose roots spring from both our \nState's seafaring heritage and agricultural legacy. Raye's Mustard Mill \nin Eastport has long provided locals with the perfect condiment to top \nalmost any meal from the once traditional sardine to the timeless \nsummer classic of burgers and hot dogs.\n  Raye's Mustard, founded in 1900 by J. Wesley Raye, has been operating \nat its current location in Eastport, America's easternmost city, since \n1903, when a young Wes Raye decided to move out of the family \nsmokehouse and into a more commercially viable location. When the \ncompany's mustard was first produced, it provided the perfect \ncomplement to the sardines being caught and consumed by Maine \nfishermen. While times have changed, Raye's mustard has consistently \nremained a Maine culinary staple. It has continued to accompany new \ndishes while it is still made using many of the same techniques that \nMr. Raye employed over 100 years ago. Indeed, Raye's is the only \nremaining traditional stone ground mustard mill in America, and the \nfirm uses a time-honored cold grind method for preparing its product, \nslowly grinding mustard seeds and other ingredients together using \nmassive pieces of stone.\n  Raye's distinctive technique has succeeded in producing numerous \naward-winning mustards that have been recognized by culinary \norganizations nationwide. Raye's 21 mustard varieties have been \nfeatured in publications, including ``Martha Stewart Living'' and \n``Yankee Magazine.'' With varieties ranging from the Downeast Schooner, \nRaye's classic yellow mustard; to more innovative flavors, like the \nspicy Heavenly Jalapeno, the firm has managed to produce mustards to \nsatisfy any palate. Furthermore, its special line of select mustards \nprovide a hint of Maine in every jar, as the company has partnered with \nlocal restaurants and breweries to produce signature items such as \nRaye's Jameson Tavern Style and Raye's Sea Dog Beer Mustard.\n  While Raye's Mustard is sold in stores regionally and worldwide via \nthe internet, just as unchanging as the mustard itself are the Mustard \nMill and The Pantry Store, Raye's on-site retail location. In fact, in \n2006, these Eastport institutions garnered the Maine Tourism \nAssociation's Down East and Acadia Regional Tourism Award. Tours of the \nmill give visitors the opportunity to learn about the history of one of \nthe most universal food products in the world and to see first hand the \nvaliant spirit and commitment to quality that have driven Raye's to the \nimpressive heights that it has achieved.\n  In addition to the respect that I have for Raye's Mustard Mill as a \nsmall family-owned business, I also have a great personal esteem for \nits fourth generation of owners. I have long known Kevin and Karen Raye \nas friends and colleagues, and I have been particularly pleased to see \nthe successes they have achieved since Kevin left Capitol Hill after \nserving as chief of staff for many years. It is with great admiration \nthat I wish Raye's Mustard the\n\n[[Page S6502]]\n\nbest of luck as it continues to excel at making distinct products that \nhave earned accolades from discerning clients and culinary greats \nalike.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/09/senate-section/article/S6502-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 5:10 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1423.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na temporary income tax credit for commercial fishermen to offset high \nfuel costs; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that will \nhelp commercial fishermen in Alaska and all over the United States \noffset high fuel prices by providing a temporary income tax credit for \nexcessive fuel costs. I am pleased to have Mr. Stevens join me in \nintroducing this important legislation.\n  Diesel fuel prices in Alaska and across the Nation have increased \nmore than 50 percent over the past year. Some fishermen are reporting \nthat they are now spending up to 70 percent of their income for fuel. \nThis is having a devastating impact on this industry as fishermen do \nnot have the option of passing the cost of fuel onto clients or \ncustomers, turning to alternative modes of transportation to do their \njobs, or selling their product for a higher price. They can't simply \nincrease the price of fish to offset higher fuel costs. Fish prices, in \nmost cases, are set by the seafood processing sector and are tied to \nprices in the global seafood market in which Alaskan and American \nseafood compete.\n  All around the world, fishermen are responding to this crisis. They \nare\n\n[[Page S6506]]\n\nblockading harbors in Ireland and France, protesting at the European \nUnion headquarters in Belgium, rioting in Italy and Spain, burning \nfishing boats in Thailand, and striking in Japan.\n  Fishermen all over the United States are staying tied to the dock, \nunable to make enough money from their catch to pay for the fuel. In \nGloucester and Biloxi, Key West and Honolulu, Point Judith and Kodiak, \nfishermen simply can't afford to go fishing. And some U.S. vessels are \nrunning all the way from the Gulf of Mexico and California to Mexico to \nbuy fuel. Even the Federal Government is cancelling fishery stock \nassessment surveys due to the high cost of fuel. As you can see, \nfishermen are getting hit from all sides right now.\n  When fishermen can't go fishing, they can't make their boat and \npermit payments. Many are simply going out of business. Fishermen are \nnot the only ones who are concerned about the high price of fuel. The \nseafood processing sector also is facing higher costs for energy and \nmany other inputs and is worried about the industry's ability to \nmaintain a steady supply of fish. When fishermen don't leave the dock, \nthe processors don't get their fish and a major seafood supply shortage \ncould occur in the near future.\n  Some people might say that if fish stocks were healthier or fewer \nboats were fishing, that the industry could better deal with the \nincreased price of fuel. But even in Alaska, where we have abundant, \nsustainably managed fish stocks that supply over 50 percent of the \nseafood in the United States, we are still suffering. The price of fuel \nhas increased from an average of $1.80 per gallon in 2004 to $2.80 last \nyear and diesel is now $4.50 on average.\n  In Alaska, we have already limited the number of vessels in most \nfisheries, so they are not over capitalized. We also have established \nmany limited access privilege programs such as limited entry, \nindividual fishing quotas, and coops, where fishermen can make choices \nto harvest in the most efficient and economic way. So, even though we \nhave tried to make the fisheries much more economical, we still are \nbeing severely impacted by these high fuel prices. We are much more \nable to withstand these high fuel prices than regions and fisheries \nthat have not limited the number of vessels or slowed the race for \nfish. But, many fisheries in Alaska, including our salmon fisheries, \nwhere over 150 million fish likely will be caught in a 2\\1/2\\ month \nseason, fishermen must catch the fish while they are available. In \nother parts of the country, where fishermen are still racing for fish \nand have not limited the number of vessels participating, things must \nbe far worse.\n  In order to provide temporary relief to the commercial fishermen \nacross the country, I am introducing this legislation. If we allow the \nfishermen in this country to stay tied to the dock, or go out of \nbusiness, we may lose a large portion of the industry. Since over 80 \npercent of the seafood Americans eat is imported, we simply can't \nafford for this to happen. We must try to assist this industry weather \nthis storm. I believe this legislation will help us do that.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. Kyl):\n  S. 3236.

Madam President, tomorrow there will be 1 hour for debate \nprior to a cloture vote on the motion to disagree to the amendments of \nthe House with respect to the housing reform bill. Therefore, Senators \nshould expect the first vote of the day to begin as early as 10:30 a.m. \nThere will be no morning business.\n  Today we were unable to reach an agreement to proceed on the Global \nAIDS legislation. We have tried to do that for weeks now. As a result \nof attempting to work something out, I was forced to file cloture to \nproceed to the bill, but I am hopeful we will be able to reach an \nagreement to consider the legislation. I certainly hope that is the \ncase. We also hope to be able to complete the housing legislation \ntomorrow, but that is up in the air. We still understand there is a \nRepublican Senator objecting to allowing us to finish this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/09/senate-section/article/S6510-4", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECESS UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
