Mr. President, we are going to have an hour of morning \nbusiness. The time is controlled by the two leaders. The Republicans \ncontrol the first half, the Democrats the second half.\n  Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of \nAmtrak. Last night, an agreement was entered into regarding \nconsideration of the pending Sununu amendment relating to rail \nsubsidies. There will be 2 hours of debate on that amendment. Votes are \nexpected sometime around 11:30 or 11:40 today.\n  I would say that the Republican leader and I just had a conversation. \nWe have to check with a couple of Senators on each side. What we might \ntry to do to get out of the procedural problem we have now--because we \ndo have one with this--is we may try to set up a couple of competing \nvotes. We will try to do that. We know the issue is pretty well formed. \nWe know what one side wants, and we know what the other side wants. So \nit is probably appropriate that we set something up so that we can vote \non both of them. What has been suggested is that we have a 60-vote \nmargin on both of them, which, of course, is certainly done on occasion \naround here.\n  So as soon as I finish here, I am going to go make a couple of calls \nto my Senators and see if we can have Senator McConnell--if he has any \nproblems on his side, he will do the same, and maybe we can enter into \nsome kind of an agreement and vote at 11:30, maybe two votes. We are on \ntop of that. I think it would be a way to move into this bill so that \nwe are actually debating the railroad Amtrak issues rather than this \nInternet issue, which is important, and it has to be decided within the \nnext few days one way or the other because otherwise it expires. So \nthat is where we are.\n  There should be amendments throughout the day. I know I have had one \nSenator who asked me if there will be votes tonight, and I think it is \nvery likely there will be votes tonight. So I think anyone considering \ngoing to Boston to watch the World Series might not be able to do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/25/senate-section/article/S13391-7", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--H.R. 3564\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, 5 years ago today, the Senate lost one of \nits hardest working, most respected Members: Senator Paul Wellstone. I \ncan still remember very clearly the phone call I received from Pete \nRouse, who was the chief of staff for Senator Daschle, and he said: I \nhave some terrible news. There was an airplane crash, and we think Paul \nWellstone was on that plane.\n  Well, hope springs eternal, and I was hoping that was wrong, but it \nwasn't. He was in a plane crash. Sheila, who was his partner--she was \nwith him everyplace--was killed in that plane crash. One of his three \nchildren, Marcia, was also killed, and three campaign aides.\n  Typical for Paul Wellstone, he had made a commitment to be someplace, \nand he wanted to go. The weather was bad. The pilot said everything \nwould be OK. The pilot wasn't telling him the way it really was. I am \nnot going to get into how the accident happened or why it happened, but \ncertainly it was nothing that Paul Wellstone did wrong. Paul Wellstone \nwanted to fulfill a commitment. He shouldn't have been up in that \nairplane. The pilot shouldn't have taken that airplane into the areas \nthat he did, but he did.\n  In his life, Paul Wellstone earned the titles of doctor, professor, \nSenator, but he liked to be called Paul. That is what I am going to \ncall him today.\n  Paul loved to talk. He stood back there, and he was a good speaker. I \ncan remember the first time I heard him speak. There were some new \nSenators who had been elected, and we had an event in the Rotunda for \nthe new Senators. I had never heard him speak before. He was dynamic, \nwhat he said. He was talking about why he had gotten involved in \npolitics.\n  Paul came here in 1991. He was a crusader. That is what he was. He \nwas a crusader. He was always out charging ahead on some issue he \nbelieved in. Mostly, the issues were those where people needed help. \nThe poor, the left behind, veterans, the environment, and those with \nmental illness were always a special concern to him. He took pride in \nchampioning the fight for people needing a helping hand.\n  He knew a lot about growing up with adversity. He had a brother he \nloved who suffered from mental illness, and that is why he joined with \nSenator Domenici to work on mental health parity. His parents worked \nhard. They didn't have much. But Paul told me how his father would sit \nat the table in the evening and talk to him about what was important in \nlife.\n  He was a remarkable man. He was very small in stature physically, but \nin that big facility across Constitution Avenue, the police \nheadquarters, where hundreds and hundreds of police officers come and \ngo out of that facility every day over the years, Paul Wellstone still \nholds the record of being able to do the most chin-ups and the most \npushups in a given period of time. He was a powerful little man \nphysically.\n  Most of what he accomplished, as indicated with the chin-ups and \npushups, was with sheer grit and determination. He earned a wrestling \nscholarship from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. He \nmarried his high school sweetheart. He earned an Atlantic Coast \nWrestling Championship and managed to graduate in just 3 years. After \ncollege, he earned a Ph.D. in political science and became a college \nprofessor at the age of 24 at a very academically known school, \nCarleton College in Minnesota.\n  But even then, in his years before the Senate, he was a true believer \nand an impassioned fighter for justice, and that is an understatement. \nOne may not have agreed with what his definition of justice was, but \nhis definition was worth fighting for, and he fought hard.\n  While teaching at Carleton College, he led the charge to divest the \nuniversity from apartheid in South Africa. He helped local farmers when \nbanks came to foreclose on their farms. That is Paul Wellstone. He \nfostered a new generation of active, civic-minded students by teaching \nspecialized courses with names like ``Social Movements'' and \n``Grassroots Organizing.'' These were courses he invented. There were \nno textbooks for them.\n  There were some who said that for an untenured professor, teaching \nactivism and leading campus protests wasn't the smartest career move a \nperson could make. In fact, when Paul came up for tenure, he was \ninitially denied. In effect, he was in the process of being fired. It \ntook a groundswell of student support. Thousands and thousands of \nstudents, most of whom didn't even go to that university, rallied on \nhis behalf. He kept his job. He got tenure. At 28, he was the youngest \ntenured professor in the history of Carleton College. It was done \nbecause the students wanted him more than did the administration, \nbecause he was a great teacher.\n  So when he came to the Senate, it was no surprise he brought a \nfearless progressive spirit with him. I recall observers comparing him \nto Jimmy Smith's character in ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.'' He was \nidealistic, he was determined, and he was very effective.\n  He came here refusing to be phased by the politics of division, \nrefusing to be phased by business as usual. I don't think the phrase \n``status quo'' was in his vocabulary. Wherever he saw injustice, \nintolerance, or simply ineffectiveness, one would understand that Paul \nWellstone would be around. When he found injustice in the treatment of \nthe mentally ill, he stepped forward to ensure parity for sufferers of \nwhat were known as unspoken illnesses when it comes to insurance caps. \nWhen he found injustice in the treatment of our veterans, he stepped \nforward to help them, especially those who were homeless. When he found \ninjustice in the way our Earth was treated, he stepped forward to \nprotect the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge from drilling, among other \nthings. He never hesitated, paused, or pondered. He stepped forward. He \nwas really a leader.\n  Now, in his leading, that didn't mean everybody agreed with him \nbecause much of the time--in fact, most of the time--he was in the \nminority. He didn't care if he had two people supporting him or one or \nif he was alone. He never hesitated--I repeat, he never paused or \npondered.\n  Many wondered how this fire-breathing progressive was able to \naccomplish so much in his time. The answer is that he believed in \nbipartisanship and he actively embraced it. It was never a surprise to \nsee Paul team up with one or more of the Senate's most conservative \nMembers to get something done for the people of the State of Minnesota \nor our country. During his time here in Washington, it never changed \nhim. It really didn't. He left this Earth with the same idealisms and \npassion he always had.\n  He once said:\n\n       Never separate the life you live from the words you speak.\n\n  He lived by that rule.\n  I recall that when he first arrived in the Senate, he kept \nwondering--he would leave his office all messed up, and he would come \nback and it was clean. He asked: Who does that? He was told: People \ncome in late at night and clean your office--the janitors. So Paul \nWellstone, after learning that, stayed that night. They came after \nmidnight. He waited for them so he could tell them how much he \nappreciated them cleaning his office. That is the kind of guy he was. \nTrue to form, he did that, as he did many unusual things, in the minds \nof many.\n  There is a man who still works here; his name is Gary. I don't know \nGary's last name. He is a big man. He helps us here. We have all seen \nhim. Gary said people refer to him as ``Tiny.'' Paul told me: I would \nappreciate it if you wouldn't refer to him as ``Tiny.'' His name is \nGary. I have never referred to him as anything other than Gary. He \nthought that was a pejorative statement. Tiny, as many people refer to \nhim, is a huge man, and Paul somehow thought that was not the right \nthing to do.\n  He was really my friend. I counseled with him. I went to the doctor \nwith him. Right before he was killed, he had\n\n[[Page S13393]]\n\na terribly bad back. Oh, it was bad. He refused to go to the doctor. He \nrefused to go to the hospital, which is where he should have gone. We \ntook him to the doctor down here. The sweat, because of the pain, was \npouring off his face.\n  He was a very tough man. I will always remember that phone call I got \nfrom Pete Rouse. I will always remember Paul Wellstone. The loss of his \npresence has been felt and missed every day. He added a new dimension \nto the Senate. You don't always have to win to be a winner. So I say to \nhis sons, David and Mark, and the entire Wellstone family, Paul \nWellstone will always be in my heart and in the hearts of anyone who \nknew him.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I, too, today wish to comment on the \nremarkable life of Paul Wellstone. Elaine and I got to knew Paul for \ntwo reasons. No. 1, they lived right near us on Capitol Hill and we \nwould frequently see them coming and going. No. 2, Sheila was from \neastern Kentucky, and we had an opportunity to share observations about \nthose good people in eastern Kentucky from whom she sprang.\n  Today is indeed a sad anniversary. I join the Senate family in \nhonoring the memory of Senator Paul Wellstone and celebrating his \ndistinguished Senate career.\n  He was the most unlikely Senator. His election in 1990 was widely \nconsidered kind of a fluke, an accident. But he was neither. He was the \ngenuine article, an extraordinary man who came to work every day with \nenthusiasm. He had a very upbeat outlook on life. Sometimes people who \nare either on the very left or the very right have a kind of grim view \nof things. Paul would, by his own admission, say he was on the very far \nleft of things, but he didn't have a grim nature about him at all. He \nwas upbeat and optimistic, and he came to work every day ready to fight \nfor what he believed in.\n  Paul was a champion of mental health and other causes. With Paul, you \nnever had any uncertainty about where he stood. It was absolutely \nclear. I am having a hard time recalling a single matter upon which he \nand I agreed, but Paul was what I would call a conviction-based \npolitician, a public servant who never wavered from his beliefs, even \nwhen the political winds shifted against him.\n  He and Sheila--that eastern Kentuckian I talked about--were \nabsolutely inseparable. High school sweethearts, they had been married \nfor 39 years when, regretfully, the plane carrying them, their daughter \nMarcia, three staff members, and two pilots went down in Eveleth, MN, \non the way to a debate in Duluth.\n  The entire Nation grieved that day for this former wrestling champ, \nan unlikely and, as I indicated, unforgettable Senator. We grieve on \nthis anniversary with Paul's two surviving sons, David and Mark, and \nthe many former Wellstone staffers, the Wellstone people who worked so \nhard to carry on his legacy. As the majority leader indicated, he had a \ndistinguished academic career, earned his bachelor's degree in 1965 and \nhis doctorate 3 years later. He plowed right through college at the \nUniversity of North Carolina, both his undergraduate degree and his \ndoctorate. He was a Phi Beta Kappa. That is about as good as it gets \nfor a student at college. He actually attended on a wrestling \nscholarship.\n  Paul was not very tall. He was 5 feet 5 inches or 5 feet 6 inches but \na strong guy. He was a champion Atlantic Coast Conference wrestler. He \nwas named to the all-ACC wrestling team.\n  As the majority leader outlined, Paul was a great professor, widely \nloved and admired by his students, and I think it is safe to say he was \nwidely admired and loved by his colleagues in the Senate.\n  We will always remember Paul Wellstone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/25/senate-section/article/S13393-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester).

Mr. President, I wish to speak this morning to honor \nthe memory of Paul and Sheila Wellstone. Today, it is exactly 5 years \nago that they died in a plane crash outside Eveleth, MN, a beautiful \narea of our State called the Iron Range, where, in some ways, Paul \nWellstone got his political start. Part of it was the farms of southern \nMinnesota, when he stood up for farmers when the farms were being \nforeclosed on. But part of it was the work he did with those iron ore \nminers. My grandfather was an iron ore miner who worked 1,500 feet \nunderground in the mines of Ely, MN, about a half hour away from where \nPaul died.\n  Paul Wellstone's daughter Marcia was also killed in the crash--his \nlongtime staff members, Mary McEvoy, Tom Lapik, and Will McLaughlin, as \nwell as the pilot and copilot of the plane. On this day, 5 years later, \nthe people of Minnesota are remembering that crash and remembering Paul \nand Sheila. It is so hard to believe it has been 5 years since we have \nlost them. It feels both so long ago and not so long ago at all. Part \nof why it doesn't seem so long ago to me is because everywhere I go in \nthis Capitol, people remind me of Paul. When I say I am a Senator from \nMinnesota, they remember Paul--people such as Ted Kennedy, who worked \nwith him on mental health issues, to the tram drivers, who for years \nand years have driven that tram from the Capitol to the Senate office \nbuildings. When I said I was this new Senator from Minnesota, the \ndriver said, ``Paul Wellstone was a Senator from Minnesota.''\n  The cops who guard at the Capitol remember Paul. The secretaries in \nthe offices remember Paul. That is because he treated everybody with \nsuch dignity in this Capitol and with such dignity in our State. That \nwas Paul Wellstone.\n  For me, as for so many other Minnesotans, it is impossible to forget \nthe moment we first heard about the plane going down and then the wait \nto get the final news that there were no survivors.\n  Paul and Sheila would be the first to tell us we should not look back \non what they accomplished and stood for. They would be the first to \ninsist our responsibility is to look ahead to the work that still must \nbe done to carry their legacy forward.\n  Although Paul and Sheila are no longer with us, we know their dreams \nand passions remain very much alive. I get my own special reminder \nevery day, not just with the employees in the Capitol but because the \nflag from Paul's Senate office hangs in our Senate office. It is a \npowerful reminder to me of Paul and all he tried to do in Washington.\n  During his lifetime as an educator, as an activist, and as a Senator, \nPaul inspired people throughout Minnesota and throughout America.\n\n  Even now, his work and his spirit continue to inspire people of all \nages, from all walks of life, all across our country, who remember Paul \nfor the fundamental values he fought and struggled for.\n  He was a voice for the voiceless. He and Sheila stood for victims of \ndomestic violence who were afraid to talk about it, afraid to go to \ncourt. They stood for them and made this their life's passion.\n  He brought power to the powerless--people such as the iron miners in \nMinnesota, people such as those farmers whose homes and farms were \nforeclosed on.\n  He brought justice to those who suffered injustice.\n  He brought opportunity to those who didn't have opportunity. When \ngoing to any small community event in our State or to events with large \nimmigrant populations, they all remember Paul coming to their \nmarketplaces or how he would meet with the women. Some of them--the \nelders--can hardly\n\n[[Page S13394]]\n\nspeak English, but they can say ``Wellstone.''\n  I know I will forever be humbled by the oath I took to be a Senator \nfrom Minnesota. I know that not I nor anyone else can truly follow in \nPaul's footsteps. But he is an inspiration for us all.\n  Paul was my friend and mentor. He taught me how to campaign on a city \nbus. When I first ran for office, for county attorney, we would get on \na city bus and work the entire bus. We would meet everybody on the bus. \nWhen we would get to the end of 8 blocks, we would say we are at our \nstop and get off. Then we would get back on a bus going the other way. \nWe would go around for hours until we met everybody on those buses in \nMinneapolis that afternoon. He worked bus by bus, block by block, \nprecinct by precinct to touch people in a way that made people believe, \nmade people know that involvement in politics could make a real \ndifference in their lives. That is what he told those new immigrants, \nnew citizens. He told them that involvement in politics could make a \ndifference in their lives. He did it not only by his words but by how \nmuch he went out and touched them and were a part of their life.\n  Paul was a crusader and a man with many passions. Anyone who ever met \nor talked with him quickly found out he had a special passion for \nhelping those with mental illness. That was shaped by the suffering of \na member of his own family. Many of you may know Paul's story about his \nbrother Stephen.\n  As a young child, Paul watched his brother's traumatic descent into \nmental illness. When Stephen was a freshman in college, he suffered a \nsevere mental breakdown and ended up spending the next 2 years in \nmental hospitals. Eventually, he recovered and graduated from college \nwith honors. But it took his immigrant parents years to pay off the \nhospital bills.\n  Writing about this, Paul recalled the years that his brother was \nhospitalized. ``For two years,'' he wrote, ``the house always seemed \ndark to me--even when the lights were on. It was such a sad home.''\n  Decades later, Paul knew there were still far too many sad homes in \nour great Nation--too many families devastated by the physical and \nfinancial consequences of mental illness.\n  Paul knew we could and we should do better. For years, he fought to \nallocate funding for better care, better services, and better \nrepresentation for the mentally ill. For years, he fought for mental \nhealth parity in health insurance coverage.\n  Finally, this year, at last, it looks as if Paul's dream may finally \ncome true. Last month, the Senate unanimously voted in support of \nlegislation that will guarantee equity for mental health insurance \ncoverage.\n  This will be a victory--if we can get this passed and work with the \nHouse and get as strong a bill as possible--for millions of Americans \nliving with these mental illnesses who have faced unfair discrimination \nin their access to affordable, appropriate health care and treatment.\n  For Paul, this was always a matter of civil rights, of justice, and \nof basic human decency.\n  Of course, on this issue--as every other issue--Sheila and Paul were \ntogether and they moved quickly. Paul and Sheila had so much energy, \nand they were always on the move. They brought such enthusiasm and joy \nto their work. They were animated, tireless, and persistent in their \nfight against injustice.\n  Sheila Wellstone was a leader in her own right. I had the opportunity \nto work closely with her when I was the chief prosecutor for Hennepin \nCounty. They focused on domestic violence. She was instrumental in \ncreating the Hennepin County Domestic Abuse Service Center, which I \nsupervised during my 8 years as county attorney. That center is a \nnational, an international, model for serving the victims of domestic \nviolence by bringing together a full range of services and resources in \none central, convenient location. Victims of domestic violence don't \nhave to go through the redtape that would even be hard for a lawyer to \nfigure out. There is a center where children can come and play, for \nprosecutors and police, and a shelter, all located under one roof.\n  Sheila knew the statistics on domestic violence. She knew these kids \nare six times more likely to commit suicide if they grew up in a home \nwith domestic violence. They are 24 times more likely to commit sexual \nassaults. They are 60 times more likely to exhibit delinquent behavior. \nMost chilling of all, little boys who would witness domestic violence \nare 100 times more likely to become abusers themselves.\n  Sheila knew these numbers, but even more, she knew the names and the \nfaces of the victims of domestic violence. She knew their children. It \nmade her all the more determined to do something about it because, in \nAmerica, of all places, kids should be free to grow up with safety and \nsecurity and peace of mind.\n  I remember the last time I saw Sheila and Paul. It was a few weeks \nbefore the tragic crash. Sheila and I had been asked to speak to a \ngroup of new citizens, immigrants from Russia. It was a very small \ngroup. There were about 50 people there. We talked about our own \nimmigrant experiences. She talked about her parents and growing up in \nAppalachia, and I talked about my Slovenian relatives coming over and \nmaking their way, saving money in a coffee can in the basement so they \ncould send my dad to college.\n  We were in the middle of these stories in this very small room. All \nof a sudden in walked Paul. He wasn't supposed to be there. He had \ngotten an early flight home from Washington. He wasn't supposed to be \nthere because he was about a month out on one of the biggest elections \nfor the Senate in the country. He had voted, had taken a brave vote, a \ncourageous vote against the resolution on Iraq. He knew he was up for \nreelection. He knew it might cost him the election, but he did the \nright thing.\n  He came into that room where there was no press, no reporters, and a \nfew weeks before this election. At the time I thought: Why did he do \nthis when he has to be out there campaigning? I knew then that there \nwere two reasons he did it. First is that he loved Sheila and he wanted \nto surprise her, and he wanted to be there by her side while she gave \nher speech and gave her remarks. But he was also there because he \nembraced the immigrant experience. He liked nothing more than talking \nabout how you can come to this country with nothing and pull yourself \nup by your bootstraps. You can be a guy working 1,500 feet underground \nin the mines in Ely, MN, and your granddaughter can be a Senator. You \ncan be someone with mental illness, such as Paul's brother, and grow up \nto get a college degree and be a teacher. You can be a victim of \ndomestic violence and get your life back together and have a home for \nyour kids. That is what Paul and Sheila stood for. That was their \nlegacy.\n  Today in our State of Minnesota and throughout this country and this \nCapitol, we think of them and what they stood for, and we pledge to \nwork again to fill their legacy.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am delighted to come to the floor \ntoday. I heard this morning the announcement by the Democratic leader, \nMr. Reid, that we probably will not bring the remaining five \nappropriations bills to the floor of the Senate before the year is out. \nQuite frankly, when the Republicans or Democrats have been in charge \nlately, it seems we have gotten into this situation going well past the \nfiscal year without acting on all the appropriations acts.\n  It seems to me as if, my ninth year in the Congress and my third year \nin the\n\n[[Page S13395]]\n\nSenate, more often than not we end up with minibuses or omnibuses. We \nroll tremendous appropriations bills one into the other, pass them at \nthe end of the night, and find out weeks later what is in them. That is \nnot good regardless of your party, and it is certainly not good for the \nUnited States of America.\n  I come to the floor this morning to talk about some suggestions that \nhave been made by some very distinguished and learned Members of this \nbody on both sides of the aisle about opening our appropriations \nprocess, diagnosing the problems with it, and fixing it statutorily.\n  I particularly call the attention of the body to Senator Domenici \nfrom New Mexico, one of the longest serving Members of the Senate. He \nwill be retiring at the end of next year. He has introduced \nconsistently every year a biennial budget. The idea is that we \nappropriate in 2-year bites rather than a 1-year bite, and we do \noversight in the second year.\n  Think about this for a second. What if the Congress did \nappropriations bills in odd-numbered years, meaning we spent the money \nin odd-numbered years and in even-numbered years, the same year we are \nup for reelection, we do oversight. So all of a sudden our debate and \nraces are not about what we are going to spend but how our money is \nbeing spent. That is responsible, it is smart, and it makes sense.\n\n  Those who object will jump up and say: Oh, well, then we will just \nhave a lot of emergency appropriations bills. Give me a break. Have you \nseen how many emergencies we have done in the last 2 years? We have \nemergencies come up all the time. Of course, you are going to have \nthose. The emergency that exists is not the fear of having an emergency \nbut the fact that once again this year we have gone past the end of the \nfiscal year, and we are operating under a continuing resolution. The \nUnited States has an untold number of issues that must be dealt with, \nand we are on cruise control in terms of the appropriations of our \ncountry. It is not right.\n  Now, I have voted for some appropriations bills, and I have voted \nagainst some appropriations bills. I am glad we have gotten seven done. \nBut we have five out there that all of a sudden are probably going to \nget rolled in with about three or four others, get vetoed, and then get \nrolled into an omnibus. We will fly in here in the dead of night, have \na document on our desk that is probably as thick as five or six \nconcrete blocks stacked on top of one another, in very fine print, and \nwe will be asked to cast a vote on how we are going to spend the money \nof the taxpayers of the United States. It is not right.\n  We need to look at new and creative ways to run the Government of the \nUnited States and its fiscal affairs. I commend Senator Domenici's \nappropriations recommendation and the idea of the biannual budget, and \nI encourage this body to start looking at a constructive solution like \nthat. Senator Voinovich, who ran the State of Ohio--he has been a \nGovernor--and is as sound a fiscal person as you want to find in this \nSenate, pointed out as well yesterday that the whole situation is just \nbroken. We have entitlements on cruise control, discretionary spending \nin a continuing resolution, and we in the Congress fight over little \ntiny parts of the appropriations process when we ought to be \nconsidering it in its totality. We should take each of the 12 budget \nunits, bring them to the floor, debate them, pass them, and send them \nto the President. Do them responsibly, as we are expected to do.\n  When the announcement was made that we are not going to get to five \nappropriations bills this year, there was also an announcement that we \nare going to have an Omnibus appropriations bill. We are going to roll \nall the bills into one, not debate them, not make decisions based on \ntheir soundness, and not even, for most of us, have a say in it; \ncertainly not have a say during prime time or a say on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, I come today to talk about responsibility on behalf of \nour body and responsibility on behalf of the people of the United \nStates, and I urge the majority to join with us to seek out \nrecommendations such as those of Senator Domenici, seek out the sound \nadvice of Senator Voinovich, and let's get our fiscal affairs in order. \nIf we don't, we are going to waste more and more tax dollars and we are \ngoing to have more and more programs that go without oversight and we \nare going to spend dollar after dollar after dollar on old problems \nwhile our new problems and new challenges go unmet. It is not right for \nme, it is not right for you, Mr. President, and, most importantly, it \nis not right for the people of the United States.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, I want to speak from the heart on two \nmatters: one on my good friend, Paul Wellstone, who died in a plane \ncrash 5 years ago. Several speakers have spoken already, very \neloquently, about Paul Wellstone, a wonderful man.\n  He and I disagreed on many issues in this body, and yet we had a \nwonderful relationship because of the nature of the person he was. He \npracticed the art of disagreeing without being disagreeable. It is a \ntough art to do, particularly in legislative bodies it can be very \ndifficult. But he did it, and he did it very well. And he had a number \nof friends on both sides of the aisle from wide across the political \nspectrum.\n  Because of that attitude--and here is something I really want to say \nto my colleagues--Paul and I could get together on what I deemed to be \nthe most important piece of legislation that I have been a part of \nhere, as far as a primary sponsor, and that is the human trafficking \nwork that he and I started--actually, his wife got him focused on it, \nand she was killed in the same plane crash--where we started seeing \npeople trafficked into the United States and different places around \nthe world, and we wondered what is going on with this dark underside of \nthe globalization that is taking place. The way they saw it was his \nwife first started to see Ukrainian women trafficked into Minnesota and \nshowing up at battered women shelters. They had been trafficked into \nprostitution in the United States and then had shown up at battered \nwomen shelters. And they said, how did you get here? Then they started \nbacktracking the trail through gang activities, criminal activities, \norganized crime activities, that moved them from the Ukraine into the \nUnited States, into brothels, and then they were battered.\n\n  As they started to piece this together, they were seeing organized \ncrime which now we know is in many cases involved in human trafficking \naround the world and is the third leading source of income for \norganized crime now--trafficking. Much of it is women or young girls, \nin many cases if not most, that they are trafficking and trafficking \ninto prostitution.\n  Paul's wife first observed this. Paul got involved in it. I got \ninvolved in it, seeing it from another angle, and we were able to put \ntogether a coalition around that issue of human trafficking at an early \nphase, before we noticed that much. That included people from across \nthe political spectrum. Paul and myself--he a dedicated liberal, myself \na conservative--we had Gloria Steinem and Chuck Colson in this \ncoalition, pushing for a bill against human trafficking, the first \nlegislation we did here on that topic.\n  Because we were able to work together and reach out across the aisle \nand disagree about a lot of things but not be disagreeable and find \ncommon cause, we were able to deal with something that is a scourge on \nthis planet. As we globalize, walls come down, people are moved, many \ntimes illicitly, in many cases brutally, and in a lot of\n\n[[Page S13396]]\n\ncases are killed in the process, or seen as disposable people--which is \na term of art used by one of the authors, experts on this topic, who \nhas written a book called ``Disposable People.'' These are people who \nhave been trafficked. Then after they get diseased or run down, they \nare thrown out on the street as a disposable person. It is a very ugly \nthing.\n  Paul, with his heart of gold, saw this. I remember him complaining to \nme one day as I was coming out on the Senate floor. He came charging up \nto me and he said: You do this to me.\n  I said: What?\n  He was showing me the rankings and he was only the second most \nliberal in the Senate. In the prior years he was the most liberal. He \nsaid: You did that to me. If I hadn't been working with you, I would be \nthe most liberal still. He had that kind of sense of humor about him \nthat he would blame me.\n  He came up to me one day, where I was talking about life being sacred \nand precious, and I was saying I believe all life is sacred, it is \nprecious, a child of a loving God, and that includes Paul Wellstone and \nTed Kennedy too. He came out and said I like your line on this, even if \nI don't agree with your position on life. He enjoyed life. He lived it \nwell. I think he has also taught a good lesson for the rest of us about \ncore convictions. There is no problem with having core convictions. It \nis a good thing to have core convictions and to stand by those. It is \nalso a good thing to recognize when it is that the topics you are \ntalking about are not your core convictions, so you can reach out \nacross the aisle. I think maybe 30 percent of the topics around \nWashington, maybe more, could be less, are divisive ones, where there \nare divisions on both sides. But there is 70 percent we can work on. \nThe country is desperate to see us make Washington work, to see us \nreach across the aisle, to see us make it work on core topics.\n  Joe Biden and I held a press conference in Iowa about a political \nsolution in Iraq, and people were stunned, saying this is what we want \nto see; we want to see our country work on tough topics. We can do that \non issues such as cancer, the war on cancer--there is no division \nbetween the parties on that--and reaching across the aisle we can show \nthe American people a government that works. That is something we need \nto do. That is something I think would be in Paul Wellstone and his \nwife's legacy.\n  I remember them today and I hope all of us will remember them in our \nprayers, about what they gave to us. I often say you can't measure a \ntree very well until it is on the ground. Unfortunately, that is the \ncase with Paul, a wonderful guy with a wonderful heart. I disagreed \nwith him on a number of political issues, but I loved his style and \nloved the way he lived life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/25/senate-section/article/S13396-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 SUDAN\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wish to talk about the situation in \nSudan. The situation in Darfur has been widely noted and known. It is \ndeteriorating. It is deteriorating slowly. We want to get the factions \nback together to try to talk about what it is we can do to bring some \nstability.\n  Something that is not widely followed right now is the deteriorating \nsituation between the north and south. We have had a long-term peace \nagreement in place now for a couple of years between the north and \nsouth that ended the longest running civil war in Africa. It had been \ngoing on for 20 years. Two million people were killed. Now the south \nhas backed away somewhat from the government. The north government is \nnot complying with the peace agreement. I will be bringing out a more \nfull statement to my colleagues. This is very dangerous, as far as the \nsituation that now we could get back into a problem between the north \nand the south again, and have two fronts going.\n  In the south, long term, there was a genocide going on there before \nit took place in Darfur. We have to be vigilant toward the Sudanese \nGovernment, which is the problem. This is a genocidal government in \nKhartoum. We have to get on top of that situation and make sure it \ndoesn't deteriorate between the north along with what is taking place \nin the west and Darfur. It could well be that Sudan in the future is a \ncountry that breaks up into three or four different countries because \nof the way the Khartoum government is trying to force people into their \nideological box. It is a militant Islamist government started by Osama \nbin Laden, this iteration. It is the problem, but we have to deal with \nit, where it is in this situation. I don't want us to take our eyes off \nthe ball.\n\n  In the south, where there has been a lot of work over a long period \nof time to get that peace, I hope that we not lose that peace in the \noverall situation.\n  Finally, the President of Congo is in Washington now. I met with him \nyesterday, along with a number of my colleagues. One of the issues I \nwant to bring up here, and I will be developing some legislation, is \nthat a number of radical militant groups are raiding in the eastern \npart of the Congo. They are dislocating nearly 450,000 people now. In \nthese guerrilla movements, what they do is get control of an area and \nthen they get mineral rights for individuals or to groups to come in \nand mine things, such as coaltan. It is a particular metal used in \nmaking cell phones. That is how they finance their rebel movement. We \nsaw this in the blood diamond issue in western Africa. What we did then \nwas put a certification process together, that you had to certify that \nthe diamonds came from legitimate means, and that shut the financing \ndown.\n  My hope is we can do something similar in the Congo, where we can \nhave a certification on minerals like the coaltan and then shut the \nfinancing down for these groups that run civilian populations out of an \narea. I think that is something we can do credibly. Our markets and our \neconomy are our key foreign policy tools. Here is a place where we can \nuse the U.S. market to try to help bring stability to a region that is \nkey for stability throughout Africa. If we get stability in the Congo \nit might bring stability throughout the region. I hope we can do those \nthings.\n  I appreciate my colleagues' time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, someone asked me once how I would describe \nmy politics. I told them: I believe in the Gospels of Saint Paul. Paul \nDouglas. Paul Simon. And Paul Wellstone.\n  They were, in my opinion, three of the best public servants I have \nknown. I had the privilege to know each of them and be inspired by \nthem. Not a week goes by that I do not draw on some lesson or some \ntruth they taught me.\n  Today, I find myself thinking especially of Paul Wellstone. It was 5 \nyears ago today that Paul and his wife Sheila died in a plane crash in \nheavy fog in the Iron Range of northern Minnesota. The information \nreached us in Chicago a few hours later. I was asked to comment on \nlocal television station. I am sure that the emotion in my voice \nbetrayed my real feelings about this great man, and Sheila.\n  Also lost in the crash were Paul and Sheila's daughter Marcia; their \nfriends and campaign workers, Will McLaughlin, Tom Lapic and Mary \nMcEvoy; and the plane's pilots, Richard Conroy and Michael Guess.\n  To understand who Paul Wellstone was and what he meant to so many \npeople, listen to this story from John Nichols, the Washington \ncorrespondent for ``The Nation.''\n  Two hours after the plane crash, he had just finished delivering a \nkeynote speech to about 150 family farm activists in a small town in \nWisconsin when the conference organizer whispered the news to him. \nThese were people who knew Paul Wellstone as the college professor who \nwas willing to march with them--and even to be arrested with them--to \nprotest family farm foreclosures. When he was elected to the Senate, \nthey thought of Paul Wellstone as their Senator, whether or not they \nlived in Minnesota.\n  When they learned that he had died, John Nichols wrote: ``Cries of \n``No!'' and ``My God! My God!'' filled the room, as grown men felt for \ntables to keep their balance, husbands and wives hugged one another and \neveryone began an unsuccessful struggle to choke back tears. The group \ngathered\n\n[[Page S13397]]\n\nin a large circle. People wept in silence until, finally, a woman began \nto recite the Lord's Prayer for the son of Russian Jewish immigrants \nwho had touched the lives and the hearts of solid Midwestern Catholic \nand Lutheran farmers who do not think of themselves as having many \nfriends in Congress.\n  ``He was our flagbearer,'' one woman said. ``There are plenty of \npeople in Congress who vote right, but Paul did everything right. We \ndidn't have to ask him, we didn't have to lobby him, he understood. It \nwas like having one of us in Congress.''\n  That was how Paul Wellstone wanted it. He once said: People have to \nbelieve you are on their side, that someone in the Senate is listening. \nIf there is someone in Congress, maybe just one person, it gives them a \nsense that change is possible.\n  Paul Wellstone was, by some standards, one of the unlikeliest \nSenators ever. His first election, in 1990, remains one of the great \nupset victories in Minnesota history. He was a college professor taking \non an incumbent Senator. His campaign had very little money.\n  He bought his first three suits--for $100 apiece--during that \ncampaign, and crisscrossed Minnesota in an old green school bus that \nalways seemed to be breaking down.\n  No matter. What he lacked in money and consultants, he more than made \nup for in ideas and passion and hustle. ``Politics,'' he said, ``is \nwhat we create by what we do, what we hope for, and what we dare to \nimagine.''\n  Minnesotans believed him, and sent him to the U.S. Senate--the only \nchallenger to defeat an incumbent Senator that year.\n  Even with his new suits, Paul Wellstone stood out in the Senate. \nDuring his first weeks here, one reporter wrote that he ``projects an \nimage of barely in-control energy and enthusiasm.'' Another reporter \ndescribed how ``he has a habit of going pie-eyed with excitement and \npumping the air with his hands.''\n  I remember him in the back row here. He used to like to get a long \ncord on his microphone and range all over that area, just walking and \ntalking and waving his arms with that kind of stumbling gait that was \npart of the back injury that had haunted him most of his adult life. \nWhen he got going, people were listening, always.\n  When Paul Wellstone was in junior high, his mother--a Ukrainian \nimmigrant--worked in the cafeteria of his school--a fact that \nembarrassed her son greatly. Later in life, whenever he visited a \nschool, he always introduced himself to the cafeteria workers.\n  He did the same thing in the Senate. He seemed to know every security \nguard, kitchen worker, and elevator operator in this Capitol Building \nby name.\n  But this is what was different about Paul Wellstone: He didn't just \ntalk to cafeteria workers; he voted as a Senator with them in mind. As \nhe said, ``Some people are here to fight for the Rockefellers. I'm here \nto fight for the little fellers.'' I am sure Jay Rockefeller didn't \ntake offense.\n  Paul Wellstone fought for family farmers on the edge of foreclosure, \nfor workers facing layoffs, for older people trying to decide which \nprescription to fill this month. He and Sheila--his indispensable \npartner for 39 years--fought for women and children threatened by \nviolence.\n  He fought for teachers and coal miners. For veterans. For people \nsuffering the sting of discrimination and denial because of race, \ngender, sexual orientation, or physical or mental disability.\n  He fought for immigrant parents who work at less-than-minimum-wage \njobs. He listened to them, and looked them in the eye. And when he did, \nhe used to say, he saw his own parents.\n  He fought for ``good education, good health care, and good jobs.'' He \ndemanded fairness for those to whom life had been unfair. He gave \npeople hope and courage.\n  It didn't matter to him if he was on the wrong end of a 99-to-1 vote. \nHe voted his conscience. I was in the Senate one day when we had a vote \non a defense-related issue. I had decided that I was going to vote \nagainst an amendment about to be called by one of the Senators on the \nother side of the aisle. As is custom in the Senate, they roll through \nthe rollcall and recount who voted how. When they listed the names in \nthe negative, mine was the only name they mentioned and I realized I \nwas by myself, and I said, ``Where's Wellstone?'' And darned if he \ndidn't walk through the door and vote ``no'' with me. That's the kind \nof person he was. He wasn't afraid to be the only one or the only one \nof two Senators voting on an issue.\n  Now, Paul Wellstone was a wrestler not just with issues but \nliterally--he was a champion wrestler in high school. In the Senate--\neven with that bad back and hobbled by M.S.--he remained incredibly \nstrong. He held the push-up record at the Capitol police gym: 91 in 1 \nminute. But it was his strength of character, even more than his \nstrength of body, that was truly extraordinary.\n  I remember the night the Senate voted on the Iraq war resolution. Mr. \nPresident, there were 23 of us who voted against the Iraq war \nresolution. Three of us remained on the floor afterwards--three of us \nwho had voted no. The Chamber was clear; it was late at night. I recall \nwalking up to Paul Wellstone, who was in a tight election contest back \nin Minnesota, and saying to him: Paul, I hope this doesn't cost you the \nelection. And he said to me: It's OK if it does. This is what I believe \nand this is who I am. The people of Minnesota would not expect anything \nless.\n  That was it. A handful of words, summarizing who he was and what he \nbelieved in and what he thought politics was all about. That was the \nlast conversation that I had with Paul Wellstone before he lost his \nlife in that plane crash 5 years ago today.\n  Much was lost in that crash. But much survives. To keep their \nparents' work alive, Paul and Sheila's sons, Mark and David, have \nstarted a progressive advocacy organization called Wellstone Action. \nPerfect. In the last 4 years, more than 14,300 people have attended \n``Camp Wellstone'' workshops in nearly every state, where they have \nlearned to how to make politics relevant and effective. And here I am \ngoing to give a plug: if you want to know more about their good work, \ngo to their Web site: www.wellstone.org. Take a look.\n  The Senate is fortunate to still have the service of talented, \npassionate men and women who learned from Paul Wellstone himself. I \ncount myself lucky as one of those lucky ones.\n  One thing I will close with: One of Paul Wellstone's real passions \nwas this issue of discrimination against the mentally ill. It touched \nhis life and his family and he knew it personally and was determined to \nmake sure those suffering from mental illness had a fair shake for \nhealth insurance and medical services. He did not get the job done by \nthe time he left us in the Senate, but that battle was carried on \nvaliantly by Senator Ted Kennedy and Senator Pete Domenici, who passed \nthe legislation. I hope that the House will pass a similar bill soon so \nwe can honor Paul Wellstone and do something important.\n  Paul Wellstone was full of hope. A reporter who knew him well \nrecalled a conversation they had after the 1994 elections, when \nDemocrats lost control of both Houses of Congress for the first time in \ndecades.\n  This is what he wrote:\n\n       Wellstone was upset but not down. ``We don't have time for \n     despair,'' he said. ``The fight doesn't change. It just gets \n     harder. But it's the same fight.''\n\n  I wish Paul Wellstone were here today. Of all of the thousands of men \nand women I have served with in the House and Senate he and Congressman \nMike Synar of Oklahoma are two that I always wish were around for a \nphone call, for a word of advice--just to sit with for a few moments \nand hear their brand of politics.\n  If Paul Wellstone were here today I know what he would tell us: Don't \ngive up. Don't despair. There are so many people counting on you. \nYou've got to keep fighting. So let's do more than just honor and miss \nour friend today. Let's vow to stick together, pick up the fallen \nstandard and continue his work.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I want to rise to take the floor for a \nfew moments to reflect and to pause to think about the life and legacy \nof former Senator Paul Wellstone and his wife Sheila.\n  It was 5 years ago today that we suffered the terrible tragedy of \nSenator Wellstone's death, tragedy for my State, for the entire Nation.\n\n[[Page S13398]]\n\n  Senator Wellstone and I had been engaged in a very hard-fought and \nvigorous election contest. We were about 10 days from the election. I \nthink everybody in our State reflects on where they were at the moment \nthey heard the news. We were both, Senator Wellstone and myself, on the \nway to a debate in Duluth, MN. I was up in Grand Rapids flying in on a \nKing Air plane, the same type of plane Senator Wellstone was flying \nwhen it went down and caused his death and the death of his wife \nSheila, their daughter Marcia, and five others.\n  We were about to get in our plane, probably about 25 miles, somewhere \nin the same area as the Senator. We heard the news with a great sense \nof disbelief, we knelt down and said our prayers for the Senator, for \nhis wife, for the others who died.\n  The news was met by disbelief, shock, and sadness. In the hours that \nfollowed, it was as if the entire State of Minnesota had stopped. For \nso many Minnesotans, regardless of where you stood politically or \nwhether you agreed with Senator Wellstone's politics, you admired him \nand his unwavering commitment to the things he cared about most. He was \nso passionate about what he believed.\n  That admiration is evidenced in folks such as Mary Oberg, who lives \nnot far from me in St. Paul. I was looking at a piece on Public Radio \ntoday. She was not far from being in St. Paul. In a news story I read, \nshe said she did not necessarily support all of Paul's views, but she \nliked the fact that there is still a memorial bench in her \nneighborhood, in my neighborhood, that honors Senator Wellstone to this \nday.\n  It shows respect, Mary said. And that is what is lacking in the world \ntoday, is a lack of respect for others. This is a magnificent \ninstitution. I see my colleague from West Virginia is here. He has been \nhere a long time, has a great sense of history--I try to visit with him \nas often as I can--a great sense of collegiality.\n  In a world that has become so divisive and so partisan, so angry, \nwhether in this Chamber or in the House Chamber, Senator Wellstone \nreflected in the passion for his belief that politics was not a death \nsport, it was something which you could agree to disagree and still \nshake a hand and ask: How are you doing? And move on. The kind of \nrespect that Mary Oberg reflected on was that hallmark of Senator \nWellstone himself.\n  His passion, enthusiasm, and energy for public service is something \nthat inspires me, as it inspired so many folks that have followed his \nfootsteps into public service. Nowhere was that passion more clear than \nin his unyielding support for those individuals who suffered the \nravages of mental illness. Since he arrived in the Senate, he worked \nday in and day out to pass mental health parity legislation; put an end \nto the discrimination against people with mental illness and chemical \naddiction.\n  Paul was also willing to put aside politics on this important issue. \nHe worked hand in hand with another champion for mental health issues, \nSenator Pete Domenici, another individual who has been around here for \nmany years and was and is so passionate about that issue.\n  Working together, Senators Domenici and Wellstone helped millions of \nAmericans overcome the stigma surrounding mental health disorders. \nMillions of Americans were able to seek treatment and gain hope through \ntheir powerful commitment to this issue.\n  I cannot imagine a better way to honor Paul's legacy than sending a \nstrong mental health parity bill to the President of the United States \nand have him sign it into law.\n  I also want to comment about a unique living memorial to the \nWellstones, and that is the Paul and Sheila Wellstone Center for \nCommunity which opened its doors a year ago. It is truly a Paul and \nSheila Wellstone kind of place. It stands literally where the East \nmeets the West. Since Paul came from the East, as I did, he probably \nfelt very much at home in our ethnic neighborhoods, filled with middle-\nclass working families.\n  It was constructed, in large measure, with $10 million generously \nprovided by this Chamber. The Paul and Sheila Wellstone Center is a \n100,000 square foot facility with meeting places for a variety of \ncultural, social, and civic activities for people of all backgrounds. \nIt also serves as an education and training center.\n  The west side is kind of like our Ellis Island. It is the place \nwhere, in the Midwest, immigrant groups came in in the old days. It was \nthe Jews and Lebanese; today it is the Hmong and the Somalis.\n  A community center is a poor substitute for the real thing, Paul and \nSheila themselves, but it is worth doing, providing a safe place where \nkids can learn and play, families can receive training and support, \ncommunity members can be organized to fight injustice and partake in \nthe American dream.\n  These and so many other issues that Paul cared about transcended \npartisan politics and ideology. The greatest legacy to Senator \nWellstone is to stay rooted in his belief that Government has an \nobligation to do what it can do, which is to help those who need help \nthe most.\n  Five years later, I certainly have a greater understanding and \nappreciation for the challenges that Senator Wellstone faced and others \nthat came before him of serving in a Congress that is too often \ngoverned by partisanship rather than a culture and a commitment to \ngetting things done.\n  I have made a commitment to follow in that tradition of working hard \nand being a vocal advocate for our great State. This anniversary should \nbe an occasion to celebrate the Wellstones' lives and to remember the \ncommitment Paul and his family made and continue to make using public \nservice to improve the lives of all people.\n  On this anniversary of their death, I hope everyone can continue to \nhold Paul, Sheila, their family, and the others who died in their \nterrible crash, hold them close in your hearts, hold them in your \nprayers, as my family and I will.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is hard to believe that it was 5 years \nago today we lost our dear friend and colleague--Paul Wellstone.\n  On a cold Minnesota morning, his life, along with his wife, daughter, \nthree staff members, and two pilots, was cut tragically short. It was a \nday that is burned into our memories, a day we will never forget.\n  Paul was a good man. He was a man who truly loved being a Senator. It \nwasn't the power and prestige that he loved, it was his ability to \nserve the people, to help those in need--especially those who otherwise \nwouldn't have had a voice.\n  He was a fighter. He fought for the underprivileged. For the \ndowntrodden. For those who otherwise had been forgotten. He fought for \nthe underdog--the little guy. And most of all he fought for what he \nbelieved in to be right and true.\n  Paul loved life and lived each day to the fullest. He always had a \nkind word and a smile to whom ever he came across. And he came to work \ndetermined to make our country and world a better place.\n  The Senate has changed a lot since Paul's death. The halls are a \nlittle quieter. There is a little less fire and brimstone on the Senate \nfloor. Paul was known for going to the floor and giving an impassioned \nspeech about how we had to provide better health care coverage for the \nmentally ill, assistance for domestic violence victims, better benefits \nfor our veterans, or education for our children.\n  While Paul was a hard-working, dedicated public servant, he was also \na family man who loved his wife, children, and grandchildren very much. \nHis best friend and companion in his life was his wife Sheila. She \ninspired him, was his constant companion, and she calmed him. Their \nlove was one of a kind. In many ways it is fitting they left this Earth \ntogether.\n  While Paul is not here, his spirit lives on. He inspired all of us to \nbe better people. And his memory lives on. Paul's work is continued \nthrough his two sons Mark and David, Wellstone Action, and through his \nstaff--many of whom can still be seen in the halls today.\n  Like many of my colleagues in Congress, I miss my Paul. So let us \nremember him today and honor all of the work he did to make this \ncountry a better place for all of us.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is hard to believe that today marks 5 \nyears since an extraordinarily frigid and raining, tough day in October \nwhen we\n\n[[Page S13399]]\n\nwere stunned to hear the reports of the missing plane and then reports \nthat it carried our friend, Senator Wellstone, his wife Sheila, and his \ndaughter Marcia. I had just been with him in Minnesota hours earlier \nwhere his wife and he campaigned.\n  It was one of the moments you never forget. I remember feeling the \nawful, vivid contrasts of a world transformed. October 25, our friend \nand colleague was gone--but October 24 he had been right there with us \nfull of life. I was in the Twin Cities at Sam Kaplan's house at a \nWellstone campaign event with Paul's wife, Sheila. Paul was campaigning \non the other side of the State, but he called into the event, and I \nwill never forget what it was like to hear that voice over the speaker \nphone--loud, clear, strong--Paul Wellstone, that voice full of passion \nand commitment.\n  It was a sad and sickening feeling to hear the next day that both of \nthem were gone.\n  In the last 5 years, I can't tell you how many times how many of us, \nin tough fights and lonely stands, have wished we had Paul Wellstone in \nour corner here on the floor of the Senate.\n  Paul and Sheila Wellstone were an extraordinary couple. They were the \nbest people in politics and in life--the most caring, the most giving, \nthe most sincere and genuine people I have ever met or will ever meet.\n  Paul was the Pied Piper of modern politics--so many people heard him \nand wanted to follow him in his fight. Joyful, rumpled, the genuine \narticle--we all admired Paul for his energy and his independence, his \nspirit and his zest for making people's lives better and inspiring \nothers to do the same.\n  It is impossible to measure the number of lives Paul touched. So many \npeople who never even knew him are better off because of him. When I \nran for President in 2004, at rope lines around the country, people \nwould come up to me after rallies--people in wheelchairs, people with \ncancer, veterans, senior citizens, farmers--and they would place in my \npalm that familiar, cherished Wellstone button, or one of those green \nribbons lovingly created after Paul passed away. These were talismans. \nWords didn't need to be spoken--you could see it in their eyes, you \ncould see how much he meant--even 2 years later, he was still their \nchampion, he was still their voice.\n  Right in front of my eyes, in their faces, I could see the legacy of \na man who lived Hubert Humphrey's credo: ``The moral test of government \nis how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life, the \nchildren; those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those \nwho are in the shadows of life, the sick, the needy and the \nhandicapped.'' Paul's politics was a moral politics.\n  To all the people who worked for him, who loved him, he was never \nSenator Wellstone, or ``the Senator''--he was just Paul, and Paul \nWellstone wouldn't have had it any other way. He was the champion in \nthe Senate for issues that some people didn't think were politically \npopular--the Hmong in Minnesota, Native Americans on the reservations, \nthe poor, children, stopping drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife \nReserve thousands of miles from his home. I still remember after our \nvictory on that filibuster, the image of Paul walking into the rally--\nlimping--his back hurting from a condition that caused him pain right \nto the end, absolutely unbowed, the look on his face was pure joy--the \nexuberance of having succeeded at doing something because it was the \nright thing to do.\n  He understood that values had to be not just spoken but actually \nlived. As he said: Politics is what we do. Politics is what we do, \npolitics is what we create, by what we work for, by what we hope for \nand what we dare to imagine.\n  I will never forget, 3 years ago, standing next to Bruce Springsteen, \nat rallies of 50,000, 60,000, 80,000 people--in Madison, WI, and \nCleveland, OH--people standing in the chill and the rain and the wind--\npeople who were there because, just like Paul, they loved their country \nso much they wanted to change it--and I still remember the response--\nthe tears and the joy and, above all, the hope--when Bruce Springsteen \nwould quote words from Paul that ought to ring true for all of us:\n  The future will not belong to those who sit on the sidelines. The \nfuture will not belong to the cynics. The future belongs to those who \nbelieve in the beauty of their dreams.\n  Paul and Sheila Wellstone aren't here with us in Washington, but they \ncontinue to remind us what we can have if we believe once again in our \nhighest hopes and our strongest ideals. They continue to remind us of \nwhat is important--and what is worth fighting for.\n  I want to say for the record today that Paul Wellstone and his \npolitics are much missed.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, 5 years ago today, Senator Paul Wellstone, \nhis wife Sheila, his daughter Marcia, and three of his staff perished \nin a plane crash.\n  This was a tragic loss to the Wellstone family, including his two \nsurviving sons, David and Mark, his State, our Nation, and this body.\n  His passion, energy, and commitment on behalf of the ``little \nguys''--all those without a voice, including children, the poor, the \nhomeless, victims of domestic violence, the mentally ill--serves as an \nexample to us all.\n  He was a champion for all those who needed one, and for doing what is \nright. This was well-illustrated in his unwavering devotion to the \nfight for mental health parity, robust education funding, and \naffordable housing.\n  Senator Wellstone worked tirelessly to achieve fairness in the \ntreatment of mental illness. On September 18, the Senate unanimously \npassed mental health parity. In the other body, the Paul Wellstone \nMental Health and Addiction Equity Act recently moved through \ncommittee.\n  We must continue the fight toward final passage of mental health \nparity. I look forward to that day, which will be a historic \nachievement, and an enduring memorial to the life of this great man.\n  I was honored to serve with Senator Wellstone for over 4 years on the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. He was a consistent \nand powerful advocate for increased education funding and ensuring our \nchildren possess the necessary skills and tools to compete in an ever-\nexpanding global economy.\n  During the debates on the No Child Left Behind Act in 2001, he would \nsay, ``We cannot realize the goal of leaving no child behind on a tin \ncup budget.'' Unfortunately, today we are still struggling to provide \nmore than that ``tin cup'' budget as the President has cumulatively \nunderfunded title I of the No Child Left Behind Act, the Federal \nGovernment's most significant commitment to K-12 education, by over $43 \nbillion since its enactment. As such, his words seem more appropriate \nthan ever.\n  Senator Wellstone worked on a multitude of issues, but I want to \ntouch on just one other today, and that is affordable housing. At \nSenator Wellstone's suggestion, on April 15, 2002, I flew out to \nMinnesota to hold a Banking Committee Subcommittee on Housing and \nTransportation field hearing on ``Affordable Housing and Working \nFamilies.''\n  At the time, Minnesota had one of the Nation's highest rates of \nhomeownership, yet one of the worst affordable rental housing shortages \nin the country. It was our hope that we could learn more about the \naffordable housing crisis impacting working families, and how \ngovernment could best work with the private sector to address the \nproblem.\n  Paul's passion for this issue and his special connection to his \nconstituents was apparent throughout this hearing. He was intent on \nfiguring out what obstacles stood in the way of creating more \naffordable housing, and what the Federal Government could do to help. \nPaul believed in democracy with a small ``d,'' and he allowed anyone in \nthe audience who had something to say to come up to the microphone and \ntell the U.S. Senate what it might do to help.\n  Paul's untimely death was a huge blow to many of us. He inspired us \nevery day to focus on those who were less fortunate, and that legacy \nmust continue to live on.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today, as we mark the fifth \nanniversary of the death of Senator Paul Wellstone, I am reminded of \nwhat Herbert Humphrey--\n\n[[Page S13400]]\n\nanother great Minnesotan that served in the Senate--once said:\n\n       The moral test of government is how that government treats \n     those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who \n     are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are \n     in the shadows of life, the sick, the needy, and the \n     handicapped.\n\n  This quote always reminds me of the way Paul lived his life and the \nlegacy he has left behind.\n  Five years ago on this day, we lost a colleague, a progressive \nadvocate, and a Senator who devoted every fiber of his being to \nbuilding a better, fairer America. Many of us also lost a close friend \nwho we admired and looked to for advice and support. Paul always stood \nup for what he believed in and gave a voice to those who were not given \na seat at the table. He was the People's Senator through and through.\n  In the Senate, Paul championed mental health parity legislation to \nhelp end discrimination against people living with mental illness. It \nwas a personal struggle for him, as he came to understand the issue \nthrough the experiences of his brother. I had the privilege of working \nwith Paul as First Lady and as a member of the Senate's Heath, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions committee, where no issue was too \ndifficult or challenging, large or small, for Paul to tackle if he \nthought it would make a positive difference in someone's life.\n  I remember when I heard that the plane carrying Paul, his wife \nSheila, their daughter Marcia, and three of his campaign aides had \ncrashed. Many of us did not want to believe it. No longer would our \nfriend and Senator--indefatigable--come bursting through the doors of \nthe Senate floor, ready to speak out, ready to right a wrong, or \naddress a problem that had to be solved. No longer would Sheila, a \ndynamic presence in her own right, travel across Minnesota and the \ncountry and spread the word about domestic violence and so many other \nworthy causes.\n  To ensure that their legacy lived on, more than three years ago, an \norganization called Wellston Action was established to honor both Paul \nand his wife Sheila. Through hard work and dedication, Wellstone Action \nhas been able to grow tremendously and preserve the Wellstone way for \nfuture generations.\n  We have a duty in the Senate to never let Paul's legacy fade. I said \nit 5 years ago and today I reiterate it again, we must work towards the \ngoals and ideals Paul fought for day in and day out: to strengthen our \neducation system, our health care system, our economy, civil and human \nrights, our Nation. We still feel in our hearts and in our lives this \ngrievous, tragic loss. Today, we not only look back on the life of a \nSenator who stood up for what he believed in, we look forward to \ncarrying on what he taught us.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to honor the life of one of \nthe finest men I have known in this body: Senator Paul Wellstone of \nMinnesota. Paul--along with his wife Sheila and his daughter Marcia; \nhis staff members Will McLaughlin, Tom Lapic, and Mary McEvoy; and \npilots Richard Conry and Michael Guess--died in a plane crash 5 years \nago to the day. Five years, half a decade already: The time has passed \nso quickly that it comes as a shock to stop and recall just how long \nPaul has been gone. In marking his death, we remember that the years \nare passing just as fast for each of us, and that they can take us, as \nthey took our friend Paul, when we are least ready to go. What a \nprivilege we have to serve here--what a short time we are given! Paul's \ndeath and Paul's life remind us to fill that short time with all the \nbest we can bring. Paul Wellstone did: He lived just 58 years, and yet \nit seems that in that time, he lived enough to fill two or three or \nfour lives.\n  Paul was a champion wrestler who became a champion scholar; a \ntireless activist and organizer who became a beloved professor; \neverywhere and always a fighter, full of energy and zeal and real love \nfor the people he spoke for in this Chamber. He was, in the proud \ntradition of his State, one of the happiest warriors I have ever known. \nHe was an intellectual, a Ph.D., but never abstract; all the theories \nin the world meant nothing to Paul if they couldn't lift up the single \nmother struggling to support a family or the torture victim seeking \nrefuge in America or the sufferer of mental illness marked with an \nunjust stigma.\n  Paul suffered with each of them. In fact, the pain that Paul felt in \nhis life--the ache of his multiple sclerosis, the challenges of growing \nup the son of immigrants, the pain of his brother's mental illness--\nbecame his most powerful political weapon. Pain cuts some of us off, \nbut not Paul Wellstone: He found the greatest salve in reaching out, in \ntraveling up and down Minnesota in the dead of winter in his rickety \ngreen campaign bus; in taking time to thank the cooks, waiters, and \njanitors who served at so many of Paul's events; in stretching out an \nappearance to two or three times its planned length because he was so \ncaught up in a conversation, until his staff were forced to grab him by \nthe arm and literally drag him out of the room.\n  He was given 12 years to make his mark in the Senate. And in that \ntime, he helped ensure that toddlers all through this country would \nhave a head start in life. He ensured that his State would be a refuge \nfor victims of torture who came here from the dungeons of Central \nAmerica or Asia. He fought hard against sex trafficking and against \ndomestic violence with Sheila Wellstone, herself a leading advocate for \nbattered women. He helped make sure that families stayed warm in the \nwinter, because the government gave them the heating assistance they \nneeded. And inspired by the struggles of his brother, he struggled to \nend the discrimination against the mentally ill by insurers. In that \nlast cause, I was particularly proud to stand beside Paul; and finally \nenacting mental health parity legislation would be a fitting honor to \nhis memory.\n  Paul did so much more than ever could be expected with the short time \nhe was given; he was driven by an untiring spirit. But he also \nunderstood that legislation, as much good as it has the power to do, is \nsomething of a symptom, an outward phenomenon; the deeper causes of \nwhat we accomplish in this Chamber are the movements and forces that \nput us in office, that make one cause prosper and another weaken--\nPaul's ear was to the ground and his eyes were on the roots. He was a \nSenator-organizer: and as much energy as he put into legislating, he \nput more into building a movement that would outlast him.\n  So I wish that Paul were still at his desk in this room today; maybe \ngrayer and a little more stooped, but still giving his all to the fight \nto end a misguided war, one he opposed since the outset, or pouring out \nall his passion against torture and lawlessness in our own government. \nI wish we still had his voice.\n  But on another level, I know that it doesn't matter. The activists \nand candidates and grassroots organizers trained by Wellstone Action, a \nnonprofit set up in Paul's name, still memorize a phrase he used to \nremind us all that politics is first and foremost about those we serve: \n``It's not about me, it's not about me, it's not about me.'' Paul knew \nthat the name at the top of the bill, the politician at the top of a \nballot, the voice speaking the words matters little. The citizens whom \nwe serve are the ones who matter most, and Paul's commitment was, first \nand foremost, to those of our citizens whose lives are spent at the \nmargins of our society.\n  ``Some people,'' Paul's home newspaper wrote today, ``live lives so \nlarge that they never really die.'' It was true of Paul Wellstone, and \nhis wife Sheila, and his daughter Marcia. May we live in their example, \nso that those words will one day be true of each of us.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, 5 years ago today, our colleague Paul \nWellstone and his wife Sheila Wellstone were killed in a plane crash in \nnorthern Minnesota. It hardly seems like 5 years.\n  I remember that morning I was on the road driving in a van to Grand \nForks, ND, going to a meeting when I received a call that an airplane \nhad gone down in northern Minnesota and it was the plane that Paul and \nhis wife Sheila and some staff were on. They feared that the crash had \ntaken their lives.\n  I was thinking as I was coming over here today that the day Paul and \nSheila were killed was very much like today--a gray day with rain and \nmoisture. Paul and his wife were on a plane\n\n[[Page S13401]]\n\nflying to a funeral in northern Minnesota. They lost their lives. They \nwere in the final stages of a very aggressive Senate campaign, one I \nbelieve Paul would have won. I believe he would have retained his seat \nin the Senate. He cared deeply about his opportunities, his privilege, \nand his obligation as a Senator.\n  A couple weeks ago, I was on the campus of the University of North \nCarolina at Chapel Hill, and I was walking across the commons of the \ncampus and looked to my left and I saw a small memorial garden to Paul \nand Sheila Wellstone. I didn't know it, but I asked someone why that \ngarden existed on the campus of the University of North Carolina. They \nsaid because it was where Paul Wellstone earned his PhD, where Paul \nWellstone had been a college wrestler and, I believe, a college \nchampion wrestler. I had not known that previously. Nonetheless, there \nis a tribute to Paul and Sheila Wellstone on the campus of the \nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n  Last week, I was visited in my office by about eight people to \npresent me with a framed plaque of sorts because of Paul Wellstone. I \nwas thinking of that as I came to the floor as well. This was a group \nof people who represented the major automobile industry in this \ncountry, the large auto producers, and the independent shops around the \ncountry that do automobile repair. I had nearly forgotten about what \nhad gone on as a result of this, but they asked to come and see me and \nthey came in and said: You and Senator Paul Wellstone 6 years ago did \nsomething that made a big difference, and we wanted to recognize that \nwork. I said: I am happy about that, but let me make sure you recognize \nand let me accept it for Paul Wellstone in his memory.\n  Paul sat in that desk right back there on the end. It was on the \nfloor of the Senate that he came to me breathless--and he was usually \nbreathless because he had so much energy and passion about things--and \nhe said: I went to an automobile repair shop in Minnesota, a small \nfamily-owned auto repair shop. They told me they cannot get the codes \nfor the new automobiles in order to be able to repair them because the \nautomobile manufacturers have these codes in their computers and they \nwon't provide them to the independent auto repair shops, which means \nwhen you buy a car at a dealership, you have to go back to the \ndealership to get it fixed. In order to get a diagnostic, you have to \nhave the codes and they won't give the independents these codes.\n  He said: Byron, that is an outrage. I want you to hold a hearing on \nthat.\n  I chaired the appropriate subcommittee in the Commerce Committee, and \nI said I would be glad to do that. Why don't you come and be a part of \nthe hearing and sit on the dais. He was not on the Commerce Committee. \nI invited him to make a statement and ask questions. So we held a \nhearing in the Commerce Committee. The room was full of people \nrepresenting the independent auto repair shops around the country. We \nhad a lot of them travel to Washington, DC.\n  There was testimony by the automobile manufacturers and the folks \nrunning these little auto repair shops around the country. They had a \nbig disagreement. I felt and Paul felt it was unfair to the independent \nauto repair dealers, the small shops, not to be able to get the codes \nso they could fix these automobiles that were in disrepair.\n  I remember Paul's statement at the hearing sticking up for the little \nguy, saying these folks running these automobile independent repair \nstations should not be disadvantaged like this; they ought to have an \nopportunity to do this as well.\n  As a result of that hearing, the automobile manufacturers and the \nindependent repair shops decided they would work together and find a \nway to solve the problem. Last week, a group of them came to my office \nand presented me with something that said what you and Senator \nWellstone did required us to sit down and negotiate, and we negotiated \nand solved the problem, and now we provide the codes to the independent \nauto repair shops. The folks from the independent shops were there and \nsaid we now have a good relationship with the auto manufacturers.\n  That issue got solved because Paul Wellstone was standing up for the \nlittle guy. He went to a repair shop in Minnesota and found out the \nindependent owner of that shop was not being treated fairly, in his \nmind, and in my judgment. So he brought it to the Congress. We got \ntogether and held a hearing, and the result is this was solved. It was \nnegotiated in a way that was good for the consumer, good for the folks \nwho owned the automobile repair businesses and, frankly, good for the \nautomobile manufacturers. They have admitted that as well. I thank all \nof them for negotiating that in the right way.\n  Mostly, I thank Paul Wellstone for the energy he had in the Senate to \nalways stand up for the little guy. The interesting thing about Senator \nWellstone, however, is that as he stood over by that back seat over \nthere, on every single issue Paul Wellstone stood up and wanted to know \nhow it would affect kids--especially poor children in this \ncountry, many of whom feel hopeless and helpless, many of whom feel \nthey do not have the same opportunities. He was unrelenting in trying \nto make certain we pass legislation that gave America's kids a good \nopportunity to be successful.\n\n  The other issue for which all of us remember Paul Wellstone--and my \ncolleague, Senator Domenici, surely will because he was Senator \nDomenici's partner--is parity for mental health care because mental \nhealth care has not been treated the same way in most insurance \npolicies, and still is not in many insurance policies, as other health \ncare one might get. If one breaks an arm or a leg or has a disease, one \ngets health care treatment, and it gets covered by their insurance \npolicy. But mental health has been treated differently.\n  Paul devoted much of his time in the Senate saying we ought to be \nfair and have parity as to how mental health is treated in health \ninsurance policies in this country.\n  I came to the floor to observe, as others have today, that it is 5 \nyears to the day we lost a good friend. He was one of those who said: \nHere is what I am; here is who I am. I am not trimming my sails to make \nthings sound better for anybody. I am just going to fight as hard as I \ncan fight for issues I care about and issues I believe are right for \nMinnesota and our country. I have always admired that spirit.\n  Those of us who were privileged to be Paul's friend also know Paul \nWellstone was a team. It was Paul and Sheila Wellstone. Most of us in \nthe Senate who had the privilege of serving with Paul and knowing \nSheila and Paul as a team continue to miss them a great deal.\n  I wanted simply today to celebrate the memory of Paul Wellstone and \nSheila Wellstone and talk about the contributions they made in this \ncountry and the contributions through public service to their country.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, this is the fifth anniversary of the \ndeath of Paul and Sheila Wellstone. I wished to say a few words on \nthat. I was a friend of Paul's when I was in the House, and on some of \nthe important social and economic issues that I worked on there, he was \nthe person to whom I went, to work with a Member of the Senate.\n  I think history will remember Paul Wellstone as one of the great \nSenators of our time, not just because of his accomplishments but, more \nimportantly, because of the extraordinary vision that he had.\n  Paul believed very much that we could create a very different kind of \nworld than the world that we are living in right now. He was prepared \nand did stand up day after day on the floor of this Senate, taking on \nvirtually every powerful special interest that exploited working people \nand low-income people and who led us to wars we should not be fighting.\n  He was a man who believed passionately in a world of peace, in a \nworld of economic and social justice. That vision he brought forth is \nthe vision I hope nobody in the Senate, nobody in this country, ever \nforgets.\n  One of the major characteristics of Paul Wellstone is he understood \nthat the way we succeed politically is not simply by going out to the \nwealthy and the powerful begging for more and more campaign \ncontributions, which is what happens so often. He understood that the \nway to win elections is by rallying ordinary people at the grassroots \nlevel, and perhaps it is that achievement, from a political \nperspective, for\n\n[[Page S13402]]\n\nwhich he will most be remembered. I know in Minnesota he organized at \nthe grassroots and brought thousands and thousands of people who had \nnot been involved in the political process together to stand up under a \nprogressive program for economic justice and a world of peace. He \nunderstood profoundly something many here do not address: Real change \ntakes place from the bottom, not from the top, and when millions of \npeople stand up and say it is imperative that we have economic justice, \nthat we have a livable wage, that we have a health care program which \nguarantees health care to all of our people, that we protect our \nenvironment, when that comes from the grassroots, then we will succeed. \nHe was a tireless advocate of grassroots politics.\n  As someone who worked with Paul, who was very fond of both him and \nSheila, the vision they brought forth is something for which I will do \nmy best to continue advocating. His loss was a loss for the working \npeople, for the vast majority of the people of this country, and for \nthe Senate.\n  I will not forget what Paul Wellstone stood for.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor to pay special \ntribute to a very special individual who is no longer with us in the \nSenate. He was a friend to me, a tremendous U.S. Senator, and he was an \nadvocate for thousands and thousands of human beings across this \ncountry who may never have met him but for whom he spoke so eloquently. \nThat was Senator Paul Wellstone.\n  Five years ago today, we lost that friend, that Senator, that \npassionate advocate. Still every day I come to this floor, I can see \nhim here, raising his voice, throwing his arms out, speaking to \neveryone as if they were right in front of him about the issues he \ncared about.\n  Every one of us has special memories of Senator Wellstone, whether it \nwas his speeches on the floor of the Senate as he wandered back and \nforth and put his tremendous voice to such great use. For me \npersonally, it was listening to him talk about the issue of mental \nhealth. It was standing beside him when he introduced the bill to ban \nasbestos 6 years ago. We looked around, and we were a pretty lonely \ncrowd trying to make that happen. I know he would be so proud, wherever \nhe is up there today, looking down and knowing that this Senate 6 years \nlater passed a ban on asbestos.\n  It was such issues as the war where Senator Wellstone, even though he \nwas in a very tight election race at the time, stood his ground and \nsaid what he felt so strongly, that he could not vote for this country \nto go to war in Iraq. He feared no one in making that decision, even \nwith the election he was facing.\n  He was a friend and partner, someone I knew so well. My best memory \nof him was going to his State. He invited me there, as we all do with \nour other colleagues when we are out campaigning and ask them to help \nus. Senator Wellstone didn't ask me to come and do a fundraiser for \nhim. He didn't ask me to do a speech to some dignified crowd in some \nballroom. He didn't ask me to come and wear a suit. He asked me to come \nto his State the week before his election and do what he called ``a \npeople raiser.'' He did it in a gymnasium. He invited people to come \nand donate their time because of what he cared about, the issue he \nfought for, to bring people into politics. He did it that day in such a \ntremendous way. All of us who knew him knew he was never comfortable \ntalking to a crowd that was sitting down. He had to inspire them and \nhave them all standing in front of him and applauding. He did it every \ntime he spoke.\n  I miss him so much in the Senate. It is hard to believe it was 5 \nyears ago that we lost such a tremendous advocate. I think he would be \nproud of the legacy he left in his own family, in the issues he left \nfor many of us, and the passion as we move forward. I know if he were \nhere today he would be saying: Don't talk about me. He would be in a \nback room someplace making sure we never forgot the people who sent us \nhere and the tremendous issues they face at home. He would be inspiring \nsomebody to stand up and speak out.\n  I hope we continue to do that in his memory for many years to come.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, for those who served with him, the \ndeath of Paul Wellstone 5 years ago was such a shock because not only \ndid Paul represent intellect and vigor, he also, because of his \nenthusiasm and high energy level, represented a youthful picture. He \nlooked like a young guy, college-age person. When he spoke, he did it \nwith such energy that everybody would hear him or listen to him. If you \ndidn't hear him, he would make sure you heard him because he was never \nbashful about sticking up, about talking about things he believed in. \nThere was very little he did not believe in that would engage him so--I \nwill use the term--furiously in his presentation.\n  So it is appropriate we remember a distinguished Member of the \nSenate, who served only a short time, and was on his way for another \nterm. But his impact was enormous. I think in many ways he created a \npicture of courage and right that serves as a model for things we \ngenerally do here.\n  I, as so many here did, regarded him as a friend. I did not see him \nunable to talk to people on the Republican side of the aisle or \notherwise. No matter how vigorous his arguments were, no matter how \nenergetic his presentation was, the fact is, he would dismiss any \ndifference as a part of a normal process. He would continue on with his \ninsistence that what he did was right, but he was never righteous about \nit.\n  We will always think of him when we think of what is right to do in \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, 5 years ago today, our country lost a good \nman. Now, I am mindful of what the Scriptures say in that there is no \nman who is good. I am mindful of that. But this is a statement I am \nmaking, and in the context of the thoughts I wish to express, I am \ngoing to say: Five years ago today, our country lost a good man. It \nlost an outstanding Senator. It was 5 years ago today that Senator Paul \nWellstone and his wife Sheila and their daughter Marcia perished in a \ntragic plane crash.\n  Paul Wellstone died tragically, but he lived heroically. Paul \nWellstone was unique. I knew him. Paul Wellstone was priceless. Paul \nWellstone was irreplaceable. Paul Wellstone was a Senator of remarkable \nintegrity and remarkable courage.\n  Only a few days before his tragic death, I witnessed firsthand the \nintegrity and the courage of that Senator, Mr. Paul Wellstone.\n  Paul Wellstone was in the late stages of a close campaign for \nreelection. Paul Wellstone had been targeted for defeat by the George \nBush-Karl Rove political machine. And this Senate was about to vote on \nthe Iraq war resolution. I was here.\n  At that time, granting President Bush the authority for an invasion \nof Iraq was the political thing to do. The White House had convinced \nmost of the country that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction and \nthat Saddam Hussein was poised to use those weapons.\n  Many Americans had been frightened by a steady drumbeat of White \nHouse rhetoric about mushroom clouds and weapons of mass destruction. \nMany Americans had been convinced that the war would be brief and that \nour troops in Iraq would be welcomed with open arms.\n  Despite the then-prevailing view that voting against the Iraq war was \npolitical suicide, Senator Paul Wellstone--God rest his soul--Senator \nPaul Wellstone proudly and defiantly--do you hear that word \n``defiantly''--announced he would vote against it. I will never forget \nhis words.\n  Seldom have I been so impressed with the courage of a colleague. \nSenator Paul Wellstone took a principled stand, a stand that would \nundoubtedly cost him votes, and maybe his reelection.\n  Did Paul Wellstone flinch? No. He did not let that sway him. He stood \nagainst the White House. Paul Wellstone stood against the easy, popular \nwinds of the time. Paul Wellstone stood against the rush to war.\n  Senator Paul Wellstone placed the good of our country and the lives \nof young Americans far above his own reelection. That was Paul \nWellstone.\n  We needed more Senators like Paul Wellstone.\n  Paul Wellstone exemplified the courage of his convictions. Senator \nPaul Wellstone stood proudly against the rush--the rush--to war. \nSenator Paul\n\n[[Page S13403]]\n\nWellstone was brave. He was passionate. He was ever true to his \nconscience and to the people he represented. Despite the pain and the \ndifficulty of multiple sclerosis, Paul Wellstone carried on and made us \nall feel humbled and proud by his bravery.\n\n  When the Senate lost Senator Paul Wellstone 5 years ago today, the \nSenate and the country lost a man of remarkable integrity. How I wish \nour country had more men like him--Paul Wellstone.\n  I close this statement with a poem, a remarkable poem--a remarkable \npoem for a remarkable man.\n\n     God, give us men!\n     A time like this demands strong minds, great hearts, true \n           faith, and ready hands.\n     Men whom the lust of office does not kill;\n     Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy;\n     Men who possess opinions and a will;\n     Men who have honor; men who will not lie.\n     Men who can stand before a demagogue and brave his \n           treacherous flatteries without winking.\n     Tall men, sun-crowned;\n     Who live above the fog,\n     In public duty and in private thinking.\n     For while the rabble with its thumbworn creeds,\n     its large professions and its little deeds,\n     mingles in selfish strife, Lo! Freedom weeps!\n     Wrong rules the land and waiting justice sleeps.\n     God give us men!\n     Men who serve not for selfish booty;\n     But real men, courageous, who flinch not at duty.\n     Men of dependable character; men of sterling\n     worth;\n     then wrongs will be redressed, and right will rule the Earth.\n     God give us men!\n\n  Thank You, almighty God, for this remarkable man, this man of great \nhonor, this remarkable man, Paul Wellstone. Whence cometh another?\n  Mr. FEINSTEIN. Mr. Presdient, 5 years have passed since we lost our \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Paul Wellstone, in a tragic plane \ncrash. That crash also took the lives of his wife Sheila, their \ndaughter, Marcia, three loyal staffers, and two pilots.\n  That sad day the Senate lost a passionate, gifted, and respected \ncolleague and friend.\n  Paul was a political science professor, with a sharply honed \nintellect. But his heart was as big as his mind, and he was a committed \nadvocate for the less fortunate.\n  He was elected in 1990 and quickly became a strong, crusading voice \nin the Senate.\n  Paul fought for increased education funding, for improvements in the \nminimum wage, for affordable, accessible health care, for campaign \nfinance reform, for legislation to protect small farmers, and for \nlegislation to expand insurance coverage for the mentally ill.\n  Paul helped lead the successful opposition to an energy bill in 1991 \nthat would have opened the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil \nexploration.\n  Paul was a champion of the dispossessed around the world--in Latin \nAmerica, in Africa, and in Asia.\n  In 1996, when I voiced concern over the treatment of women and girls \nby the Taliban, Paul was one of the few open to the idea that the \nUnited States should do something.\n  In 1999, Paul and I introduced the International Trafficking of Women \nand Children Victims Protection Act to address these heinous crimes and \nto hold to account nations that fail to meet minimum international \nstandards.\n  Paul cared deeply about Tibetan autonomy. The last time we worked \ntogether was to cosponsor legislation to encourage dialogue between the \nDalai Lama and the Chinese Government--and to protect the identity of \nthe people of Tibet.\n  He would have been pleased to see the Congressional Gold Medal--the \nNation's highest civilian honor--awarded to the Dalai Lama earlier this \nmonth.\n  Paul was eloquent. He was compassionate. And he is missed. I feel \nhonored to have been his friend and colleague. I will never forget him, \nand the Senate is better for his service.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I can hardly believe it has been 5 years \nsince we lost Paul and Sheila Wellstone. It still seems like only \nyesterday that I would see Paul pacing up and down the aisles on the \nSenate floor, speaking out for Minnesota and what he so affectionately \ncalled the ``little fellers'' in the world.\n  There isn't a day that goes by that I don't miss him and beloved wife \nand soul mate, Sheila, but the loss is especially poignant in these \ntough times our country faces.\n  I remember during the Iraq war debate, Paul spoke out passionately \nagainst the resolution authorizing the go-it-alone military approach in \nIraq. He spoke, almost prophetically, about the possible consequences \nof our actions--how it would impact the continuing war on terrorism and \nefforts to rebuild Afghanistan. He said that the gravest concerns were \nthose raised about the possible loss of life--to our soldiers and \ninnocent Iraqis. I can hardly imagine what he would think of the mess \nwe are in today.\n  That day, Paul was strong and unafraid, as he always was, even though \nhe knew his ``no'' vote could cost him his Senate seat. He said then \nthat the ``only way to do it, is to do what you honestly think is \nright, and then whatever happens, happens.''\n  I think history has shown that Paul was absolutely right. And my only \nregret is that he is not here today to continue speaking out against \nthe war in Iraq.\n  There are times when it is positively exhausting to keep fighting for \njust causes, especially against this administration. But then I look at \nthe wall in my office and I see a beautiful picture of Paul and me \ntogether, and I think of what he would say if he was still here, and I \nam sure he would tell me to stand up and keep fighting.\n  We all lost so much 5 years ago on that tragic day--Paul, a fighter, \na hero, a friend, a father, a grandfather. And of course we lost \nShelia, Paul's partner in life, their daughter Marcia, and three \ndevoted staffers. My heart still aches.\n  But what we gained, from Paul's life and legacy, cannot be erased by \ntime. His passion and life's work is being carried on by his friends \nand colleagues, and by the good people of Minnesota, who I know miss \nhim dearly.\n  And I know that if he could, Paul would tell us that there is no time \nfor tears, and as he said many years ago, this is no time for timidity.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today we mark the anniversary of a sad \nevent. The tragic deaths 5 years ago of my friends, Paul and Sheila \nWellstone. Yet I know that I join today the people of Minnesota and my \ncolleagues here in the Senate in celebrating the lives they lived and \nthe legacy they left behind.\n  Paul was a remarkable man who stood up in the Senate for those most \nin need of representation, the underpriviledged, the oppressed, and the \nmentally ill. He stood up and he never backed down.\n  Paul Wellstone was a man of great energy and passion, seemingly \nalways in motion, but never too busy to have a word with people he \nwould come across in the corridors or in the elevators, never too busy \nto take a moment to talk with the tourists in the Capitol, Senate \nworkers, or the constituents of other Senators. For this, he was \nbeloved by the many people who serve us here in the Senate and the many \nothers he touched. We all miss his eloquence, and his humor, but, most \nof all, we miss this man of warmth and caring.\n  When that plane crashed in northern Minnesota 5 years ago, his \nbeloved State, the Senate, and the Nation were deprived of a wise and \nthoughtful leader. When I stood on the Senate floor to pay tribute to \nPaul Wellstone shortly after the accident, I pointed out that one of \nhis last acts in the Senate was a vote against the war in Iraq. I \nrecalled his speech then. But now, 5 years later, after the painful \ncourse which that war has taken, his words ring even more true. He saw \nand understood the first of the series of mistakes made in Iraq. He \nsaid, ``Acting now on our own might be a sign of our power. Acting \nsensibly and in a measured way, in concert with our allies with \nbipartisan congressional support, would be a sign of our strength.''\n  Paul never feared to fight for what he believed, even when in a small \nminority like his vote against the welfare reform bill in 1996, and his \nbattles against the bankruptcy bill, and on behalf of more equitable \nfunding for the victims of mental illness.\n  My wife Barbara and I often think of our friends, Paul and Sheila \nWellstone, and the good times we shared. Because of those enduring \nmemories, we celebrate their lives on this anniversary, in much the \nspirit that they lived, with a smile in our hearts.\n\n[[Page S13404]]\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, it is 5 years ago today that we \nlost one of the most articulate, most energetic, and brightest lights \nof this Senate when our colleague from Minnesota, Senator Paul \nWellstone, and his family were killed in an airplane crash as he was \ncampaigning in Minnesota for reelection.\n  Paul sat at that desk right there, and from that desk he would pace \nback and forth with his speeches, like a caged lion, because the energy \nwas bursting from him as he would speak with such passion about the \npoor and the downtrodden and the dispossessed. It was such a voice that \nwas snuffed out that when they had the memorial service for him, it is \namazing the number of Senators who went to Minneapolis for that \nmemorial service; Senators from both sides of the aisle, who had \ntremendous respect for this Senator who spoke with such passion.\n  I wanted to add my voice to those who have recalled the life of \nSenator Paul Wellstone and what he meant to America and to the Senate.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, today we remember Paul Wellstone, his wife \nSheila, and his daughter Marcia. Today my wife Connie and I send our \nthoughts and prayers to the Wellstone sons, Mark and David.\n  Paul, so many of our colleagues noted earlier today, was more than a \nSenator, more than a professor. He was, of course, first and foremost a \nloving husband and a proud father. But for millions of Americans, Paul \nWellstone was a hero.\n  Paul was an unparalleled champion for social and economic justice. He \nled by example, fighting for the weakest among us, those whose voices \nare too often drowned out or altogether ignored.\n  In the Senate, Paul Wellstone was their voice. He may have had the \ntitle ``Senator,'' but he proudly, perhaps more proudly, wore the \nmoniker ``activist.'' From this Chamber, he fought for the poor, for \nthe veterans, the environment, and working men and women not just in \nMinnesota but across the land and across the world. He led by example, \nan example we in this Chamber are well served to follow.\n  Five years after his death, he remains sorely missed.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today marks 5 years since the tragic death \nof our friend and colleague, Paul Wellstone of Minnesota.\n  You know, I look around the Chamber, I see men and women of \nremarkable talents and abilities. But I have also had a strong sense \nthat over the last 5 years there has sort of been a void in our midst; \na very special Senator, a Member who played a unique role within this \nbody, has been missing.\n  It is as though we are suffering from ``phantom limb syndrome''; you \nknow, where a person loses a limb but still feels its presence. \nWhenever an issue of moral urgency, an issue of conscience comes to the \nSenate floor, I still expect to look back over here in the back row and \nsee Paul Wellstone over there, chopping his hands in the air, speaking \nwith his passion, urging us to do the right thing. On that score, I \nremind my colleagues that one of the last major votes cast by Senator \nWellstone was his vote against a resolution later used by President \nBush as an authority to launch an invasion of Iraq.\n  I remember it well because Paul and I were very close friends, and we \ndebated this between us. I said: Paul, no, Bush is not going to use \nthis as any kind of authorization to go to Iraq. This is only meant to \ngive him the authority to go to the U.N., to get the U.N., which is \nwhat we want to do, is to get the U.N. inspectors back there.\n  Well, I think Paul was a little more prescient than I was. So we did \nnot vote the same way on that. I will forever rue the day I voted to \ngive President Bush that authority. Quite frankly, Senator Wellstone \nwas in the midst of a very difficult reelection campaign when he cast \nthat vote. So I think it is a measure of his political courage that he \ncast that vote without thinking about any political consequences.\n  Five years later, with our Armed Forces bogged down in a civil war in \nIraq, it is painfully clear Senator Wellstone's vote was not only a \ncourageous vote, it was the right vote.\n  I think Paul truly was, as I have said before, kind of the soul of \nthe Senate. I have said before that no one ever wore the title \n``Senator'' better or used it less. He loved it when ordinary folks \ncame up to him and called him Paul. Some Senators might not be so \napproachable. Paul Wellstone was. He took that as a sign that ordinary \npeople knew he was one of them. He was approachable and he cared.\n  Paul Wellstone was truly my best friend in the Senate. But he is one \nof those rare souls who so many saw as their best friend. He had a \npowerful authenticity about him that made a miner up in the Iron Range \nknow he was as important to Paul Wellstone as the President of the \nUnited States. That was a very unique ability he had.\n  He never had to proclaim his decency. It shone forth in great acts of \npolitical courage and small acts of human kindness. He never had to say \nhe cared. He never had to proclaim his compassion. You just knew it was \nthere. The hard-working folks he cared about most didn't have lobbyists \nof influence, but they had Paul Wellstone. He truly was their best \nfriend.\n  So 5 years later we remember the political science professor whose \nmeasure of truth was never in political theory but in the impact of our \ndecisions on real people. We remember the community organizer who \nunderstood how to bring people together, rural and urban, \nenvironmentalists and labor, Republicans and Democrats and, as I have \noften joked, he even brought Minnesotans and Iowans together. We \nremember a leader, a proud Democratic Farmer Labor Party liberal who \nconstantly reminded those of us who are Democrats that the purpose of \nour party is to offer hope and opportunity to all Americans, including \nthe neediest among us.\n  I still remember the first time I ever met Paul Wellstone. It was in \n1988. I was a freshman Senator. We were in the midst of one of the \ndeepest recessions--depressions, almost--in farm country that we had \nhad since the Great Depression. Farmers were losing their farms all \nover the Midwest. Suicides were up. Families were breaking up. There \nwere bankruptcies. It was not a very good time in farm country. I \nremember I went out to speak to a large group right outside of Austin, \nMN, at a big farm gathering. I know there were well over 1,000 farmers. \nIt was a big gathering. I think the Minnesota Farmers Union or maybe \nthe National Farmers Union had pulled them together.\n  So they asked me to come speak because I had been, at that time, \ntrying to get through a bill called the Harkin-Gephardt farm bill to \nrespond to the crisis.\n  So I went there to speak and, of course, as any big gathering like \nthat on the stage, you have a lot of different speakers. I was supposed \nto be the final speaker. I was the Senator. So I get there. We had one \nfarmer speak, then the head of the Farmers Union speak and then \nsomebody else spoke and then somebody else spoke. Right before me, they \nhad this guy, this Professor Wellstone. I had never met this guy, and I \nam on the stage with him. I am preparing my remarks, thinking how I am \ngoing to get the crowd up and excited, get them stimulated. And so this \nWellstone guy gets up to speak. He has long curly hair. He has a T-\nshirt on, kind of rolled up. He was muscular, a wrestler.\n  How can I say it? After he spoke, I didn't quite know what to do. He \nhad everybody up. He was so enthusiastic. He had everybody pumped up. \nHe had everybody enthused. I thought, how can I follow this? Well, I \ntried my best. It wasn't very good. I came back to my staff. I said: I \ndon't know who that guy is, but don't you ever put me on after him \nagain.\n  That was my first introduction to Paul Wellstone. Then after that we \nbecame friends. After that, through mutual friends in Minnesota, I \nfound out that he was thinking of running for the Senate. Of course, he \nhad a big primary. He won it. Of course, I couldn't do much to help him \nbecause I was fighting for survival myself in 1990. I had a Congressman \nrunning against me. I was a first-term Senator. But I couldn't have \nbeen more happy, after my own reelection, than the fact that Paul \nWellstone won that race in Minnesota in 1990. So we joined forces in \nthe Senate.\n  In 1996, running for reelection, that was a tough year. Quite \nfrankly, both of us nearly lost. We were very close. I remember talking \nto him on the phone.\n\n[[Page S13405]]\n\n  I said: Paul, I don't know if I am going to survive. He said:\n  Yes, we are going to survive.\n  Then 2002 came. I remember a dinner with another colleague. I won't \nmention the name. It is a personal thing. But we were thinking maybe of \nnot running again. Paul Wellstone had said he was only going to serve \ntwo terms, and he was afraid of breaking that commitment. So we \ndiscussed this over dinner. Our wives were with us. We discussed the \nissue of running or not. I thought, well, I have been here for a couple \nterms myself. I didn't know if I wanted to do it anymore. That would \nhave been my third term, his second. Then one by one we decided we were \ngoing to run again, and we talked Paul into it.\n  We said: Paul, you have to be here. You have to do it. And don't \nworry about that. Your people will understand. You have things to do. \nYou haven't finished your job.\n  So we all decided, yes, we would seek another term in office.\n  Paul once said:\n\n       Politics is about what we create by what we do, what we \n     hope for, and what we dare to imagine.\n\n  Paul was a hopeful man. I always remember that green was his color. \nHe had that bus painted green. When I say ``painted green,'' I mean \nwith a paint brush. It was an awful paint job they did on that bus of \nhis. He climbed aboard that bus in 1990 and set out to build a better \nAmerica. But Paul never meant for it to be a solo voyage. He wanted us \nall aboard.\n  Though Paul is no longer with us, his journey for justice continues. \nNear the site of the tragic plane crash is a beautiful physical \nmemorial for Paul and the seven others who died there: his wife Sheila, \ndaughter Marcia, two pilots, campaign staffers Will McLaughlin, Tom \nLapic, and Mary McEvoy. That is the physical monument.\n  I would like to think there are also living memorials that Paul would \nhave been truly passionate about. One of those is the nonpartisan, \nnonprofit Wellstone Action organization founded by his sons, Mark and \nDavid, which trains citizens in civic activism and grassroots, people-\nto-people politics, the kind of politics he loved and excelled at like \nno one else.\n  I think there is one more Paul Wellstone legacy. It is not tangible, \nbut it may be the most powerful legacy of all. That is our memory of \nhis passion, his convictions, and his incredible capacity for bringing \npeople together to accomplish important things.\n  Before closing, I must mention one of those important things he \nfought so hard for and was so passionate about that still remains \nunaccomplished. He fought hard all the time I knew him to end the \nneglect and denial surrounding issues of mental health, access to \nmental health services. Over 41 million persons suffer from a moderate \nor serious mental disorder each year. Less than half receive the \ntreatment they need, and 80 to 90 percent of all mental disorders are \ntreatable by therapy and medication. Paul fought very passionately for \nthe Mental Health Parity Act to end the absurd practice of treating \nmental and physical illnesses as two different kinds of things under \nhealth insurance.\n  In late 2001, the Senate passed the Mental Health Equitable Treatment \nAct, sponsored by Paul Wellstone and Senator Domenici of New Mexico--\nthat was when I happened to be chairman. We had a brief interim where \nwe had the Senate, at that time, 2001-2002--as an amendment to the 2002 \nLabor-Health and Human Services-Education appropriations bill. It \npassed the Senate. Then we went to conference. In conference it was \nargued that this was not the right place for it, that it should be on \nan authorization bill, not on an appropriations bill. I don't have the \nwords right here, but I have them, when people committed that we would \ntake care of mental health parity the next year on an authorization \nbill. So it was dropped in conference. Then 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, \n2006, 2007, and we still don't have mental health parity. The Senate \npassed it. A strong majority of Members in the other body supported a \nsimilar bill entitled the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction \nEquity Act of 2007. But we still don't have it done.\n  I can't think of a better living legacy to Senator Paul Wellstone \nthan for this Congress, the 110th Congress, to pass the strongest \npossible mental health parity bill and send it to the President to \nbecome law. I hope we can get that job done before we go home whenever \nthat may be.\n  In closing, for those of us who had the privilege of serving with \nPaul Wellstone, his spirit is still very much with us. He still \ninspires us. He still calls us to conscience. He still makes us smile \nwhen we think of his puckish humor. He was the finest of men. We miss \nhim greatly.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, having had the privilege of serving with \nPaul Wellstone for a couple of years after arriving as a Senator, not \nknowing him as well as Senator Harkin knew him, I say amen to all the \nSenator from Iowa said and thank him for reminding us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 294, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 294) to reauthorize Amtrak, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Sununu amendment No. 3452, to amend the Internet Tax \n     Freedom Act to make permanent the moratorium on certain taxes \n     relating to the Internet and to electronic commerce.\n       Sununu amendment No. 3453, to prohibit Federal subsidies in \n     excess of specified amounts on any Amtrak train route.\n       Lautenberg (for Carper) amendment No. 3454 (to amendment \n     No. 3452), of a perfecting nature.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3453\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey \nfor giving me this time and for being a longtime advocate of Amtrak but \nnot only the eastern corridor Amtrak. The Senator from New Jersey has \nworked diligently for a national system. The reason we have a need for \na national system is because it is national. The national system \nconnects other routes to each other. If we had funded Amtrak in the \nsame way we funded and helped other modes of transportation, we would \nhave a bigger ridership because we would have better on-time delivery. \nThe bad on-time delivery has caused a drop-off in ridership. This does \nnot mean we should abandon the national system.\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this bill. Senator Lott has been \nanother longtime champion of a national system. There are 41 cosponsors \nof this bill. We have worked together to make sure we don't only \nsubsidize the eastern corridor. I have said all along, it is national \nor nothing for me. I believe in a national passenger rail system, one \nthat connects our country from coast to coast. My vision is that we \nhave a track going across the northern part of the country from the \nAtlantic to the Pacific, the southern part from the Atlantic to the \nPacific, and then from the top to the bottom of our country, from the \nnorthernmost point down to the tip of Florida and the tip of \nCalifornia. That is a national system. It would have a track that also \nsplits the middle of the country from Chicago down to Texas. From \nthere, we have the capability to have State systems that would emanate \nfrom that skeleton.\n  It is important that we stay together. It would be easy to say: Well, \nthe northeastern corridor does own its own tracks, and therefore it is \nmore efficient, and why don't we just cut off the rest of the country \nand subsidize that? That is not a national system. I\n\n[[Page S13406]]\n\ncould not in good conscience support only a northeastern line. My \nconstituents would be robbed of the Texas Eagle and the Sunset Limited \nlines, and there are other States that have legitimate needs as well. \nIf we actually had done better by Amtrak all these years, we would \nrequire fewer subsidies.\n  I am pleased to support the bill, but I do not support the Sununu \namendment. It isn't that I don't think his heart is in the right place. \nHe is trying to save money because Amtrak is subsidized. We don't deny \nneeded highways in the rural parts of our States. All of our Federal \nhighway money is divided. It goes into rural areas. Why would we deny \nAmtrak service to other parts of the country that don't have the \nridership mainly because of the on-time service not being dependable?\n  In 2003, a public opinion poll showed an overwhelming 85 percent of \nparticipants supported Amtrak, $2 billion worth of funding for Amtrak. \nWe need a better system. We are working for a better system.\n  The bill before us is a well-debated, well-adjusted bill that isn't \neverything the Senator from New Jersey wants. It is not everything the \nSenator from Mississippi wants. It is not everything this Senator from \nTexas wants. But I know that if we have a national system, it is an \nimportant alternative mode of transportation for our country. We need \nhighways. That is the bread-and-butter transportation system for the \ncountry. We need air transportation, and we do provide an air traffic \ncontrol system to support that. A national rail passenger train is \nanother mode that, in the event of an emergency, is a very helpful mode \nof transportation. After 9/11, when our air traffic system was shut \ndown, people went to Amtrak. We needed that for the emergency. I \nbelieve we would be able to have much more in Amtrak if we funded it at \na level where it would have better service and if we could get freight \nrail to work with us to actually help us alleviate some of the \ncongestion they cause on their freight lines. We could work this out if \nwe had rail support for Amtrak. It is important that we do that.\n  In 2005, SAFETEA-LU authorized more than $40 billion on our highways \nfor fiscal year 2009. The Senate will take up an FAA bill later this \nyear that will invest $17 billion in aviation annually. We just sent \nthe President a water resources bill authorizing $23 billion over the \nnext 2 years. There is always a different standard for Amtrak. Amtrak \nis asking for, in this bill, $2.1 billion a year. I don't know why \nAmtrak is a stepchild. If we have the resources necessary to make it a \nsystem that serves the whole country, it would be an environmentally \neffective, efficient system that would operate to not only provide \ntransportation needs in rural parts of the country, where you can have \nbuses that go into very small communities and feed into an Amtrak \nstation, but the service would improve. The on-time delivery would \nimprove. For the kinds of subsidies we need, that we are authorizing in \nthis bill, it should be a national system, not a northeastern corridor \nsystem. That is what is fair for the country. It is right for the \ncountry.\n\n  Always in the Senate since I have been here, our Amtrak supporters \nhave been national-or-nothing Amtrak supporters. I have supported the \nnortheastern corridor. My friends on the northeastern corridor have \nsupported a national system. Even in the hardest times, we have kept \nthe system together. If we do that, we will see that the States will \nstep in and do more, as California and some of the Western States have \ndone, to their credit. We will have more private lines, more mass-\ntransit lines, such as we have coming into Dallas, feeding into the \nAmtrak station, making it more used. In Texas, 250,000 passengers used \nthe Texas Eagle and the Sunset Limited last year. It is a very \nimportant mode of transportation. The more we can do to make it \nefficient and effective, the better off we will be.\n  The Sununu amendment would wreck the national system. I hope we will \nreject that, even though I respect my colleague from New Hampshire. I \nknow his heart is in the right place. I want to work with him to make \nAmtrak more efficient, but dropping national lines is not going to make \nit more efficient.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nTexas. She has always been a supporter of a national passenger rail \nservice. We appreciate the fact that we can work together on this \nproject.\n  Among the routes that would be eliminated under a proposal that is in \nfront of us would be the Crescent in the first year. The ridership \nthere is not quite what it used to be because it originates in New \nOrleans and New Orleans is not a place where there is a lot of traffic. \nThe Sunset Limited is the one--I am sorry--originates in New Orleans. \nIn the third year, the Texas Eagle would be eliminated. Each one of \nthem by themselves is not massive, but they are all part of a national \nnetwork. When 9/11 came along and the aviation system was closed down, \nin many cases the only way to get more people to their destinations, \nhome or otherwise, was through rail service. This would be a national \nsecurity breach if we permitted this to be discontinued. There is no \ncountry in the world where there is rail service that doesn't have some \nsubsidy contribution. We have to adjust ourselves to that. Neither \nwould our aviation system work if we didn't make contributions to that; \nneither would our highway system be operating if we didn't, and we are \ndeficient there.\n  We have to make sure that a national transportation infrastructure is \nin place. An integral part of that is national passenger rail service.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Surely.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I was so pleased the Senator from New Jersey talked \nabout the Sunset Limited because the Sunset Limited, which is the first \nline that would be eliminated under the Sununu amendment, connects \nCalifornia all the way through the southern part of the country, all \nthe way through Texas. It goes through San Antonio and Houston, then \nover to New Orleans, through Mississippi, Alabama, and it ends in \nFlorida. In Florida, you connect to go all the way up the northeastern \ncorridor. If you take out the Sunset Limited--that is our \nintercontinental rail line all the way across the country on the \nsouthern side--you are taking out a major part of the connection to our \nnational system. I hope the Senator from New Jersey is correct that we \nwill not have a national system, if you take out the whole \nintercontinental southern half of it. I applaud him for bringing that \nout.\n  Does he think if we took out that whole southern system, the Sunset \nLimited, that it would enhance Amtrak? Would it enhance the eastern \nseaboard? Would it enhance all the investment California has made all \nthe way up to California and into the States of Oregon and Washington? \nWould that be something that would help the system?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. In response, Mr. President, it would probably destroy \nthe system. We can't escape the fact that the equipment is often moved \naround in different areas. We have to have this as a backup, as I said \nearlier, for security alone, but also, as we join the fight against \npollution and greenhouse gases, the railroads are the best, most \nefficient use for transportation in those cases.\n  So I think the wholeness of Amtrak's system is essential. We want to \nwork together and make sure we include this as one of the targets for \nimproving our transportation efficiency in the country. We are, \nunfortunately, way behind--whether it is in aviation or on the \nhighways; and, certainly, Amtrak has not gotten its share of support. \nSo we are looking forward to doing that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do not want us to have only those speaking \nwho are opposed to the amendment. I know the sponsor, Senator Sununu, \nis here and will probably want to speak momentarily in support of his \namendment.\n  Let me say, to his credit, unlike some of our colleagues, he has been \ninvolved in this issue for years. As a member of the Commerce \nCommittee, and when we were trying to get it up for consideration last \nyear, he did not just try to block it from coming to the floor, he had \nsome amendments, and we\n\n[[Page S13407]]\n\nagreed those amendments should be considered. That is the way to do \nthis.\n  One of the things I said last night, and I want to expand on a little \nbit, is this bill may not be perfect, that we can perhaps have more \nimprovements. But here is a case where the people I hear from say this \nis not a good bill because it does not do enough--not that they are \nopposed to most of what is in it, or what is in it; they just want to \ndo more. But then you say: ``All right, what do you want?'' and they go \nsilent.\n  So I think it is a major step in the right direction. If we can find \nmore things that would improve the service, more reforms that would be \nhelpful, I think we ought to consider that.\n  Mr. President, I ask Senator Sununu, would you like to speak now? I \nwould be glad to defer and let you explain more about your amendment, \nand then I would follow you, if you prefer, or I can go ahead.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Without objection, Mr. President, if I can respond to \nSenator Lott, I am happy to speak whenever the Senator feels he has \nmade all the points he needs to make, at least in the current time \nframe. I wish to speak for 10 or 15 minutes or so on the amendment, and \nwe can move from there. I know we have been allotted 2 hours, but I \nhope and I think we will not have to take all the time.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in the interest of fairness, usually we go \nback and forth. We have had a couple people speaking against the \namendment--Senator Hutchison a few moments ago. I say to the Senator, \nif you wish to speak now, I encourage you to do so, and then we will \nhave speakers on the other side after that.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the amendment I offered \nlast night. This is an amendment that addresses the most basic question \nof fiscal responsibility. ``Fiscal responsibility,'' ``fiscal \nresponsibility''--we hear this phrase all the time from politicians, \nwhether you are inside the beltway from Washington or outside the \nbeltway. I am sure at times people listening to the debate turn the \nother way because they hear everyone using this particular phrase as it \nseams to mean something different to everyone. But I say it is a most \nbasic question of responsibility. Because we are not talking about how \nhigh the tax burden should be, or even how much or how large the \nFederal budget should be; we are not talking about whether we should \nspend money in a particular area so much as we are asking how much we \nshould subsidize a money-losing proposition; how much money should the \ntaxpayers be asked to spend on a business that is losing money.\n  Amtrak is a business, and Amtrak is losing money. We are in a \nposition to be able to look at different parts of that business and try \nto identify exactly how much money they are losing in particular areas, \nand ask that simple question: What is fair? What is right? How much \nFederal funding should be used to subsidize a passenger on a particular \ntrain in the Amtrak system?\n  I would like to think my colleagues are willing to stand up and say \nthe amount of money we should subsidize a passenger on a long-distance \ntrain is less than $1 billion per passenger. I think we can get \nagreement on that. Sometimes I am not sure if we could get agreement on \nthat, but I think we could get agreement we should not provide a \nsubsidy of $1 billion per passenger on every long-distance train Amtrak \nruns. That is a good starting point.\n  I would like to think we could get agreement the subsidy for every \npassenger on every long-distance train Amtrak runs should not be $1 \nmillion per passenger. In fact, let's say for the sake of reasonable \ndiscussion we can at least--at least--agree the maximum subsidy should \nnot be $1,000 for every single passenger.\n  This is a basic question of fiscal responsibility. How big should \nthat subsidy be?\n  Well, let's look at, first, how big the subsidy is today. There are \n15 long-distance routes. Mr. President, 15 percent of Amtrak ridership \nconsumes 43 percent of the total Amtrak budget. That is well in excess \nof $1 billion. The revenue generated? Less than $400 million. By the \nCommerce Committee estimates, that means there is as much as $900 \nmillion in losses--losses--for these 15 routes. The average per-\npassenger subsidy is in excess of $200 for everyone riding these \ntrains. Now, I say ``as much as $900 million'' because no one knows how \nmuch is being lost today.\n  We have heard about all the fiscal reforms in this package, and we \nhope they better enable us to understand how much money Amtrak is \nlosing, but the last time any clear audit was done on these long-\ndistance trains was in 2004 by the Inspector General. Let's look at \nwhat the Inspector General audit found in 2004.\n  At that time, the losses were $475 million. They have only gone up \nsince then. On the 15 routes, of course, the losses vary. On some \nroutes they are higher than others. I think the lowest was for the Auto \nTrain that runs from Orlando to Washington, DC. The subsidy per \npassenger was about $26. Given the importance many place on having a \nnational system, and recognizing we provide different types of \nsubsidies to aviation service, and even to our highways in different \nways--mass transit as well--a subsidy level of $15 or $20 or $25 may \nwell be justified. But that is the lowest subsidy level on any of the \nroutes. The highest subsidy levels? In some cases, the Sunset Limited, \nat $286 per passenger; the Southwest Chief, at $198 for every passenger \nrunning on that train; the California Zephyr, at $140 per passenger.\n  Where are we going to draw the line? Perhaps those who will support \nany of these long-distance trains no matter how much they are losing \ncan stand up and say: Well, look, the good news is it is not $1 million \nper passenger. That is not good enough. It certainly is not good enough \nwhen we are taxing working families across America to provide these \nsubsidies.\n  It begs the question whether you could buy airline tickets for the \namount that gets lost on any one of these routes. I think in many cases \nyou could pay the airfare. I had my staff look today at what they might \npay for an air ticket for the route of the California Zephyr. It \ncertainly is lower than the cost of the train ticket. It is even lower \nthan the cost of the subsidy. As compared to the Southwest Chief, the \nair ticket is lower than the cost of the train service and even lower \nthan the subsidy--the cost to taxpayers for every passenger running on \nthis system--and so on down the line.\n  Now, I understand Amtrak has improvements they wish to make, that \nthis bill has budget reforms and auditing reforms and costs management \nreforms that hopefully will improve these numbers. But we have to draw \nthe line somewhere. All my amendment says is: draw the line at $200--\n$200 per passenger--on any given train route. Next year, we lower that \nto $175; in the third year of the bill, $150. I think if you ask any \nAmerican: ``Should we provide a subsidy of $150 per passenger,'' they \nwould say: Of course not. That is ridiculous.\n  We all feel there is some real value in train service, that Amtrak \nhas great potential--a potential to be more successful, more \nfinancially successful, and to attract a different ridership. This \namendment would not affect any of the corridor routes that serve the \nsouthern part of the country, the central part of the country, the west \ncoast of the country, the Northeast part of the country. It would not \naffect any of those corridor routes. The corridor service is 46 percent \nof the ridership in the country. This amendment would not affect the \nNortheast corridor. That is nearly 40 percent of the ridership in the \ncountry.\n  So the vast majority of people who enjoy or depend on service through \nAmtrak would not be affected. In fact, the vast majority of the riders \non the long-distance routes would not be affected because today, at \nleast according to the Inspector General's audit, there is only one \nroute that is in excess of the $200 subsidy level. There are only two \nthat are in excess of the $175 level.\n  So if there is a real belief this bill is going to address these \nconcerns and this problem, even the strongest supporters of long-\ndistance service should\n\n[[Page S13408]]\n\nbe willing to support this amendment because, if nothing else, it will \nprovide a real incentive, an honest incentive, to improve the \nperformance of these routes.\n  You would like to think it can be done. I would like to think it is \nnot impossible to run these routes without losing $150 and $200 per \npassenger. Maybe it is not. But if it is not possible, the American \npeople should be told it is not possible today--not in 3 years or 5 \nyears or 10 years.\n  All the amendment would do is ask for some basic level of fiscal \nresponsibility, to set some threshold as to the amount we are not \nwilling to spend on these per-passenger subsidies. I hope those who \nfeel most strongly about this legislation and about Amtrak can \nrecognize this can only provide incentives for their performance, \nimprovements they argue they want so very much. I encourage my \ncolleagues to vote for the amendment, for no other reason than because \nI think it is pretty hard to defend a vote against it when we have \nfamilies across America who are working hard, paying taxes every day, \nwho could certainly use the $200 in subsidy per passenger, or the $150, \nor the $100, to spend themselves. Those are taxes we don't need to \ncollect if we are not running these routes at such incredible losses.\n\n  Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of the time we control.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, would the Senator yield 3 minutes to me?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the courtesy.\n  Mr. President, how could something so wrong sound so good? Well, the \nanswer is the label doesn't describe the problem. This label says it is \ngoing to be fine, but the product says: Let's get rid of rail passenger \nservice in this country, except for Boston to Florida, the eastern \ncorridor.\n  Let me describe it in the context of the Empire Builder, a wonderful \ntrain that goes up through my part of the country. One hundred thousand \nNorth Dakotans rode the Empire Builder last year. That train has a \ngreat history, it has a past, and it also has a great future in my \njudgment.\n  But there are those who come to this Chamber time after time after \ntime and want to get rid of long-distance train service in this \ncountry. Why? Because they believe the country is crowded on the east \ncoast and they ought to have good train service on the east coast and \nthe rest of it doesn't quite match up. Look: Every country in the world \nvirtually that has rail service, rail passenger service, has some \nsubsidy for it. We subsidize most transportation services in this \ncountry. I don't have a problem with doing that.\n  I think a national rail passenger system contributes to this country \nin a very significant way. Somehow, to suggest that our rail passenger \nsystem in the future should look like this: You have rail passenger \nopportunities from Boston down to Florida on the east coast, and the \nrest of it, you know, you don't need it--to suggest that is to ignore a \nsignificant part of this country.\n  I support Amtrak. Can it work better? Sure. My colleagues, Senator \nLautenberg and Senator Lott, have been great stewards in trying to put \ntogether legislation that accomplishes that. But I would say this: I \nthink this country is strengthened and is a better country and has a \ntransportation system that is a better system because we have a \nnational rail passenger system.\n  This is not a new amendment, I say to my colleagues. We have had this \namendment around before. It has had different titles, but it is an \namendment that says: Let's get rid of long-distance train service \nbecause there are people who have never liked Amtrak very much. Well, \npeople probably will want to have train service, passenger rail service \nfrom Boston to Florida forever because that income stream of the large \npopulation center sustains it. The question is: should we have a \nnational rail passenger system? Our country long ago answered that \nquestion and said: Yes, we should. That is why we have a national \nsystem.\n  My colleague says: Well, there wouldn't be much consequence if we \npass this amendment. Oh, yes, there would. Most of the long-distance \nrail system would cease to exist. That is what this product is. It \ndoesn't say that on the label, but that is what the product is. I don't \ndisparage my colleague for suggesting it. We come from different parts \nof the country. He apparently believes that only the eastern corridor \nshould end up with a rail passenger system. I think it enriches our \ncountry, across the country from East to West to have a national rail \npassenger system that works well. It works well for my State. One \nhundred thousand people a year board that Amtrak system. They like that \nservice. I hope the Senate will decide to weigh in, in opposition to \nthis amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, do I control the time on our side, or do I \nneed to request the time to be yielded?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator controls the time on his side.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 46\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  First, for any Senator who stands up and states that I believe there \nshould only be service in the Northeast is wrong. It is wrong in \nsubstance, and I think it is wrong in the spirit of the debate on this \nfloor because I certainly never suggested that. In fact, I suggested \nthe opposite: No. 1, that this amendment doesn't affect the corridor \nservices on the gulf coast, on the west coast, in the Northwestern part \nof the United States in any way, shape, or form; No. 2, that this only \naffects long-distance lines that lose more than $200 per passenger; and \nNo. 3, that the goal of having a national service is a good one, \nprovided that the level of cost and subsidy can be maintained.\n  The suggestion was made earlier that I want to get rid of long-\ndistance trains. Again, no--only those losing more than $200 per \npassenger. In fact, to the point of the line that was mentioned \npreviously in debate, the Empire Builder; according to the statistics \nof the Inspector General's review in 2004, it wouldn't be affected by \nthis amendment either. The Empire Builder lost $94 per passenger in \n2004. I hope the performance has been improved a little bit since then, \nbut even if it hasn't, even if this is one part of our economy that has \nseen no improvements in productivity since 2004, no reduction in costs \nsince 2004, no improvements in marketing and ridership since 2004, the \nEmpire Builder wouldn't be affected because it lost less than $200 per \npassenger. In fact, the Empire Builder wouldn't be affected in the year \n2009, when that subsidy threshold drops to $175. It wouldn't be \naffected in 2010, 2011 or 2012, because over the 5-year period, we only \nbring the cap down to $100, and the Empire Builder would still be below \nthat figure in what it loses per passenger. In fact, in addition to the \nAuto Train, which I mentioned earlier, the Coast Starlite, the City of \nNew Orleans, the Silver Service, all of those cost taxpayers less than \n$100 per passenger.\n\n  Now, is a subsidy of $80 or $90 per passenger; a loss of $80 or $90 \nper passenger; good? Is it that easy to justify to a family as they pay \ntheir taxes on April 15? I would be hard-pressed to justify that to \npeople in my State of New Hampshire. But regardless, those routes are \nunaffected by this amendment. In fact, there are many others--several \nothers--whose cost per passenger is in the range of $100 to $125, \naccording to the Inspector General's report in 2004. I would hope and I \nwould think they can improve performance by the 10 percent or 12 \npercent or 15 percent necessary to get below that $100 cost per \npassenger as well. Maybe they can't. We can't forecast the future. But \nI think we can set an honest and a reasonable limit on what subsidies \nwe are willing to provide.\n  Again, I can't state it plainly enough. This amendment doesn't affect \n85 percent of the routes and ridership of Amtrak, the people who ride \nfrom all over the country--North, South, East, and West. It doesn't \naffect any of those long-distance routes, and there are probably close \nto half of them that have a subsidy level of less than $100 today. For \nany of those that meet the performance benchmarks, they would be \nunaffected as well. I hope my colleagues can support the amendment.\n\n[[Page S13409]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would be interested in speaking on \nbehalf of the Sununu amendment. I don't know what the alternating \nagreement is.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I yield time to the Senator from Alabama, \nwhatever time he needs to consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will be brief. Amtrak does go through \nmy home State, and I have been interested in the impact of not having \nsupport for that periodic travel through our State that the system does \nand how much it costs and what the right public policy should be and \nhow we should think about it. I would note Amtrak operates 44 routes \nover 220,000 miles of track, and 97 percent of those tracks are freight \ncompany tracks. But it runs a deficit each year, and we have to have \nFederal subsidies for it.\n  The crux of the public policy issue that all of us, I think, should \nthink about for the overall public policy--not for one or two little--\nnot for a few people in a vision for what we ought to do for the future \nbut what is the truthful situation we are in.\n  Kenneth Mead, the Department of Transportation inspector general, \nsuccinctly stated the situation this way:\n\n       The mismatch between the public resources made available to \n     fund inner city passenger rail service, the total cost to \n     maintain the system that Amtrak continues to operate, and the \n     proposals to restructure the system comprise dysfunction that \n     must be resolved in the reauthorization process of the \n     Nation's inner city rail system.\n\n  This proposed reauthorization would entail about a $2 billion-a-year \nsubsidy for the next 6 years. Remember, the bill that was enacted in \n1997 to reform and have accountability for Amtrak contemplated there \nwould be no more subsidies in 2002.\n  Now, Senator Sununu has studied this issue, and I believe we can rely \non the things he is saying, fundamentally. It is important, and I am \nglad somebody has committed the time and effort to point out some of \nthe problems with going forward with business as usual.\n  I am going to take a couple of minutes and share some thoughts. The \ntrain that goes through Alabama, Mobile, AL, east and west, it comes \nup--I am not sure exactly what the situation is this year, but when I \nchecked last year, the train went through 2 or 3 days a week going east \nat 2 a.m. in the morning, and when it goes west, 2 or 3 days a week, it \nwas 3 a.m. in the morning. Now, that is not likely to attract a lot of \ncustomers.\n  Let me show this chart and go through it. I believe we will come to \nunderstand that what we are talking about, I say to Senator Sununu, is \ntrying to do something that is basically impossible to do. It is not \ngoing to work. I wish we could. As we used to say in the country--I \ngrew up on the railroad tracks. My daddy had a country store. There \nwere three country stores and a railroad depot in our little community. \nThe train went by, we had a passenger--I remember when we had a \npassenger train down there. There hasn't been a passenger train on that \nroad in 40 years. There is only one store left and no railroad depot. \nTimes change. Things happen.\n  Let's look at this chart on what it would take from Birmingham to \nWashington, DC. Well, what are your options? If you go on a commercial \nairline--the one we checked here was a direct flight from USAir last \nOctober--to Birmingham, there were seven direct flights to Washington, \nDC, from Birmingham, AL, a day. If you take your personal vehicle, you \ncan leave anytime you want to leave. If you take the train, there is \nonly one a day. That limits your options. People, when they are \ndeciding how to make a trip, think about these things.\n  What about how long does it take? The air time is 3 hours 12 minutes, \nthe personal vehicle is 11 hours, approximately, and the train time is \n18 hours.\n  What about how many stops do you make? If you take an airline, it is \none stop. It is a direct flight.\n  What about your personal vehicles? Let's assume you make four stops. \nBut Amtrak is making 18 stops. It is not taking the shortest route.\n  What about our cost? I was surprised at this when we looked at the \nnumbers. The primary cost for a round trip airline ticket, as I said, \nas of last October, was about $328. We now think it is $350 or $360, \nsomething around that price. That is what the commercial airline fare \nis. If you took your personal vehicle, the cost for gasoline is $87. \nGas is about $2.97 a gallon today. The Amtrak ticket is $206 round \ntrip.\n  I don't know that this is an accurate figure for the food and board, \nbut in the air you have no cost of food and a room is not needed. In a \npersonal vehicle, you can estimate one meal or two meals at $20. On \nAmtrak, the high cost of food and a sleeper car can put you well over \n$100--maybe even $200--as our figures show. On the commercial airline, \nthe total cost for one way would be $160 to $175. A personal vehicle is \nless than that while the train is more than that. The train is going to \nbe much more than that one way.\n  So this is why people are not traveling long distances on trains. It \nis not because they are not there. They are there. But you say: Well, \nwhat we need is Amtrak coming through Mobile at 5 a.m., 7 a.m, or 8 \na.m. Well, you cannot make that happen. To do that, we would have to \ndouble the number of trains or triple or quadruple them, and they will \nlose even more money. I wish it weren't so. I wish we could make this \nsystem work, but certain long routes are not feasible. However, \nCongress, being what it is, mandates it. We say you have to run these \nroutes, and Amtrak runs up billions of dollars in debt trying to \ncomply. If I could see us moving to a time when we would come close to \nmaking this feasible, I would be supportive.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, can I ask a moment of the Senator's \ntime without him losing his right to the floor? I have a unanimous \nconsent request.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am pleased to yield for that purpose.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we are planning to hold the vote at \n12:15. I want other Members who are interested to know that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 12:15 today the Senate proceed to \nvote in relation to the Sununu amendment and the time until 12:15 be \nequally divided and all provisions under the previous order remain in \neffect. I assume Senator Sununu has agreed to this.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, while I am not opposed and don't think \nthe proponents of the legislation have a bad intent, they have a vision \nfor a national rail system, and they are willing to put billions of \ndollars into it. But I have never been able to lay my hand on a study \nthat shows that a national rail system mandated by the government is \nfeasible over long distances. Yet there was a study that showed, even \nin Europe, that train routes within certain ranges will work. I think \nthe distance was approximately 200 to 300 miles. If it is much longer \nthan that, people almost always choose to fly. If it is much shorter \nthan that, they almost always choose to drive. Americans, more than \nanyone else in the world, have automobiles, and we choose to drive \nfrequently. It allows you to arrive when you want, carry things you \nwant to carry, drive straight to where you intend to go, and not have \nto wait in a station. And you don't have this on time problem. \nCommercial airlines are on time about 80 percent of the time. Amtrak \nwas only on time 66 percent of the time. That is another factor you \nhave to think about if you are going to regularly use a long-distance \ntrain.\n  In certain corridors, where the traffic is heavy, it works, and I am \nnot disputing that. I am not for shutting down a profitable route or \neven routes that are close to profitable, which we can justify \nsubsidizing. But I think, in all honesty, that Senator Sununu has \nraised a legitimate point. How much can we support these routes that \nare losing money, are unlikely to ever make money, and are driving up a \nheavy cost that the whole Amtrak system must carry in its effort to \ncomply with congressional mandates?\n  So if you could reduce some of these losses that are draining \nAmtrak's ability to be effective and gave them some freedom to make \nbusiness decisions rather than having their operations determined by \npolitical decisions made by Congress, I think we would be better off. \nSo after much thought and review,\n\n[[Page S13410]]\n\nI have concluded that this is a rational amendment. It is hard for me \nto see how it can be opposed. Therefore, I will support it. I thank the \nSenator for offering it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I used to serve on the Amtrak board of \ndirectors. We have a lot of trains running up and down the Northeast \ncorridor. I have ridden on them since I was a little boy. The trains \nrun about every hour. You can catch a train in Boston to come to DC \npretty much every hour; between New York and DC, the frequency is even \nmore. They run from 5 in the morning and go well into the night.\n  The reason a lot of people don't ride trains across the country is \nthere are 15 different long-distance trains, which only run 2 or 3 days \nin a lot of cases. It may come in at 1, 2 or 3 a.m. in the morning, and \nit is not very convenient. It is hard to build ridership. I agree with \nSenator Sununu. I am not interested in spending $200 or $150 per \npassenger to subsidize long-distance trains. We don't do it in the \nNortheast corridor.\n  We have addressed this in a more thoughtful way, and I want to share \nthat. I commend Senator Lautenberg and Senator Lott and our staffs for \nworking on it for years. The legislation calls for the Federal Railroad \nAdministration to actually study every year, for the next 3 years, five \nlong-distance train routes to figure out why they lose money and what \ncan we do to reduce the cost of the train routes. I think they will \nfind this in places in the Midwest. These numbers are out of the \nMidwest. There is a lot of investment, particularly in the Illinois \narea. Ridership is up on the Chicago-St Louis corridor in the last \nyear. Ridership between Chicago and Carbondale is up 46 percent. For \nthe Chicago-Galesburg-Quincy route, ridership has increased 33 percent. \nThey have actually added frequency and provided better service and more \non-time service, and they have worked with the freight railroads that \ncontrol the tracks to get better support so that they let the passenger \ntrains run on time.\n  I think there is a better way to skin this cat than our friend, \nSenator Sununu, has proposed. I believe the answer is in the \nlegislation. If you look at the country as a whole, today we have \nprobably over 50 percent of the population living within 50 miles of \none of our coasts. Think about that. What that means is we have these \ndensely populated corridors up and down the east coast, the gulf coast, \nand on the west coast. They are perfectly suited for high-passenger \ncorridor rail service.\n  Think about the other places around the country, and there is an \nexample of the St. Louis-to-Chicago route. That part of America is \nwhere densely populated corridors also exist. My suspicion is if we \nprovide them the kind of service we are providing on these coastal \ncorridors, we would see the increase in ridership that we are seeing in \nIllinois and also in Missouri.\n  Again, to my friends who want to make sure we take some affirmative \naction to provide better train service but reduce the kind of subsidies \nnow being paid for folks riding trains that run every 2 or 3 days, \ncoming through communities at all hours of the night, as well as the \nday, there is a smarter way to do this, and it is in the legislation.\n  I encourage my colleagues to oppose this particular amendment, \nhowever well intended it is. I think there is a better way to get to \nthe legitimate issue raised. It is the language Senators Lott and \nLautenberg and our staffs and I have crafted and included. The first \nyear, we would take five long-distance train routes and scrub their \nperformance and find out a smarter way to provide the service. The \nsecond year, we would do five more, and the third year, five more. So \nover 3 years we would scrub 15 of these.\n  A lot of people are starting to ride trains who would not have \nthought about it before. That is because of congestion on the roads and \nhighways, in airports, bad pollution in the air, and our dependence on \nforeign oil. The passenger rail service can address all those issues. \nAmtrak is not the whole answer, but it begins to get at the answer.\n  The language in the underlying bill answers the question Senator \nSununu raises. I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment and support for \nthe underlying legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we understand that Senator Sununu \ncomes with a background in business and comprehension of what balance \nsheets and financial statements are like. We recognize that the State \nof New Hampshire does have some Amtrak service. But the State of New \nHampshire is also one of the beneficiaries of something called \nEssential Air Service, where the country takes great pains to make \ncertain that communities are not so isolated that you have difficulty \nin traveling from there and to there. It costs the Federal Government \nabout $50 million a year for Essential Air Service. We are all in the \nsame boat. It is our country, these are our communities, and they have \nto be part of the functioning of our society.\n  So when I look at the amendment proposed by the Senator from New \nHampshire, this amendment would destroy our national passenger rail \nsystem. Based on 2007 data, the Sununu amendment would immediately cut \npassenger rail service to the entire Southwestern United States. Four \nof Amtrak's longest train routes would be gone. It is easy to see on \nthis chart the lines that crisscross our country. You are saying that \nalmost everything, in about a 5-year period, would be pretty much not \nin existence. We start off with four of Amtrak's longest train routes, \nmost of them in the Southwest. Next year, five more trains would be \neliminated, including the Silver Star, which is New York to Miami; \nSilver Meteor; the Cardinal; the Coast Starlight, Seattle, WA, to L.A., \nCA; and the Lakeshore Limited, Chicago to New York. These comprise \nsomething over a million travelers a year. Within 5 years--likely \nsooner--the entire national network of long-distance trains would be \ngone because corporate overhead costs would be shared among the \nremaining routes, increasing their costs.\n  These long-distance trains provide essential transportation services \nto millions of Americans, and their ridership and revenue has been \ngrowing.\n  Last year, ridership increased on Amtrak's long-distance trains 2.5 \npercent and revenue went up 5 percent. For instance, if we look at \nAmtrak's Palmetto train, which is New York to Miami, its route extends \nsouth from the Northeast corridor and serves South Carolina, Georgia, \nFlorida, North Carolina, and Virginia. It had 7.5 percent more riders \nthan the year before, a total of 157,000 riders.\n  The States want Amtrak service, and they want to expand it as well.\n  One Governor--I have a letter written in 1996--wrote to Amtrak \nclaiming:\n\n       Many of us believe that Amtrak finances and operations are \n     a matter for the Federal Government. The Federal Government \n     created Amtrak.\n\n  This is the letter from the then-Governor of Texas, George W. Bush, \nin 1996. He attributes responsibility to the Federal Government.\n  To connect our rural areas with our urban commercial centers, the \nFederal Government subsidizes all modes of transportation. We have \nessential air service, which I mentioned. We have Federal subsidies for \nintercity bus transportation. And since the Federal Government took \nover passenger rail service, we have funded it as well.\n  I wish to make note of the fact that despite the fact that our \nairlines are for-profit companies, we insist that we have to help them \nfunction and we give them about $3 billion a year in subsidies. These \nare for-profit companies. We want them to keep flying. There has been \nabout $20 billion put into the aviation system since 9/11.\n  I remind our colleagues, there is no passenger rail service in the \nworld that earns a profit. Countries pay for rail service because of \nthe benefits, and if you eliminate these trains, it would mean millions \nof additional cars on the highways and even longer lines at the \nairport, adding to our country's congestion problems.\n  In addition, terminating these routes destroys Amtrak's \ninterconnected system, isolating different parts of the country from \none another and reducing the utility and the value of all of Amtrak's \nservices.\n\n[[Page S13411]]\n\n  This bill, our bill, already cuts Amtrak's operating subsidy by 40 \npercent. And rather than micromanaging Amtrak, our bill mandates that \nthis performance standard is the one the company must meet. We also \nrequire Amtrak to tell us how they plan to meet this standard. They \nneed to set up specific improvement goals and plans for each individual \ntrain route. If the plans are not followed or if they don't work, \nfunding for that train route can then be terminated.\n  Senator Lott and I, along with Senator Carper and others, put a lot \nof thought into this bill. It will make major improvements to rail \nservice in our country. The Sununu amendment does exactly the opposite. \nIt will destroy America's national passenger rail network. Ironically, \nit won't even save money because a sudden and massive reduction of \ntrains that this amendment would force would leave Amtrak with huge \nlabor costs for displaced employees.\n  This is not a new subject we are airing today. In some ways, it would \nbe nice to be able to agree with Senator Sununu on this issue and say, \nOK, it would be nice if they could pay their own way, but they can't do \nit. When you are operating on schedules that, in many cases, pay lots \nof attention to the key peak work hours and then don't have the traffic \nafter that----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. How much time do we have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. None.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. That is good. We have no time left. We had, I \nthought, a minute or two before the vote.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, is it true that I have plenty of time \nleft?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It depends on the Senator's definition of \n``plenty.'' The Senator from New Hampshire has 11 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. In New Hampshire, 11 minutes is plenty of time. I yield 2 \nminutes to the Senator from New Jersey to finish his remarks.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator. May I take that at the end of \nthe Senator's presentation?\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I wasn't aware this was a negotiation as \nopposed to an act of solidarity with my colleague on the other side of \nthe aisle. I will be happy to reserve Senator Lautenberg's two minutes \nfor the end.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am touched by the generosity of the Senator from \nNew Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we reserve \ntwo minutes on each side for the end of this debate. I have a couple of \nminutes of comments, and then if there are speakers on the other side, \nwe may still have another couple of minutes to yield to them as well.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am concerned, Senator Lott wanted to say a couple \nof words.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Excellent. I will be happy to reserve those two minutes \nfor the other side.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. That is a satisfactory arrangement, and I consider it \nto be very fair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, let me use my portion of time to conclude \nmy remarks. I wish to address some of the points Senator Lautenberg \nmade in his presentation.\n  First, it was suggested that under 2007 data, four routes would have \nto be shut down if my amendment were made the law of the land. I find \nthat surprising and maybe a little problematic for a couple of reasons. \nFirst, I am not aware of any Inspector General audit that was done for \n2007, which would be required under the amendment. The only IG audit of \nwhich I am aware, the most recent one, was in 2004, and that indicated \nonly one route did not meet this threshold. So, first, I don't think \nthere is any data to make that assertion that four routes would be \nclosed.\n  Second, if that were the fact today, that means the situation has \ngotten worse over the last three years; that it has gotten worse and \nthat the costs are trending in the wrong direction, and that is \nsomething about which we should all be concerned and, in fact, alarmed.\n  Third, it was suggested that closing four routes, if that were the \ncase, would be a sudden and massive reduction in the capacity of the \nsystem. In fact, even if four routes were affected, we are talking \nabout 1 to 2 percent of ridership.\n  The phrase ``making people pay their own way'' was also used. It does \nnothing of the sort. As I indicated, I think there is an opportunity \nfor providing some support or subsidy level, certainly in the medium \nterm. This would by no means require anyone to pay their own way \nbecause it would still allow in the first year subsidies up to $200 per \npassenger and in the second year subsidies up to $175 per passenger. \nOnly in Washington would a $200 subsidy be called ``paying your own \nway.'' That is just not right.\n  Finally, it was suggested that closing one of these routes would \nisolate parts of America. I think the idea that eliminating a long-\ndistance train would isolate people in America in this day and age, \ngiven all the ways we have to travel, to communicate, and to reach out \nto one another, is ridiculous.\n  This is a common-sense amendment. This is not the grim reaper for \nnational train service. This amendment only says if a route is losing \nmore than $200 per passenger, we should not continue to operate that \nservice. I suppose it is a little bit like hitting yourself in the head \nwith a hammer: Maybe once you really get going, you are reluctant to \nstop because you think the next time you hit yourself in the head it \nmight not feel quite as bad. At a certain point, we need to draw the \nline. I think $200 per passenger is a pretty reasonable line to draw. I \nencourage my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time. I am happy to yield Senator Lott \n2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senator from New Hampshire is yielding \nme 2 minutes out of the time of the proponents of the amendment? I \ndon't want to mislead anybody here.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. As the Senator may not be aware, we have a unanimous \nconsent agreement, and having consumed all the time on the opponents' \nside, I offered to share an additional 2 minutes so that Senator Lott \ncan conclude his remarks.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, that is typical generosity of the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire. He is engaged, thinking about this issue and trying \nto do the right thing.\n  I also think this is a classic chicken-and-egg deal. We tell Amtrak \nwe want them to do better, but yet we don't offer any reforms, \nchallenges, responsibilities to do better. We throw rocks and say: Why \naren't you providing better service at cheaper rates?\n  I think you need a plan to move toward actually what the Senator from \nNew Hampshire is trying to achieve. The bill before us, S. 294, already \nrequires Amtrak to reduce its total Federal operating subsidy by 40 \npercent over the life of the bill. The bill gives Amtrak management the \nflexibility to achieve this goal through cost savings, route changes, \nrevenue growth, or expanded service rather than through mandated route \ncuts. Additionally, the bill requires improvement plans for each long-\ndistance route that will focus on strategies to increase revenues, \nridership, efficiencies, and service quality. These plans must be \nimplemented and achieved in order for them to continue to get Federal \nroutes.\n  I think some of these routes are going to eventually need to be \nterminated, but if we do what this amendment would do, it would \nbasically, cold turkey, start eliminating routes very soon, including, \nto be perfectly honest, the Crescent, which is the train that comes \ndown through the heart of the South, through Meridian, MS, Hattiesburg, \ndown to New Orleans. We need that service.\n  Also, this would force cuts at a time when we need more rail service, \nnot less. We have ever-increasing air and highway congestion and \nenvironmental concerns. The Federal Government provides operating \nsubsidies in all these other areas, but we are saying we want to \nterminate these long-distance routes. If we want a national rail \npassenger system, we are going to have to keep some of these routes \ngoing at least until we make an effort to make them more cost \nefficient.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n[[Page S13412]]\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, we are approaching 12:15, which is the \ntime for the vote. I wish to conclude first by responding to some of \nthe remarks and the observations made by the Senator from Mississippi.\n  First, there was mention of the Crescent, which is one of the 15 \nlong-distance trains. Under the 2004 Inspector General's audit, the \nCrescent lost $114 per passenger in coach class. At that rate, they \nwould not be affected in 2008 by this amendment. They would not be \naffected in 2009 by this amendment, or 2010 or 2011. They might be \naffected in 2012 if they have failed to improve any performance on the \nbasis of cost over a 4-year period. I don't think that is Draconian. I \ndon't think that is too much to ask. I hope the Senator from \nMississippi and others will support that kind of improvement in \nperformance, and I think it can be achieved.\n  To that point, the Senator from Mississippi said: We need to do \nbetter; we need to have a plan for doing better. From what I have \nheard, he and many others believe this bill is the plan to do better, \nand I think in many parts it is a plan to do better. I support that \nconcept. I support a blueprint for improving financial reporting, \nstandards of accounting, and cost performance.\n  What my amendment simply does is tell people honestly and directly: \nHow much better do we expect you to do? What is the minimum we expect \nyou to do? We expect ridership or routes not to lose $1 million per \npassenger, or $500,000, or $1,000, or $500 per passenger, and I think \nit is reasonable to say we expect you not to lose $200 per passenger. \nThat is what we are asking. That is how much better we expect you to be \nfor only those routes which are not meeting that standard today.\n  It is a reasonable standard. It is an understandable standard. Under \nthe 2004 data, it would affect one of the 15 routes. It might affect \nmore than one. It might affect two or three more routes 2 or 3 years \nfrom now if they have failed to improve. But when we are asking \nfamilies across America to fill out their tax forms every April 15 to \nprovide resources to our country to fulfill important obligations, I \ndon't think we should be asking those families to subsidize passengers \non Amtrak at $200 per person.\n  It is reasonable, and I hope my colleagues will support a commonsense \namendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the Sununu amendment, No. 3453.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), \nthe Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd), the Senator from California \n(Mrs. Feinstein), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), and the \nSenator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) would vote ``nay.''\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I recognize I did not prevail in that \namendment, but I appreciate that debate and the managers allowing me \ntime on the debate. I do have another amendment. I told them I would \ntry to move my amendments, so I have another amendment I wish to offer.\n  Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3454\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the Lautenberg for \nCarper second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. I ask for the yeas and nays on that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At this moment there is not a sufficient \nsecond.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. I ask for the yeas and nays, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I have an amendment I send to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  I ask unanimous consent the pending amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. President, I think the bill manager does not have a copy. It was \nsuch a short amendment, I sort of assumed that multiple copies were \nmade. If I can ask unanimous consent to speak on the topic of the \namendment, to provide a little background.\n  Mr. BYRD. Would the Senator inform the Senate as to what the subject \nof his amendment is?\n  Mr. SUNUNU. I would be pleased to describe the amendment prior to it \nbeing offered.\n  Mr. President, this is one of the two amendments I filed in \ncommittee, but did not offer on the bill, because I wanted to allow a \nvote and debate on the floor rather than delay us unnecessarily in \ncommittee.\n  This is an amendment that addresses the question of competing on \ndifferent routes within the Amtrak system. Under this legislation that \nis before us today, there is an allowance to have two routes \ncompetitively bid each year.\n  The managers think that is a good idea. I think that is a good idea. \nBut I do not see why there needs to be a legal restriction on the \nnumber of routes that could be bid or sent out to bid under \ncompetition. This does not mandate that bids be put out to competition, \nbut it certainly would allow that.\n  That is what my amendment is intended to do. At this time, I yield to \nwait for the copies to be distributed in a timely way.\n  Mr. President, at this time I believe copies have been distributed.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3456\n\n   (Purpose: To remove the limitation on the number of Amtrak routes \n                     available for competitive bid)\n\n  Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk, ask unanimous consent \nthat any pending amendment be set aside, and ask for the immediate \nconsideration of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Sununu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3456.\n\n\n[[Page S13413]]\n\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object, the Senator has an \namendment?\n  Mr. SUNUNU. I do.\n  Mr. BYRD. Does he wish to have it read?\n  Mr. SUNUNU. I have submitted the amendment to the bill manager and to \nthe clerk and asked that it be considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk has reported the amendment by \nnumber.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the clerk read the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       On page 35, strike line 1 and all that follows through \n     ``(A)'' on line 4 and insert the following:\n       ``(b) Implementation.--Pursuant to any rules or regulations \n     promulgated under subsection (a)\n       On page 35, strike 11 through 16.\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I apologize again to the bill manager for \nnot having a copy for him.\n  As was clear from the reading of the amendment, if nothing else was \nclear, it is a brief amendment. It strikes the line of the bill that \nwould have placed a limit on the number of routes that could be allowed \nfor a competitive bid.\n  That means it allows for an operator to offer to run that route at an \neffective cost with particular service goals in mind in order to \nprovide service at or above the current quality of service at a lower \ncost. I think it would be a mistake to place an arbitrary restriction \non the number of routes that could be competitively bid.\n  Certainly decisions about putting routes out to bid, or which routes \nare put out to bid, how they are done, would still be in the hands of \nthe management team at Amtrak. I think that is as it should be. I \nappreciate the opportunity to offer the amendment. I ask that my \ncolleagues support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we look forward to a full discussion \nof this amendment. We do provide in the bill an opportunity for a \ncompetitive review on two lines.\n  Whether it should be expanded is something we will want to talk \nabout. We think that two lines each and every year can be competed for \nand reviewed by Amtrak. We have to examine it here. But our inclination \nis to oppose this. But we will have a discussion about it at such a \ntime as we go to a vote.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sununu amendment No. 3456.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3455\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment 3455, the Allard amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Allard] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3455.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To strike the provisions repealing Amtrak's self-sufficiency \n                             requirements)\n\n       Strike subsection (a) of section 219.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. My amendment is very straightforward. Right now there is \na provision in law saying that Amtrak is supposed to be financially \nself-sufficient. To be clear, the provision does not even apply to \nAmtrak as a whole. It only requires Amtrak to be operationally self-\nsufficient, presuming, of course, that the Federal Government will \ncontinue to provide capital subsidies.\n  I was surprised and even disheartened to learn that S. 294 would \nrepeal this provision in law requiring Amtrak to become operationally \nself-sufficient. I strongly believe that this goal should be \nmaintained.\n  My amendment would strike the provision in the bill that repeals the \nself-sufficiency goal.\n  I am quite puzzled that the Commerce Committee report noted:\n\n       This repeal is technical in nature and not meant to \n     indicate that Amtrak should not strive to reduce its \n     dependency on Federal funds or improve the efficiency of how \n     it spends Federal funds as elaborated through this bill.\n\n  This statement makes no sense. If we repeal a provision calling on \nAmtrak to become self-sufficient, we are saying they have no need to \nreduce their dependency on the taxpayers. There is no other way to \ninterpret it. We need to be crystal clear that we expect them to reduce \ntheir dependency on Federal funds, and the only way to do it is to \nmaintain this provision in current law.\n  To be clear, even with the provision in law, Amtrak has made little \nprogress toward becoming operationally self-sufficient. According to \nthe Department of Transportation Office of Inspector General, Amtrak \ncontinues to incur substantial operating losses, and over the last 5 \nyears, annual cash losses, excluding interest and depreciation, have \nfallen only modestly, a little more than 3 percent a year. But modest \nprogress is not a reason to eliminate the operational self-sufficiency \nprovisions. Failure to meet a goal is not reason to lower the bar \nsufficiently to redefine success. Rather, it simply means that more \nwork must go toward meeting their original goal.\n  The Office of Inspector General went on to say:\n\n       The problem with the current model exists beyond funding. \n     There are inadequate incentives for Amtrak to provide cost-\n     effective service. Amtrak, as the sole provider of intercity \n     passenger rail service, has few incentives, other than the \n     threat of budget cuts or elimination, for cost control or \n     delivery of service in a cost-effective way. Amtrak has not \n     achieved significant cost savings since its last \n     reauthorization.\n\n  That is what the Inspector General had to say in his report. The \nquestion I have is, given that we have so few incentives for cost \ncontrols, why would we eliminate one of the few provisions in law \ncalling on Amtrak to control their costs? While passenger rail has a \nrole in an efficient, modern transportation infrastructure, I am \nconcerned about how Amtrak has performed in providing that service. As \nmy colleagues may know, I am a strong proponent of results and \noutcomes. Amtrak and other government-funded entities should not be \njudged based on how much they receive in Federal funding but the \nresults they can demonstrate with those taxpayer dollars or the fees \nthey charge passengers who ride their trains. In the case of Amtrak, I \nam afraid these results are not very impressive. In the \nadministration's PART assessment, their tool for evaluating the \neffectiveness of programs, Amtrak was rated as ineffective. In fact, it \nwas the only program in the entire Department of Transportation to \nreceive an ``ineffective'' rating.\n  I want to be clear on what this rating means. From the \nadministration's description ineffective, programs receiving this \nrating are not using taxpayer dollars effectively or the fees they are \ncharging the passengers to use their services. That seems pretty clear \nto me, and I hope Members of this body will agree with me on that fact. \nIf Amtrak is not being effective with the money they spend, it would \nmake sense to reduce the money we spend there. Instead, we are talking \nabout increasing their subsidies and eliminating provisions calling on \nAmtrak to be more careful in how they spend tax dollars. Again, that \nmakes no sense. Right now Amtrak's Federal subsidy is nearly equal to \nits total ticket revenue per year. To put it a different way, for every \ndollar spent on a ticket, the rail passenger receives another dollar \nfrom the taxpayers.\n  Given the subsidies on some routes, taxpayers would save money by \nactually paying passengers to take another mode of transportation such \nas flying. Calling on Amtrak to become operationally self-sufficient is \nnot about being antirail. It is about being for taxpayers and for those \nriders who use that service to hold down their costs. It is for \nefficiency and for common sense.\n\n[[Page S13414]]\n\n  Even if Amtrak were to become operationally self-sufficient, it would \ncontinue to receive sufficient Federal subsidies under my amendment. \nAccording to the U.S. Department of Transportation, Amtrak is by far \nthe most heavily subsidized mode of travel in the United States, even \nthough it carries less than 1 percent of the intercity passenger \nmarket. Amtrak costs $210.31 per passenger, per thousand miles, \ncompared to $4.66 for intercity buses and $6.18 for commercial \nairlines. Because motorists pay far more in Federal user fees than they \nget back in Federal transportation spending, the U.S. Department of \nTransportation estimates that the Federal Government earns a profit of \n$1.79 per passenger, per thousand miles from automobiles.\n  This bill proposes to spend $11.3 billion on Amtrak. It is entirely \nreasonable for Congress and the American taxpayer and their passengers \nto tell Amtrak that they should work to reduce those subsidies. If we \nare too timid to even tell Amtrak to reduce their need for operational \nsubsidies--remember, this is operational subsidies, not capital \ninvestment--how can we expect that they will ever do it? Many of us are \nparents and have worked to raise our children to become independent, \nself-sufficient people. When my daughters graduated from college, my \nwife and I expected them to get jobs to support themselves. If we had \nsimply paid their rent, bought their groceries, paid their utilities, \nand given them spending money without any conditions or expectations of \nindependence, why would they want to work and make the tough choices \nnecessary for change? It is the same with Amtrak. Unless we are clear \nthat we expect them to change and become operationally independent of \nthe Federal Government, things will never change.\n  It is critical that we keep this goal in place for Amtrak. They must \nhear loudly and clearly from Congress and from America that they need \nto make the tough choices necessary to get out on their own. My \namendment will ensure they hear this message.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, would the Senator read his amendment \nagain, please, for the edification of the Senate.\n  Mr. ALLARD. My amendment is actually very simple. I will ask the \nclerk to read the amendment, if she will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Strike subsection (a) section 219.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. If I may address the Senator through the Chair.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, please.\n  Mr. ALLARD. The section I am repealing puts in some guidelines, and \nit is not date specific but it says that the goal of Amtrak should be \nto become self-sufficient; in other words, work toward less subsidies \nfrom the Federal Government. For some reason or other that was taken \nout by the committee staff. It is appropriate we continue to keep that \nin law instead of repealing it. Since they are not driven by \ncompetitiveness within the fixed rail system, I encourage them to note \nthat the Congress expects them to work for efficiency and to repeal it. \nI recall in Boston, for example, we had a situation where Amtrak runs \nthrough Boston and is part of their mass transit system. So a committee \nchair looked at a contract they let out for the Boston fixed rail. It \nwas the most expensive contract, providing the least service to the \npassengers. This kind of provision is an incentive. It gives Members of \nCongress a way of expressing to Amtrak that we hope that they work for \nan efficient, effective system. I don't think it is particularly \nDraconian; at least I do not view it that way.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I have listened with interest to our \ncolleague from Colorado. Since I have a son and two grandchildren who \nlive in Colorado, they talk about how nice it would be for train \nservice to run from Denver to Glenwood Springs and provide that kind of \nservice. It would ease up the traffic on the highways in Colorado, \nRoute 70, and others.\n  It would be nice if it was possible to reduce the subsidies, but the \nproblem is, the world has proven in country after country that you \ncannot operate passenger rail service at a profit. You cannot carry the \nobligations that are required with a passenger rail system. My \ncolleague will excuse me when I say this: It is kind of fallacious to \neven believe that it is possible. We tried it.\n  In 1997, our reauthorization bill said we should try to eliminate \nsubsidies. We couldn't eliminate them. But I will tell my colleagues \nwhat did happen. Ridership has gone way up. That proves one thing; that \nis, that the railroads have to be there. We just had a vote on an \namendment calling for the elimination of routes across the country \nwhich lost substantially. The fact is, the country desperately needs \nrail service. Our airlines are busy beyond capacity. Highways are busy \nbeyond capacity. We are stuck in traffic all over. The railroad is \nfinally beginning to find its way out.\n  What we have in our bill, for the edification of our friend from \nColorado, is a goal to reduce operating subsidies by 40 percent in 6 \nyears. That is a start.\n  I urge my colleague to let this take place. Let it happen. Let's see \nwhat goes on there. We have made all kinds of conditions of reform for \nthe railroad, not ignoring the fact that there have been large \nsubsidies but also recognizing that passenger rail service requires \nsubsidy.\n  In the UK, for example, the Government decided to go private with its \nrail system. They found out that things deteriorated rapidly. They \nweren't safe, and they weren't efficient. We are now beginning to see \nthat Amtrak is attracting ridership as we have not seen it before, as \n26 million people rode Amtrak last year. But so many burdens were \nplaced on Amtrak: insufficient funding for capital in the first place, \nsubstantial outstanding indebtedness.\n  How did Amtrak get to be a national corporation? It got there in the \nearly 1970s because the private sector couldn't handle it. There is no \nmoney to be made there, when you consider that freight railroads are \nmaking money and freight railroads often are an impediment to passenger \nrail service operating efficiently.\n  We are going through a review of what Amtrak ought to be. We know our \nequipment is not up to date. We know our trackage is not up to date. We \nknow our signage is not up to date.\n\n  I had the opportunity to ride in the engine of a train from Paris to \nBrussels going to a NATO meeting. We cruised along at 300 kilometers, \n180 miles an hour, and rode 200 miles in an hour and 20 minutes. It is \nthat kind of service that could be offered if we could invest in \nbringing Amtrak up to date, and perhaps we could begin to see the \nresults that would attract that kind of support.\n  Revenue increases have been taking place, so we are on a good track \nto make Amtrak more efficient, less costly, and more conscious of their \noperating expenses. But we have to be able to continue in that vein. If \nwe said we demand there be a point in time when there are no more \nsubsidies, we would not be being realistic. It can happen.\n  I hope if this comes to a vote, we will defeat it soundly. I think we \nhave the votes to do that. I hope we can put this aside for now and \ngive us a chance to go further on the debate and the review of the \nAmtrak bill as it is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I wish to respond for a moment, if I \nmight, to clarify. No. 1, I am a strong proponent of fixed rail. As \nchairman of the Housing and Transportation Subcommittee in Banking, I \nworked hard for mass transit and, obviously, fixed rail. So I agree \nthat rail needs to be a vital part of our transportation system.\n  All this amendment does is put in law a goal we want self-sufficiency \nfor--not capital investments. So as to the signage the Senator talks \nabout, the rails on the ground that need to be laid, buying the new \ntransportation, it does not apply to that. It applies to operational \ncosts. It is not a hard line. We have been going for several years \nwithout meeting this goal.\n  I think we have done some work in that direction, but as far as I am \nconcerned, the amount of efficiency has been pretty minimal. I think we \ncan do more. Even if it is minimal, at least we can keep it in there so \nit continues to\n\n[[Page S13415]]\n\nencourage them to be more efficient and review processes and procedures \nthey use in the operation of Amtrak. That is not capital investment. \nThat is operational, things they can do to bring efficiency to their \nservices, which I think is to the advantage of the rider, as well as to \nthe taxpayers of this country.\n  I wanted to clarify that for the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to \nspeak as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Barrasso pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2229 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                        Internet Tax Moratorium\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, a large number of Senators of both parties \nare working in good faith to try to address this question of the \nInternet tax moratorium. I simply want to take a few minutes this \nafternoon to bring to light a new development in the discussion that I \nhope all Senators will keep in mind.\n  The Congressional Research Service--our independent group that \nanalyzes policy matters--informed me this morning that because the \nother body, the House of Representatives, changed the definitions in \nthe current Internet tax moratorium, it would be possible, under the \nlanguage that was adopted by the other body, to tax various Web \nservices, such as e-mail. I know no Member of the Senate who wishes to \nsee that happen.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent at this time to have printed \nin the Record the memorandum the lawyers at the Congressional Research \nService sent me about the Internet tax moratorium.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Congressional Research Service,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 24, 2007.\n\n\n                               Memorandum\n\n     To: The Honorable Ron Wyden, Attention: Joshua Sheinkman.\n     From: John R. Luckey, Legislative Attorney, American Law \n         Division.\n     Subject: Internet Tax Moratorium.\n       This memorandum is furnished in response to your request \n     for an analysis of whether the definition of ``internet \n     access'' in the Internet Tax Freedom Act Amendments (H.R. \n     3678) as passed by the House is more restrictive (would \n     permit more activities to be taxed by the states) than that \n     of the Internet Tax Moratorium which is set to expire on \n     November 1, 2007.\n       The expiring moratorium defines ``Internet access'' to \n     mean:\n\n     a service that enables users to access content, information, \n     electronic mail, or other services offered over the Internet, \n     and may also include access to proprietary content, \n     information, and other services as part of a package of \n     services offered to users. The term `Internet access' does \n     not include telecommunications services, except to the extent \n     such services are purchased, used, or sold by a provider of \n     Internet access to provide Internet access.\n\n       Exemption is provided for voice services over the Internet.\n       H.R. 3678 would define ``Internet access'' as follows:\n       The term ``Internet Access''--\n       (A) means a service that enables users to connect to the \n     Internet to access content, information, or other services \n     offered over the Internet;\n       (B) includes the purchase, use or sale of \n     telecommunications by a provider of a service described in \n     subparagraph (A) to the extent such telecommunications are \n     purchased, used or sold (i) to provide such service; or (ii) \n     to otherwise enable users to access content, information or \n     other services offered over the Internet;\n       (C) includes services that are incidental to the provision \n     of the service described in subparagraph (A) when furnished \n     to users as part of such service, such as a home page, \n     electronic mail and instant messaging (including voice- and \n     video-capable electronic mail and instant messaging), video \n     clips, and personal electronic storage capacity; and\n       (D) does not include voice, audio or video programming, or \n     other products and services (except services described in \n     subparagraph (A), (B), or (C)) that utilize Internet protocol \n     or any successor protocol and for which there is a charge, \n     regardless of whether such charge is separately stated or \n     aggregated with the charge for services described in \n     subparagraph (A), (B), or (C).\n       The language of H.R. 3678 would be more restrictive in at \n     least two ways. First, the ``enables users to connect'' \n     language of paragraph (A) would limit the moratorium to taxes \n     upon the connection provider and services they provide under \n     (B) and (C). Thus, if an Internet user utilized one provider \n     to connect to the internet and another paid provider of, for \n     instance, email services, the connection provider would be \n     covered by the moratorium but not the paid email provider. \n     Under the current moratorium, each would be covered.\n       Second, the exemption of paragraph (D) would allow the \n     taxation of many more products and services than the existing \n     exemption under the current Sec. 1108.\n       We hope this information is responsive to your request. If \n     you have further questions, please call.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, in reference to the language that came from \nthe other body, which I am concerned about, the Congressional Research \nService said:\n\n        . . . if an Internet user utilized one provider to connect \n     to the internet and another paid provider of, for instance, \n     email services, the connection provider would be covered by \n     the moratorium but not the paid email provider. Under the \n     current moratorium, each would be covered.\n\n  What that means is, if you are an American, for example, who gets \nyour Internet access from Verizon, under the House language that would \ncontinue to be protected. But if you get your e-mail from, say, another \nprovider--perhaps EarthLink or Google or Yahoo--under the language that \nwas passed by the other body, that could be taxed, according to the \nCongressional Research Service. I do not think any Member of this body \nwants that to happen.\n  Also, reading further from the Congressional Research Service \nmemorandum, they say it would also allow the taxation ``of many more \nproducts and services than the existing exemption under the current \nmoratorium.''\n\n  The reason I wanted to bring this to light this afternoon is I know \nvarious proposals will be voted on next week. I will not be able to be \nhere next week because of some very exciting news in our household, but \nI do want all Senators to be aware of what the Congressional Research \nService has said. We have had the Internet tax moratorium now for a \ndecade. I wrote the original law with now-SEC Chairman Christopher Cox, \nand it has worked well. The Internet has thrived and prospered. It is, \nof course, a technology treasure trove that we use for business, health \nopportunities, education, and a vast array of services.\n  We were told when the original proposal came out that it would, for \nexample, be harmful to States, that they would lose revenue. That \nhasn't been the case. The States have gained in revenue for something \nlike 16 straight quarters.\n  We heard it would be harmful to Main Street, to small businesses. \nThat hasn't been the case either. In fact, most small businesses now \nlook to something called ``Bricks and Clicks'' where they have a \nphysical presence and an Internet presence.\n  We were also told it would be harmful to malls, as if our original \nproposal would empty the malls. That hasn't happened either. The \nmoratorium has worked well, and I wish to make it permanent.\n  Frankly, the thing I am most concerned about this afternoon is the \nchange in these definitions. The change in the definitions from the \noriginal moratorium, as outlined in this memo by the Congressional \nResearch Service, ought to trouble every Senator as this\n\n[[Page S13416]]\n\nbody considers the various alternatives that will be presented this \nupcoming week. I think the current definitions have served us well. \nThey have allowed the net to thrive and prosper and they haven't caused \ndamage to the States or to small businesses on Main Street or to the \nshopping malls. I see no reason for changing those current definitions.\n  I hope Senators will reflect on this language. Certainly it is going \nto be hard to explain to folks at home making changes that would open \nup the prospect, as the Congressional Research Service has said, for \ntaxing e-mail. But an awful lot of Americans get their Internet access \nfrom one provider and they get their e-mail from somebody else. Given \nthat, I wanted to make sure the Senate was aware of this, and that as \nthe Senate considers this legislation, the issue of whether the \nmoratorium should be made permanent is important, but even more \nimportant is getting this question of the definitions of what is \ncovered in the moratorium right, because I don't believe any Senator \nwants to see happen what the Congressional Research Service has \nindicated this morning could happen under the bill that was passed by \nthe other body.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, we need to invest in America's \ninfrastructure. Today, America invests only three-tenths of 1 percent \nof our gross domestic product in public buildings and roads and \nbridges, ports and railroads. This abysmal figure is the lowest rate in \nthe recent history of public investments dating back to at least the \n1960s, and maybe before that. In Minnesota earlier this year, we saw \nsome of the tragic consequences of the failure to invest in America.\n  I am glad to see the Sununu amendment was not agreed to. That \namendment would have put a cap on our subsidies that Amtrak can utilize \non its routes. In truth, however, such an amendment would put an end to \nall of Amtrak's long-distance trains within 5 years. By eliminating all \nof these essential rail services, the amendment would also lead to the \nslow but certain death of America's regional service as well.\n  The Nation receives extraordinary public benefits from mass \ntransportation systems. They take thousands of cars off of our \ncongested highways. They take tons of pollutants out of the air we \nbreathe. They move people more efficiently into and out of our most \ncongested areas. Such an amendment and the veto threat issued by the \nWhite House both are based on wrong assumptions--that we should be \ntaking management flexibility and financial resources away from Amtrak. \nWe should be doing exactly the opposite. We need to invest in Amtrak, \njust as we need to invest in our bridges, buildings, ports, and other \ntransit systems.\n  Amtrak operates approximately 90 trains daily in Maryland, mostly on \nthe Amtrak-owned Northeast corridor, through Baltimore, Penn Station, \nand New Carrollton. In addition to the Northeast corridor service, \nincluding the Acela Express, Regional, and Metroliner trains, Amtrak \noperates five long-distance trains through Maryland, as well as two \nregional trains. More than 1.7 million passengers board and disembark \nin Maryland's Amtrak stations every year. Those numbers are increasing. \nAmtrak's fiscal 2007 ridership topped 25.8 million. That is the fifth \nyear in a row that Amtrak has seen a growth in passenger service.\n  So our constituents want this service. They need this service. It is \nin our national interest to promote a more efficient passenger rail \nsystem. It also set a record for the highest ridership that Amtrak has \nseen since the National Railroad Passenger Corporation was enacted in \n1971.\n  Amtrak employs more than 2,500 Marylanders, brings good jobs that \nrange from corporate executives and accountants to trainmen and the men \nand women who operate and maintain the tracks. Amtrak operates weekday \nMARC commuter rail service on the Northeast corridor, including \nWashington, Baltimore, and Perryville, under a contract with the \nMaryland Transit Administration. It has a shared capital agreement with \nthe State. Both Amtrak and the State of Maryland invest jointly in the \nimprovements. The joint benefit program included the investment of $28 \nmillion by the State in 2006.\n  Amtrak is part of the infrastructure backbone of Maryland. It carries \nmillions of passengers, employs thousands of workers, and benefits all \nof us, both economically and environmentally. Let me underscore that.\n  Transit service is important for quality of life, so people can get \nfrom one place to another. It is certainly a lot easier if you are \ntrying to get from Baltimore to New York to get on a train. It takes \nyou right to downtown New York. You don't have to worry about going \nthrough the security of an airport. It is easier for people to use the \nrail service. But you are also helping our environment. It is a \nfriendlier way for our energy and dealing with the environmental risks \nof transportation today to our environment. I was at a hearing \nyesterday regarding global climate change. Rail service will help us in \ndealing with the challenges of our environment. So it is in our \nenvironmental interest.\n\n  It is also in our economic interest. It helps us to become more \nenergy efficient. We import too much oil. We are dependent upon \ncountries with policies with which we disagree. Amtrak is part of the \nsolution by improving rail service in this country. So we will be \nhelping the security of America, the economy of America, and certainly \nthe environmental issues as well.\n  Mr. President, we need to rethink our approach to America's critical \ninfrastructure. We need to reinvest in Amtrak. It is an investment in \nAmerica that is long overdue. I urge my colleagues to support the \nlegislation.\n  I thank the leadership in the Senate for bringing this issue forward. \nIt will have my support.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nPassenger Rail Improvement and Investment Act of 2007. I thank my \ndistinguished senior colleague from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, \nwho, not only in this legislation but for some time, has been probably \nAmtrak's strongest advocate. Beyond being an advocate for Amtrak, which \ncertainly is worthy of it, it is the advocacy over the course of the \nyears of millions of riders who depend upon Amtrak to send their sales \nforce to work, to promote their products along Amtrak's routes; those \nAmericans who use Amtrak to get to some of the Nation's leading \nhospitals and research centers to try to be cured; those individuals \nwho come to visit, for example, the Nation's Capital and do so through \nAmtrak and the tourism that is spread throughout that process; those \nwho do financial transactions in commerce and lawyers--a whole host and \nuniverse of America's economy and people who use Amtrak to ultimately \nachieve the Nation's economic well-being. Senator Lautenberg has been \nat the forefront of that. I thank him and Senator Lott for their \nefforts in guiding this important legislation to the floor.\n  Every year since 2002, Amtrak has had to continue operations on a \nyearly basis without adequate funds to maintain the rail system over \nthe long term. It is almost like a starvation diet--keeping it up just \nenough to be temporarily alive but working it in such a way and cutting \nits funds in such a way that it can neither be successful nor fully \nsurvive. Right now, the system is at a breaking point. Amtrak's \nequipment is aging, and no amount of maintenance can keep cars built in \nthe 1950s on the tracks.\n  Amtrak is not just a passenger rail system that serves 25 million \npeople each year; Amtrak is also a program that reduces our greenhouse \ngas emissions, reduces congestion on our roadways, fights sprawl, \ncreates jobs, and it fosters economic activity. I know firsthand the \nbenefits of Amtrak because over 100,000 New Jersey commuters depend on \nAmtrak's infrastructure every day. There are many other commuter\n\n[[Page S13417]]\n\nrail systems in States that depend upon Amtrak's infrastructure as well \nto move very large amounts of their State's residents over the Amtrak \nlines.\n  Some critics want Amtrak to be the only major transportation system \nin the world that operates without Government subsidy. This standard is \nsimply impossible to meet and a standard to which we do not hold any \nother mode of transportation. Over the past 35 years, we have spent \nless money on Amtrak than we will on highways in this year alone. So \nover the last three and a half decades, we have spent less money on \nAmtrak than we will spend on highways just in this year alone. When you \nfactor in State and local subsidies for infrastructure and parking, \nsome studies suggest that up to 8 percent of our gross national product \nis spent on subsidies for automobile use.\n  We have never committed the same support behind Amtrak as we have for \nother modes of transportation. This bill will finally give Amtrak a \nstable amount of authorized funds it needs over the next 6 years to \nadequately fund its operation and finance capital improvements.\n  At the same time, these funds aren't free. To get these funds, Amtrak \nwill be forced to tighten its belt, while simultaneously improving \nservice. The bill reduces Amtrak's annual appropriations need by \nrequiring reforms that will reduce Amtrak's operating costs by 40 \npercent over the life of the bill.\n  In addition, the bill provides for $1.4 billion for States to provide \nnew passenger rail service between cities. In some instances, these \nState operations will likely provide service that complements existing \nAmtrak service just as the recent light rail projects we have seen in \nNew Jersey have done. In other cases, these funds may actually create \ncompetition for Amtrak for service between some cities.\n  The bill will also require Amtrak to use a new financial accounting \nsystem so that regulators and legislators can better monitor how Amtrak \nuses its resources. This bill would also require Amtrak to use its \nresources to provide a new level of service by improving ontime \nperformance, upgrading onboard services, and providing easier access to \nother transportation systems.\n  Finally, the bill will also require a systemwide security review to \nensure that rail remains a safe transportation alternative. With \nrecord-high gasoline prices, congested highways, and airports that are \nexperiencing record delays, we need all the alternative forms of \ntransportation we can provide to a frustrated American traveler.\n  Mr. President, as someone who represents a State that saw the \nconsequences of what happened on September 11, 2001, that fateful day, \nsince then we have come to fully appreciate the importance of multiple \nmodes of transportation in a security context.\n\n  We have always talked about transportation in the context of getting \npeople to work and jobs and economic opportunity. We have talked about \nsending sales forces of small and midsize businesses, using rail \nservices to go to different cities, for intercity travel, so they can \npromote their products and services. We have talked about people who \nmight get on a rail line to go to Johns Hopkins University Hospital or \nsome of the great hospitals in New Jersey, such as Robert Wood Johnson \nor Hackensack University Medical Center, or the great hospitals in New \nYork, to name one of the many route lines that give people access to \nsuch opportunities. We have talked about tourism and people being able \nto take Amtrak to go to different parts of the country to see the \ngreatness of America. That has always been the focus we have had as it \nrelates to rail passenger service or, for that fact, really \ntransportation modes in general. But on September 11, and therefrom, we \nlearned that multiple modes of transportation are critical to the \nNation's security and well-being.\n  On that fateful day, when we had the attacks in New York and the \nplane that crashed in Pennsylvania and the incident that took place in \nWashington at the Pentagon--on that fateful day, when in the \nmetropolitan region where there are millions of Americans living, where \nthe tunnels were closed down, where the bridges were closed down, where \nthe subway systems were closed down, it was a different mode of \ntransportation that got people out of downtown Manhattan from the World \nTrade Center site and to hospitals to be triaged in my State of New \nJersey. That particular mode of transportation happened to be ferries. \nThe only way to get into intercity travel, when all of the airlines \nwere shut down for that period of time, was Amtrak.\n  So we have learned a lesson that this is beyond economics. We have \nlearned a lesson that this is beyond tourism and this is beyond getting \npeople to great centers of research and medicine to be cured; it is \nalso about security. If we do away with Amtrak, we do away with the \nability to have another mode of transportation that is critical to our \nsecurity blanket. We have to think about Amtrak in that way as well.\n  Finally, there are small communities in rural America in which the \nonly entity that stops at their doorstep is Amtrak--the only entity \nthat stops at their doorstep. Imagine being cut off from the rest of \nAmerica, other than through a car, because no entity serves the \nopportunity to make your community the destination. Amtrak, as part of \na national rail system, creates opportunities for many parts of America \nto finally realize that they, too, will have access to the rest of the \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, for all of these reasons, I urge my colleagues to \nrecognize that a strong, well-funded Amtrak is an essential resource \nfor our country in all of these dimensions. I urge my colleagues to \ngive us a strong vote for the Passenger Rail Improvement and Investment \nAct of 2007 and make sure that we reject amendments that would seek to \nundermine this critical asset for our economy, for our environment, for \nour health care and, yes, in a post-September 11 world, for our \nsecurity. Let's make sure we send a strong message from the Senate that \nwe will take second place to no one in the world in terms of having a \nstrong passenger rail system and will unite our country by giving that \nopportunity for Amtrak to travel across the landscape of America and be \nable to meet all of these challenges.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3456\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order regarding my \namendment No. 3456.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That amendment is pending.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3456, as Modified\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I send a modification of my amendment to \nthe desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 35, strike line 20 and all that follows through \n     ``(A)'' on line 23 and insert the following:\n       ``(b)'' Implementation.--Pursuant to any rules or \n     regulations promulgated under subsection (a)\n       On page 36, strike lines 6 through 11.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, have I been recognized?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I submitted to the desk a small technical \nmodification of the amendment I offered that would strike the \nprohibition on allowing multiple routes to be competitively bid under \nthe Amtrak system. In the legislation, there is competitive bidding \nallowed but for only two routes. I don't think we need to have such an \narbitrary restriction. The technical modification makes sure the right \nportions of the bill, the right lines of the bill are referenced in the \namendment. It is not a substantive change.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3452\n\n  Mr. President, I also wish to address my amendment that deals with \nInternet taxes. I offered this amendment last night, and I offered it \non this legislation because we have been unable to get a vote anywhere \nin the Senate on Internet tax moratorium.\n\n[[Page S13418]]\n\n  What an Internet tax moratorium does is prevents States, cities, and \ntowns from placing taxes on the cost of Internet access, whether it is \nfor consumers, small businesses, large businesses--it doesn't matter. \nThe Internet is a national and global system for communications. It is \na national system for commerce and for business, and it should be \nprotected from multiple taxation, from local taxation for a number of \nreasons.\n  First, it is interstate commerce and, frankly, if there are going to \nbe taxes levied, that interstate commerce and interstate communication \nshould be the responsibility of Congress.\n  Second, because those taxes would only discourage broadband \ndeployment, it would raise costs for consumers and certainly have an \nimpact on businesses that rely on Internet access as part of doing \nbusiness.\n  We were supposed to have a markup in the Commerce Committee. The bill \nwas pulled from the markup. This is not something that just came up. We \nimplemented a ban on Internet taxes in 1998 that lasted for 5 years. We \nextended it in 2003 for another 4 years. This is something that has \nreceived bipartisan support in the House and the Senate. Over 240 \nMembers of the House of Representatives, Democrats and Republicans, \nsupport making this ban on Internet access taxes permanent.\n  Given that we have seen no action and that the prohibition expires on \nNovember 1, less than a week from today, I am sure a lot of people \nacross the country are wondering why is Congress so dysfunctional. Why \nhas Congress not acted on something that has such broad bipartisan \nsupport that is going to expire in less than a week?\n  I cannot answer that question, but I can try to do something about \nit, and that is why I offered an amendment to this bill that would make \nthat ban on Internet access taxes permanent. The way it does that is by \ntaking legislation that passed the House by a very strong bipartisan \nvote, 405 to 2, and making that 4-year proposal a permanent proposal. \nWe take the same approach to technical definitions, the same approach \nto grandfathering that existed for some States that taxed the Internet \nin the past, and simply make that legislation permanent.\n  There is also a second-degree amendment that was offered to my \namendment--an amendment to my amendment--that would say we should not \nmake this ban permanent; we should only make it 4 years. I think that \nis a mistake. Given that we have already extended the ban on Internet \naccess twice, given that it has bipartisan support, given that we have \nbeen able to see how this law works and has worked effectively over the \nlast 9 years, I don't think we need to keep passing short-term \nextensions. And, frankly, short-term extensions, whether they are 1 \nyear, 2 years, or 4 years, is something the American public looks at, \nand it is baffling why we cannot find it within ourselves the \ndiscipline, the will--whatever it takes--to make a good idea the \npermanent law of the land. It is high time we do that when it comes to \nbanning Internet access taxes.\n  Senator Wyden spoke earlier about this issue and suggested that the \ntechnical language in the bill passed by the other body was not \nperfect. That should come as a surprise to no one. There is no such \nthing as absolutely perfect legislation. But it was certainly good \nenough to get all but two Members of 435, all but two Members to vote \nfor the legislation. It was certainly good enough to offer the same \nlanguage as an amendment to my bill.\n  To suggest that this language is fatally flawed is very much \nmistaken. But even if it were an issue that needed to be addressed, it \nwill have to be addressed whether we pass a 4-year extension or a \npermanent extension. So to use that as an excuse to oppose making the \nInternet tax ban permanent, I think, is a mistake. It simply is wrong.\n\n  I would like to see the clearest possible language when it comes to \nservice providers that are providing different kinds of Internet \nservices but might not be providing Internet access as well. I even had \nan amendment ready to offer in committee to improve this language. As I \nindicated, Mr. President, we didn't have any amendments in committee \nbecause we didn't have any votes in committee because we didn't have \nany bill offered before the committee for a markup.\n  So that is where we find ourselves. We have a proposal in front of us \nin the way of an amendment to make permanent the ban on Internet access \ntaxes using language that has been supported in a very strong \nbipartisan way in the House of Representatives, and we have an \namendment to my proposal that would say: No, let's not make it \npermanent; let's do another short-term extension.\n  We have filed a cloture petition to bring debate on this particular \nissue to a close. That vote will happen tomorrow. And if cloture is \ninvoked, we will have a vote on both amendments.\n  I have no problem voting on alternatives. And I have said this in \ndifferent situations on different legislation in the past. What is most \nfrustrating, as a Member of the Senate, is when there are procedural \nmaneuverings used to prevent us from offering an amendment, having a \nvote on any given alternative. I do not mind voting on bills or \nlegislation that I don't support. If you don't support something, you \nvote no and explain to people why you don't support it.\n  So we have both of these amendments before us, a cloture vote that \nwill occur to bring debate to a close, and have the votes. And I \ncertainly hope we vote cloture so we can have the votes and move \nforward on this very important issue.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CARPER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SUNUNU. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. CARPER. I would invite the Senator from New Hampshire to engage \nin a brief colloquy. I have been listening to his comments. I think we \nhave a couple of options, and there may be a better path for it than \nthe one we are assuming today. We are talking about an amendment that \nthe Senator had offered to the Amtrak bill, bringing the Internet tax \nissues to the reauthorization of Amtrak, and others of us would offer a \nsecond-degree amendment to that. There will be a cloture vote that will \nproceed either of those two amendments.\n  I think there is another alternative that I would ask my friend to \nconsider, and that would be the chance--I think all along the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire has wanted an up-or-down vote on his proposal, which \nis fair game. I think our own leadership, and I think in consultation \nwith your leadership, including with Senator Lott, has suggested maybe \none day next week we have an up-or-down vote--your proposal and the \nalternative of our proposal that Senator Alexander and I and others \nwould offer, which would provide for a 6-year extension for a \nmoratorium on Internet taxation. For another 6 years we would provide \nfor a 6-year extension of the grandfather--\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, reclaiming my time, and I am happy to view \nthe statement that was made in the form of a question so I can respond. \nThat is what we will have if we invoke cloture tomorrow. We will have a \nvote on a 4-year extension and a vote on making the ban permanent. We \ncan certainly have further discussions about the procedures and \nproposals off the Senate floor rather than negotiate a process or a \nprocedure in a colloquy format, but I am sure the Senator from Delaware \ncan appreciate the frustration that has put us in this position, given \nthat no bill was offered in committee, no bill was offered in the \nFinance Committee, and in fact the legislation was pulled.\n  So I am pleased we are in a position now where tomorrow we will have \nexactly what the Senator from Delaware prescribes, and if there are \nother alternatives or proposals, I am certainly happy to listen to \nthem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, while Senator Sununu is still on the \nfloor, if I could add one other comment. Senator Lott said at the \nbeginning of the debate on this bill that folks are welcome, Democrats \nand Republicans, to come and offer their amendments, nongermane, if \nthey are. But when we get to conference, he said: I will warn you right \nfrom the get-go, nongermane amendments that are offered to this bill \nmight be attached to this bill when we get to conference, but they will \nnot be in this bill when we come out.\n  So I would suggest to Senator Sununu that we consider the approach\n\n[[Page S13419]]\n\nI just outlined; that next week, maybe in the middle of next week, he \nwould have the opportunity, with time for debate, to offer his proposal \nto make permanent the moratorium on taxing Internet access, and we \nwould have the opportunity to offer an alternative, which would be a 6-\nyear extension of the moratorium.\n  I will tell you why we think it is important. Five years ago, I never \nheard of VOIT, voice over Internet protocol. I had no idea what it was. \nI don't think anybody around here did. That is the ability to send \ntelecommunications, telephone messages, over the Internet. It is a \nmajor change in the way we communicate on the telephone. The problem \nwith making permanent this legislation is we assume there are not going \nto be any more technological changes. We are learning how to send cable \nTV, movies, and all kinds of stuff over the Internet. Traditionally, \nState and local governments have had the right to raise revenues as \nthey see fit. In fact, we have an unfunded mandates law that says State \nand local governments have protection from us in Congress telling them \nhow to spend their money or telling them how to raise their money. We \npassed a law that says we can't do that. I was Governor, actually, in \n1995. I was Governor when we pushed for that sort of protection. Who \nare we in the Federal Government to tell States how they have to spend \ntheir money or how they can raise it? That is what was adopted in the \nunfunded mandates legislation in 1995.\n\n  We turned around in Congress 3 years later and said: By the way, we \ndon't want folks to tax access to the Internet, and if you are already \ndoing that in the United States, we are going to grandfather you in for \na while, but we put in place, starting in 1998, this 3-year moratorium \non other States beginning to tax access to the Internet--really trying \nto tax people's AOL bills.\n  The concern as we go forward, as we learn to do other things over the \nInternet other than sending e-mails and instant messaging and stuff, if \nwe allow the bundling of services, including telephone services, \nincluding cable services, television services, the sort of thing that \nState and local governments have traditionally used to pay for \neducation, pay for schools, pay for fire, pay for police, or pay for \nparamedics, if we aren't careful, we are going to basically preclude or \nreduce their ability to raise the revenue they need for the problems in \ntheir States.\n  So we are not smart enough--I am not smart enough, and I don't think \nany of us here are smart enough--to know for certainty what the \ntechnology is going to be in 5 years, 4 years, or 10 years. That is why \nwe want the extension of the moratorium, to make sure people's access \nto the Internet is not going to be taxed, but what we don't want to do \nis to do something permanently because of the changing nature of \ntechnology.\n  So I think it makes sense next week for us to have the opportunity \nfor Senator Sununu to come to the floor, offer his permanent moratorium \namendment, and have the same opportunity for Senator Alexander and \nmyself, and Senator Dorgan, Senator Feinstein, Senator Rockefeller, \nSenator Enzi, and Senator Voinovich, and others who believe that a 6-\nyear moratorium may be the better alternative for now. I hope we will \nhave that opportunity.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I appreciate the interest of the Senator \nfrom Delaware in the issue, and I want to take the opportunity to \nrespond to a couple of issues.\n  First, on the substantive issues: The Congress--the Federal \nGovernment--tells the States what they can or can't do on taxes all the \ntime; not in every area, to be sure, and we shouldn't in every area. \nAnd if this permanent ban on Internet taxes passes, Internet-related \nbusinesses will still pay property taxes, payroll taxes, and business \nincome taxes, but the network itself, access to the global network \nitself, will not be subject to taxes.\n  This is not that dissimilar from the fact that we prevent States from \nlevying their own export taxes because it affects international trade \nand global commerce, and even interstate commerce. We don't allow \nStates to arbitrarily tax flights from their State to other States or \nacross the country for the same reason--because we view that as \ninterstate commerce and an interstate transportation system. We even \nhave restrictions on States' ability to impose tolls on interstate \nhighways, all for the same reason.\n  So to suggest that we should never tell States how to handle matters \nof taxation is incorrect. We do it all the time. And we should do it on \nmatters of interstate commerce, which is the responsibility--the \nconstitutional responsibility--of the Congress.\n  Second, back to the issue of technology changing. Well, of course, \ntechnology changes things. And we may and do have to modify legislation \nfrom time to time with regard to evolving technology. Regulations or \nlaws affecting the Federal Communications Commission--the FCC--laws \nregarding regulations of video, phone, Internet protocol services, we \nwant to make sure they keep pace. But that doesn't mean every law we \npass in these areas should be temporary, especially in matters of \ntaxation, because the way we tax goods and services affects our entire \neconomy.\n  Anyone who has worked in the area of technology is familiar with the \nR tax credit. The Congress continually passes 1- and 2-year \nextensions of the research and development tax credit, even though it \npasses almost unanimously in both Chambers every time. The American \npublic looks at that and they wonder if our goal is to just make a \nlittle bit of extra work for lobbyists. It is wrong to deal with our \nTax Code on such a short-term basis, whether it is the research and \ndevelopment tax credit or Internet access taxes.\n  Finally, a couple of points about process. How easy it is to stand up \non the Senate floor and say: Well, let's do the collegial thing and \njust take care of this next week. We had the Internet tax moratorium on \nthe floor a few years ago. It made the moratorium permanent. The \nopponents of making the Internet moratorium permanent said: We are not \nquite ready. Could we take care of this next week or maybe the week \nafter? And in good faith that bill was taken from the floor. Then the \nopponents of making the ban permanent prevented us from bringing the \nbill to the floor for another 9 months. Maybe it was even longer.\n  So it is easy to come and say we should take care of this next week, \nbut the fact is that next week the moratorium expires. On November 1, \nthe moratorium expires. Why can't we take care of it this week, with \nthe votes that are currently pending, currently before us--not just for \nmy amendment but for an alternative, an amendment to my proposal? I \nthink that is more than fair.\n  Again, I will be happy to talk about alternatives. And since we were \nfirst scheduled to have a debate and markup on this legislation in the \nCommerce Committee, no one has come to me and proposed specific \nalternatives other than the amendment that has been offered to my \nproposal. And just now Senator Carper said: Well, maybe not 4 years, \nmaybe 6 years. And I know he means that in good faith, but there are \nother leaders, on the Commerce Committee and others, who have an \nimportant role to play that will also have to be part of those \ndiscussions, and none of them have approached me directly with an \nalternative.\n  So I hope we can resolve this. I hope my colleagues will support \nmaking the Internet tax moratorium permanent and support me in voting \nfor cloture tomorrow morning so we can have those votes.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             GLOBAL WARMING\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nthe scientific truth. Once again, the administration has kept all the \nfacts from getting to the American people. On Tuesday, the Director of \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Julie Gerberding, \ntestified before the Environment and Public Works Committee on the \nhealth impacts of global warming. The purpose of this hearing was to \nget all the facts\n\n[[Page S13420]]\n\nabout the health threats global warming poses to our communities and \nour families. I thank Senator Boxer for her leadership of that \ncommittee, for her leadership on climate change. I am proud to be a \nmember of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and we are doing \nsome very good work in the climate change area. We actually have some \nlegislation that we are considering in the next few weeks that I \nbelieve is good legislation. I don't believe we can wait to act.\n  I went to Greenland this summer and saw firsthand the water coming \noff these humongous glaciers like spigots. They have lost the size of \nGreenland and Arizona combined off the Greenland ice sheet. It is the \ncanary in the coal mine for climate change.\n  There was a hearing this week. Unfortunately, the Director's initial \ntestimony was not the testimony that was presented to the committee \nbecause her initial testimony did present the facts. As the Centers for \nDisease Control Director, she appears if you look at her initial \ntestimony, to have taken seriously the mission of Centers for Disease \nControl which pledges to:\n\n        . . . base all public health decisions on the highest \n     quality scientific data, openly and objectively derived.\n\n  But the testimony she gave at the committee fell short of that pledge \nbecause, as has been reported in the press, the administration \neliminated much of Dr. Gerberding's draft testimony which highlighted \nthe threats to public health posed by global warming.\n  It is only the latest incident in what has been a pattern of this \nadministration in attempting to suppress science. Specifically, this \nadministration deleted her testimony on the views of the Centers for \nDisease Control on several health impacts of global warming, including \nexplanations and descriptions of the links to heat stroke, weather \ndisasters, worsening air pollution and allergies, food- and water-borne \ninfectious diseases, mosquito- and tick-borne infectious diseases, food \nand water scarcity, mental health problems, and even chronic disease.\n  The Centers for Disease Control is an important agency that the \nAmerican people trust to protect their health and safety and provide \nreliable health information. Let me reiterate one of the central tenets \nof the mission of the Centers for Disease Control, to:\n\n        . . . base all public health decisions on the highest \n     quality scientific data, openly and objectively derived.\n\n  Dr. Gerberding's original testimony included the following statement:\n\n       The United States is expected to see an increase in the \n     severity, duration and frequency of extreme heat waves. This, \n     coupled with an aging population, increases the likelihood of \n     higher mortality as the elderly are more vulnerable to dying \n     from exposure from excessive heat.\n\n  The President's spokesman claims they edited the testimony because:\n\n       there were broad characterizations about climate change \n     science that didn't align with the U.N. Intergovernmental \n     Panel on Climate Change Report.\n\n  What did the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Report state \nabout the prospects of heat waves? It is important to remember that the \nIPCC is a very cautious group of scientists with a very conservative \nprocess for meticulously reviewing their conclusions through consensus. \nTheir reports are produced by some 600 authors from 40 countries. Over \n620 expert reviewers and a large number of Government reviewers also \nparticipated.\n  The IPCC stated:\n\n       Severe heat waves will intensify in magnitude and duration \n     over the portions of the U.S. where they already occur . . .\n\n     and:\n\n       Local factors, such as the proportion of elderly people, \n     are important in determining the underlying temperature-\n     mortality relationship in a population.\n\n  I ask you, how does this align? How does eliminating this from the \nNation's leading public health official's testimony benefit Americans?\n  Let me cite another example that was deleted from her testimony. Dr. \nGerberding's original testimony stated:\n\n       The west coast of the United States is expected to \n     experience significant strains on water supplies as regional \n     precipitation declines and mountain snowpacks are depleted. \n     Forest fires are expected to increase in frequency, severity, \n     distribution and duration.\n\n  So as the wildfires rage out West, the President, his administration, \nis censoring testimony in the East.\n  Global warming does not cause these fires, but they certainly \nintensify the three main causes of wildfires: high temperature, summer \ndryness, and long-term drought. Southern California has experienced all \nthree and is now suffering the consequences.\n\n  Again, we go back to what the President's spokesperson said yesterday \nwhen asked about this. She said they had to look at that testimony and \nmake sure it was consistent with what the IPCC had said. In fact, that \nwas the reason she gave for why they had censored it. Let's see what \nthe IPCC said about forest fires. They, the IPCC, in their fourth \nassessment report, found that:\n\n        . . . warm spells and heat waves will very likely increase \n     the danger of wildfire.\n\n  That is what they said, the IPCC, that it would increase the danger \nof wildfire.\n  Then you have the head health official for our Government, the \nCenters for Disease Control, in her original testimony, saying it would \nincrease the danger of forest fires. Pretty similar.\n  As these fires are raging in southern California and as we are seeing \nall across the country record high temperatures, record summer dryness, \nand long-term drought, the administration chose to redact, to delete \nportions of the testimony of their Director of Disease Control, which \nin fact predicted this would happen. We have not just seen large forest \nfires in California this year. We saw them in northern Minnesota. I was \nthere shortly after these fires in the Ham Lake area in northern \nMinnesota devastated areas, burned down homes, and went way up to \nCanada. I was meeting up there with resort owners, with residents, and \nwe were talking about the disaster relief, we were talking about when \nthey are going to get their phone lines, we were talking about the \neffects on their business up there. Do you know what some of them \nwanted to talk about in the midst of all this disaster and burned \ntrees? They wanted to talk about climate change because they had seen \nwhat was happening. There was a 30-percent reduction in profits at the \nski resorts; forest fires raging--they knew something was wrong. Yet \nthe administration is deleting the scientific prediction that is saying \nthat exactly this will happen.\n  This is not the time for this administration to be censoring \ninformation. It is the time, instead, to look seriously at the health \nand other impacts of global warming and to take the steps we need to \naddress them. I am proud to be part of a committee, under the \nleadership of Senator Boxer, that is no longer talking about whether \nclimate change exists but talking about how to solve it.\n  We will continue to investigate the reasons this was deleted. We will \ncontinue to request information and get to the truth. But the main \nthing I would like to say today to my colleagues is that the American \npeople know that something is wrong. They want us to solve it. You \ncan't hide the facts anymore. You can't bury them as forest fires are \nraging and sea levels are rising and temperatures are rising. You can't \nbury the facts. You have to get to the solution.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, 2 days ago the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee held a hearing on the Health Impacts of Global Warming. \nOur lead witness was Dr. Julie L. Gerberding, the Director of the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention and the Administrator for \nthe Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry within the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services.\n  Dr. Gerberding was invited to testify by Chairman Boxer because the \nDirector is a highly respected leader in the public health arena. The \ncommittee wanted to have the benefit of her expertise as we grapple \nwith one of the most important issues of our time, global climate \nchange.\n  As everyone now knows, Dr. Gerberding's written testimony for the \nhearing was severely edited, with whole pages deleted. The White House \nsays that some of her written comments did not represent the consensus \nview of the scientific community.\n  The very first line that the White House censored in Dr. Gerberding's \ntestimony was this: ``Scientific evidence supports the view that the \nearth's climate is changing.''\n  If that statement doesn't represent the overwhelming sentiment of the\n\n[[Page S13421]]\n\nworld's scientific community, I don't know what does. I find it \nastounding that this simple, sober statement of scientific fact would \nbe censored.\n  These continuing efforts to silence the scientific community would be \nlaughable if the stakes weren't so high. In the censored portions of \nher testimony, Dr. Gerberding lists them for us: direct effects of \nheat; health effects related to extreme weather events; air pollution-\nrelated health effects; allergic diseases; water- and food-borne \ninfectious diseases; vector-borne and zoonotic diseases; food and water \nscarcity, at least for some populations; mental health problems; and \nlong-term impacts of chronic diseases and other health effects.\n  Mr. President, I found Dr. Gerberding's oral testimony to be \nexcellent. She answered my questions directly and without \nqualifications. Her responses to the other Senators on the panel \nappeared to be equally candid.\n  Oral testimony is always limited by time, and committees rely heavily \non the written comments of witnesses to provide a more complete \nperspective. Because of votes on the Senate floor on Tuesday morning, \nwe were especially constrained for time.\n  I regret that we did not have the benefit of Dr. Gerberding's full \nstatement prior to the hearing. Certainly, they would have added a more \ncomplete picture of the human health impacts associated with global \nwarming than she was able to convey in the highly censored version that \nwas transmitted to the committee.\n  The American people and the U.S. Senate have a right to know what our \ntop health officials have to say on this critical issue. Today I will \nbe submitting to the Record a full copy of the testimony that Dr. \nGerberding had intended to offer. Her views are critical to this \ndebate.\n  Science shouldn't be silenced. And today we will make sure Dr. \nGerberding's words are heard.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of her draft testimony be \nprinted into today's Record. The American people can read for \nthemselves what the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention had to say before the White House censors tried to silence \nher.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Climate Change and Public Health\n\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       Good morning Madam Chairwoman, Senator Inhofe, and other \n     distinguished members of the Committee. It is a pleasure to \n     appear before you as Director of the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention (CDC), the Nation's leading public \n     health protection agency located within the Department of \n     Health and Human Services. Thank you for the opportunity to \n     present testimony on climate change and human health and to \n     highlight the role of CDC in preparing for and responding to \n     the health effects of climate change.\n\n\n                               Background\n\n       The health of all individuals is influenced by the health \n     of people, animals, and the environment around us. Many \n     trends within this larger, interdependent ecologic system \n     influence public health on a global scale, including climate \n     change. The public health response to such trends requires a \n     holistic understanding of disease and the various external \n     factors influencing public health. It is within this larger \n     context where the greatest challenges and opportunities for \n     protecting and promoting public health occur.\n       Scientific evidence supports the view that the earth's \n     climate is changing. A broad array of organizations (federal, \n     state, local, multilateral, faith-based, private and \n     nongovernmental) is working to address climate change. \n     Despite this extensive activity, the public health effects of \n     climate change remain largely unaddressed. CDC considers \n     climate change a serious public health concern.\n\n\n               Climate Change is a Public Health Concern\n\n       In the United States, climate change is likely to have a \n     significant impact on health, through links with the \n     following outcomes: Direct effects of heat, health effects \n     related to extreme weather events, air pollution-related \n     health effects, allergic diseases, water- and food-borne \n     infectious diseases, vector-borne and zoonotic diseases, food \n     and water scarcity, at least for some populations, mental \n     health problems, and long-term impacts of chronic diseases \n     and other health effects.\n       The United States is a developed country with a variety of \n     climates. Because of its well developed health \n     infrastructure, and the greater involvement of government and \n     nongovernmental agencies in disaster planning and response, \n     the health effects from climate change are expected to be \n     less significant than in the developing world. Nevertheless, \n     many Americans will likely experience difficult challenges. \n     Catastrophic weather events such as heat waves and hurricanes \n     are expected to become more frequent, severe, and costly; the \n     U.S. population is anticipated to continue to age and move to \n     vulnerable locations such as coastal areas, increasing \n     exposures to specific risks; and concurrent challenges such \n     as water scarcity in certain regions could limit our \n     resilience. In addition, climate change is likely to alter \n     the current geographic distribution of some vector-borne and \n     zoonotic diseases; some may become more frequent, widespread, \n     and outbreaks could last longer, while others could be \n     reduced in incidence.\n     Heat stress and direct thermal injury\n       One of the most likely climate change projections is an \n     increase in frequency of hot days, hot nights, and heat \n     waves. The United States is expected to see an increase in \n     the severity, duration, and frequency of extreme heat waves. \n     This, coupled with an aging population, increases the \n     likelihood of higher mortality as the elderly are more \n     vulnerable to dying from exposure to excessive heat. \n     Midwestern and northeastern cities are at greatest risk, as \n     heat-related illness and death appear to be related to \n     exposure to temperatures much hotter than those to which the \n     population is accustomed.\n     Extreme weather events\n       Climate change is anticipated to alter the frequency, \n     timing, intensity, and duration of extreme weather events, \n     such as hurricanes and floods. The health effects of these \n     extreme weather events range from loss of life and acute \n     trauma, to indirect effects such as loss of home, large-scale \n     population displacement, damage to sanitation infrastructure \n     (drinking water and sewage systems), interruption of food \n     production, damage to the health-care infrastructure, and \n     psychological problems such as post traumatic stress \n     disorder. Displacement of individuals often results in \n     disruption of health care, of particular concern for those \n     with underlying chronic diseases. Future climate projections \n     also show likely increases in the frequency of heavy rainfall \n     events, posing an increased risk of flooding events and \n     overwhelming of sanitation infrastructure.\n     Air pollution-related health effects\n       Climate change can affect air quality by modifying local \n     weather patterns and pollutant concentrations, affecting \n     natural sources of air pollution, and promoting the formation \n     of secondary pollutants. Of particular concern is the impact \n     of increased temperature and UV radiation on ozone formation. \n     Some studies have shown that higher surface temperatures, \n     especially in urban areas, encourage the formation of ground-\n     level ozone. As a primary ingredient of smog, ground-level \n     ozone is a public health concern. Ozone can irritate the \n     respiratory system, reduce lung function, aggravate asthma, \n     and inflame and damage cells that line the lungs. In \n     addition, it may cause permanent lung damage and aggravate \n     chronic lung diseases.\n     Allergic diseases\n       Studies have shown that some plants, such as ragweed and \n     poison ivy, grow faster and produce more allergens under \n     conditions of high carbon dioxide and warm weather. As a \n     result, allergic diseases and symptoms could worsen with \n     climate change.\n     Water- and food-borne infectious diseases\n       Altered weather patterns resulting from climate change are \n     likely to affect the distribution and incidence of food- and \n     water-borne diseases. Changes in precipitation, temperature, \n     humidity, and water salinity have been shown to affect the \n     quality of water used for drinking, recreation, and \n     commercial use. For example, outbreaks of Vibrio bacteria \n     infections following the consumption of seafood and \n     shellfish have been associated with increases in \n     temperatures. Heavy rainfall has also been implicated as a \n     contributing factor in the overloading and contamination \n     of drinking water treatment systems, leading to illness \n     from organisms such as Cryptosporidium and Giardia. Storm \n     water runoff from heavy precipitation events can also \n     increase fecal bacterial counts in coastal waters as well \n     as nutrient load, which, coupled with increased sea-\n     surface temperature, can lead to increases in the \n     frequency and range of harmful algal blooms (red tides) \n     and potent marine biotoxins such as ciguatera fish \n     poisoning.\n     Vector-borne and zoonotic diseases\n       Vector-borne and zoonotic diseases, such as plague, Lyme \n     disease, West Nile virus, malaria, hantavirus pulmonary \n     syndrome, and dengue fever have been shown to have a distinct \n     seasonal pattern, suggesting that they are weather sensitive. \n     Climate change-driven ecological changes, such as variations \n     in rainfall and temperature, could significantly alter the \n     range, seasonality, and human incidence of many zoonotic and \n     vector-borne diseases. More study is required to fully \n     understand all the implications of ecological variables \n     necessary to predict climate change effects on vector-borne \n     and zoonotic diseases. Moderating factors such as housing \n     quality, land-use patterns, and vector control programs make \n     it unlikely that these climate changes will have a major \n     impact on tropical diseases such as malaria and dengue fever \n     spreading into the United States. However, climate change \n     could aid in the establishment of exotic vector-borne \n     diseases imported into the United States.\n     Food scarcity\n       Climate change is predicted to alter agricultural \n     production, both directly and indirectly. This may lead to \n     scarcity of some foods, increase food prices, and threaten \n     access to food for Americans who experience food insecurity.\n\n[[Page S13422]]\n\n     Mental health problems\n       Some Americans may suffer anxiety, depression, and similar \n     symptoms in anticipating climate change and/or in coping with \n     its effects. Moreover, the aftermath of severe events may \n     include post-traumatic stress and related problems, as was \n     seen after Hurricane Katrina. These conditions are difficult \n     to quantify but may have significant effects of health and \n     well-being.\n\n\n                      Climate Change Vulnerability\n\n       The effects of climate change will likely vary regionally \n     and by population. The northern latitudes of the United \n     States are expected to experience the largest increases in \n     average temperatures; these areas also will likely bear the \n     brunt of increases in ground-level ozone and associated \n     airborne pollutants. Populations in mid-western and \n     northeastern cities are expected to experience more heat-\n     related illnesses as heat waves increase in frequency, \n     severity, and duration. Coastal regions will likely \n     experience essentially uniform risk of sea level rise, but \n     different rates of coastal erosion, wetlands destruction, and \n     topography are expected to result in dramatically different \n     regional effects of sea level rise. Distribution of animal \n     hosts and vectors may change; in many cases, ranges could \n     extend northward and increase in elevation. For some \n     pathogens associated with wild animals, such as rodents and \n     hantavirus, ranges will change based on precipitation \n     changes. The west coast of the United States is expected to \n     experience significant strains on water supplies as regional \n     precipitation declines and mountain snowpacks are depleted. \n     Forest fires are expected to increase in frequency, severity, \n     distribution, and duration.\n       The health effects of climate change on a given community \n     will depend not only on the particular exposures it faces, \n     but also on the underlying health status, age distribution, \n     health care access, and socioeconomic status of its \n     residents. Local response capacity will also be important. As \n     with other environmental hazards, members of certain ethnic \n     and racial minority groups will likely be disproportionately \n     affected. For example, in low-lying coastal communities \n     facing increasingly frequent and severe extreme precipitation \n     events, there could be increased injuries, outbreaks of \n     diarrheal disease, and harmful algal blooms; saltwater may \n     intrude into freshwater tables and infrastructure is likely \n     to be damaged by severe storms, hampering economic recovery. \n     In certain Southern coastal communities with little economic \n     reserve, declining industry, difficulty accessing health \n     care, and a greater underlying burden of disease, these \n     stressors could be overwhelming. Similarly, in an urban area \n     with increasingly frequent and severe heat waves, certain \n     groups are expected to be more affected: the home-bound, \n     elderly, poor, athletes, and minority and migrant \n     populations, and populations that live in areas with less \n     green space and with fewer centrally air-conditioned \n     buildings are all more vulnerable to heat stress.\n       Some populations of Americans are more vulnerable to the \n     health effects of climate change than others. Children are at \n     greater risk of worsening asthma, allergies, and certain \n     infectious diseases, and the elderly are at higher risk for \n     health effects due to heat waves, extreme weather events, and \n     exacerbations of chronic disease. In addition, people of \n     lower socioeconomic status are particularly vulnerable to \n     extreme weather events. Members of racial and ethnic minority \n     groups suffer particularly from air pollution as well as \n     inadequate health care access, while athletes and those who \n     work outdoors are more at risk from air pollution, heat, and \n     certain infectious diseases.\n       Given the differential burden of climate change's health \n     effects on certain populations, public health preparedness \n     for climate change must include vulnerability assessments \n     that identify the most vulnerable populations with the most \n     significant health disparities and anticipate their risks for \n     particular exposures. At the same time, health communication \n     targeting these vulnerable populations must be devised and \n     tested, and early warning systems focused on vulnerable \n     communities should be developed. With adequate notice and a \n     vigorous response, the ill health effects of many exposures \n     from climate change can be dampened.\n\n\n             Public Health Preparedness for Climate Change\n\n       Climate change is anticipated to have a broad range of \n     impacts on the health of Americans and the nation's public \n     health infrastructure. As the nation's public health agency, \n     CDC is uniquely poised to lead efforts to anticipate and \n     respond to the health effects of climate change. Preparedness \n     for the health consequences of climate change aligns with \n     traditional public health contributions, and--like \n     preparedness for terrorism and pandemic influenza--reinforces \n     the importance of a strong public health infrastructure. \n     CDC's expertise and programs in the following areas provide \n     the strong platform needed:\n       Environmental Public Health Tracking: CDC has a long \n     history of tracking occurrence and trends in diseases and \n     health outcomes. CDC is pioneering new ways to understand the \n     impacts of environmental hazards on people's health. For \n     example, CDC's Environmental Public Health Tracking Program \n     has funded several states to build a health surveillance \n     system that integrates environmental exposures and human \n     health outcomes. This system, the Tracking Network, will go \n     live in 2008, providing information on how health is affected \n     by environmental hazards. The Tracking Network will contain \n     critical data on the incidence, trends, and potential \n     outbreaks of diseases, including those affected by climate \n     change.\n       Surveillance of Water-borne, Food-borne, Vector-borne, and \n     Zoonotic Diseases: CDC also has a long history of \n     surveillance of infectious, zoonotic, and vector-borne \n     diseases. Preparing for climate change will involve working \n     closely with state and local partners to document whether \n     potential changes in climate have an impact on infectious and \n     other diseases and to use this information to help protect \n     Americans from the potential change in of a variety of \n     dangerous water-borne, food-borne, vector-borne, and \n     zoonotic diseases. CDC has developed ArboNet, the national \n     arthropod-borne viral disease tracking system. Currently, \n     this system supports the nationwide West Nile virus \n     surveillance system that links all 50 states and four \n     large metropolitan areas to a central database that \n     records and maps cases in humans and animals and would \n     detect changes in real-time in the distribution and \n     prevalence of cases of arthropod-borne viral diseases. CDC \n     also supports the major foodborne surveillance and \n     investigative networks of FoodNet and PulseNet which \n     rapidly identify and provide detailed data on cases of \n     foodborne illnesses, on the organisms that cause them, and \n     on the foods that are the sources of infection. Altered \n     weather patterns resulting from climate change are likely \n     to affect the distribution and incidence of food- and \n     waterborne diseases, and these changes can be identified \n     and tracked through PulseNet.\n       Geographic Information System (GIS): At the CDC, GIS \n     technology has been applied in unique and powerful ways to a \n     variety of public health issues. It has been used in data \n     collection, mapping, and communication to respond to issues \n     as wide-ranging and varied as the World Trade Center \n     collapse, avian flu, SARS, and Rift Valley fever. In \n     addition, GIS technology was used to map issues of importance \n     during the CDC response to Hurricane Katrina. This technology \n     represents an additional tool for the public health response \n     to climate change.\n       Modeling: Currently sophisticated models to predict climate \n     and heat exist. For example, CDC has conducted heat stroke \n     modeling for the city of Philadelphia to predict the most \n     vulnerable populations at risk for hyperthermia. Modeling and \n     forecasting represent an important preparedness strategy, in \n     that it can help predict and respond to the most pressing \n     health vulnerabilities at the state and local level. Armed \n     with modeling data, we can target response plans for heat and \n     other extreme weather events to the most vulnerable \n     communities and populations.\n       Preparedness Planning: Just as we prepare for terrorism and \n     pandemic influenza, we should use these principles and \n     prepare for health impacts from climate change. For example, \n     to respond to the multiple threats posed by heat waves, the \n     urban environment, and climate change, CDC scientists have \n     focused prevention efforts on developing tools that local \n     emergency planners and decision-makers can use to prepare for \n     and respond to heat waves. In collaboration with other \n     Federal partners, CDC participated in the development of an \n     Excessive Heat Events Guidebook, which provides a \n     comprehensive set of guiding principle and a menu of options \n     for cities and localities to use in the development of Heat \n     Response Plans. These plans clearly define specific roles and \n     responsibilities of government and nongovernmental \n     organizations during heat waves. They identify local \n     populations at increased high risk for heat-related illness \n     and death and determine which strategies will be used to \n     reach them during heat emergencies.\n       Training and Education of Public Health Professionals--\n     Preparing for the health consequences of climate change \n     requires that professionals have the skills required to \n     conceptualize the impending threats, integrate a wide variety \n     of public health and other data in surveillance activities, \n     work closely with other agencies and sectors, and provide \n     effective health communication for vulnerable populations \n     regarding the evolving threat of climate change. CDC is \n     holding a series of five workshops to further explore key \n     dimensions of climate change and public health, including \n     drinking water, heat waves, health communication, vector-\n     borne illness, and vulnerable populations.\n       Health Protection Research: CDC can promote research to \n     further elucidate the specific relationships between climate \n     change and various health outcomes, including predictive \n     models and evaluations of interventions. Research efforts can \n     also identify the magnitude of health effects and populations \n     at greatest risk. For example, CDC has conducted research on \n     the relationship between hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and \n     rainfall, as well as research assessing the impact of climate \n     variability and climate change on temperature-related \n     morbidity and mortality. This information will help enable \n     public health action to be targeted and will help determine \n     the best methods of communicating risk. CDC can serve as a \n     credible source of information on health risks and actions \n     that individuals can take to reduce their risk. In addition, \n     CDC has several state-of-the-art laboratories conducting \n     research on such issues as chemicals and human exposure, \n     radiological testing, and infectious diseases. This research \n     capacity is an asset in working to more fully understand the \n     health consequences of climate change.\n\n[[Page S13423]]\n\n       Communication: CDC has expertise in health and risk \n     communication, and has deployed this expertise in areas as \n     diverse as smoking, HIV infection, and cancer screening. \n     Effective communication can alert the public to health risks \n     associated with climate change, avoid inappropriate \n     responses, and encourage constructive protective behaviors.\n       While CDC can offer technical support and expertise in \n     these and other activities, much of this work needs to be \n     carried out at the state and local level. For example, CDC \n     can support climate change preparedness activities in public \n     health agencies, and climate change and health research in \n     universities, as is currently practiced for a variety of \n     other health challenges.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       An effective public health response to climate change can \n     prevent injuries, illnesses, and death and enhance overall \n     public health preparedness. Protecting Americans from the \n     health effects of climate change directly correlates to CDC's \n     four overarching Health Protection Goals of Healthy People in \n     Every Stage of Life, Healthy People in Healthy Places, People \n     Prepared for Emerging Health Threats, and Healthy People in a \n     Healthy World.\n       While we still need more focus and emphasis on public \n     health preparedness for climate change, many of our existing \n     programs and scientific expertise provide a solid foundation \n     to move forward. Many of the activities needed to protect \n     Americans from the health effects of climate change are \n     mutually beneficial for overall public health. In addition, \n     health and the environment are closely linked, as strongly \n     demonstrated by the issue of climate change. Because of this \n     linkage it is also important that potential health effects of \n     environmental solutions be fully considered.\n       Thank you again for the opportunity to provide this \n     testimony on the potential health effects of global climate \n     change and for your continued support of CDC's essential \n     public health work.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                   Administration Spending Priorities\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, over the past few months we have sent the \nPresident critical legislation that invests in our country's \ntransportation, economy, health and safety needs. Funding these \npriorities will make our country safer, our communities healthier, and \nour economy stronger. Unfortunately, it seems the President doesn't \nshare these priorities. He has proposed to this Congress harmful budget \ncuts, and now he says he is going to veto several of these vital bills \nbecause we are asking for $22 billion more than he requested. He says \nour domestic spending is ``irresponsible and excessive.''\n  I personally find that hard to understand when, at the same time as \nhe is saying that, he wants $196 billion in emergency spending for the \nwars in Iraq and Afghanistan. By the way, that does not include any \nmoney for our veterans. In fact, the $22 billion we want to invest at \nhome represents less than what the President spends in Iraq in 3 \nmonths. That, not these bills, is what I think is irresponsible and \nexcessive. We have to make sure we are not ignoring our needs here at \nhome. The appropriations bills have the support of both parties. They \nensure that our roads and our bridges, our airports, our railways are \nin good condition. They assure that our workers and families are \nhealthy and our children have a chance to succeed. They assure that we \nhave enough law enforcement officers to keep our communities safe. \nThese bills simply restore some of the money the President cut and take \na modest step forward after years of going in the wrong direction.\n  A healthy transportation system is vital to a healthy community. We \nneed to ensure that our families can get to school or get to work and \nthat goods move from place to place. But when he says no to our bill \nthat provides money for transportation and housing and urban \ndevelopment, what the President is saying no to is the investments that \nensure that our communities are strong, that prevent disasters--such as \nthe bridge collapse in Minneapolis--from happening in this country \nagain.\n  I am baffled, frankly, that the President's request for the war \nincludes about $200 million for the construction of secondary roads in \nAfghanistan. He wants to spend $200 million on roads in Afghanistan but \nhe is upset about our amendment to fix bridges in the United States.\n  Clearly, this administration thinks these projects are a priority for \nIraq and a priority for Afghanistan; otherwise, the President would not \nhave included them in his emergency spending bill for the war. So I \nask, why doesn't the President think the roads and bridges are a \npriority in our country, in the United States?\n  At the same time the President is waging war overseas, we are here \ntrying to make sure our employers have workers, that our families have \naccess to health care, that our children get a good education. Tuesday \nnight an overwhelming majority of this Senate voted to spend $11 \nbillion over the President's request on Labor, Health and Human \nServices and Education programs so we could do that. That bill we \npassed would invest in cutting-edge medical research for diseases such \nas Alzheimer's and diabetes and cancer, research that brings hope to \nmillions of Americans. In taking that vote the other evening, a \nbipartisan group of Senators agreed to restore funds for education, for \njobs training, for health systems, when President Bush would have left \nthem to cope with yet another year of unfunded mandates and empty \npromises.\n  The children's health insurance bill that we approved earlier this \nyear also is intended to help millions of our children. That bill, too, \nachieved a majority of support in the House and in the Senate but not \nfrom the President. Those bills would make Americans healthier and the \neconomy more competitive. But the President disagrees. He says these \nprograms are ``irresponsible and excessive.''\n  But guess what he proposes in his $196 billion request for Iraq and \nAfghanistan. He asks for $25 million for economic development projects \nto foster job creation--in Iraq. And $60 million to fund economic \nprojects to sustain development in the tribal areas of Pakistan.\n  Let me say it another way. He plans to veto job creation and economic \ndevelopment right here at home, but he is asking us to spend millions \nof dollars in emergency funding on similar programs in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  The President says $196 billion that he is requesting for the war is \nnecessary to make our world safer. We believe we also need to invest \nmore in safety here at home. Our bill funding Commerce, Justice and \nScience programs works hard to ensure that our communities have enough \nFBI agents and police on our streets here at home. Like the other \nprograms we want to fund, that bill restores the cuts that the \nPresident had proposed. Few bills are as important to the safety of our \ncommunities as that one.\n  I am especially concerned that the President is threatening to veto \nthat bill because of how it affects my home State and the Nation. Six \nyears after 9/11, the administration still has not replaced 2,400 law \nenforcement agents across the country that it reassigned to \ncounterterrorism after 9/11.\n  In my home State of Washington, we were hit very hard by that. \nAccording to an investigation by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, our \nSeattle newspaper, we have a critical shortage of FBI agents: 2.1 \nagents for every 100,000 residents or about half the national average.\n  The shift to counterterrorism has left our law enforcement \nshorthanded. Local police and sheriffs told me that the FBI has \n``virtually disappeared'' from white-collar crime investigations. They \ntold me the FBI does not have the resources today to adequately staff \nantigang task forces.\n  Criminals have not stopped robbing our banks or dealing drugs or \nstealing identities. An amendment I included in that bill would take \nsteps to get more FBI agents into my community and wherever they are \nneeded.\n  But the President said he is going to veto that bill. In so doing, he \nis going to veto our amendment. If we can spend $10 billion a month for \nthe war in Iraq, we should be willing to spend a fraction of that to \nensure the security of our citizens at home.\n  Clearly, the President is the one who is being ``excessive'' and \n``irresponsible.'' This might be an abstract debate about Federal \nfunding for the President, but I think all of us know here it is about \nreal people; it is about hard-working parents who are searching for a \nway to get health care for\n\n[[Page S13424]]\n\ntheir own families when it has not been provided by their employers. It \nis about citizens out of traffic jams, and ensuring that our roads and \nbridges are safe to drive on. It is about making sure the people we \nrepresent can trust that enough law enforcement officers will be there \nto fight crime in their neighborhoods.\n  When I travel around Washington State, people tell me they want hope \nand they want change. Whether it is the war in Iraq or gas prices or \naccess to health insurance, people today feel a real weight on their \nshoulders. They are looking for a light at the end of the tunnel. By \nvetoing those important bills, and failing to invest in the safety, \nhealth, and economic future of all Americans, the President keeps \nputting out that light. We are investing $22 billion over last year in \nthe future of our country.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support these bills as we move forward \non behalf of the millions of American children and families who would \nbenefit. I hope the President is listening.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant majority leader.\n\n\n                                  Iran\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the bill before us is a very important \nbill for our country. It is the reauthorization of the Amtrak operation \nwhich serves Illinois and most of our Nation very well. It is one of \nthe most successful modes of transportation in terms of growth in our \ncountry.\n  In the last year the ridership on Amtrak in Illinois has doubled. \nDoubled. That is an indication of a commitment, not only from the State \nof Illinois to make that happen, but also with the price of gasoline a \nlot of people are discovering the train again. They are back on those \ntrains traveling between St. Louis and Chicago, Quincy and Chicago, \nCarbondale and Chicago, students, families, business people. That is a \ngood thing.\n  I salute Senators Lautenberg and Lott for bringing this authorization \nbill to the floor. I definitely want it to pass as quickly as possible. \nI hope we will show the support for Amtrak which has been lacking for \nsome time in the past but in the future needs to be there.\n  I want to discuss an amendment which I am going to offer which has \nnothing to do with Amtrak, and perhaps it will not be allowed at this \nmoment in time in the debate. But I will offer it because I think it is \ntimely, and I offer it because if it is not allowed on this bill at \nthis time, I hope we will have a chance to bring it up in the very near \nfuture.\n  I can recall a little over 5 years ago, on the floor of the Senate, \nwhen we debated the invasion of Iraq. Those votes are historic and very \npersonal. Members who were called on to make those decisions will never \nforget the anguish they face when they have to decide whether to send \nour Nation to war. We know it is the most important vote that can be \ncast. We know even under the best of circumstances Americans will die \nif we go to war. We hope our enemy will be vanquished, but we know that \ninnocent people will also die.\n  A little over 5 years ago, that decision was made on the floor of the \nSenate to go forward with the invasion of Iraq. There were many of us \nwho had serious misgivings about that decision. I was one of 23 \nSenators, 22 on the Democratic side, 1 on the Republican side, who \nvoted against the authorization of military force.\n  I felt the President had not made a strong case for that invasion. I \nfelt he did not have a sound plan for an invasion and a victory. I felt \nthe American people had been misled; misled about Saddam Hussein, \nmisled about weapons of mass destruction, misled about the impact of \nthis almost unilateral invasion by the United States into Iraq.\n  Well, here we are in the fifth year of the war, over 3,800 Americans \nhave been killed, 30,000 injured, more than 10,000 seriously injured, \nwith amputations and serious burns, traumatic brain injury. With the \nPresident's latest request, the spending on the war in Iraq will reach \nthree-quarters of a trillion dollars. In 5 years, three-quarters of a \ntrillion dollars, $750 billion; money, which if spent in the United \nStates on Amtrak, on medical research, on health care, on education, \nwould have had a dramatic, historic impact, a positive impact on \nAmerica.\n  But, no, it was spent in the course of a war that has no end in \nsight. Our men and women in uniform have shown extraordinary bravery \nand courage under amazing, trying circumstances in the civil war we \nnever bargained for.\n  When we went to war in Iraq, the President said the reasons were \nclear: first, depose Saddam Hussein; second, to rid our world of his \nweapons of mass destruction; and, third, to protect threats against \nAmerica's security.\n  Here we are almost 5 years later with Saddam Hussein gone, no weapons \nof mass destruction, and the only threat to America's security being \nthe threat to our own soldiers and occupational forces in Iraq.\n  The debate seems to have moved from Iraq to another neighboring \ncountry, at least in the eyes of the White House, that is, the country \nof Iran. We continue to hear the most bellicose, warlike statements \ncoming from the President and Vice President about the potential for \nthe invasion of Iran.\n  Make no mistake, Iran cannot be ignored. It has fostered a foreign \npolicy that supports some of the worst actors in the Middle East, from \nHezbollah to Hamas. It is pursuing a nuclear program despite \ninternational condemnation. It has threatened to wipe our strong ally \nIsrael off the map. There is plenty of evidence to suggest Iran is \ncomplicit in supplying training and materials for attacks against our \nsoldiers in Iraq.\n  Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon and I have introduced bipartisan \nlegislation, the Iran Counterproliferation Act of 2007. It would \ntighten sanctions against Iran if it does not halt its nuclear \nprograms. It stops short, clearly stops short, of calling for military \naction. That is the reason I come today.\n  I continue to be concerned that this administration is going to move \ntoo far, too fast, toward military action against Iran. The positioning \nof some of our battle forces, the statements from Vice President Cheney \nand President Bush trouble me. They trouble me because in August the \nMcClatchy Newspapers reported that the Vice President proposed U.S. air \nstrikes inside Iran. Earlier this month, President Bush said if we were \ninterested in avoiding World War III--these are his words, World War \nIII--we ought to be concerned about preventing Iran from gaining the \nknowledge needed to produce nuclear weapons.\n  This week, Vice President Cheney said, during an event in Lynchburg, \nVirginia, that the United States and others are ``prepared to impose \nserious consequences'' on Iran. This troubles me. If this \nadministration believes it has some authority from Congress for the \ninvasion of Iran, I challenge them to show me what that authority is. \nThey certainly did not receive that authority with their authorization \nto use military force in Iraq. That was never even considered. There \nhas been no action I am aware of since which would given them that \nauthority.\n  If they think they have some inherent power to launch an invasion of \nanother country such as Iran, they are clearly wrong, wrong because of \nthis document, our Constitution. The Constitution makes clear in \narticle I, section 8, that the power to declare war is vested in the \nAmerican people through their elected representatives in Congress, in \nthe House and in the Senate.\n  I come to the floor today to remind not only my colleagues but the \nadministration that they have solemn constitutional responsibilities. \nBefore they initiate any offensive action in Iran, they have to come to \nthe Congress for the authority to do so. To do otherwise is, in my \nmind, not only reckless but clearly unconstitutional.\n  I want to take a moment to read this resolution I have proposed \nbecause it is very short. It is two sentences:\n\n       The Senate hereby affirms that Article I, Section 8 of the \n     Constitution of the United States vests in Congress all power \n     to declare war.\n\n  And, paragraph 2:\n\n       Any offensive military action taken by the United States \n     against Iran must be explicitly approved by Congress before \n     such action may be initiated.\n\n  The wording is concise and limited, and I hope makes a clear point. \nThat point is, the Constitution counts. This President, no President, \nhas the authority for unilateral invasion of a country. Every President \nhas the power to defend America and Americans. But to initiate an \ninvasion of Iran at this point in our history would\n\n[[Page S13425]]\n\nbe not only a terrible foreign policy mistake, but violate the \nconstitutional processes we have set in place, a Constitution we have \nall sworn to uphold.\n  I understand that this bill, this Amtrak authorization bill, is \nhardly a bill to debate the constitutional authority to go to war or \nforeign policy on Iran, but I continue to be troubled day in and day \nout with statements by the President and Vice President to suggest that \nwe are somehow preparing in any way, shape, or form for offensive \nmilitary action in Iran.\n  I know my time is limited. I thank the sponsor of the legislation \nthat is now pending, and the Republican minority leader on this \ncommittee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendments be set aside so \nthis amendment be might be called up, with the understanding that it is \nnot likely to be allowed, but to let my colleagues know I am going to \nintroduce this as separate legislation. I hope they will join me in \ncosponsoring it and join me as well in finding the first available \nvenue and forum to raise this important constitutional issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, first, I \nthank the Senator for his comments about our efforts on the Amtrak \nlegislation. This is the Amtrak legislation, and I do not think it is \nthe place to have this debate he is proposing. He acknowledges such. In \nview of that, I would object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 3:15 \ntoday, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Sununu amendment \nNo. 3446, with no amendment in order to the amendment prior to the \nvote; and that the 4 minutes immediately prior to the vote be divided \nas follows: 1 minute each for Senator Lautenberg, myself, and Senator \nLott, or our designees, and 2 minutes for Senator Sununu.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, first, if I could clarify the agreement \nthat was just enumerated here, at 3:15 then we will move to a vote on \nthe pending Sununu amendment, and prior to that, it will give us a \nchance on both sides of the issue to make some brief remarks, and \nSenator Sununu will be back momentarily to make some comments and an \nexplanation of his amendment.\n  The amendment would modify the bill's competition pilot program to \nallow an unlimited number of existing Amtrak routes to be open to \ncompetition from freight rails that seek to operate passenger trains in \nexchange for Amtrak's current subsidy.\n  We have worked on this issue before. Senator Sununu had this \namendment the last time this bill came up. We worked out a compromise \nthat is in the bill which is to have a pilot program. Philosophically, \nI am attracted to this amendment. I do think we ought to have \ncompetition. I think it makes sense maybe for the freight lines to \nprovide this passenger service. But this is a major change in what is \ncurrently done. So rather than just leaping into this in an uncertain \nand an unknown way in terms of its impact, results, what would happen \nto Amtrak, how it would impact the service, the alternative is to go \nwith what we worked out a couple years ago, and that is a competitive \npilot program that would allow two routes a year--not two total; it is \ntwo a year--to get into this competitive pilot program area, see how it \nworks, find out the details, assess the good and the bad and the costly \nwhich could come out of it. That is the preferred way to go. We do say \nwe will have this for the life of the bill, which is a number of years, \nso it could be up to 10 or 12 routes that may be involved eventually.\n  This is a new concept, and we believe what we have outlined in the \nprovisions of S. 294 will prescribe it in such a way that it won't \ncause problems and we can see if it works. It may work. I emphasize, \nthis is something I may want to move toward in the future. But I want \nus to have a national rail passenger system, No. 1. I want us to quit \nstarving Amtrak and then blasting them because they don't do better \neven though we know they don't have the money to do the job. I want us \nto give them clear instructions for reform and to evaluate routes and \nhave better governance. We have put this in the bill. This will be a \nmajor plus for Amtrak, to give them more authority.\n  Some of these routes could be shut down. We had the earlier Sununu \namendment that we think could have led to a pretty precipitous shutting \ndown of six or eight of these long-distance routes in other parts of \nthe country. That would have been a mistake. But I do think that, more \nthan likely, over a period of 2 or 3 years, you can't defend an \nindividual subsidy per passenger of $500 or $600.\n  More and more, as we make this a more attractive entity, deal with \nthe capital needs, improve the trackage that is available for them to \nuse, get better governance, then it will be more attractive for \ncompetition to come into play. Maybe States will have more operations, \nas well as the freight lines.\n  I understand the goal of Senator Sununu. I appreciate the fact that \nhe is not one who has just been critical. He is engaged. He is thinking \nabout it. He has some ideas. But I urge defeat of this amendment. Let's \nsee how the pilot program works and then, in 4 or 5 years, evaluate \nwhat we have seen and perhaps do something more.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, we are examining an amendment \noffered by Senator Sununu. As we have just heard, we have been through \nthis somewhat before. The amendment would open to privatization all of \nAmtrak's long-distance and corridor train routes and give Federal \nfunding to private companies to do what Amtrak does with no additional \ncontract oversight. We saw something with the British experience--that \nthere is potential for disaster when you fully privatize a national \nrailroad. In the UK, wholesale privatization of their rail line did not \nwork. In the end, safety was compromised for profits, and several died \nin horrific train derailments.\n  Our bill does not allow a complete selloff of our entire national \nrailroad. It does, however, provide a controlled procedure for \ncompetitive bidding on a limited number of routes. This competition \nwill be allowed only under strong supervision by Federal regulators. \nThe Federal Railroad Administration, which also overseas rail safety, \nwill start by accepting bids from other railroads interested in running \npassenger trains for one to two train routes. This is an experiment to \nsee if the Government can save any money by letting someone other than \nAmtrak try to run passenger train service.\n  Railroading in America is a complex operation. Most railroads \ncurrently in service can trace their roots back 150 years. There are \ncomprehensive safety standards that must be met. There are laws that \napply only to the railroad industry. You have to share limited \ninfrastructure with other railroads. Wholesale privatization of Amtrak \nis not in our country's best interest. The traveling public relies on \nthe expertise of American railroads for safe and efficient service.\n  Under our bill, a limited experiment can be attempted for competitive \nbidding with proper oversight. Expanding it by including the Sununu \namendment, frankly, could be disastrous. It is hard to imagine that we \nwould permit residents in a hospital or medical learning experience to \ngo ahead and start doing surgery. Say take a couple of cases, we will \nexamine them, and then we will go on to full-time operation with your \nskills. Meanwhile, you don't just throw the whole thing together and \ntake a chance that you are right. We have included an opportunity for \ntwo of these competitive bids to take place in a year and see what the \nresults are and then decide whether we go further, instead of throwing \nthe whole works in there at one time.\n  For obvious reasons, I oppose this amendment. I urge my colleagues to \nvote against it. We are just now doing a whole reform of Amtrak. We are \nreducing operating costs as a requisite and doing much more to improve \nrail service. It is obvious that rail service is and has to be an \nessential part of our transportation infrastructure.\n  I oppose this amendment. I hope my colleagues will stand up and say: \nNo, we are going to give Amtrak a chance to operate because we \ndesperately need it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S13426]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Madam President, we will have a vote shortly on the \nsecond amendment I have offered. Senator Lautenberg just spoke a little \nbit about the amendment. I certainly want to clarify for the record \nwhat the intention of the amendment is and what its practical impact \nwould be.\n  This is not a wholesale privatization of Amtrak--far from it. The \nprovision in the legislation allows two routes under supervision, \noversight as described by Senator Lautenberg, to be put out for \ncompetitive bid to see if there is another service provider that can \nrun the trains on those routes, delivering better service at a better \ncost. That makes good sense--good sense for riders and taxpayers. It is \nnot a wholesale privatization by any stretch, especially considering \nthe supervision and oversight that would have to be in place for this \ncompetitive bidding process.\n  Senator Lautenberg used the phrase or description about this being a \nlearning experience and you don't want to have people in a medical \nenvironment in a learning experience then suddenly asked to do major \nsurgery. I think I understand what he was trying to suggest, but I \nlistened to that phrase and it implies to a certain degree that the \nmanagement team at Amtrak is a bunch of amateurs that can't be trusted. \nThat is not the case at all. They understand these routes, the \noperation, the nature of the service they are providing. They are in \nthe best position to help determine how routes should be put out for \ncompetitive bid. My amendment simply says there is no reason to limit \nthe number to two. Why would we do that? Because we don't trust them? \nWe don't think they will do a good job? We don't think they want to \ndeliver good service at a competitive cost? Why would we limit them to \ntwo? My amendment would allow competition in more than two routes. It \nwould not mandate it or require it. It wouldn't force anyone's hand. It \nsimply would remove a very arbitrary limit on the number of routes that \ncan be put out in a competitive bid to companies run more effectively \nand efficiently for riders and taxpayers. That is about as simple as \nyou can get. It does make good sense. It doesn't destroy the system. It \ndoesn't throw anyone out of work. It doesn't undermine the integrity of \nthe reforms that are already in the bill by any stretch. I think it \nsimply allows us to get an even better idea of whether those reforms \nhave an impact.\n  Senator Lautenberg described a process where up to two routes, as \nallowed for in the bill, would be competitively bid. Then the managers \nat Amtrak would look to see how successful it was and be able to go \nfrom there. That isn't true. In fact, that is just what I am trying to \ndeal with. They wouldn't be able to go from there because there is a \nlimitation that they could only do two. So if they decided that this \nwas very effective, they wouldn't be empowered to use this tool to even \ngreater advantage without Congress coming back and changing the law and \nchanging the statute. That is not going to happen anytime soon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. We have already seen how difficult it is to pass this \nbill as written. I encourage support for my amendment.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, we ought to crawl before we walk, to \nuse the old adage. We have to learn it firsthand without putting the \nwhole thing at risk.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, they have not.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment, as modified.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), \nthe Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), the Senator from Connecticut \n(Mr. Dodd), the Senator from California (Mrs. Feinstein), the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. \nLieberman), the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) would vote ``nay.''\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, Senator Lautenberg is here, chairman of the \nsubcommittee. He is working with Senator Murray on a couple amendments. \nWe have a couple amendments by Senator DeMint that we have cleared. We \nare hoping we will have a chance to visit with Senator DeMint or some \nof his representatives momentarily and maybe clear some other \namendments. I thank Senator DeMint for coming over. He actually came \nover with a block of nine amendments, and we are working through those. \nSome of them we can certainly accept. We will work through the rest.\n  Senator Reid was very generous yesterday in agreeing that we wouldn't \ncomplete this bill until Senators had a chance to review it and come up \nwith amendments, even as late as Tuesday morning, provided they were \ngermane; otherwise, we could finish this bill this evening.\n  We have another issue that has been interjected; that is, the \nInternet tax issue. I know Members on both sides and the leadership are \nworking out when and how we would get to vote on that important issue \nbecause next Thursday, if we don't come up with something, the Internet \nmoratorium on taxes will expire November 1. We have to deal with the \nissue.\n  I call on my colleagues, if you have amendments of any kind on the \nAmtrak legislation, come over and offer\n\n[[Page S13427]]\n\nthem. We will work through them this afternoon. I don't know what the \nleadership is going to decide with regard to votes later on this \nevening or tomorrow, but there will not be any votes on Monday, as \npreviously announced by the leadership. So we will have to either deal \nwith these amendments that might come up this afternoon or tomorrow or \nTuesday.\n  After we dispose of the Internet tax, everybody needs to know that \nthis bill can and should and will be finished before sundown Tuesday. \nThat is what the leader, Senator Reid, wants. That is what Senator \nMcConnell wishes to accommodate. It is my intent to work with Senator \nLautenberg to drive this bill to conclusion. It is not controversial. \nWhat is in here is broadly supported. We had 93 votes last time. We may \nget more this time. Of the amendments that have been offered, the most \nan amendment has received was 27 votes. We are going to continue to \nlook for ways to do even more that is positive for Amtrak. But we need \nto go ahead and be done with this next Tuesday.\n  I yield the floor to hear any remarks the chairman has.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Very briefly, I join Senator Lott in telling our \ncolleagues to come on down if they have something they want to put into \nthis bill. We are on the edge of progress, and we ought to move ahead.\n\n\n        Amendments Nos. 3457, as Modified, and 3459, as Modified\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside, and I call up en bloc the Murray amendments Nos. 3457 and \n3459 and ask unanimous consent that the amendments be modified with the \nchanges at the desk; that the amendments, as modified, be considered \nand agreed to and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table en \nbloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3457 and 3459), as modified, were agreed to, as \nfollows:\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3457, as Modified\n\n       On page 189, after line 25, add the following:\n\n                         TITLE V--MISCELLANEOUS\n\n     SEC. 501.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Subprime Foreclosures\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, today the Joint Economic Committee released \na report highlighting the impact of subprime foreclosures on local \neconomies. It confirmed what many of us know: When homes go into \nforeclosure, it is not just the homeowner and the tragedy to that \nfamily; whole communities suffer. When entire neighborhoods fall victim \nto foreclosures, communities are often devastated.\n  Today's report shows that in Ohio, there are more than 293,000 \noutstanding sub-prime loans--293,000 in a State of 11 million people, \nperhaps 3 million-plus households; 293,000 outstanding subprime loans. \nEvery outstanding loan represents a family, an Ohio family, that is so \nclose to losing their home.\n  The estimated loss of property value this year in Ohio is more than \n$3.7 billion. The estimated local tax loss, that is local government \nrevenue all over the State, this year is more than $31 million. That is \nlost revenue needed to pay for firefighters, for schoolteachers, for \npolice officers, and for rescue squad vehicles and their workers. That \nlost revenue means poorer service and less service for those \ncommunities already suffering from poverty and suffering from the \nforeclosures themselves.\n\n  Two years ago, when Hurricane Katrina's storm surge left thousands \nhomeless, Congress and the American people leapt to respond. We were \nmoved and ashamed by the images we saw in our newspapers and on \ntelevision. We were moved by the images, and ashamed, frankly, by our \nGovernment's lack of response. Most of us could not believe this could \nhappen in our country. Today, we are witnessing the economic equivalent \nof Katrina in the housing market--a slow moving storm surge that is \nleaving hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of people in this \ncountry without a home. They have lost their homes, they have lost \ntheir American dream. It started on Lake Erie rather than on Lake \nPontchartrain, but it has spread to all corners of our country--from \nNew York to the Presiding Officer's Florida, from California to \nMinnesota. As today's report shows, subprime lending doesn't just hurt \nfamilies, it hurts entire communities.\n  Unfortunately, the response to date in some ways has been worse than \nKatrina. Regulators have been slow to use their authority to act, \nCongress has done next to nothing, and the President, as before with \nKatrina, made a speech and then moved on. The Treasury Department \nsprang into action when Wall Street was looking at losses, but it has \nnot applied the same energy or commitment to the thousands upon \nthousands of families in Slavic Village, near Cleveland, in Columbus \nand Lima, in Mansfield and Marion, or Zanesville. Thousands and \nthousands of families in those communities are losing their homes.\n  Whole neighborhoods in Cleveland and Dayton and cities throughout the \nState are drowning in foreclosures. Things are going to get worse \nbefore they get better. We know that, because the adjustable rate \nmortgages are about to reset day after day, week after week, month \nafter month in our communities. Almost every day the news brings more \nevidence of how widespread this problem has become for banks--losses in \nMerrill Lynch, layoffs at Bank of America, and huge layoffs at National \nCity Bank in my State.\n  Even as National City announces the layoff of 1,000 people in Ohio, \nin the first 9 months of this year, since January, 100,000 foreclosure \nfilings have already stacked up, with every county in our State \ncontributing to that stack.\n  Home sales are down, prices are down, and problems are showing up in \nprime markets. But we have yet to see the worst of it. Resets of \nsubprime adjustable rate mortgages will peak this fall, ease up a bit, \nand then skyrocket next fall. Throughout the time these mortgages were \nbeing made, underwriting standards fell further and further. So on top \nof the enormous volume of loans resetting over the next 12 to 15 \nmonths, the likelihood of all those 2-28 loans made in 2006 defaulting \nin 2008 is likely to get worse.\n  We are already in record territory when it comes to this year's \nloans, but we have made a start in addressing this crisis. The $200 \nmillion contained in the housing appropriations bill passed by the \nSenate must be maintained or increased in the bill sent to the \nPresident. And he must sign it. He must do something about this. That \nwould be a major first step to helping those neighborhood \norganizations, those not-for-profits. There is a terrific one in \nToledo, and several in my State and in the State of Florida too. It \nwill matter to those people who are about to lose their homes. They are \ndelinquent in their payments, perhaps because of the reset and a higher \nmortgage, or because their taxes and insurance were added when they \ndidn't know they weren't included, or when they were simply deceived or \nbetrayed by fraudulent mortgage brokers.\n  This $200 million is not a bailout. It is only to help them \nrenegotiate their loans so their delinquencies won't turn into \nforeclosures. And the President, as I said, must sign this bill.\n  The regulators need to act and act quickly with strong protections \nfor consumers, and Congress must act to codify and build on those \nprotections. Mortgage bankers must be held accountable for their \nactions. They can no longer sell loans without regard to whether a \nborrower can afford to pay them back. And banks have to be responsible \nas well. Underwriting standards have to ensure that borrowers qualify \nat the real rate rather than the teaser rate. No more of that. Escrows \nhave to be set up for subprime loans, as they are for prime loans, and \nput money aside for insurance and for taxes. No-document loans need to \nbecome a thing of the past.\n  Just because the subprime crisis is less visible than the destruction \nof a hurricane, it is no less damaging. All of us need to respond. Our \nresponse must be comprehensive and our response needs to happen now.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida.) Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Maytag Plant Closing\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, tomorrow with the closing of the Maytag \nmanufacturing plant in Newton, IA, a beloved Iowa institution and an \nicon in the history of industrial America will be gone forever.\n  The Maytag brand, synonymous with product quality and reliability, \nwill still be attached to rebranded Whirlpool Corporation appliances, \nbut do not be fooled, those products will no longer be made by loyal, \nskilled, experienced, Iowa workers. They will be made elsewhere.\n  This is a heartbreaking loss to the Newton community, Newton, IA, and \na loss felt by people across my State of Iowa. Maytag was founded in \nNewton by Fredrick Louis Maytag, in 1893, as a manufacturer of farm \nequipment. Fourteen years later, the company introduced its first \nwashing machine, which it produced during seasonal downturns in the \nfarm implement business.\n  Newton soon became known as the washing machine capital of the world. \nBy the time it was acquired by Whirlpool in 2006, Maytag Corporation \nwas a $4.7 billion company with 18,000 employees worldwide.\n  But the center of its operations, the heart of its operations, was \nNewton, IA, with 2,800 employees. Now, it is all gone. Thousands of \ngood-paying jobs and the economic foundation of an entire community.\n  For generations, Iowans eagerly went to work at Maytag, and Maytag \nwas an integral part of the Newton community. Maytag workers helped to \nbuild a thriving local economy. The children of Maytag assembly line \nworkers and the children of the Maytag executives all went to the same \nhigh-quality schools.\n  When children graduated from high school or from college, many came \nhome to Newton to work at Maytag, either on the line or as executives. \nTogether, workers and management at\n\n[[Page S13429]]\n\nMaytag built a wonderful community and a wonderful business. Now, in \nwhat seems like the blinking of an eye, Maytag is gone.\n  Why? Well, because it is cheaper to make appliances in foreign \ncountries that pay their workers a pittance; that lack labor standards \nand environmental protections. Maytag management was seduced by the \nlure of lower wages; sent jobs from some of their plants to Mexico.\n  This, combined with unwise decisions by management to buy a variety \nof companies, significantly weakened Maytag's finances and their \nability to invest in improvements to their own product lines. That made \nthe company a takeover target.\n  It is a personal tragedy for the workers of Maytag and elsewhere who \nhave lost good-paying jobs, but it is something else; it is a threat to \nthe middle-class standard of living in this country, as displaced \nworkers are obligated to accept lower paying jobs, often without health \ninsurance or pension benefits.\n  According to a study by economists at Iowa State University, the \naverage income in Jasper County, that is the home of Newton, the \naverage income in Jasper County in 2005 was $34,400 a year, again, \nbecause of Maytag.\n  Without the Maytag jobs, the average income will drop by nearly \n$5,000. Let's be clear. As I said, washing machines made elsewhere will \nprobably still carry the Maytag brand, but I will always say that the \nheart and soul of Maytag was the Newton community.\n  Richard Doak, a Des Moines Register columnist, was intervening a \nMaytag worker years ago when the company was hinting it might close the \nNewton plant. The worker stated:\n\n       If that ever happens, it will be the end of Maytag, because \n     the people of Newton are the essence of the company. We pump \n     blue blood [said the worker, referring to the color of the \n     Maytag logo.]\n\n  Daniel Krumm, the chief executive officer who transformed Maytag into \na global company said that what he called the Newton ethic, was the key \nto the company's success. By the Newton ethic, he meant an entire \ncommunity that was loyal to the company and took great pride in making \nproducts of the highest quality.\n  Unfortunately, some of Daniel Krumm's successors chose to betray the \nNewton ethic. Some of them chose to cash it in for cheaper products, \nand higher profits made outside the United States.\n  This story is all too familiar to skilled workers in the \nmanufacturing sector in this country. You might wonder why I am on the \nfloor talking about this on this Thursday, October 25. Because \ntomorrow, on Friday, Maytag will shutter its last plant and cease \noperations in Newton, IA. I worked as hard as I could to prevent the \nWhirlpool takeover of Maytag. I worked with State and local officials \nto prevent the closing of the plant in Newton. But in the end, \nregrettably, our efforts were unsuccessful.\n  Particularly, I wish to salute the tremendous effort of the officers, \nthe plant committee, the department of stewards of United Auto Workers \nLocal 997. Under the outstanding leadership of Ted Johnson, the local \npresident, they have been on the frontlines throughout the crisis of \nMaytag, fighting to prevent the plant closure; when that failed, doing \neverything possible to help the displaced workers.\n  Tomorrow, Friday, will be a sad day in Newton, IA. But there is \nrebirth. Not all of the news from Newton is bad. The Newton ethic \nsurvives, and the Newton community is resilient. Two companies, Iowa \nTelecom and Caleris, plan to add more than 200 jobs in Newton by the \nend of the year.\n  Other businesses are expanding. Community leaders are coming together \nto develop a strategy to rebound from the loss of Maytag. I wish them \nevery success, and I will stand ready to continue to assist in any way \nI can.\n  Another sad chapter in the continuing decline of our manufacturing \nbase in America. Maytag. Who has not seen the ad about the Maytag \nrepairman who has nothing to do because Maytag was such a good product?\n  Whether it is refrigerators or washing machines, home appliances, \nMaytag always stood for the best in quality. It was the best in quality \nbecause it was made by dedicated workers, skilled workers who took \npride in their work. They made good livings. They were middle-class \nfamilies. I said it was always a joy to go to Newton. It was wonderful \nto see the sons and daughters of assembly line workers going to the \nsame school as the executives' kids, all working together, going to the \nsame churches, belonging to the same clubs, going to the same bowling \nalleys, having this wonderful picnic every year, where the executives \nand their families and the workers and their families all were enjoying \ntheir annual picnic with their kids.\n  They took pride in the products they built. I do not think the people \nin some of these other countries will have that same kind of \ncommitment. They are lower paid, they did not have the benefits. At \nsome point, we have to take stock of what is happening to our \nmanufacturing base in this country and what is happening to us in terms \nof a community and a business that can grow and evolve.\n  I know things change, and they have to change, but still, there is no \nreason, there is no reason why Maytag had to leave Newton. There were \nsome bad business decisions made. But, again, it is chasing higher \nprofits in the short term by shipping our jobs out overseas or to \nMexico or to other countries.\n  And those short-term profits lead to long-term losses for the workers \nand their families and everyone else. So it is a sad day tomorrow in \nNewton and a sad day for all of us trying to work so hard to keep \nMaytag alive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We have a lot \nwe are going to do Tuesday, the first of which is to complete the work \non the important Amtrak legislation. There has been great progress made \non that today.\n  I think we have had an interesting week. We may not be happy with the \nresults--I say that because some are happy, some are not--but it has \nbeen a productive week. It has been a week in which, in spite of the \ndivisiveness of the issues before us, they have been handled in a very \ncollegial way. There have been strong feelings expressed on both sides, \nbut it has been done, I think, in a way that brings credit to the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, just briefly, a couple of other \nobservations, I would say that I know it is the position of the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire--of course, he can speak for himself, but it is the \nposition of the Senator from New Hampshire, myself, and many others \nthat we make this moratorium permanent. I think that still ought to be \nour goal in the future.\n  With regard to the week that is now coming to a conclusion, I would \nhave to state it has been quite a good week, with a number of \nachievements that\n\n[[Page S13431]]\n\nare important for the Senate and, in particular, the confirmation of \nJudge Southwick, which was not only important to the State of \nMississippi but important to this institution, the Senate, in terms of \nhow we are going to treat nominees in the future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, let me add a couple comments with respect \nto the legislation we just passed by unanimous consent.\n  The adoption of this legislation comes after a very tough negotiation \nthat goes back not just a couple days or a couple weeks or a couple \nmonths but literally years, almost a decade. In tough negotiations, not \neveryone is happy. But I think the American people basically want us to \nfigure out how to get work done. The American people look for us to set \naside partisan differences, and they want to see some results.\n  My hope is, for the most part, they come to understand what we have \ndone here tonight and realize the House still has to speak on this \nmatter. The American people will, if not applaud the actual results, \nsome of which are not easily understood, at least say: Well, on this \nmatter, at least, the U.S. Senate figured out how to work together. A \ncouple guys from small States got together, along with the help of a \nbunch of others, including Senators Alexander and Enzi and Voinovich. I \nam grateful to them for all their good work on this too.\n  I think among the most important results that flow from the adoption \nof this legislation are, No. 1, we preserve the intent in the 1998 \ninitial Internet moratorium legislation. What we wanted to do in 1998 \nwas not to allow additional States and additional local governments to \nplace a tax on access to the Internet, if you will, a tax on our AOL \nbills. That was part of the 1998 legislation that said for a handful of \nStates--nine or so--that were already doing that, they were allowed to \ncontinue to do so but nobody else could pile on.\n  This legislation today makes sure we are not going to be allowing \nadditional access taxes or additional taxes by State and local \ngovernments for access to the Internet. That protects the consumers, \nbut it also does it in a way that I think is fair to the States. \nBecause 3 years before the 1998 legislation was passed--3 years prior--\nin 1995, this same Congress passed legislation saying that the unfunded \nmandates were a bad idea, and that the Federal Government was not going \nto tell State and local governments how to spend their money without \nproviding that money, the Federal Government was not going to take away \nthe ability of State and local governments to raise money without \nproviding for funds to make up for the shortfall.\n  What we have done is we have protected the States that are already \nderiving revenues from access taxes on the Internet. We said we are not \ngoing to allow, as we go forward with new innovations--for, if you \nwill, telecom companies, telephone companies--we are not going to allow \nthem to bundle services and begin to offer those bundled services--\ntraditionally taxed by State and local governments, in some cases--and \nship them over on the Internet to avoid all State and local taxes. So \nthe States have spoken loudly: Do not take away our revenue base. We \nhave been responsive to that.\n  As a Governor for 8 years in my State, and as, at one time, the \nchairman of the National Governors Association, I never liked it when \nthe Federal Government came in and said: Spend your money this way or \nthat way, without giving us the money. I never liked it when the \nFederal Government came in and said: We are going to take your ability \nto raise money away without providing for the shortfall. I think we are \nconsistent here and true to the concerns that have been raised by State \nand local governments on that score.\n\n  The third thing we have done--I sort of alluded to it--the technology \nin this area continues to change dramatically. I like to kid, but I say \n5 years ago I could not even spell VOIP, Voice Over Internet Protocol, \nwhich basically means sending telephone services over the Internet.\n  Actually, 5 years ago, the idea of being able to do that was, I \nthink, a gleam in somebody's eye. Today it is common practice. Not only \nthat, we have the ability to send something called IPTV, Internet \nProtocol TV, to send television signals over the Internet. In my State, \nwe do not necessarily raise our revenues this way. But some places do. \nThey raise some of the revenues for educational purposes, for \nparamedics, for fire services, for police services. They raise their \nrevenues by taxing telephone services and cable services. It is \ninappropriate for us to come and say: You cannot do that, even as those \nservices are somehow transferred and transmitted over the Internet.\n  So what we have done, by not making the moratorium permanent, is we \nhave made sure we are going to come back and revisit this issue \nsomewhere down the line. We say 7 years. The House says 4 years. We \nwill have the opportunity and the requirement to come back and revisit \nthis issue. If the technology changes--and it will. I can tell you one \nthing for sure, the technology that is in place today is not going to \nbe same in 4, 5, 6, 7 years, just as it was not 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 years \nago. It has continued to change. By virtue of this legislation, we will \nbe better prepared for that change.\n  Again, I close with this: When I talk to people in our State, and in \nother States as well, when I hear about the low regard people have for \nthe Congress and, frankly, for the administration--but we will stick \nwith us right now--one of the things that people are most unhappy about \nis our seeming inability to work together, to hang in there, until we \nhave been able to carve out, find a middle ground that is responsive to \nthe concerns of most people. We have done that. It has not been easy, \nbut we have been persistent, and I think ultimately--at least tonight, \ntoday--successful.\n  I am pleased to have been a part of this effort and to have had a \nchance to work with our Senators Alexander, Stevens, Inouye, McCain, \nand Senator Sununu.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to stand up \ntonight, after Senator Carper, which is very appropriate, to talk about \nthis success. The Senator from Delaware has described, I think very \nclearly, the strength of this legislation, the value of the \nlegislation, and the importance of the legislation.\n  We really do have a responsibility to act in our role as a Congress \nto prevent Internet access taxes. Because this is a national--and, in \nfact, global--communications network. It is a national and global \nnetwork for commerce and business as well. That is our responsibility \nunder the Constitution to make sure there are not unnecessary, undue \nburdens on interstate commerce and trade.\n  So what we have done tonight is to take legislation that was passed \nin the House and really improve it dramatically. Senator McConnell \nindicated we have nearly doubled the length. We added clarification \nlanguage as to what could and could not be taxed, and how the \ngrandfathered States that were taxing prior to 1998 would be treated.\n  We also added explicit language to make sure that Internet services, \nsuch as e-mail and instant messaging, could not be taxed. This is an \nimportant issue for me and many others, particularly Senator Wyden from \nOregon, who spoke about it today on the floor of the Senate.\n  It is important that consumers know that Internet access is not going \nto be taxed, first and foremost, because taxes raise the price of \nsomething. I do not think Congress wants to be in the position of \nallowing the price and the cost of Internet access for every consumer \nin America to go up. We do not want to be in the position of raising \nthe cost of Internet access as well because it would affect the pace of \ninvestments and the incentives to make investments.\n  Anytime you tax something, you are going to get less of it. This ban \non Internet taxes is extremely important. I would like to make the ban \npermanent. I think the time has come to make it permanent. After \npassing it in 1998, and extending it in 2001 and 2004, to look at yet \nanother short-term extension does not seem to make as much sense to me \nas making the ban on access taxes permanent. But at the same\n\n[[Page S13432]]\n\ntime, we need to recognize that a 7-year extension is the longest \nextension we have ever had, and that alone I think should make us very \nproud of the work that was done, and it was bipartisan.\n\n  A lot of members of the Commerce Committee worked very hard on this \nissue. Senator Carper certainly spent a lot of time on this issue. We \nhaven't always agreed on every aspect of the legislation, but we can \nagree, and we have agreed, on this 7-year extension tonight.\n  I do want to make special mention of Senator Inouye, one of the \nSenators who was mentioned earlier as well. He is the chairman of the \nCommerce Committee. It was very frustrating to me that we never had a \nchance to vote on this legislation in the Commerce Committee, but he \nand his staff didn't stop working on the issue, and they put in a \ntremendous effort today to work through all of the details that are \nrequired. Even if it only takes the Senate 32 seconds to make a \nunanimous consent request to pass the final product, that 32 seconds \nhas behind it hours and hours of work by many Members of the Senate and \nmany more staff members. So I appreciate Senator Inouye's work and the \nwork of the staff as well.\n  I am pleased we are sending this to the House tonight, but also \npleased to note that we are doing it before the expiration of the \ncurrent moratorium. The last extension was passed in 2004 and expires \non November 1, or next Thursday. It is not that often, unfortunately, \nthat Congress does something in a fairly timely way. So to pass this \nlegislation tonight in advance of that expiration date adds a little \nbit more satisfaction, knowing we did the right thing, and that we did \nit on time. I am pleased to support the legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, let me take one more minute on this \nsubject to also extend my thanks and compliments to our staffs. On my \nstaff, Bill Ghent and Chris Prendergast worked long and hard for many \nhours. Our Commerce Committee staff, both Democrat and Republican, did \na terrific job under the leadership of Senator Inouye, and we are \ndeeply grateful to him and to Senator Stevens' staff for the wonderful \nwork they did. The Commerce staff works in a way I wish every committee \nstaff and subcommittee staff would--Democrat, Republican, majority, \nminority--it is almost seamless the way they approach almost every \nissue, including this one. I think one of the things that happens when \nyou work like that is you get something done. While it is not unanimous \nacclaim for what we have done here, I think for the most part it is \ngood work.\n  If we live to see what happens over in the House, hopefully we will \nbe able to resolve our differences with them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/25/senate-section/article/S13432-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13432-S13434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    PASSENGER RAIL INVESTMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2007--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, the bill before us is the Amtrak \nreauthorization bill. Each year it seems we find ourselves fighting \nincreasing gridlock on our highways, whether it is Iowa, Delaware, New \nHampshire, or Vermont. We face growing threats of smog in our skies, \npolluted air, crowded conditions at our Nation's airports, and \nfinancial challenges facing our aviation industry. If we don't broaden \nour investment in transportation infrastructure across our Nation, we \nare headed for a crisis.\n  Each year an outfit called the Texas Transportation Institute \nreleases something they call the Urban Mobility Report. It continues to \nshow traffic congestion growing across our Nation in cities of all \nsizes, consuming more hours of the day and affecting more travelers and \nshipments of goods than ever before. The annual financial cost of \ntraffic congestion has ballooned. In 1982 it was about $14 billion; \ntoday, $78 billion. There is a personal cost as well--the time lost to \ntraffic.\n  The same Urban Mobility Report quantifies this loss at 4.2 billion \nlost hours. That is not commuting time. This is just sitting in traffic \nnot going anywhere, 4.2 billion lost hours and almost 3 billion gallons \nof wasted fuel. That is the equivalent on the one hand of 105 million \nweeks of people's lives and 58 fully loaded supertankers.\n  Rail remains the most underdeveloped opportunity to reshape our \nnational transportation network. Rail can efficiently move large \nnumbers of people over moderate distances, anywhere from 100 to 400 \nmiles, and requires a smaller right-of-way than highways.\n  I would also point out that to move a ton of freight from Boston, \nMassachusetts, to Washington, DC, takes about 1 gallon of diesel fuel. \nSo in a time and age when we are worried about the amount of oil we are \nimporting, 1 gallon of diesel fuel can move a ton of freight from \nBoston to Washington.\n  But with respect to corridors, this is important in densely populated \nareas where there is not much land available to support new \ninfrastructure, and the land that is available is mighty expensive.\n  States are starting to put their own funding toward rail corridor \ndevelopment as well. Several are using rail to relieve congestion at \nairports by investing in rail service in connection with their \nairports, much like we have at BWI, just north of here near Baltimore, \nmuch like we have at Newark, NJ, and other places. But what they are \ndoing is using rail service to make a connection with airports as a \nsubstitute for the spoke portion of a hub-and-spoke air journey.\n  Early success stories include rail service between Boston Airport and \nPortland, ME, as well as increased service from the Milwaukee Airport \nto the Chicago region.\n  More and more people are taking the train in our country, and there \nare a variety of reasons for that. Trains are convenient, they are \ncomfortable, they are reliable. When you ride the train, you have \nbigger seats, you have more leg room. You can also use the phone and \naccess the Internet. If you want a place that is quiet, you can go to \nthe quiet car. If you want to eat, you can go to the dining car.\n  Amtrak used to have an ad campaign that said: ``Amtrak: The Civilized \nWay to Travel.'' Compared to some of the adventures I have had in \nairplanes in the last year, it surely is the civilized way to travel.\n  When you arrive at your destination, in many cases the train station \nis in the center of town as it is here; as it is in Wilmington and \nPhiladelphia, and as it is in New York City and a lot of other places \nas well. On-time performance is not great, but it is on par with the \nairlines nationwide. But in the Northeast corridor where some of us \nlive, the train is even more reliable. The Acela Express has an on-time \nperformance of almost 90 percent--not 100 percent but pretty darn good.\n  As a result, Amtrak ridership is starting to break records. In fiscal \nyear 2007, a record-breaking 25.8 million people rode Amtrak. Total \nticket revenues increased about 11 percent over fiscal year 2006 to \nsome $1.4 billion; still less than the cost of running the train, but \nstill a hefty increase.\n  Ridership has increased across the Nation. The Acela Express has seen \na 20-percent increase over last year and the Northeast corridor's \nregional trains are up as well. Outside of the Northeast corridor, \ninterestingly, the Keystone Service train, the train between \nHarrisburg, PA, and Philadelphia and New York, experienced about a 21-\npercent increase in ridership; the Chicago-St. Louis corridor, 42 \npercent. California's Capitol Corridor, which is a train that runs from \nAuburn to San Jose, is up 15 percent, and the San Diego-San Luis Obispo \nPacific Surfliner is up about 9 percent. I think what we need to do is \nto look at those corridors to see what is working and try to apply that \nto a whole lot of other Amtrak lines. What we do in this bill is just \nthat.\n  The Passenger Rail Investment Improvement Act would require the \nFederal Railroad Administration to develop performance standards to \nevaluate the financial performance, on-time performance, and customer \nsatisfaction of each Amtrak train.\n  Amtrak is then required to establish performance improvement plans \nfor the five long-distance routes with their worst performance, \nincluding the worst financial performance. A year later, Amtrak must \nimplement the plans and the Federal Railroad Administration may \nwithhold funds for a route plan if the plan is not implemented. In \nfuture years, the remaining 10 long-distance\n\n[[Page S13433]]\n\nroutes would undergo the same restructuring process.\n  Additionally, the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act would \nrequire the Federal Railroad Administration to analyze Amtrak's routes \nand consider changes that would require cost recovery and on-time \nperformance as well as address the transportation needs of communities \nthat are not served by any other form of public transportation.\n  I expect when we analyze these long-distance train routes, we will \nfind the factors that make a train--or any form of travel--appealing to \ntravelers is the frequency, the reliability, and the travel time of \nthat service. In the case of many of these long-distance trains, the \ntrain may only run a few days a week or at odd hours. I remember the \nfirst time my family and I--my mom, my sister, and I ever caught a \ntrain, we lived in Beckley, WV. We caught a train in a little nearby \ntown called Prince where the train stopped. We caught the train about 3 \no'clock in the morning. I was about 5 or 6 years old. We caught it at 3 \no'clock in the morning. In a lot of places around the country, we have \ntrains that are stopping at 3 o'clock in the morning, 2 o'clock in the \nmorning, 1 o'clock in the morning, 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning. No \nwonder people don't want to ride those trains, especially when they \nshow up about every 2 or 3 days. But on-time performance can be an \nissue because the tracks outside the Northeast corridor are not owned \nby Amtrak, they are owned by the railroad companies, and capacity on \nthe freight rail lines is constrained by increasing demand to move more \nfreight by rail. The freight is on the track. Amtrak sometimes gets in \nthe way. The freight railroads want to move freight, not necessarily \npassengers. What this does is it indicates, to me at least, the need \nfor additional investment in rail infrastructure--something we also \naddress in this bill that is before us.\n  I think it is particularly remarkable how many States are investing \nin rail today when you consider the fact that the Federal Government \nprovides no support. I learned when I served as Governor of Delaware \nthat if we wanted to build in my State or to expand an airport, the \nFederal Government put up 80 percent of the funds--80 percent. The \nState would do 20. Building or expanding a highway or bridge in my \nState would also yield that same 80 percent support from the Federal \nGovernment. If we wanted to invest in transit, as we do, those funds \nwere more competitive and hard to come by. The Federal Government would \nstill pony up about 50 percent of the expense and the State would do \nthe rest. But we wanted in my State to invest, and we do it smart, to \ninvest in passenger rail, but that was the wisest investment for the \ndollar, for the buck. We got nothing from the Federal Government. The \nState had to put up 100 percent. Think about it. If you are the \nGovernor of a State or you are running a State and you can get matching \nfunds for highways, you can get 80 percent on transit projects, 80 \npercent from the Federal Government for money on airports, but you can \nget zero for a city passenger rail service, which one would you vote \nfor or choose? The answer I think is pretty obvious--not necessarily \nthe right decision, the smartest decision, but oftentimes that is the \ndecision that is made. It makes no sense.\n  So the Passenger Rail Investment Improvement Act bill changes that. \nIt authorizes some $1.7 billion over the life of this bill for a new \nState and capital grant program to support States that wish to provide \nnew or improved inner city passenger rail. The Federal match is 80 \npercent--the same as highways, same as roads, same as airports. I \nbelieve this step will create a long-term, sustainable Federal funding \nmechanism for States investing in inner city passenger rail capacity, \nwith the same kind of capital support we currently provide again for \nairports, highways, and transit.\n  Last Congress, the Senate passed the bill we have before us by a vote \nof 93 to 6. It was added as an amendment to an appropriations bill and \npassed 93 to 6. It died in conference. It was taken out, dropped. The \nSenate then overwhelmingly recognized the wisdom of our approach in \nbringing the Northeast corridor to a state of good repair, requiring \nreforms to the long-distance lines, allowing freight railroads to \ncompete with Amtrak on their rail lines, the rail lines and the \nfreights, and providing Federal support for capital rail investment, \nmuch as we do for highways, airports, and transit.\n  I urge my colleagues to show the same strong support for this bill \nwhen we reconvene next week so we can respond to our constituents' \ncalls for more rail investment and more transportation options, \nespecially where that makes sense.\n  Let me close, if I can, with this. Having served for 4 years on the \nAmtrak board, as Congressman, Senator, and Governor, being very much \ninvolved in the passenger rail service in my State and across the \ncountry, I am not interested in running trains for people who don't \nwant to ride them. I don't think any of us are. I am not interested in \nthe Federal Government providing inordinate subsidies for trains for \nfolks who don't want to ride or for people who have other perfectly \ngood options. If you think about it, in this country of ours, over half \nthe people live within 50 miles of one of our coasts, over 50 percent \nof the people live 50 miles from one of our corridors. We have these \ndensely populated corridors up and down the east coast, the gulf coast, \nthe west coast. They were made to order for trains. Some of those long-\ndistance trains make a lot of sense too.\n  A lot of businesses will pay good money, premium money for those \ntrains. Folks will take a train south of here and go down to Orlando, \nput their car behind them on the train or minivan or whatever, and they \npay good money for those trains. They actually make money. What we have \nto do is to figure out how to work differently, to meet the need that \nis out there, to work smarter. The legislation that is before us will \ndo that.\n  I know the hour is late and you have places to go and so do I. Let me \nyield back the floor and I thank you all for your patience.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to offer my support \nfor the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2007. This \nlegislation authorizes Federal funds for Amtrak's capital and operating \nneeds to maintain current operations, upgrade equipment, and return the \nNortheast corridor to a state of good repair.\n  Passenger rail is indispensable to our Nation's economy and quality \nof life. As our Nation's aviation and highway transportation systems \nbecome increasingly more unreliable or cost prohibitive due to flight \ndelays, congestion, and rising fuel costs, a viable passenger rail \nalternative has become a vital component of the national transportation \nnetwork. More travelers rely on Amtrak now than at any other point in \nthe company's 36-year history. Not only is Amtrak an important option \nfor travelers, but increased reliance on passenger rail has the \npotential to reduce our Nation's dependence on foreign oil and curb \nautomobile emissions by attracting more would-be drivers into train \ncars.\n  This legislation would ensure the stability and solvency of our \nNation's passenger rail transportation system, without which I believe \nwe would be severely disadvantaged. In addition to authorizing a \nreliable stream of funding for Amtrak, the bill restructures Amtrak's \ndebt to achieve savings, creates a new grant program for States to \nsupport rail improvement projects, and creates a new, bipartisan, nine-\nmember Amtrak board of directors whose members must have either rail, \ntransportation, or business background.\n  Additionally, I am pleased that the managers' package of amendments \nincludes language which I sponsored requiring Amtrak to study and \nreport to Congress on the infrastructure and equipment improvements \nnecessary to achieve 2 hour and 30 minute Acela service from \nWashington, DC, to New York City and 3 hour and 15 minute Acela Service \nbetween New York City and Boston. The current trip times are 2 hours 45 \nminutes from New York City to Washington, DC, and 3 hours 30 minutes \nfrom New York City to Boston. I believe this study will provide a \nblueprint for the future of the Northeast corridor and will assist \nAmtrak in providing faster, more reliable service along this route.\n  Accordingly, as a longstanding supporter of Amtrak and a frequent \npassenger, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I fully support S. 294, a bill that will \nfinally\n\n[[Page S13434]]\n\nreauthorize Amtrak and make important changes to secure a prosperous \nfuture for intercity passenger rail in the United States. In a year \nwhen Amtrak faces yet another crisis, in part due to the \nadministration's proposal to severely reduce Amtrak funding in an \neffort to restructure the railroad through bankruptcy, this bill is all \nthe more necessary. Additionally, congestion delays at our airports and \non our roads are making more and more travelers dependent on passenger \nrail. We need to ensure that our national passenger rail system is \nadequately prepared to accommodate this increased ridership.\n  I congratulate Senator Lautenberg and Senator Lott for crafting this \nimportant bill, of which I am a cosponsor. This bill encourages the \ndevelopment of new rail corridors, provides incentives for Amtrak to \noperate more efficiently, and strengthens the relationship between \nAmtrak and the States in which it operates. This bill will also provide \nmore transparency into Amtrak's operations and help Amtrak better \ncontrol its costs. I believe that it will further fortify Amtrak as an \nimportant, necessary, and viable option in the United States' \ntransportation landscape.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/25/senate-section/article/S13434-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. CARPER.

Mr. President, I am in strong support of the fiscal \nyear 2008 Labor, Health and Human Services appropriations bill. I thank \nthe chairman of the Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Subcommittee, \nSenator Harkin, and the ranking member, Senator Specter, for their \nleadership in crafting this bill and ensuring some of our Nation's most \ncritical priorities are adequately funded. I am proud that we have been \nable to negotiate a bipartisan appropriations bill that passed the \nSenate.\n  This bill is one of the most important funding bills that comes \nbefore us. It fulfills our responsibilities in key priorities, such as \nhealth care and education. With the passage of this legislation, we \nwill be striking a significant departure from the administration's \ndamaging trend of shortchanging our children, our schools, our workers, \nand our health. Instead of undermining education, abdicating our \nresponsibilities on health care, weakening the rights of our workers, \nthis bill will restore a commonsense balance to our values that we \nshould expect from the greatest Nation in the world.\n  I would like to highlight a few areas in which this bill is \nespecially successful and contrast them to the administration's \nmisguided priorities.\n  While the President's budget zeroed out funding for mentoring \nprograms under the Safe and Drug Free Schools Act--a program that is \ncritical to keeping our children safe and off the streets--I am proud \nthat this bill not only restores that funding, but increases it by more \nthan $30 million.\n  As someone whose dreams of college could not have been realized \nwithout Pell grants and other Federal financial aid, I am pleased this \nbill follows through on the promise to increase Pell grants and \nrestores funding for Perkins loans. These increases will mean that \ntoday's young people who come from families that cannot afford college \non their own can still achieve their dreams. I know the power of this \nassistance. Without these programs, I would not have been the first in \nmy family to graduate from college and law school. There are millions \nof students nationwide who are in the shoes I once was. They are \nwaiting, hoping that there will be adequate financial aid to help them \naccess college. And as tuition continues to increase, as grant aid \nunder this president has shrunk, that challenge is getting anything but \neasier. In my home state of New Jersey, where the average tuition rose \n7 percent since last year, 4-year public colleges are the second most \nexpensive in the Nation. Our students need more, not less, grant aid if \nthey are going to achieve their dreams. This bill sets us in the right \ndirection.\n  Another program that is vital to students in New Jersey is vocational \neducation. The vocational State grants are critical for the \ninstitutions in our state that are working to develop a workforce that \nis able to compete in today's global economy. New Jersey has some of \nthe best vocational and technical education programs in the country. \nAnd while this President continually speaks about an educated and \ncompetitive workforce in the science, technology and math fields, he \ndoes not put his money where his mouth is. His budget would have cut \nvocational funding in half. Our bill restores those cuts.\n  This bill also restores cuts to education technology grants, which \nthe President called for eliminating. These grants help ensure that our \nchildren have access to technology in the classroom. New Jersey alone \nwould have lost $5 million next year under the President's cuts. In the \nglobal race to have the most trained, highly skilled, best prepared \nworkforce, we are losing ground. The earlier we can introduce our young \npeople to technology, to help them gain fluency in areas that involve \ntechnology, the better off they will be in an evolving and increasing \ntechnological world.\n  I am also pleased this bill increases funding for special education \nby more than $500 million. This funding is critical to ensuring \nchildren with disabilities have an equal opportunity to receive a good \npublic education, just as other children.\n  And ensuring all children begin on an equal playing field means \nadequately funding Head Start, which this bill does. This legislation \nprovides a $200 million increase for Head Start, which will help \nimprove the school readiness of our young children to ensure they can \nget the skills necessary to succeed. Head Start provides child \ndevelopment, education, health care, nutrition, and socialization \nskills, all essential services that benefit more than nearly 1 million \nlow-income children in this country.\n  This bill also helps our young people by expanding opportunities for \nthem to learn trade skills. It provides a $15 million increase for \nYouthBuild, which helps young people learn constructing and housing \nskills and prepare for postsecondary training. This legislation also \nprovides an increase of almost $82 million for Job Corps to help \nstrengthen these centers that provide key job skills to young people.\n  In addition, this bill will help veterans transition to civilian life \nby providing a $5 million increase for employment and training \nservices.\n  In terms of health care, this bill makes significant changes to the \nPresident's budget proposal and redefines our priorities as a Nation. \nOverall, the bill provides $68.1 billion in discretionary \nappropriations for Health and Human Services Department programs. This \namount is $5 billion more than last year's level and $5.4 billion more \nthat the administration's budget request.\n  The bill provides $250 million more for Community Health Centers and \nover $200 million for the National Center of Minority Health and Health \nDisparities to address the health care needs of our Nation's minority \nand underserved communities.\n  This bill will also provide almost $29.9 billion in funding for the \nNational Institutes of Health, $1.3 billion more that the Bush \nadministration's budget request. The Centers for Disease Control would \nalso receive $6.4 billion under this bill which is $444 million more \nthan the administration's request. It is imperative that we continue to \ninvest in our Nation's health and research facilities as their work \nwill save and improve the lives of millions of Americans.\n  I am proud that this bill also provides $8 million for the initial \nimplementation of the Patient Navigator, Outreach, and Chronic Disease \nPrevention Act of 2005, which President Bush signed into law in 2005. I \nsponsored this legislation when I was in the House of Representatives \nin order to improve health outcomes by helping patients, including \npatients in underserved communities, to overcome barriers they face in \ngetting early screening and appropriate followup treatment.

Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to one of \nVermont's outstanding teachers, Diane Bahrenburg, who last month was \nnamed the 2008 Vermont Teacher of the Year. Diane is an English teacher \nat Colchester High School in Vermont, where she has taught since 1979. \nI recently had the opportunity to meet Diane in my Washington office, \nand I was impressed with her intellect, her passion for teaching, and \nher commitment to the students of Colchester High School. As we talked \nabout her classes and students, it was evident how much Diane cares \nabout teaching.\n  In being chosen as Vermont's Teacher of the Year, Diane will have the \nopportunity to visit schools throughout our State and others around the \ncountry. Her travels will allow her to work with other teachers, \nsharing and discussing the methods that have helped her become so \nsuccessful. Hopefully she will share with all of us how she has been \nable to balance the everyday demands of teaching in the classroom, with \nthe work she has done as an adjunct instructor at Johnson State College \nand UVM, acting as the Vermont debate-forensics lead coach at \nColchester High School, and being a parent.\n  We all know that teaching is a hard job. And it is a crucial job an \nindispensable link between our young people and their futures, as well \nas our Nation's future. The opportunities for recognition of teachers' \naccomplishments are too few and too far between. So I am so pleased \nthat Diane is being recognized for all she has done over three decades, \nday in and day out, to educate our children and to make a constructive \ndifference, one child at a time. Teachers are the instrument by which \nwe measure the success of our schools. The knowledge, skill, and \nexperience of teachers like Diane are exactly what we need in each and \nevery one of our classrooms.\n  We are fortunate in Vermont. I continue to be impressed by the high \nlevel of achievement of Vermont's students and the academic gains that \nhave been made because of the strong and committed efforts of teachers \nlike Diane. In spite of the countless hours spent sorting through the \nmaze of No Child Left Behind requirements, our teachers are able to \ninspire students to look beyond tests and find the true lessons of the \nclassroom.\n  As an alumnus of St. Michael's College in Vermont, I would be remiss \nif I failed to note that Diane received her master's in education \ndegree from St. Michael's College in 2000. I believe that she embodies \nthe core principles of the college's education programs with her skill \nin maintaining an inclusive classroom, while keeping a balance between \nchallenge and support and between individual and community. Diane is a \nmodel teacher, and after decades of teaching, she is incredibly worthy \nof this recognition. Diane, again I say thank you for all that you do, \nand on behalf of the Senate, we say congratulations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/25/senate-section/article/S13435-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DAVID TAWEI LEE\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to acknowledge the \nservice of Representative David Tawei Lee, who has given nearly 3 years \nof exceptional service as Taiwan's principal representative to the \nUnited States. Representative Lee recently departed Washington, DC, to \ntake on his next assignment as Taiwan's Representative to Canada. He \nleaves behind a legacy of friendship, prosperity, and understanding.\n  When Representative Lee arrived in Washington, he came equipped with \na wealth of experience and insight. A foremost expert on U.S.-Taiwan \nrelations, Mr. Lee has studied, written, and published on U.S.-Taiwan \npolitical and economic ties, including the development of the Taiwan \nRelations Act. I believe Representative Lee will be remembered not only \nfor his excellent knowledge of history but also for his \naccomplishments.\n  While serving in Washington, Representative Lee dedicated his energy, \nintelligence, and spirit to expanding Taiwan-American ties. He raised \nthe cultural and political profile of Taiwan and its people with \ncultural and education programs. To enhance our economic ties, \nRepresentative Lee oversaw the successful acceleration of our bilateral \nTrade and Investment Agreement talks. And he worked tirelessly to raise \nawareness of the benefits of a potential U.S.-Taiwan Free Trade \nAgreement. In these areas alone, he has left a legacy of which he \nshould take pride.\n  Representative Lee's dedication and efforts were also felt far beyond \nour Nation's Capital. Three years ago, I was delighted to personally \nwelcome Mr. Lee to my home State of Montana. There he witnessed Big Sky \nCountry in all of its glory, making friends with hospitable and \ngenerous Montanans. But together we also saw the deep and healthy roots \nof the Montana-Taiwan economic relationship. At its core are Montana's \nfinest agricultural products, which have long found their way to \nTaiwanese dinner tables and bakeries. Today, Taiwan purchases over 30 \nmillion bushels of Montana wheat annually. Our fine Montana beef is \nalso in demand. This relationship benefits families in both Montana and \nTaiwan. And I hope it will continue to grow stronger.\n  It has truly been a pleasure to work with Representative Lee. His \npersonal touch to everything he did will not be forgotten. And the \nvalue of his contributions will be remembered for many years to come. I \nwish him luck in all of his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/25/senate-section/article/S13435-3", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13435-S13436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO LOUISIANA WWII VETERANS\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \npay tribute to a group of 94 World War II veterans from Louisiana that \nis making its way to Washington this weekend. Here the veterans will \nvisit the World War II, Korea, Vietnam and Iwo Jima memorials as well \nas Arlington National Cemetery to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the \nUnknowns.\n  The trip to the Nation's Capital this Saturday is being sponsored by \na group in Lafayette, LA, called Louisiana HonorAir. The organization \nis honoring each surviving World War II Louisiana veteran by giving \nthem a chance to see the memorials dedicated to their service. So far \nthis year, there have been three trips to these Washington memorials \nand two more are planned, including this one.\n  World War II was the deadliest conflict in our history. More than 60 \nmillion people worldwide were killed, including 40 million civilians, \nand more than 400,000 American service members were slain during the \nlong war.\n  In Louisiana, there remain today about 44,000 living World War II \nveterans, and every one of them has their own heroic tale of their \nexperience in achieving the noble victory of freedom over tyranny.\n  One of our veterans traveling for his first time to Washington is \nFrank Menard from Lafayette. Originally from Youngsville, he was \ndrafted into the Army in 1942 at 21 years old and trained at Camp \nClaiborne in Rapides Parish. In 1943, he was sent to England as part of \nthe Army's 101st Airborne Division, serving as a driver and a mechanic. \nHe participated in many battles with the Nazis during his 3 years in \nEurope, including the Battle of Normandy, where an enemy artillery \nshell struck his truck, and the Battle of the Bulge, which severely \ncrippled German forces. His French and German language skills helped \nhim gather intelligence about enemy plans. During the Battle of the \nBulge, he took a pregnant Belgian woman whose toes had been shot off by \nthe Germans to an American hospital, saving her life. When he returned \nto Louisiana after the war, Frank used his mechanics skills to become a \nunion electrician in Lake Charles and Lafayette, where he settled.\n\n[[Page S13436]]\n\n  I ask the Senate to join me in honoring Frank Menard, the other 93 \nLouisiana heroes we welcome to Washington this weekend and Louisiana \nHonorAir for making these trips a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/25/senate-section/article/S13436-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               IN HONOR OF REVEREND WALLACE S. HARTSFIELD\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me \ntoday in honoring Rev. Dr. Wallace S. Hartsfield, a much-loved member \nof the Kansas City community. Reverend Hartsfield will soon retire \nafter 40 years as the senior pastor of Metropolitan Missionary Baptist \nChurch. He has served as Metropolitan's pastor since 1972 with the \nsupport of his wife Matilda and their four children. Prior to that, he \nheld pastoral positions in South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and \nKansas.\n  Reverend Hartsfield's distinguished career in the ministry has \ntouched thousands in Missouri. As the ambassador for his church, he has \ngraced pulpits across the country bringing words of hope to the masses. \nHe is a respected servant-leader of many organizations including the \nNational Baptist Convention of America, Inc.; National Baptist \nConvention, USA; Congress of National Black Churches and the General \nBaptist State Convention of Missouri, Kansas, and Nebraska.\n  He has expanded his ministry as a community advocate. Reverend \nHartsfield has spent much of his life speaking up for those whose \nvoices are ignored on the subjects of civil rights, health care, \neducation, crime and safety, and economic development. One of his \nbravest acts occurred in 1964 when five department stores in downtown \nKansas City refused to allow African Americans to try on clothes, use \nthe restrooms, drink at the water fountains, or eat at the lunch \ncounters. Reverend Hartsfield organized a boycott and marched on the \nstores. Eventually African Americans were allowed to patronize these \nstores but it was not without the personal intervention of this \ninspirational leader.\n  His service has afforded him a seat at many tables where he has \nproven to be a skillful diplomat and a cunning negotiator. Reverend \nHartsfield has worked on countless boards including those of the Jazz \nDistrict Redevelopment Corporation, Greater Kansas City Community \nFoundation, Missouri Highway and Transportation Commission, and Kansas \nCity Interfaith Council.\n  Reverend Hartsfield has a bachelor's degree in elementary education \nand minor degrees in religion and psychology from Clark College in \nAtlanta, GA. He also holds a bachelor and master of divinity from \nGammon Theological Seminary in Atlanta. Dr. Hartsfield has served as an \nadjunct professor and guest lecturer at numerous colleges and \nuniversities across the Nation.\n  Reverend Hartsfield has been a mentor to many, from pastors to \npoliticians. He continues to provide wise counsel to those who want to \nmake a difference in the world. He also has the ability to identify \nhidden treasures in those who have not been afforded an opportunity to \nthrive. This precious gift has been the catalyst for many to realize \ntheir dreams.\n  For 40 years, the members of Metropolitan have been blessed to have \nthis powerful leader at the helm. Reverend Hartsfield has worked hard \nand he has earned the opportunity to step back. However, we know his \nwork is not yet done. He will continue shaping lives, communities and \ndestinies for years to come.\n  During one of the many times he was honored for his good works it was \nsaid:\n\n       Wallace Hartsfield does battle with all the dark forces \n     that would keep us from knowing and loving one another. With \n     his Bible and his passion for justice and his rock-ribbed \n     integrity, Reverend Wallace Hartsfield leads us to the high \n     moral ground where all God's children sit down together as \n     family at the table of peace and delight.\n\n  No truer words could be spoken.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/25/senate-section/article/S13436-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING WYNN SPEECE\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize the passing of \nWynn Speece. Wynn passed away on October 22, at Avera Sacred Heart \nHospital in Yankton, SD, at the age of 90.\n  Many will remember Wynn as the ``Neighbor Lady'' from her WNAX talk \nradio show. For 64 years her voice came into the homes of countless \nMidwestern families. Her household tips, recipes, and personal \nanecdotes will be missed not only by South Dakotans but also by her \nmany listeners throughout the Midwestern region.\n  Wynn grew up in Marshalltown, IA, where she took a special interest \nin home economics and theater. Upon her graduation from high school, \nshe continued her education at Drake University where she majored in \nspeech with a broadcasting emphasis. After her graduation in 1939, she \ntook a job writing commercials for WNAX in Yankton, SD. It took 2 years \nof writing before WNAX gave Wynn her very own show. From the first show \nshe was an instant success, and that success would follow the \n``Neighbor Lady'' for the next 64 years.\n  Wynn won several awards for outstanding radio work. She was presented \nwith the prestigious Marconi Award for ``Best Small-Market Radio \nPersonality'' and was named one of the top 10 Yankton citizens of the \n20th century by the Yankton Press and Dakotan. Not only was Wynn a \ncelebrated radio host, but she also worked hard to make a positive \nimpact on the community of Yankton. Her local involvement and selfless \ngiving earned Wynn the 1991 Yankton Community Citizen of the Year \nAward.\n  Wynn Speece was an extraordinary woman and a great South Dakotan who \nwill be greatly missed by all who knew her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/25/senate-section/article/S13436-3", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING CAROLE HILLARD\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize the passing of \nCarole Hillard, former Lieutenant Governor of South Dakota. Carole \nHillard was a gracious woman with an authentic and deeply held passion \nfor public service.\n  Ms. Hillard was born August 14, 1936, in Deadwood, SD. She attended \nthe University of Arizona and received a degree in education in 1957. \nShe received a master's degree in education from South Dakota State \nUniversity in 1982 and a master's degree in political science from the \nUniversity of South Dakota in 1984.\n  As the mother of five children, David, Sue Ellen, Todd, Eddie, and \nLornell, she possessed the practical knowledge to connect with the \nneeds of South Dakotans as she served on the South Dakota Board of \nCharities and Corrections, the Rapid City United Way Campaign, the \nSouth Dakota Children's Home Society, and as the first woman president \nof the Rapid City Council.\n  She was elected to the South Dakota House of Representatives in 1991 \nand served until 1994, at which point she became the first female \nLieutenant Governor in South Dakota. From 1995 until 2003, Ms. Hillard \ngraciously presided over the Senate and memorably seemed initially \nsurprised when State Senators on the Senate floor formally referred to \nher as ``Madam President.'' Her career in public service and the impact \nshe had did not go unnoticed, as she won many awards in her lifetime, \nincluding the 1987 Public Service Award, the 1988 Governor's \nOutstanding Citizen Award, the 1993 South Dakota Outstanding Women \nAward, and induction into the South Dakota Hall of Fame in 2007.\n  Not only has she accomplished much for the State of South Dakota but \nshe has also accomplished much on the international level. In recent \nyears, Carole Hillard was an international consultant traveling on \nbehalf of the U.S. Department of State. Ms. Hillard completed \nassignments to 67 countries such as Panama, the Czech Republic, San \nSalvador, Bosnia, and Africa. Recently, she also helped bring to life a \nskill-building workshop for residents of Kabul, Afghanistan, and \nsupervised the January 2007 elections in the West Bank.\n  Carole Hillard's life accomplishments are truly remarkable. Her \npositive outlook on life, her integrity, and her warm personality truly \nembodied a woman whose passion was the betterment of humankind. While \nMs. Hillard is no longer with us, her legacy of service to the people \nof South Dakota and her diligent work on the promotion of democracy and \neconomic development will not be forgotten.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/25/senate-section/article/S13437-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S13437]]\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 4, 2007, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on October 24, 2007, during the \nadjournment of the Senate, received a message from the House of \nRepresentatives announcing that the Speaker had signed the following \nenrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 995.

A bill to withdraw certain Federal land in the Wyoming Range \nfrom leasing and provide an opportunity to retire certain leases in the \nWyoming Range; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise because today is Wyoming's day, \nliterally. It is a long awaited day, a day that is special, a day that \nis as special as the mountain range that this day centers on, and as \nspecial as the State for which this mountain range is named.\n  This is a day of which I am proud to be a part, joining with the \nstrong majority of Wyoming people who want the legislation I am \nintroducing. It is the Wyoming Range Legacy Act of 2007.\n  Energy development is a proud part of Wyoming, and it is an important \npart of our Nation. But equal to that energy heritage is tourism and \nrecreation--also a proud part of Wyoming and an important part of this \nNation.\n  Wyoming is special. Reflecting both aspects of our economy, our \npeople want a special balance between two of our top industries: energy \nand tourism and recreation.\n  Some of Wyoming's significant and important energy contributions to \nthis great Nation encompass thousands of acres for our natural gas and \nenergy fields. Meanwhile, independent and strong stands an isolated \nmountain range 100 miles long and 12,000 feet high. This range is named \nfor our great State. It is that independent and wild mountain range--\nthe Wyoming Range--that I want to focus on today, and well into the \nfuture, for the best future for Wyoming and for our people.\n  As leaders, there are things we do, defining actions, actions that go \nwell beyond everyday issues. They surmount the daily noise and the \ndisagreements, and they rise to the level of something else: It is to \ndoing the right thing.\n  Today goes beyond the average day for Wyoming. As I said, today is \nWyoming's day. It is a great day because it is today that a bill is \nintroduced that will keep this special place on the map for tourism, \nfor recreation, and for sportsmen forever.\n  We, as a State--the Governor and I--come together, cooperatively, to \njoin in the memory of our dear friend Craig Thomas to finish his work, \nto keep and enhance the tourism, recreation, hunting, and sportsmen \neconomy of the Wyoming Range, to preserve a key part of Wyoming's \nheritage.\n  This legislation, this initiative Craig Thomas was ready to introduce \nthe week he passed goes to the very heart and soul of the great State \nof Wyoming. Indeed, this is a place where the heart and the soul of \nWyoming run free and run wild.\n  This is 1.2 million acres for Wyoming tourism, sportsmen, and \nrecreationists. This will mean that new, future leasing for oil and gas \nwill be welcomed elsewhere in the State, and the Wyoming Range will \nremain in the recreational-based economy that now exists.\n  For those leases that have already been issued, this legislation \nprovides a process for groups or individuals who are focused on \nconservation to buy back the value of those leases under voluntary \npurchase, and then retire them forever.\n  We all must recognize that the issued leases do have a value because \nthey are\n\n[[Page S13440]]\n\nnow legal property. At the same time, we can encourage all at the \ntable--leaders, conservationists, and the private sector--to work \ntoward doing the right thing. That process is now appropriately outside \nof the legislation and is ongoing.\n  For the recently issued leases that amount to some 44,000 acres, I \nhave great confidence we will be able to work out creative solutions \nwith respect on all sides.\n  But let us look at the bigger picture in this bill, with emphasis on \nan important, central point: What was the last bold move for Wyoming \ntourism? I proudly say, 1.2 million acres for Wyoming tourism, for \nWyoming sportsmen, and for Wyoming outfitters and guides--all of whom \ncontribute millions to our economy.\n  This is not a bill that ``locks up'' land. To the contrary, it is a \nbill for economic prosperity, for recreation, and for tourism. What we \ndo in this important piece of legislation is to recognize an economic \nbase and then enhance it. Let me repeat--because this is a very \nimportant point--we are taking the existing economic base and enhancing \nit in the Wyoming Range.\n  The Wyoming Range is a recreational-based economic zone. Yes, there \nare symbolic reasons for this initiative. It is the Wyoming Range, \nafter all. But there is hard math at the core of this legislation. \nTourism and recreation in our Wyoming economy matters. And doing the \nright thing matters. It matters for future generations of Wyoming \npeople who will someday hunt and fish and hike in these mountains. It \nis also a place where Wyoming's agricultural industry has thrived for \nyears. With this legislation, grazing and Wyoming's cowboy heritage \nwill continue to thrive.\n  I want to read you something from 1961 that still applies very much \ntoday. It goes to the heart of maintaining proper balance and multiple \nuse of our land:\n\n       Another factor in maintaining balance involves the element \n     of time. As we peer into society's future, we--you and I, and \n     our government--must avoid the impulse to live only for \n     today, plundering, for our own ease and convenience, the \n     precious resources of tomorrow. We cannot mortgage the \n     material assets of our grandchildren without asking the loss \n     also of their political and spiritual heritage. We want \n     democracy to survive for all generations to come, not to \n     become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow.\n\n  Those words were spoken by President Dwight Eisenhower in his final \naddress as he left the Presidency. The children who were listening to \nhis words back then are now grown and have grandchildren of their own.\n  The Wyoming Range--the range named for our beloved State--has \nsymbolic meaning, inherent values. It is the heart and the soul of a \ngreat State, a spiritual heritage, now a physical reality.\n  Mr. President, today is Wyoming's day, for the Wyoming range, and for \nthe people who love it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN:\n  S. 2230. A bill to amend title VIII of the Public Health Service Act \nto expand the nurse student loan program, to establish grant programs \nto address the nursing shortage, to amend title VII of the Higher \nEducation Act of 1965 to provide for a nurse faculty pilot project, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am honored to introduce the Nursing \nEducation Opportunities Act. This bill seeks to help alleviate both the \nnursing shortage faced in hospitals and clinics throughout the country, \nas well as the faculty shortage in nursing schools that constrains the \nnumber of new nurses who can be trained to fill the vacancies in our \nhealth facilities.\n  As most people who have heard me talk about health care know, nurses \nhave a soft spot in my heart. In 1987, I was stricken with a brain \naneurysm and spent months recovering at Walter Reed Hospital. The \nsurgeons who operated on me were spectacular and I can never thank them \nenough. But the nurses who took care of me during my stay at Walter \nReed were the embodiment of absolute comfort and unquestioning \nkindness. Along with the top notch medical care they provided me, the \nnurses at Walter Reed literally breathed life back into my lungs, \nwashed me, brushed my teeth and went on search missions for the most \ncomfortable pillows available. As I often say, if there are any angels \nin heaven, they must be nurses.\n  Unfortunately, right now our country is facing a nursing shortage. \nThe American Hospital Association reported in July 2007 that United \nStates hospitals had an estimated 116,000 registered nurse vacancies as \nof December 2006. Despite the nurse shortage and efforts to increase \nthe pool of qualified nurses, schools of nursing struggle to increase \nstudent capacity. According to the American Association of Colleges of \nNursing, AACN, the U.S. nursing schools turned away nearly 43,000 \nqualified applicants in 2006 primarily due to an insufficient number of \nfaculty.\n  AACN reported in July 2006, a total of 637 faculty vacancies at 329 \nnursing schools with baccalaureate or graduate programs, or both, \nacross the Nation. Besides the vacancies, schools cited the need to \ncreate an additional 55 faculty positions to accommodate student \ndemand. Most of the vacancies, approximately 53.7 percent, were faculty \npositions requiring a doctoral degree.\n  The average ages of doctorally prepared nurse faculty holding the \nranks of professor, associate professor and assistant professor are \n58.6, 55.8, and 51.6 years, respectively. Considering the average age \nof nurse faculty at retirement is 62.5 years, a wave of nurse faculty \nretirements is expected in the next decade. In fact, in 2007 the \nAssociation of Academic Health Centers surveyed chief executive \nofficers from academic health centers regarding faculty shortages \nacross various health professions. The CEOs rated the nursing faculty \nshortage as the most severe of all health professions with 81 percent \nnoting the nursing faculty shortage as a problem.\n  To address this nurse faculty shortage and to get more nurses \ntrained, this bill provides three mechanisms to increase the number of \nand access to nurse faculty.\n  First, the bill establishes a grant program to help schools establish \ndoctoral nursing programs. Right now, there are 8 States, including my \nhome State of Delaware, which do not have a doctoral nursing program in \ntheir State. This bill allows eligible schools to receive a grant up to \n$2,000,000 to be used to establish a doctoral degree program. The funds \ncan be used to hire administrators, faculty and staff; retain current \nfaculty; develop doctoral curriculum; repair and expand \ninfrastructures; purchase additional equipment; develop and enhance \nclinical laboratories; recruit students; establish technology \ninfrastructures; and other investments deemed necessary.\n  Second, this bill establishes a doctoral nursing consortia pilot \nproject to provide grants to partnerships of schools to allow them to \nshare doctoral faculty and programmatic resources. This would allow \nschools with a shortage of faculty at the doctoral level to partner \nwith other schools to provide proper education for their students. \nThese grants can be awarded up to $500,000 and can be used to establish \ntechnology infrastructures; develop shared doctoral curriculum; hire \nfaculty and staff; retain current faculty; provide travel stipends for \nnursing faculty who agree to teach nursing courses at consortium \nschools; provide scholarships for post-doctoral fellows who agree to \nteach a nursing course within the nursing doctoral curriculum; provide \ncollaborative networks for nursing research; and other investments \ndetermined necessary.\n  Third, I am pleased to include a nurse faculty pilot project that was \npart of the Nurse Faculty Higher Education Act introduced in the House \nof Representatives by Representative Carolyn McCarthy. This pilot \nproject would provide grants to partnerships between accredited schools \nof nursing and hospitals or health facilities to fund release time for \nqualified nurse employees so they can earn a salary while obtaining an \nadvanced degree in nursing with the goal of becoming nurse faculty. In \nshort, this will make it easier for nurses to pursue an advanced degree \nby allowing them to work part time and retain some of their salary. \nMany nurses currently cannot afford to leave their jobs to go back to \nschool because they would lose their salaries.\n  In addition to these three provisions, the bill also amends the \nPublic Health Service Act to provide that, in the case of a nurse \nfaculty shortage, the Secretary of Health and Human Services\n\n[[Page S13441]]\n\nmay obligate more than 10 percent of traineeships through the Advanced \nEducation Nursing Grants for individuals in doctoral degree nursing \nprograms. This is important to help advance nursing education and allow \ngreater funding opportunities for doctoral students.\n  But while this bill focuses heavily on increasing the number of nurse \nfaculty to allow nursing schools to train more nurses, it also seeks to \nhelp nursing students as well.\n  First, the bill explicitly includes accelerated degree nursing \nstudents as eligible for financial assistance through nursing programs \nin the Public Health Service Act, including the Nursing Student Loan \nProgram. To address the shortage of qualified nurses, schools of \nnursing have developed accelerated, second-baccalaureate degree \nprograms in nursing. Students in accelerated degree programs are those \nwith a baccalaureate degree in another field who have decided to return \nto school to get a degree in nursing. The students in these programs \nhave difficulty securing federal funding as this program category is \nnot easily defined. Accelerated nursing degree programs are not typical \n4-year baccalaureate degree programs, as they take between 1 and 2 \nyears to complete. However, they are becoming increasingly popular. In \n2005, these programs graduated 3,769 students. In 2006 they graduated \n5,236--an additional 1,467 nursing graduates in a single year. \nHospitals and other health facilities like hiring graduates from \naccelerated nursing degree programs because they often have \ndemonstrated a record of success and work-ethic that facilitates a more \nrapid and smooth transition in to the highly complex health care \nenvironment. Accelerated nursing degree students are a critical element \nto meeting this country's nursing needs.\n  Additionally, it is time to raise the yearly loan amounts available \nto all nursing students through the Nursing Student Loan Program. This \nimportant program, which provides long-term, low interest-rate loans to \nfull-time and half-time financially needy students pursuing a course of \nstudy leading to a diploma, associate, baccalaureate or graduate degree \nin nursing, has not adjusted the maximum yearly loan amounts available \nfor over a decade. Currently, a student can receive a maximum yearly \nloan of $2,500 for their first 2 years in a nursing school and $4,000 \nper year during their second 2 years. This bill would adjust these \ntotals to $4,400 in the first 2 years and $7,000 in the second 2 years, \nrespectively. It is time to raise the yearly loan amounts, as the cost \nof tuition at nursing schools has increased substantially over the past \ndecade.\n  It is imperative that we in Congress act to help alleviate the \nnursing shortage and the nurse faculty shortage in this country. Nurses \ncomprise the largest segment of health care providers in this country \nand they are crucial in ensuring the quality of care that Americans \nreceive. I believe the initiatives contained in the Nursing Education \nOpportunities Act can help reduce these shortages. The American Academy \nof Nursing, American Association of Colleges of Nursing, American \nNephrology Nurses' Association, American Nurses Association, American \nOrganization of Nurse Executives, Association of Women's Health, \nObstetric and Neonatal Nurses and the National League for Nursing all \nsupport this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2230\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Nursing Education \n     Opportunities Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The American Hospital Association reported in July 2007 \n     that United States hospitals need approximately 116,000 \n     registered nurses to fill vacant positions nationwide.\n       (2) To address the shortage of qualified nurses, schools of \n     nursing have developed accelerated, second-baccalaureate \n     degree programs in nursing. In 2005, these programs graduated \n     3,769 students. The number of accelerated degree graduates in \n     2006 was 5,236. This is an additional 1,467 nursing graduates \n     in 1 year.\n       (3) Despite the nurse shortage and efforts to increase the \n     pool of qualified nurses, schools of nursing struggle to \n     increase student capacity. According to the American \n     Association of Colleges of Nursing (referred to in this Act \n     as the ``AACN''), United States nursing schools turned away \n     nearly 43,000 qualified applicants in 2006 primarily due to \n     an insufficient number of faculty.\n       (4) The AACN reported in July 2006, a total of 637 faculty \n     vacancies at 329 nursing schools with baccalaureate or \n     graduate programs, or both, across the Nation. Besides the \n     vacancies, schools cited the need to create an additional 55 \n     faculty positions to accommodate student demand. Most of the \n     vacancies (53.7 percent) were faculty positions requiring a \n     doctoral degree.\n       (5) In 2007, the Association of Academic Health Centers \n     surveyed chief executive officers (CEOs) from academic health \n     centers regarding faculty shortages across various health \n     professions. The CEOs rated the nursing faculty shortage as \n     the most severe of all health professions with 81 percent \n     noting the nursing faculty shortage as a problem.\n       (6) The average ages of doctorally-prepared nurse faculty \n     holding the ranks of professor, associate professor, and \n     assistant professor are 58.6, 55.8, and 51.6 years, \n     respectively. Considering the average age of nurse faculty at \n     retirement is 62.5 years, a wave of nurse faculty retirements \n     is expected in the next decade.\n       (7) Master's and doctoral programs in nursing are not \n     producing a large enough pool of potential nurse educators to \n     meet the demand. In 2006, the AACN found that graduations \n     from doctoral nursing programs were up by only 1.4 percent \n     from the previous academic year.\n       (8) Nurses are vital to the Nation's health care delivery \n     system. Due to the nurse shortage, patient safety and quality \n     of care are at risk. Given the findings described in \n     paragraphs (1) through (7), measures must be taken to address \n     the nurse shortage and nursing faculty shortage.\n\n     SEC. 3. NURSING STUDENT LOAN PROGRAM.\n\n       Title VIII of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 296 \n     et seq.) is amended--\n       (1) in section 835(b)(4), by inserting ``(including a \n     student in an accelerated nursing degree program who is \n     pursuing a second baccalaureate degree or a master's degree \n     as an entry level nursing degree)'' after ``graduate degree \n     in nursing''; and\n       (2) in section 836--\n       (A) in subsection (a)--\n       (i) by striking ``$2,500'' and inserting ``$4,400'';\n       (ii) by striking ``$4,000'' and inserting ``$7,000''; and\n       (iii) by striking ``$13,000'' and inserting ``$22,900''; \n     and\n       (B) in subsection (b)--\n       (i) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``(including a student \n     in an accelerated nursing degree program who is pursuing a \n     second baccalaureate degree or a master's degree as an entry \n     level nursing degree)'' after ``graduate degree in nursing''; \n     and\n       (ii) in paragraph (2), by inserting ``(including a student \n     in an accelerated nursing degree program who is pursuing a \n     second baccalaureate degree)'' after ``equivalent degree''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Richard Cheney,\n     President of the Senate, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: The Administration is pleased to \n     forward the enclosed draft legislation, titled the \n     ``Cooperative Conservation Enhancement Act,'' for your \n     consideration. The draft legislation is intended to advance \n     the Department of the Interior's successful model of \n     cooperative conservation in several ways. First, it will \n     ensure clear, but flexible statutory authority for programs \n     that are currently carried out by the Department but are \n     generally authorized under many disparate authorities. \n     Second, the bill seeks to expand the use of cooperative \n     conservation by providing the Secretary of the Interior with \n     new authorities that will assist the Department in promoting \n     conservation partnerships with private individuals, \n     companies, and organizations and government entities; promote \n     conservation partnership capacity building; and authorize the \n     use of collaborative problem solving and alternative dispute \n     resolution in the Department's bureaus and offices.\n       This draft legislation represents a major step forward for \n     the Department's cooperative conservation efforts. If \n     enacted, this new authority will reduce barriers to the use \n     of partnerships in meeting our resource management \n     obligations, and will enhance our collaborative efforts to \n     conserve and protect natural resources and the environment \n     for which the Department is responsible.\n       To assist you in your review of the draft legislation, we \n     have enclosed a section-by-section analysis for the proposed \n     bill. The Administration recommends that the draft bill be \n     sent to the appropriate committee for consideration and that \n     it be enacted.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection to the submission of this proposal from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n     P. Lynn Scarlett.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                           Sectional Analysis\n\n       The purposes of this bill are to authorize programs and \n     activities that will strengthen and advance the Department of \n     the Interior's cooperative conservation efforts and reduce\n\n[[Page S13447]]\n\n     barriers to the use of partnerships in meeting resource \n     management obligations.\n       Generally, the proposal seeks to strengthen and advance the \n     Department's successful model of cooperative conservation by \n     ensuring clear, but flexible statutory authority for programs \n     that are currently carried out by the Department but \n     generally authorized under many disparate authorities. The \n     bill also seeks to expand the use of cooperative conservation \n     by providing the Secretary of the Interior with new \n     authorities that will assist the Department in promoting \n     conservation partnerships with private individuals, \n     government entities, and organizations; promote conservation \n     partnership capacity building; and authorize the use of \n     collaborative problem solving and alternative dispute \n     resolution in the Department's bureaus and offices.\n\n\n                         SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE\n\n       This section states that the short title for the bill is \n     the ``Cooperative Conservation Enhancement Act.''\n\n\n                    SECTION 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES\n\n       This section sets forth congressional findings and \n     purposes.\n\n\n                         SECTION 3. DEFINITIONS\n\n       Section 3 sets out several definitions for terms that are \n     used throughout the bill. The term ``cooperative \n     conservation'' is defined as actions that relate to the use, \n     enhancement, and enjoyment of natural resources, protection \n     of the environment, or both, and that involve collaborative \n     activity among federal, state, local, and tribal governments, \n     private for-profit and non-profit institutions, other non-\n     governmental entities, or individuals. The term \n     ``Department'' is used throughout the bill to reference the \n     Department of the Interior. Finally, the term ``Secretary'' \n     means the Secretary of the Interior.\n\n                  Title I--Working Landscape Projects\n\n       According to the Department's partners, one of the \n     difficult hurdles for cooperative conservation projects that \n     involve multiple partners or which require coordination \n     across jurisdictions is securing funding for administrative-\n     type costs. These costs might include costs associated with \n     governance, such as the hiring of an executive director, or \n     costs of support services or dissemination of information.\n       Title I of the bill would provide the Secretary with \n     authority, for a three-year period, to establish a consistent \n     stream of such funding, to be awarded competitively and for a \n     period of up to three years for any given project, for \n     projects authorized under existing authorities that support \n     innovative approaches to cooperative conservation.\n\n\n                        SECTION 101. SHORT TITLE\n\n       The short title of this provision is the ``Working \n     Landscape Projects Act of 2007.''\n\n\n                        SECTION 102. DEFINITIONS\n\n       Section 102 provides definitions for certain terms used \n     throughout this title. The term `administrative services' is \n     defined to include services and costs associated with the \n     operations of activities authorized under this title. It is \n     intended that such services and costs include, but not be \n     limited to, things like meeting announcements, copying, \n     personnel costs and reasonable rental costs for facilities \n     necessary for implementing this title. It is also intended \n     that services and costs under this title shall be consistent \n     with any applicable federal rules, regulations, and guidance. \n     The term `information dissemination activities' is defined to \n     include broadcasting the announcement of meetings and the \n     distribution of reports, memos, and other relevant \n     information necessary for carrying out the authorities under \n     this title.\n       `Governance activities' are defined as those activities \n     required to ensure the operation and implementation of \n     projects including, but not limited to, hiring personnel to \n     coordinate project implementation; providing oversight and \n     monitoring of projects and project goals; performing adaptive \n     management techniques on projects; coordinating activities \n     with various partners; performing scientific oversight of \n     projects, including commissioning scientific studies; and \n     requesting data from federal, state, and local government \n     officials, non-profit organizations, and private individuals. \n     Finally, the term `landscape project partner' is a \n     representative of federal, state, or tribal governments, \n     private landowners or corporations, or those of non-profit \n     organizations.\n\n\nSEC. 103. AUTHORIZATION FOR ADMINISTRATIVE, GOVERNANCE, AND INFORMATION \n                         DISSEMINATION PURPOSES\n\n       Section 103 would authorize the Secretary of the Interior \n     to provide funds through a competitive process for the \n     development or maintenance of necessary administrative \n     requirements, including, but not limited to, costs associated \n     with governance, support services, and dissemination of \n     information associated with projects that feature innovative \n     approaches to cooperative conservation.\n       Funding for any particular project would be limited to \n     three years, and to qualify for such administrative funding, \n     a project must include participation by a diverse group of \n     partners, including government entities, must affect several \n     jurisdictions or land ownerships, and must have the potential \n     to advance cooperative conservation across a geographical \n     area.\n       Projects that receive funding under this provision may \n     include established projects with a record of success; \n     existing projects that are in their early stages and require \n     sustained capacity building; or new or proposed projects that \n     have developed a plan for establishing partnerships and \n     developing landscape-based projects. Section 103 also \n     enumerates certain listed criteria that the projects must \n     meet, and would establish the position of Conservation \n     Project Coordinator, who would serve as the primary federal \n     coordinator of projects that receive funding under this \n     section and whose responsibility it would be to oversee and \n     encourage such projects such that they are reviewed and \n     executed expeditiously. The Coordinator would also be \n     authorized to carry out such other cooperative conservation \n     related activities and projects as the Secretary deems \n     appropriate. All actions undertaken by the Coordinator must \n     be related to the authorized programs and activities of the \n     Department of the Interior.\n\n\n                          SECTION 104. FUNDING\n\n       Section 104 sets out the mechanism by which the \n     administrative costs awarded under this title would be \n     funded. The Secretary would be authorized to use funds \n     identified in the President's annual budget submission as \n     Cooperative Conservation Programs. Examples of such programs \n     that have been so identified in past budgets include the \n     Department's Challenge Cost Share Program, authorized by \n     section 502 of this legislation, or the U.S. Fish and \n     Wildlife Service's Coastal Program, authorized by section 501 \n     of this legislation. These funds would, in turn, be made \n     available to the Secretary in amounts of up to 5 percent of \n     those total funds for FY 2008; up to 6 percent in FY 2009; \n     and up to 7 percent in FY 2010, and will be used, for \n     example, for the costs associated with governance, such as \n     the hiring of an executive director, or costs of support \n     services or dissemination of information.\n\n          Title II--Landowner Conservation Assistance Matters\n\n       In order to encourage landowners to participate as citizen \n     stewards in protecting endangered and threatened species, \n     species proposed for listing under the Endangered Species Act \n     of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), and candidate species, this \n     proposal would authorize a conservation banking program \n     within the Department of the Interior.\n\n\n  SECTION 201. ESTABLISHMENT, USE, AND OPERATION OF CONSERVATION BANKS\n\n       In May 2003, the FWS administratively issued its ``Guidance \n     on the Establishment, Use, and Operation of Conservation \n     Banks.'' That document recognized that conservation banks can \n     benefit the Service--by reducing a piecemeal approach to \n     conservation by promoting the establishment of larger \n     reserves and habitat connectivity--as well as landowners--who \n     benefit from its relative ease of use, flexibility, and \n     opportunity to generate income from what may previously have \n     been considered a liability. Banking also allows a public/\n     private collaboration to maintain lands as open space, \n     providing for the conservation of listed and candidate \n     species.\n       Section 201 would establish within the FWS a conservation \n     banking program. It defines certain important terms, \n     including ``bank operator,'' ``bank sponsor,'' ``conservation \n     bank,'' ``conservation bank agreement,'' ``conservation bank \n     review team,'' and ``credit.'' The proposal would authorize \n     the Secretary to select and convene a ``Conservation Bank \n     Review Team,'' an interagency group that may include federal, \n     state, tribal and local regulatory and resource agency \n     representatives, to evaluate for acceptance proposals \n     received from bank sponsors. Section 201 provides that if the \n     Conservation Bank Review Team recommends a proposal, it shall \n     present the proposal to the Secretary, who may modify or \n     accept the proposal. Once it has been accepted, the Secretary \n     may enter into a conservation bank agreement and is \n     responsible for establishing the terms under which the \n     conservation bank will operate.\n       This section also contains criteria to be used in \n     determining whether to approve a conservation bank proposal, \n     including whether the bank would provide an economically \n     effective process providing options to landowners to offset \n     the adverse effects of projects to species covered by the \n     bank; whether it would provide adequate mitigation for \n     species through appropriate actions; and whether it would be \n     of sufficient size to ensure the maintenance of ecological \n     integrity in perpetuity. The proposal includes requirements \n     that must be contained in bank proposals that have been \n     accepted.\n       Finally, in order to ensure the enforceability of \n     agreements entered into under this section, the proposal \n     contains a provision authorizing any party to an agreement to \n     bring an action for violation of an agreement in the U.S. \n     District Court for the District of Columbia.\n\n                   Title III--Promoting Partnerships\n\n       Title III of the proposal would provide mechanisms for \n     increasing the use of cooperative conservation by providing \n     the Secretary of the Interior with new authorities that will \n     assist the Department in promoting conservation partnerships \n     with private individuals, government entities, and \n     organizations, and provide the Department increased \n     flexibility in working with partners and the ability to \n     publicize partnership programs using appropriated funds.\n       In some cases, the provisions in Title III are intended to \n     clarify areas of law where general authority is believed to \n     exist within a particular bureau, but which would benefit\n\n[[Page S13448]]\n\n     from clarification. In other cases, the provisions of this \n     title are intended to provide application of a particular \n     provision uniformly across the Department's land managing \n     bureaus.\n\n\n             SECTION 301. COOPERATION WITH OUTSIDE ENTITIES\n\n       Section 301 would authorize the Secretary or designated \n     bureau official to provide assistance to and cooperate with \n     any agency, organization, or private individual in order to \n     carry out measures that clearly and directly contribute to \n     achieving conservation or natural resource management-related \n     mission and performance goals of the Department and its \n     bureaus. The section would also authorize Departmental \n     bureaus to accept donations of land and interests in land \n     that further the purposes of this section. This language \n     is intended to provide to bureaus across the Department \n     authority similar to that provided to the Secretary in the \n     Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act.\n\n\n   SECTION 302. ABILITY TO EXPEND FUNDS TO BENEFIT DEPARTMENT LANDS.\n\n       Because it is not clear that all of the Department's \n     bureaus enjoy this authority, section 302 would authorize the \n     Secretary or his designee to carry out activities on non-\n     federal lands that directly benefit the resource values and \n     management of federal lands, such as the preservation, \n     conservation, and restoration of coastal and riparian \n     systems, watersheds, and wetlands; the prevention, control, \n     or eradication of invasive species that occupy adjacent non-\n     federal lands; or the restoration of natural resources, \n     including native wildlife habitat.\n       Activities authorized by this section could only be \n     conducted with the written consent of the landowner, and must \n     clearly and directly benefit the specific Departmental land \n     management unit by directly contributing to the programmatic \n     and performance goals of that unit. Eligible activities would \n     not include the construction of permanent capital \n     improvements or the acquisition of land.\n       Finally, in order to ensure that the specific language of \n     section 302 does not limit the application of the \n     Department's other grant-making and other landowner \n     assistance provisions authorized in title V of this Act, the \n     language of section 302 makes clear that nothing in this \n     section supersedes or otherwise affects or alters the \n     authority provided in that title.\n\n\n  SECTION 303. PUBLICIZING AND PROVIDING NON-FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO \n                             PARTNERSHIPS.\n\n       In order to assist our partners and to provide clarity to \n     an issue that has caused confusion within the Department's \n     bureaus, section 303 would authorize the Secretary or his \n     designee to use appropriated funds to publicize partnership \n     programs and opportunities through publication of \n     announcements in newspapers of general circulation, in the \n     Federal Register, or such other appropriate methods. It would \n     also allow the Department to provide non-financial assistance \n     to private individuals who are establishing nonprofit groups \n     that are intended to support the mission of a Departmental \n     bureau or management unit of a bureau, such as a particular \n     park or refuge. For example, this provision would make it \n     clear that the National Park Service may provide meeting \n     space to individuals interested in establishing a ``friends \n     of the park'' group for a particular park unit.\n       The provision specifically would not allow a Department \n     employee to establish a not-for-profit or other entity to \n     support the Department's mission, and nothing in this section \n     would waive the application of the provision of the Anti-\n     Lobbying Act (18 U.S.C. 1913).\n\n\n      SECTION 304. CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE FOR PARTNERSHIP LEARNING.\n\n       Cooperative Conservation is critical to the Department's \n     ability to achieve its conservation goals on a landscape \n     scale and resolve environmental and natural resources \n     disputes. Consistent with President Bush's 2004 Executive \n     Order titled ``Facilitation of Cooperative Conservation,'' \n     which directs federal agencies to implement laws relating to \n     the environment and natural resources in a manner that \n     promotes cooperative conservation, section 304 authorizes a \n     number of sites where federal employees and their partners, \n     including state and local government employees, non-profit \n     employees, private sector employees, and employees of Indian \n     tribes, could experience and learn from resident experts the \n     best practices involved in creating successful partnerships \n     and fostering collaboration.\n       For clarity, section 304 contains a definition of ``Center \n     of Excellence for Partnership Learning'' or ``Center,'' which \n     means a federal facility that is identified by the \n     appropriate Secretary as meeting criteria established under \n     this section and which provides federal employees and their \n     partners the opportunity to learn cooperative conservation-\n     related best practices.\n       Each site is authorized to develop a schedule of hosting \n     activities, which could include some combination of visits, \n     formal courses, detail opportunities, or job swaps at various \n     times throughout the year. To the maximum extent practicable, \n     spaces in the program would be filled on a first-come, first-\n     served basis. Section 304 includes criteria for identifying \n     sites that would serve as Centers of Excellence for \n     Partnership Learning, and allows each Center to receive \n     funding reimbursement for the cost of running the program. \n     Each Center would be authorized to cover travel and other \n     incidental expenses of federal employee participants.\n\n\n                    SECTION 305. PARTNERSHIP ROSTER.\n\n       Section 305 authorizes the Secretaries of the Interior and \n     Agriculture to establish a multi-agency roster to enhance \n     capacity for partnership and collaborative action. The goal \n     of the Roster is to provide non-financial assistance and \n     information to government agencies, private sector \n     organizations, and the public on a variety of issues, \n     including authorities, agreements and contracts, creating and \n     managing non-profit support groups, diversifying and \n     strengthening agency funding, developing a partnership \n     workplace, building community connections, citizen \n     engagement, allowable avenues for donor recognition, \n     communications, conflict management, and collaborative \n     management.\n\n              Title IV--Cooperation Among Federal Agencies\n\n\n                 SECTION 401. SERVICE FIRST AUTHORITY.\n\n       Section 401 provides permanent authorization for the \n     Service First Initiative, a multi-agency program jointly \n     implemented by the Departments of the Interior and the \n     Department of Agriculture's Forest Service. That program was \n     last authorized in the Department's FY 2006 Appropriations \n     legislation. Under this provision, the Secretary of the \n     Interior, acting through the Bureau of Land Management, \n     the National Park Service, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \n     Service, and the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through \n     the U.S. Forest Service, are authorized to conduct \n     projects, planning, permitting, leasing, contracting and \n     other activities, either jointly or on behalf of one \n     another; co-locate in federal offices and facilities owned \n     or leased by an agency of either Department; promulgate \n     special rules for issuance of unified permits, \n     applications, and leases; and share or transfer equipment, \n     vehicles, or other personal property.\n       The Secretaries may also make reciprocal delegations of \n     their respective authorities, duties and responsibilities in \n     support of the activities authorized in this section in order \n     to promote customer service and efficiency.\n\n\n                        SEC. 402. USE OF FUNDS.\n\n       Section 402 provides a mechanism by which the Secretaries \n     may, in carrying out the provisions of this title, make \n     transfers of funds available and reimbursement of funds on an \n     annual basis among the Bureau of Land Management, the \n     National Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, \n     and the U.S. Forest Service, including transfers and \n     reimbursements for multi-year projects that involve one or \n     more of those agencies. In so doing, however, the Secretaries \n     may not circumvent other requirements and limitations imposed \n     on the use of funds.\n\n\n                        SEC. 403. CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       Section 403 clarifies that nothing in title IV is intended \n     to alter, expand or limit the applicability of any public law \n     or regulation to lands administered by the participating \n     agencies of either Department.\n\n                    Title V--Cooperative Assistance\n\n\n        SECTION 501. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE COASTAL PROGRAM.\n\n       The FWS's Coastal Program was created by administrative \n     action, rather than by statute, relying on a number of \n     authorities, including the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act \n     (16 U.S.C. 661-667e), the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 \n     U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 703 et seq.), and the Coastal Barriers Resources Act \n     (16 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.).\n       Section 501 would provide specific statutory authorization \n     for the Secretary of the Interior to carry out the Fish and \n     Wildlife Service Coastal Program within the FWS. Assistance \n     would be used by coastal program partners for, among other \n     things, conservation and restoration of important coastal \n     habitat that supports ``priority'' species, including \n     threatened and endangered species, fishery resources under \n     the Department's jurisdiction, and migratory birds.\n       To ensure that the programs carried out under this \n     authority are coordinated with other programs within the \n     Administration that benefit coastal areas, the section \n     contains a provision requiring that the Secretary, where \n     appropriate, coordinate with other interested federal \n     agencies on the program authorized under this section.\n\n\n      SECTION 502. COOPERATIVE CONSERVATION CHALLENGE COST-SHARE.\n\n       Section 502 authorizes the Secretary, through the U.S. Fish \n     and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Land Management, or the \n     National Park Service, to negotiate and enter into \n     cooperative arrangements--partnerships--with state or local \n     governments, Indian tribes, public or private agencies, \n     organizations, institutions, corporations, individuals, or \n     other entities to carry out on a public-private cost sharing \n     basis on-the-ground conservation activities on public or \n     private lands. The language contains certain requirements for \n     projects carried out on private lands, and specifies that the \n     federal share for a project may not exceed 50 percent and \n     shall be provided on a matching basis. The non-federal share \n     for a project may be in the form of cash, services, or in-\n     kind contributions.\n       Finally, the language makes clear that nothing in this \n     section is intended to supersede, modify, or repeal existing \n     laws providing additional cost-share authorities to \n     Department bureaus.\n\n[[Page S13449]]\n\n             SECTION 503. WATER MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT ACT.\n\n       Section 503 authorizes the Secretary to enter into grants \n     and cooperative agreements with states, tribes, irrigation \n     districts, water districts, or other organizations with water \n     delivery authority to fund up to 50 percent of the cost of \n     planning, designing, constructing, or otherwise implementing \n     improvements that will conserve water, increase water use \n     efficiency, facilitate water markets, enhance water \n     management, or implement other actions to prevent water-\n     related crises or conflicts in watersheds that have a nexus \n     to federal water projects within the states identified in the \n     Reclamation Act of 1902.\n       The purpose of this section is to give Reclamation \n     permanent authority for the competitive grants program that \n     is a central element of Reclamation's ``Water 2025'' program. \n     The program is intended to apply to watersheds containing or \n     receiving water from, or hydrologically impacted by, not only \n     Bureau of Reclamation projects, but other federal projects as \n     well, including but not limited to those of the U.S. Army \n     Corps of Engineers, the Environmental Protection Agency, and \n     the Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources \n     Conservation Service.\n       The authority may be used to promote partnership on any \n     action that would achieve the Water 2025 program goal of \n     preventing water-related crisis and conflict. Illustrative \n     examples include actions to enhance water management, such as \n     canal lining and piping, installation of measuring devices to \n     control water or water management technology such as \n     automation, or actions that improve riparian habitat. The \n     program aims to promote cooperation between the different \n     interests within a watershed. Recipients of Water 2025 \n     awards are encouraged to enter into partnerships with \n     other entities, including governmental entities or \n     community organizations without water delivery authority, \n     so long as the recipient of the grant or cooperative \n     agreement is a state, tribe, irrigation district, water \n     district, or other organization with water delivery \n     authority. In instances where grant partners are states, \n     funds will be disbursed in conformance with the Cash \n     Management Improvement Act (P.L. 101-453 as amended by \n     P.L. 102-589).\n       Agreements entered into pursuant to this authority must \n     comply with the following criteria:\n       (1) Funding for improvements to federally-owned facilities \n     may be provided on a non-reimbursable basis to an entity \n     operating affected transferred works or may be deemed non-\n     reimbursable for non-transferred works. Language regarding \n     reimbursability is necessary to distinguish this authority \n     from some other Bureau of Reclamation authorities, which \n     often require that project beneficiaries reimburse the \n     federal government for its investment.\n       (2) Title to improvements made to federally-owned \n     facilities shall be held by the United States. This does not \n     preclude title to an entire project being transferred to non-\n     federal entities at a later date.\n       (3) Non-federal cost-share contributions can include the \n     value of any in-kind contributions, but may not include funds \n     from other federal agencies. In-kind contributions should \n     materially contribute to the completion of the proposed \n     action, and should be in compliance with Reclamation \n     standards regarding allowable contributions.\n       (4) The cost of operating and maintaining such improvements \n     shall be the responsibility of the non-federal entity. This \n     is consistent with existing practice for most Reclamation \n     facilities, where local project partners are responsible for \n     either reimbursing Reclamation for operating and maintaining \n     the facilities, or directly financing those activities \n     themselves.\n       (5) The United States shall not be held liable for monetary \n     damages arising out of any occurrence relating to non-\n     federally owned facilities created or improved under this \n     section, except for damages caused by acts of negligence.\n       It is intended that these provisions shall not supersede \n     any existing project-specific funding authority.\n       The Secretary is also authorized to enter into cooperative \n     agreements with universities, non-profit research \n     institutions, or organizations with water or power delivery \n     authority to fund research on ways to conserve water, \n     increase water use efficiency, or enhance water management \n     under such terms and conditions as the Secretary deems \n     appropriate. This provision is intended to provide \n     Reclamation broader authority to enter into cooperative \n     agreements on research that advances achievement of \n     Reclamation's core mission areas, and which is consistent \n     with the Administration's Research and Development criteria. \n     It is not intended to apply only to Reclamation's Water 2025 \n     program, but to apply to all of Reclamation's research and \n     development efforts.\n       Grants or cooperative agreements made pursuant to this \n     section may be for the mutual benefit of the United States \n     and the other party, in contrast to agreements entered into \n     under provisions of the Federal Grant and Cooperative \n     Agreement Act of 1977, 31 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 6304-6305, which \n     restrict the use of grant or cooperative agreements to \n     relationships in which the principal purpose is to benefit \n     the non-federal party.\n       The legislation provides for a $100 million authorization \n     of appropriations to carry out the section, to remain \n     available until expended.\n       Finally, the language makes clear that this section would \n     amend and supplement the Act of June 17, 1902, as amended and \n     supplemented.\n\n\n              SECTION 504. CONSULTATION WITH STATE PLANS.\n\n       Section 504 would require the Secretary, where appropriate, \n     to consult the State Comprehensive Conservation Plans \n     required under the State and Tribal Wildlife Grant Program \n     and coordinate with state fish and wildlife agencies in the \n     planning and implementation of the actions identified in \n     those plans in evaluating proposals for wildlife conservation \n     grants under programs administered by the Department.\n\n                     Title VI--Conflict Resolution\n\n\n          SECTION 601. ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION OFFICE.\n\n       Section 601 would establish in the Department the Office of \n     Collaborative Action and Dispute Resolution, which would be \n     responsible for promoting and advancing the use of \n     collaborative problem-solving and alternative dispute \n     resolution activities in all Departmental bureaus and \n     offices. The Office would be tasked with increasing the use \n     of early consensus building, alternative dispute resolution, \n     and negotiated rulemakings. The section authorizes such sums \n     as are necessary to carry out the program.\n\n                  Title VII--Miscellaneous Provisions\n\n       In order to ensure clarity and flexibility in implementing \n     this Act, the bill contains a savings provision, which makes \n     clear that the provisions contained in this bill are not \n     intended to supersede any provision of state or federal law; \n     a severability provision, which will ensure the operation of \n     the Act if a particular provision is successfully challenged; \n     and a general authorization to promulgate any regulations \n     necessary to carry out the terms of the Act.\n                                              The Deputy Secretary\n\n\n                                              of the Interior,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 19, 2007.\n     Hon. Richard Cheney,\n     President of the Senate,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: The Administration is pleased to \n     forward the enclosed draft legislation, title the \n     ``Cooperative Conservation Enhancement Act,'' for your \n     consideration. The draft legislation is intended to advance \n     the Department of the Interior's successful model of \n     cooperative conservation in several ways. First, it will \n     ensure clear, but flexible statutory authority for programs \n     that are currently carried out by the Department but are \n     generally authorized under many disparate authorities. \n     Second, the bill seeks to expand the use of cooperative \n     conservation by providing the Secretary of the Interior with \n     new authorities that will assist the Department in promoting \n     conservation partnerships with private individuals, \n     companies, and organizations and government entities; promote \n     conservation partnership capacity building; and authorize the \n     use of collaborative problem solving and alternative dispute \n     resolution in the Department's bureaus and offices.\n       This draft legislation represents a major step forward for \n     the Department's cooperative conservation efforts. If \n     enacted, this new authority will reduce barriers to the use \n     of partnerships in meeting our resource management \n     obligations, and will enhance our collaborative efforts to \n     conserve and protect natural resources and the environment \n     for which the Department is responsible.\n       To assist you in your review of the draft legislation, we \n     have enclosed a section-by-section analysis for the proposed \n     bill. The Administration recommends that the draft bill be \n     sent to the appropriate committee for consideration and that \n     it be enacted.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection to the submission of this proposal from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 P. Lynn Scarlett.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. STEVENS (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Ms. Murkowski, and Mr. \n        Akaka):\n  S. 2232. A bill to direct the Secretary of Commerce to establish a \ndemonstration program to adapt the lessons of providing foreign aid to \nunderdeveloped economies to the provision of Federal economic \ndevelopment assistance to certain similarly situated individuals, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Foreign Aid \nLessons for Domestic Economic Assistance Act of 2007 to bring a fresh \napproach to the vexing problem of stimulating Alaska Native, Native \nHawaiian and Lower-48 Indian Tribe economies to bring jobs, hope and \ninvestment to these impoverished peoples.\n  Despite modest improvements in the economic and social well-being of \nAlaska's native people, they continue to have extremely high rates of \nunemployment and poverty, poor health, substandard housing, and the \nrelated ills of alcohol and drug abuse.\n  Only 11 percent of American Indians and Alaska Natives hold a \nbachelor's degree compared to 24 percent of the total population. The \npoverty rate in\n\n[[Page S13450]]\n\n1999 was 25.7 percent for the American Indian and Alaska Native \npopulation, compared to 12.4 percent of the total population.\n  Weak economies also contribute to poor health in native communities: \nAmerican Indian and Alaska Natives suffer from significantly higher \nmortality rates compared to the general population. The death rate for \nAmerican Indians and Alaska Natives for tuberculosis is 600 percent \nhigher, 510 percent higher for alcoholism, 229 percent higher for motor \nvehicle crashes, 189 percent higher for diabetes, 61 percent higher for \nhomicide and 62 percent higher for suicide. American Indian and Alaska \nNative infants die at a rate of 8.5 per every 1,000 live births, \ncompared to 6.8 per 1,000 for all U.S. races.\n  Housing statistics are no better--12 percent of American Indian and \nAlaska Native homes lack safe and adequate water supply and waste \ndisposal facilities compared to one percent of the U.S. general \npopulation.\n  This is the profile of native communities in Alaska, and in the \nlower-48 states as well, despite a vibrant cultural legacy and abundant \nnatural resources on and under their lands and in their waters. Many \nnative communities have marketable timber, huge reserves of coal, \nnatural gas, oil, fish and shellfish and other natural amenities.\n  At the same time, native economies are hobbled by geographic \nremoteness, distance from markets and population centers, poor physical \ninfrastructure, and a lack of governmental transparency, contributing \nto stagnating Native American economies.\n  Because native economies are often plagued by the same challenges as \nthe economies of the developing world, native economies are likely to \nbenefit from the application of proven models employed in international \ndevelopment efforts, most notably the Millenium Challenge Act of 2003. \nThis initiative aims to foster those policies that are known to be \neffective and in the process, reduce poverty and promote sustainable \neconomic growth in the host country. Typically, the activities that are \nassisted are related to agriculture, irrigation, and related land \npractices; physical infrastructure development to facilitate marketing \nof goods and services; and a variety of health care programs.\n  Similarly, the objectives of the legislation I am introducing today \nare just as straightforward: enhancing the long-term job creation and \nrevenue generation potential of Native economies by creating \ninvestment-favorable climates and increasing Native productivity.\n  The Foreign Aid Lessons for Domestic Economic Assistance Act would \nalso authorize administering federal economic development assistance in \na novel manner to promote economic growth, eliminate poverty, and \nstrengthen good governance, entrepreneurship, and investment in native \ncommunities.\n  A corollary, but equally important, objective is to improve the \neffectiveness of existing Federal economic development assistance by \nencouraging the integration and coordination of such assistance to \nbenefit Native economies. Accordingly, this legislation requires that \nany assistance provided must be coordinated with other Federal economic \ndevelopment assistance programs for Native Americans.\n  A critical component of the Foreign Aid Lessons for Domestic Economic \nAssistance Demonstration is in its demand for accountability in the \nperformance of the Compact terms and use of financial resources. This \nlegislation requires that eligible entities submit to the Secretary of \nCommerce written reports on an annual basis detailing activities \nundertaken and progress made through assistance from this program.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 2236. A bill to title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security \nAct of 1974, title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act, and the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide additional limitations on \npreexisting condition exclusions in group health plans and health \ninsurance coverage in the group and individual markets; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Pre-\nexisting Condition Exclusion Patient Protection Act of 2007. This is a \ncritical bill for the tens of millions of individuals who suffer from \nchronic, disabling, and life-threatening conditions, as it will ensure \nthat they have access to affordable, comprehensive, and meaningful \nhealth insurance coverage despite ``pre-existing conditions.''\n  The Centers for Disease Control & Prevention estimates that fully \none-third of all Americans will have a chronic, disabling, and life-\nthreatening condition at some time during their lifetimes. In West \nVirginia, that translates to approximately 600,000 of our neighbors who \nwill face these serious health problems. Far too often these are the \nvery people who find their health insurance coverage interrupted, \ncancelled, or denied because of pre-existing condition limitations in \ntheir health insurance policies.\n  That is why, over 10 years ago, Congress passed the Health Insurance \nPortability and Accountability Act of 1996, HIPAA, P.L. 104-191, with \nthe objective of protecting Americans from interruptions in health \ninsurance coverage resulting from job changes or other life \ntransitions. HIPAA provides this protection by restricting when private \ninsurers can use pre-existing conditions to limit health care coverage. \nHIPAA has been successful, and many individuals have come to rely on \nits protections. However, after more than a decade, certain gaps in \nHIPAA's protection have become apparent that hamper individuals' access \nto care for which they could be covered, but for their pre-existing \nconditions.\n  First, individuals who have been without health insurance coverage \nfor 63 days or more, risk becoming permanently uninsurable. This is \nparticularly true of individuals with pre-existing conditions, because \na 63-day gap in coverage eliminates any prior creditable coverage. If \nan employee cannot demonstrate that he or she had prior creditable and \ncontinuous coverage, an employer can exclude coverage for pre-existing \nconditions for up to 12 months.\n  Second, employers can restrict coverage for pre-existing conditions \nto otherwise qualified employees based on a 6-month ``look-back'' \nperiod. This means that an employer may use medical recommendations, \ndiagnoses, and treatments within the most recent 6 months to exclude \ncoverage as a ``pre-existing condition.'' This ``look-back'' period is \nsufficiently long that it likely impacts all Americans with at least \none chronic illness, a category that includes a staggering one out of \nevery three Americans, according to the Centers for Disease Control.\n  Third, the protections offered to individuals moving into a group \nhealth plan, or moving into the individual insurance market from a \ngroup plan, are not available to individuals attempting to shop around \nfor policies within the individual market. As a result, individuals who \npurchase policies in the non-group market and never have a gap in \ncoverage still have no protection against the pre-existing condition \nexclusions that insurers may choose to impose.\n  The Pre-existing Condition Exclusion Patient Protection Act of 2007 \ntakes significant steps to improve these weaknesses in the law, thereby \nprotecting patients who are currently at risk of being denied health \ninsurance coverage. To close the first gap in the law, the bill reduces \nthe timeframe during which an employer can exclude coverage for pre-\nexisting conditions from 12 months to three months. This would ensure \nthat more Americans have access to health insurance coverage; \nfurthermore, it is consistent with the requirements for ``state-\nqualified plans'' under the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform Act of \n2002.\n  To close the second HIPAA gap, this legislation shrinks the permitted \n``look-back'' period from 6 months to 30 days, which would result in a \ndecrease in the number of Americans who are unfairly denied health \ncoverage due to pre-existing conditions. Finally, the bill closes the \nthird gap by applying the same pre-existing condition protections \nafforded to individuals in the group health insurance market under \nHIPAA to individuals moving to, and within, the individual health \ninsurance market.\n  Passing this legislation would increase access to private health \ninsurance for the almost 94 million Americans who suffer from at least \none chronic illness. It also would ensure\n\n[[Page S13451]]\n\nthat the 158 million individuals who are insured through employer-based \nprivate plans and the more than 14 million individuals who are covered \nby non-group, private plans would have far better protection when \nchanging jobs or their health care plans.\n  I am confident that with these actions, we can achieve a significant \nimprovement in the access of Americans to health insurance coverage. \nFor this reason, I urge my colleagues to advance progress toward this \nimportant goal by supporting the Pre-existing Condition Exclusion \nPatient Protection Act of 2007.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2236\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to fight crime; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President. I rise to mark the introduction of the 2007 \nBiden Crime Bill because a perfect storm is gathering with respect to \ncrime in America, and we need bold action to get us back on track.\n  Before I discuss the specifics of my legislation, I want to talk to \nyou about what is feeding this perfect storm. Since 2001, Federal \nfunding for local law enforcement has been slashed by billions of \ndollars--from about $2,1 billion per year in the nineties to a proposed \nlevel of $32 million in 2007. The COPS hiring program has been \neliminated completely.\n  At the same time, President Bush has reassigned more than 1,000 FBI \nagents from fighting crime to combating terrorism. Certainly, this was \nnecessary, but he has not replaced them. A bitter irony results--we \nhave improved our ability to fight international terrorism, but left \nour communities here at home less safe from the threat of murderers, \nrapists, and drug kingpins.\n  This is the perfect storm: asking local law enforcement to do much \nmore for a growing population while giving them much less--less Federal \nfunding and fewer Federal agents with whom to partner. As a result, \nlocal law enforcement has had to give up crime prevention practices, \nlike community policing, in order to stay on top of rising demand. They \nare doing their level best, but they need more help.\n  Early stages of the storm are upon us. The FBI's Uniform Crime \nReports show a rise in violent crime and murder for the second straight \nyear. This hasn't happened since 1994. Last year, crime rose at the \nhighest rate it had in 15 years and this year we add another 1.9 \npercent increase.\n  The Police Executive Research Forum reports that the homicide rate \nrose more than 10 percent in metropolitan areas around the country, \nlike Baltimore, Boston, Charlotte, Cincinnati, Kansas City, \nand Philadphia. Don't believe the statistics? Just ask your local cops. \nThey will tell you they are seeing more crimes with a higher level of \nviolence.\n\n  Back in the nineties we faced a similar crime crisis. In 1994, \nCongress passed the Crime Bill, and it transformed the Federal approach \nto fighting crime. It used a three-part system: invest in prevention \nprograms, dedicate Federal support to community-oriented policing, and \nensure that offenders serve tough-but-fair prison sentences. It worked. \nCrime dropped for eight consecutive years. Violent crime and murder \nrates dropped more than 30 percent\n  The bill I introduced today is the most comprehensive crime bill in \nmore than a decade and it builds on the successful approach of the 1994 \nCrime Bill.\n\n[[Page S13452]]\n\nIt invests more than $6 billion in tried and true prevention programs \nthat recognize that the first step to fighting crime is protecting kids \nfrom neglect and abuse and providing them with a stable family, \npositive early education, and someplace safe and constructive to spend \nthe critical after-school hours.\n  My bill reauthorizes the COPS program and provides $1.15 billion per \nyear to hire, equip, and train 50,000 new police officers, and hire \nadditional local prosecutors. Study after study has demonstrated the \neffectiveness of the COPS program, and every major law enforcement \nagency in the country supports it. It is high time we started funding \nit again.\n  In addition, the bill provides funds to hire an additional 1,000 FBI \nagents dedicated to fighting crime and an additional 500 DEA agents \ndedicated to dismantling drug trafficking organizations. The Federal \nGovernment cannot make the trade-off between fighting crime and \nterrorism--we owe it to our citizens to do both.\n  The bill invests more than $1 billion in preventing recidivism by \nensuring that when prisoners are released into society, they have the \nvocational training, the drug treatment, and the housing they need to \nreintegrate as law-abiding, productive members. Currently, over 650,000 \nex-offenders are released from Federal and State prisons each year. \nWithin 3 years of release, two thirds will commit another crime. That \nis hundreds of thousands of crimes each year, and we need to bring that \nnumber down.\n\n  Finally, the bill addresses developments in crime fighting and in \ncriminal trade craft. Mr. President, 13 years ago, online sexual \npredators, Internet copyright infringement, and computer hacking were \nvirtually unknown. Today they are common crimes with real victims. This \nbill ensures that law enforcement has the resources and legal tools it \nneeds to prevent, investigate, and prosecute such crimes.\n  The bottom line is that fighting crime is like cutting grass--you \nstop mowing the lawn and one day you'll look outside and see a real \nmess. We can't ignore crime and hope it goes away. We've made that \nmistake over the last 6 years, and our communities are paying the \nprice.\n  We have to get back to cutting the grass. This legislation takes a \ncomprehensive approach once again to fighting crime. It renews our \nfinancial commitment to rebuilding law enforcement capabilities at the \nFederal, State, and local level. It is a significant step toward making \ngood on one of Congress's most sacred duties to our citizens protecting \nthem from crime and fostering safe communities. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 2239. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nself-employed individuals to deduct health insurance costs in computing \nself-employment taxes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I, along with Senator Hatch, am \nre-introducing the Equity for Our Nation's Self-Employed Act of 2007. \nThis important legislation corrects an inequity that currently exists \nin our tax code that forces the self-employed to pay payroll taxes on \nthe funds used to pay for their health insurance while larger \nbusinesses do not. Because of this inequity, health insurance is more \nexpensive for the self-employed. At a time when the number of people \nuninsured is growing at an alarming rate, we need to find ways to \nreduce the cost of health insurance. This legislation is a first \nlogical step.\n  Under current law, corporations and other business entities are able \nto deduct health insurance premiums as a business expense and to forego \npayroll taxes on these costs. However, sole-proprietors are not allowed \nthis same deduction and thus, are required to pay self-employment tax, \ntheir payroll tax, on health insurance premiums. The self-employed are \nthe only segment of the business population that are additionally taxed \non health insurance. The legislation we are introducing today would \nstop this inequitable tax treatment and allow sole proprietors to \ndeduct the amount they pay for health insurance from their calculation \nof payroll taxes, leveling the playing field for the over 20 million \nself-employed in our Nation.\n  This problem affects all self-employed who provide health insurance \nto their families. According to the IRS, there are almost 130,000 sole-\nproprietors in New Mexico. While we do not know how many of these \npeople in New Mexico have health insurance, we do know that roughly 3.8 \nmillion working families in the U.S. paid self-employment tax on their \nhealth insurance premiums. Estimates indicate that roughly 60 percent \nof our Nation's uninsured are either self-employed or work for a small \nbusiness. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, self-employed \nworkers spent upwards of $12,000 per year in 2006 to provide health \ninsurance for their family. Because they cannot deduct this as an \nordinary business expense, those that spend this amount will pay a 15.3 \npercent payroll tax on their premiums, resulting in over $1,800 of \ntaxes annually.\n  This problem was identified by the National Taxpayer Advocate in \nseveral of her annual reports to Congress and our legislation to \ncorrect it is supported by over 40 national and State organizations \nincluding the National Association for the Self-Employed, the National \nSmall Business Association, the National Federation of Independent \nBusiness, National Association of Realtors, the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, and the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to get this important \nlegislation passed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARPER (for himself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 2240. A bill to prohibit termination of employment of volunteer \nfirefighters and emergency medical personnel responding to emergencies, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today with my mend from Maine to \nintroduce the Volunteer Firefighter and EMS Personnel Job Protection \nAct.\n  Current law offers volunteer firefighters and emergency medical \nservices personnel no protection against punishment by their employers \nshould they miss work when called on to respond to a national \nemergency. This means that firefighters or EMS personnel volunteering \ntheir time, even during major disasters like 9/11, Hurricane Katrina, \nor even the current wildfires in California, can be disciplined or even \nfired for putting their lives at risk to save others.\n  We put forward this legislation today out of concern that volunteers \nfaced with the prospect of losing their jobs and not responding to a \ncall will choose the latter. Its passage would protect volunteers from \nhaving to make that choice when the call is to a Presidentially-\ndeclared disaster or emergency.\n  In order to receive the protections offered under the bill, a first \nresponder would need to provide reasonable notice to their employer \nbefore missing time and would need to provide regular updates during \nthe course of their absence. The bill also allows volunteer \nfirefighters or EMS personnel to take legal action against businesses \nthat fire or discipline an individual who gives appropriate notice \nbefore missing work due to a legitimate emergency situation.\n  In order to prevent abuse, the bill places a 14-day limit on the \namount of time volunteer firefighters or EMS workers could take off \nfrom their jobs before being subject to disciplinary action. The bill \nalso does not require employers to compensate volunteers for time away \nfrom work.\n  Communities across the country depend on volunteer firefighters and \nEMS personnel to respond to major disasters. My State is among them. In \nfact, most communities in Delaware rely almost exclusively on the work \nand sacrifice of volunteers to protect their citizens from fires to \nmajor disasters. This bill seeks to ensure that Delawareans can \ncontinue to rely on them.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2240\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President. I rise to offer my wholehearted support \nfor the bill offered by the distinguished Senator from Delaware to \nprovide some reasonable measure of job protection for the volunteer \nfirefighters and emergency medical personnel who save thousands of \nlives across this country every year.\n  This bill is a matter of simple fairness. It recognizes that \nvolunteer firefighters and emergency medical personnel not only serve \ntheir own towns and offer mutual assistance to other communities on a \nday-to-day basis, but also that they are a key component in state and \nfederal plans for responding to catastrophic natural disasters and \nterrorist attacks.\n  Across the Nation, our emergency planning relies on the ready \navailability of these brave first responders. Indeed, volunteers are \nabsolutely critical to mounting a response to disasters, both large and \nsmall. My home state of Maine, for example, has slightly more than \n10,000 firefighters in 492 departments. Because Maine is a mostly rural \nState, fully 88 percent of those firefighters are volunteers.\n  Yet, even if they are called up in a major disaster or a \nPresidentially declared emergency under the Stafford Act, these \nvolunteers have no official protection for their jobs while they are \nanswering the call to duty.\n  We should protect volunteer firefighters and EMS personnel who put \ntheir lives on the line.\n  The current lack of job protection is dangerous. If large numbers of \nvolunteer firefighters and EMS personnel were terminated or demoted \nafter being called away to a disaster or a series of disasters, \nrecruitment and retention of volunteers could be devastated.\n  The Volunteer Firefighter and EMS Personnel Job Protection Act would \ncorrect the injustice and mitigate the danger in a measured and \nresponsible way. It would protect the volunteer first responders \nagainst termination or demotion by employers if they are called upon to \nrespond to a Presidentially declared emergency or a major disaster for \nup to 14 workdays.\n  The bill imposes no unreasonable burdens on employers. They are not \nobliged to pay the volunteers during their absence, and they are \nentitled to receive official documentation that an absent employee was \nin fact summoned to and served in a disaster response.\n  Finally, I would note that the bill would facilitate the work of \nemergency managers. Having this job protection in force would allow \nthem to make operational and contingency plans with greater confidence, \nknowing that volunteer responders would not be forced to withdraw in \nshort order for fear of losing their jobs.\n  The Volunteer Firefighter and EMS Personnel Job Protection Act is a \nstraightforward matter of simple justice and sound policy. By extending \nsome protection to these brave men and women, we can strengthen the \nprotection and life-saving response that they provide to many millions \nof Americans. I believe this bill merits the support of every Senator, \nand I am proud to be an original co-sponsor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD (for himself and Mr. Salazar):\n  S. 2241. A bill to provide consistent enforcement authority to the \nBureau of Land Management, the National Park Service, the United States \nFish and Wildlife Service, and the Forest Service to respond to \nviolations of regulations regarding the management, use, and protection \nof public land under the jurisdiction of those agencies, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I have just introduced a piece of \nlegislation called the Public Land Fire Regulation Enforcement Act. I \nwish to spend a moment talking about that.\n  Mother Nature possesses a beauty like no other; this beauty sometimes\n\n[[Page S13454]]\n\nallows us to forget the ferocious might that she can bring to bear. The \ntragic fires in California provide an all too real reminder of this.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with folks in California, because it was \nnot so long ago that Colorado fund itself in a similar situation. Each \nyear people out West live with the constant and growing threat of \nwildfire. In 2002, nearly 400,000 acres burned. Then Governor Bill \nOwens said that ``all of Colorado is burning''.\n  Unfortunately, some folks--through ignorance, carelessness, or \nmalice--ignore Federal guidelines and start fires during high risk \ntimes. In order to deter this action and provide an added measure of \nsecurity Senator Salazar and I are introducing the Public Land Fire \nRegulations Enforcement Act. This bill will strengthen current law by \nincreasing the penalties for individuals who disregard public safety \nand start fires during restricted times. It increases possible fines \nand doubles the maximum time violators could spend in jail.\n  I hope that the fires burning in California are contained soon and \nthat the damage is minimized as much as possible. I also hope that the \nlegislation I introduce today will help prevent future catastrophic \nfires from being started.\n                                  ____\n\n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 2243. A bill to strongly encourage the Government of Saudi Arabia \nto end its support for institutions that fund, train, incite, \nencourage, or in any other way aid and abet terrorism, to secure full \nSaudi cooperation in the investigation of terrorist incidents, to \ndenounce Saudi sponsorship of extremist Wahhabi ideology, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President. I have sought recognition to offer \nlegislation to encourage Saudi Arabia to halt its support for \ninstitutions that fund, train, incite, encourage, or in any other way \naid and abet terrorism, and to secure full Saudi cooperation in the \ninvestigation of terrorist incidents.\n  I offer this bill on behalf of myself and Senator Wyden. \n  Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, evidence has emerged \nindicating that support for al-Qaeda, Ramas, and other organizations \nhas come from Saudi Arabia.\n  Testimony presented to several Congressional committees, including \nthe Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, Judiciary Committee, and \nIntelligence committees in both houses, has indicated that Saudi Arabia \nis an epicenter for terrorist financing. These committees have also \nfound the Saudi government's cooperation in investigations into the al-\nQaeda terrorist network has been lackluster.\n  In the 108 Congress, as a member of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee and as a member of the Judiciary Committee, we worked to \nestablish a basic point that anybody who knowingly contributes to a \nterrorist organization is an accessory before the fact to murder; so \nwhen people contribute to al-Qaeda or Hamas, knowing that both \norganizations employ suicide bombers, they are accessories to murder.\n  United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373, adopted in 2001, \nmandates that all States ``refrain from providing any form of support, \nactive or passive, to entities or persons involved in terrorist acts,'' \ntake ``the necessary steps to prevent the commission of terrorist \nacts,'' and ``deny safe haven to those who finance, plan, support, or \ncommit terrorist acts.'' There is mounting evidence that Saudi Arabia \nhas not been compliant with this resolution.\n  The 9/11 Commission interviewed numerous military officers and \ngovernment officials who repeatedly listed Saudi Arabia as a prime \nplace for terrorists to set up bases and found that ``Saudi Arabia's \nsociety was a place where al-Qaeda raised money directly from \nindividuals through charities.''\n  The Council on Foreign Relations concluded in a 2002 report that \n``for years, individuals and charities based in Saudi Arabia have been \nthe most important source of funds for al-Qaeda, and for years, Saudi \nofficials have turned a blind eye.''\n  There are indications that, since the May 12, 2003, suicide bombings \nin Riyadh, the Government of Saudi Arabia is making a more serious \neffort to combat terrorism. That said, I would like to draw attention \nto the following findings recanted by organizations which have studied \nthe record of the Saudis. \n  In a June 2004 report entitled ``Update on the Global Campaign \nAgainst Terrorist Financing,'' the Council on Foreign Relations \nreported that ``we find it regrettable and unacceptable that since \nSeptember 11, 2001, we know of not a single Saudi donor of funds to \nterrorist groups who have been publicly punished.''\n  A joint committee of the Select Committee on Intelligence of the \nSenate and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House \nof Representatives issued a report on July 24, 2003, that quotes \nvarious U.S. Government personnel who complained that the Saudis \nrefused to cooperate in the investigation of Osama bin Laden and his \nnetwork both before and after the September 11, 2001, terrorist \nattacks.\n  My frustration with the Saudi government's lack of cooperation in \ninternational counterterrorism efforts goes back more than a decade. \nAfter the Khobar Towers were bombed in 1996--an attack which cost 19 \nAmerican airmen their lives and injured 400 more--I traveled to \nDhahran, Saudi Arabia to see the carnage firsthand. When I arrived, \nU.S. investigators were being denied the opportunity to interview the \nsuspects apprehended by the Saudis. I personally met with Crown Prince \nAbdullah of Saudi Arabia to request that the FBI be granted access to \nthe prisoners. Crown Prince Abdullah said that the U.S. should not \nmeddle in Saudi internal affairs; the murder of 19 airmen and the \nwounding of 400 more hardly qualifies as a Saudi internal affair.\n  The Saudi government continues to drag its feet when it comes to \ncooperation in combating terrorism. The Iraq Study Group stated that \nSaudi Arabia has been ``passive and disengaged'' with regard to the \nsituation in Iraq. Passive and disengaged is unacceptable when Saudi \ninstitutions are funding, training, inciting, and encouraging many \nterrorist actions in Iraq.\n  On October 23, 2007, Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz stated, ``The \nKingdom is determined to continue its policy of fighting all forms of \nterrorism.''\n  According to a July 27, 2007, New York Times article, ``Of an \nestimated 60 to 80 foreign fighters who enter Iraq each month, American \nmilitary and intelligence officials say that nearly half are coming \nfrom Saudi Arabia and that the Saudis have not done enough to stem the \nflow.''\n  On October 23, 2007, Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz stated, \n``Saudi Arabia's view is that dealing with the phenomenon of terrorism \nshould not be confined to the mere security aspect of it but it should \nalso be at the intellectual level.''\n  The Center for Religious Freedom, formerly affiliated with Freedom \nHouse, in a 2006 report entitled ``Saudi Arabia's Curriculum of \nIntolerience,'' stated that despite 2005 statements by the Saudi \nForeign Minister that their educational curricula have been reformed, \nthis is ``simply not the case.'' On the contrary, religious textbooks \ncontinue to advocate the destruction of any non-Wahhabi Muslim. Saudi \nArabia has established Wahhabism, an extreme form of Islam, as the \nofficial state doctrine, and about 5,000,000 children are instructed \neach year in Islamic studies using Saudi Ministry of Education \ntextbooks.\n  A fall 2007 report by the U.S. Commission on International Religious \nFreedom stated that, ``Due to insufficient information provided by the \nSaudi government, the Commission could not verify that a formal \nmechanism exists within the Saudi government to review thoroughly and \nrevise educational texts and other materials sent outside of Saudi \nArabia. It appears that the Saudi government has made little or no \nprogress on efforts to halt the exportation of extremist ideology \noutside the Kingdom.'' It is important to note that fifteen of the \nnineteen 9/11 hijackers were Saudis.\n  In my judgment, the U.S. has been lenient with the Saudis out of \ndeference to Saudi oil. It is really an open scandal that we have not \ntaken action to secure some independence from our reliance on Saudi \noil. A September 2005 Government Accountability Office report stated \nthat, ``Saudi Arabia's multibillion-dollar petroleum industry, although \nlargely owned by the government, has fostered the creation of large\n\n[[Page S13455]]\n\nprivate fortunes, enabling many wealthy Saudis to sponsor charities and \neducational foundations whose operations extend to many countries. U.S. \nGovernment and other expert reports have linked some Saudi donations to \nthe global propagation of religious intolerance, hatred of Western \nvalues, and support of terrorist activities.''\n  The 9/11 Commission recommended that the problems in our bilateral \nrelationship with Saudi Arabia must be confronted openly--this \nlegislation takes a step in that direction.\n  The legislation expresses the sense of Congress that the Government \nof Saudi Arabia must immediately and unconditionally: 1. permanently \nclose all organizations in Saudi Arabia that fund, train, incite, \nencourage, or in any way aid and abet terrorism anywhere in the World; \n2. end all funding for offshore terrorist organizations; 3. block all \nfunding from private Saudi citizens and entities to Saudi-based or \noffshore terror organizations, and 4. provide complete, unrestricted, \nand unobstructed cooperation to the U.S. in the investigation of terror \ngroups and individuals.\n  The President should certify to Congress when the Government of Saudi \nArabia is fully cooperating with the U.S. in the actions listed above.\n  Two major objectives in the Global War on Terrorism are to deny \nterrorists safe haven and to eradicate the sources of terrorist \nfinancing. We cannot be successful in this war by ignoring the problem \nSaudi Arabia presents to our security. The government of Saudi Arabia \ncan no longer remain idle while its citizenry continues to provide the \nwherewithal for terrorist groups with global reach nor can it continue \nto directly facilitate and support institutions that incite violence.\n  President Bush stated that the U.S. ``will challenge the enemies of \nreform, confront the allies of terror, and expect a higher standard \nfrom our friends.'' To be successful in the global war on terrorism we \nneed the proactive and full cooperation of all nations--especially \nthose who consider themselves allies of the U.S.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2243\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Saudi Arabia Accountability \n     Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 (2001) \n     mandates that all states ``refrain from providing any form of \n     support, active or passive, to entities or persons involved \n     in terrorist acts'', take ``the necessary steps to prevent \n     the commission of terrorist acts'', and ``deny safe haven to \n     those who finance, plan, support, or commit terrorist acts''.\n       (2) In 2004, the Council on Foreign Relations reported that \n     it knew of ``not a single Saudi donor of funds to terrorist \n     groups who has been publicly punished''.\n       (3) In his July 2005 testimony to the Committee on Banking, \n     Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate, Stewart Levey, the \n     Undersecretary for the Office of Terrorism and Financing \n     Intelligence of the Department of the Treasury, reported that \n     ``even today, we believe that Saudi donors may still be a \n     significant source of terrorist financing, including for the \n     insurgency in Iraq''. He added that Saudi financiers and \n     charities ``remain a key source for the promotion of \n     ideologies used by terrorists and violent extremists''.\n       (4) According to a July 27, 2007 New York Times article, \n     ``Of an estimated 60 to 80 foreign fighters who enter Iraq \n     each month, American military and intelligence officials say \n     that nearly half are coming from Saudi Arabia and that the \n     Saudis have not done enough to stem the flow.''.\n       (5) According to a July 15, 2007 Los Angeles Times article, \n     ``About 45% of all foreign militants targeting U.S. troops \n     and Iraqi civilians and security forces are from Saudi Arabia \n     . . . according to official U.S. military figures made \n     available to The Times by the senior officer. Nearly half of \n     the 135 foreigners in U.S. detention facilities in Iraq are \n     Saudis, he said. Fighters from Saudi Arabia are thought to \n     have carried out more suicide bombings than those of any \n     other nationality, said the senior U.S. officer, who spoke on \n     condition of anonymity because of the subject's \n     sensitivity.''.\n       (6) The Center for Religious Freedom, formerly affiliated \n     with Freedom House, in a 2006 report entitled ``Saudi \n     Arabia's Curriculum of Intolerance'', stated that despite \n     2005 statements by the Saudi Foreign Minister that their \n     educational curricula have been reformed, this is ``simply \n     not the case''. Contrarily, religious textbooks continue to \n     advocate the destruction of any non-Wahhabi Muslim. Saudi \n     Arabia has established Wahhabism, an extreme form of Islam, \n     as the official state doctrine, and about 5,000,000 children \n     are instructed each year in Islamic studies using Saudi \n     Ministry of Education textbooks.\n       (7) A Fall 2007 United States Commission on International \n     Religious Freedom report stated ``Due to insufficient \n     information provided by the Saudi government, the Commission \n     could not verify that a formal mechanism exists within the \n     Saudi government to review thoroughly and revise educational \n     texts and other materials sent outside of Saudi Arabia. It \n     appears that the Saudi government has made little or no \n     progress on efforts to halt the exportation of extremist \n     ideology outside the Kingdom.''.\n       (8) A September 2005 Government Accountability Office \n     report stated that ``Saudi Arabia's multibillion-dollar \n     petroleum industry, although largely owned by the government, \n     has fostered the creation of large private fortunes, enabling \n     many wealthy Saudis to sponsor charities and educational \n     foundations whose operations extend to many countries. United \n     States Government and other expert reports have linked some \n     Saudi donations to the global propagation of religious \n     intolerance, hatred of Western values, and support of \n     terrorist activities''.\n       (9) A June 2004 press release on the website of the Saudi \n     embassy, www.saudiembassy.net, discussed the creation of the \n     Saudi National Commission for Relief and Charity Work Abroad, \n     a nongovernmental body designed to ``take over all aspects of \n     private overseas aid operations and assume responsibility for \n     the distribution of private charitable donations from Saudi \n     Arabia'' in order to ``guard against money laundering and the \n     financing of terrorism''. As of late 2007, this Commission \n     had not been created.\n       (10) In a February 2006 open Senate Select Committee on \n     Intelligence hearing on the ``World Wide Threat'', former \n     Director of National Intelligence and current Deputy \n     Secretary of State John Negroponte, stated that ``there are \n     private Saudi citizens who still engage in these kinds of \n     donations [in which money is transferred back door to \n     terrorists]''.\n       (11) A March 2005 report by the Congressional Research \n     Service stated that at least 5 persons listed as \n     beneficiaries of the Saudi Committee for the Support of the \n     Al Quds Intifada were suspected suicide bombers.\n       (12) During November 8, 2005 testimony on Saudi Arabia \n     before the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology, and \n     Homeland Security of the Committee on the Judiciary of the \n     Senate, Steve Emerson, terrorism expert and Executive \n     Director of the Investigative Project on Terrorism, stated \n     that despite repeated declarations by Saudi officials that \n     there has been substantial reform in education, progress \n     against terrorism, and movement toward transparency, a review \n     of other Saudi announcements shows that they have either \n     specifically failed to follow through or cannot be proven to \n     have followed through on their pledges. He also noted that \n     the Saudi government established the Saudi Committee for the \n     Support of the Al Quds Intifada, which was proven to provide \n     aid to Palestinian terrorist groups. During an Israeli raid \n     on a Hamas institution, they discovered a spreadsheet from \n     the aforementioned committee giving a detailed account about \n     how they received $545,000 from the committee to allocate to \n     102 families of so-called martyrs. The spreadsheet included \n     the names of 8 suicide bombers.\n       (13) A January 2007 Congressional Research Service Report \n     on Saudi Arabia's terrorist-financing activities indicated \n     that although the records portion of the Committee for the \n     Support of the Al Quds Intifada was deactivated in March \n     2005, of the 1,300 listed beneficiaries, over 60 matched or \n     closely resembled the names of known Palestinian militants \n     who carried out attacks against Israel between October 2000 \n     and March 2002.\n       (14) The final report of the Presidentially-appointed Iraq \n     Study Group stated that ``funding for the Sunni insurgency in \n     Iraq comes from private donors in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf \n     states''.\n       (15) A January 2005 report by the Center for Religious \n     Freedom found that Saudi Arabia was creating and \n     distributing, through its embassy in Washington, D.C., \n     material promoting hatred, intolerance, and violence at \n     mosques and Islamic centers in the United States.\n       (16) On December 14, 2005, R. James Woolsey, former \n     Director of Central Intelligence wrote, ``Over the long run, \n     this movement [Wahhabism] is in many ways the most dangerous \n     of the ideological enemies we face.'' Mr. Woolsey also \n     explained that ``al Qaeda and the Wahhabis share essentially \n     the same underlying totalitarian theocratic ideology. It is \n     this common Salafist ideology that the Wahhabis have been \n     spreading widely--financed by $3-4 billion/year from the \n     Saudi government and wealthy individuals in the Middle East \n     over the last quarter century--to the madrassas of Pakistan, \n     the textbooks of Turkish children in Germany, and the mosques \n     of Europe and the U.S.''.\n       (17) According to a May 2006 report by the Center for \n     Religious Freedom, official Saudi religious textbooks \n     continue to teach hatred of those who do not follow Wahhabi \n     Muslim doctrine and encourage jihad against such\n\n[[Page S13456]]\n\n     ``infidels'' and ``the Saudi public school religious \n     curriculum continues to propagate an ideology of hate toward \n     the unbeliever . . .

SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) it is imperative that the Government of Saudi Arabia \n     immediately and unconditionally--\n       (A) permanently close all charities, schools, or other \n     organizations or institutions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia \n     that fund, train, incite, encourage, or in any other way aid \n     and abet terrorism anywhere in the world (referred to in this \n     Act as ``Saudi-based terror organizations''), including by \n     means of providing support for the families of individuals \n     who have committed acts of terrorism;\n       (B) end funding or other support by the Government of Saudi \n     Arabia for charities, schools, and any other organizations or \n     institutions outside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia that train, \n     incite, encourage, or in any other way aid and abet terrorism \n     anywhere in the world (referred to in this Act as ``offshore \n     terror organizations''), including by means of providing \n     support for the families of individuals who have committed \n     acts of terrorism;\n       (C) block all funding from private Saudi citizens and \n     entities to any Saudi-based terror organization or offshore \n     terrorism organization; and\n       (D) provide complete, unrestricted, and unobstructed \n     cooperation to the United States, including the unsolicited \n     sharing of relevant intelligence in a consistent and timely \n     fashion, in the investigation of groups and individuals that \n     are suspected of financing, supporting, plotting, or \n     committing an act of terror against United States citizens \n     anywhere in the world, including within the Kingdom of Saudi \n     Arabia; and\n       (2) the President, in determining whether to make the \n     certification described in section 4, should judge whether \n     the Government of Saudi Arabia has continued and sufficiently \n     expanded its efforts to combat terrorism since the May 12, \n     2003 bombing in Riyadh.\n\n     SEC. 4. PRESIDENTIAL CERTIFICATION.\n\n       The President shall certify to the appropriate \n     congressional committees when the President determines that \n     the Government of Saudi Arabia--\n       (1) is fully cooperating with the United States in \n     investigating and preventing terrorist attacks;\n       (2) has permanently closed all Saudi-based Wahhabbist \n     organizations that fund Islamic extremism, internally and \n     abroad;\n       (3) has exercised maximum efforts to block all funding from \n     private Saudi citizens, corporations, and entities, to \n     foreign Islamic extremist and terrorist movements; and\n       (4) has stopped financing and disseminating materials, and \n     other forms of support, that encourage the spread of radical \n     Wahhabi ideology.\n\n     SEC. 5. STATUS REPORT.\n\n       (a) Requirement for Report.--Not later than 6 months after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, and every 12 months \n     thereafter until the President makes the certification \n     described in section 4, the Secretary of State shall submit a \n     report to the appropriate congressional committees that \n     describes the progress made by the Government of Saudi Arabia \n     toward meeting the conditions described in paragraphs (1) \n     through (4) of section 4.\n       (b) Form.--The report submitted under subsection (a) shall \n     be in unclassified form and may include a classified annex.\n\n     SEC. 6. APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES DEFINED.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``appropriate congressional \n     committees'' means the Committee on Foreign Relations of the \n     Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of \n     Representatives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 2244. A bill to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto carry out demonstration projects and outreach programs for the \nidentification and abatement of lead hazards, to establish the Joint \nTask Force on Lead-Based Hazards and the Task Force on Children's \nEnvironmental Health and Safety, to strengthen the authority of the \nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Lead \nElimination, Abatement and Poisoning Prevention Act of 2007, \nlegislation that would help us address the threat of lead poisoning \namong children.\n  We have made enormous strides in reducing exposure to lead since its \nuse was phased out in gasoline and residential paint more than twenty \nyears ago. From 1976 to 1994, we reduced the number of children from \nage 1 to 5 with elevated blood lead levels from more than 75 percent of \nthe population to slightly over 4 percent of the population, according \nto the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC. And many local \ngovernments have responded to existing lead hazards through intensive \ninterventions.\n  In my state, for example, Rochester is just one of the cities that \nhave increased their efforts to address elevated blood lead levels \namong their residents. In 2002, Rochester estimated that nearly 25 \npercent of its children had blood lead levels that exceeded the CDC's \nstandard of 10 micrograms per deciliter. Rochester embarked on efforts \nto engage in residential lead remediation and abatement, particularly \namong the 80 percent of its housing stock identified as having lead-\nbased paint. By 2005, according to the Monroe County Department of \nHealth, out of more than 13,000 children screened, the number with \nelevated blood lead levels had dropped to less than 5 percent--a marked \nreduction from only three years before. Yet these levels are still \nhigh, and Rochester continues to work to reduce that level even \nfurther, continuing efforts to identify and address the sources of lead \npoisoning with a coalition of stakeholders.\n  These are the types of interventions we should be supporting, because \nthere are still far too many children in Rochester and other places \naround our country who are at risk for lead poisoning. The CDC \nestimates that more than 300,000 children have elevated blood lead \nlevels. Many of these children are at risk due to existing lead-based \npaint in their homes. To address this concern, I have introduced \nlegislation--the Home-Based Lead Safety Tax Credit Act--which will help \nfamilies and landlords remediate and abate lead-based hazards in \nresidences.\n  But as recent events have shown us, residential lead paint is not the \nonly source of exposure to lead hazards. This past summer, families \nexperienced wave after wave of recalls for products containing lead \nhazards--products that were all targeted for use by children, including \ntoys, bibs, and notebooks. Hundreds of thousands of children have been \nneedlessly exposed to lead-contaminated products, and I have written to \nboth President Bush and the Acting Commissioner of the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission to urge them to undertake the reforms necessary to \nstrengthen this agency.\n  Our Government's Healthy People 2010 Objectives includes the goal of \neliminating elevated blood lead levels in children. The Environmental \nProtection Agency's Strategic Plan for 2006-2011 also sets the goal of \neliminating elevated blood lead levels in American children by 2010. \nBut if we keep along our current path, we will not attain those goals. \nWe must increase our commitment at our federal agencies to address this \nissue, provide our state and local governments with the tools to \nmobilize the multiple stakeholders involved in lead abatement and \npoisoning prevention, and increase our efforts to educate families \nabout ways to protect their children from lead exposure.\n\n  We need to take a comprehensive approach to lead poisoning \nprevention, which is why I am introducing the LEAPP Act today. This \nlegislation will do the following:\n  In far too many cases, a single dwelling accounts for multiple \nchildhood lead poisonings. This bill would establish a pilot project to \nincrease collaboration between state and local health departments, \nhousing agencies, and environmental departments to identify these \n``repeat offender'' houses, take steps to remediate or remove the \nexisting lead hazards and treat children who have been exposed. This \nprogram would be authorized at $5 million annually from fiscal years \n2008 to 2012.\n  Currently, the federal government has multiple programs designed to \naddressing lead-based hazards and increase lead poisoning prevention. \nThe LEAPP Act would consolidate these task forces to improve \ncoordination among all agencies, as well as state, local and community \nstakeholders, and have them develop a strategic plan to maximize \nresources for Federal Government resources.\n  The President's Task Force on Environmental Health Risks and Safety \nRisks to Children was established in 1997 to help coordinate the \noverall environmental health work in the Executive Branch. The LEAPP \nAct would codify the Task Force to facilitate\n\n[[Page S13457]]\n\nhigh-level federal coordination for initiatives that improve children's \nenvironmental health, including lead poisoning prevention and \nabatement.\n  While exposure to lead paint remains a primary hazard, other sources \nfor lead poisoning are imported products with high levels of lead and \ntraditional medications that contain lead. The LEAAP Act would \nauthorize the Office of Minority Health and the Office of Refugee \nResettlement to engage in community-based partnerships to increase \nculturally appropriate education and outreach campaigns to reduce lead \nhazard exposure.\n  Since lead accumulates in bones, many pregnant women may unknowingly \nhave elevated blood lead levels, which may be passed to their children \nor cause toxic effects on their own organs. Through identifying and \nscreening women during pregnancy, we can work to improve the health of \nthe mother, her child, and the overall family. The LEAPP Act would \nestablish pilot projects to incorporate risk assessment, screening and \ntreatment as part of prenatal care for Medicaid populations. This \nprogram would be authorized at $5 million annually for each of fiscal \nyears 2008 through 2012.\n  Current law does not require landlords and homeowners to conduct \nlead-based paint inspections before they can lease or sell their homes. \nThis legislation not only requires landlords to conduct these \ninspections, but also produce documentation of these inspections and \nremediate any lead-based paint hazards found as a result of these \ninspections before leasing or selling homes.\n  Far too many children are exposed to lead-based paint in their homes \nonly to return to the same home after being diagnosed as having \ncontracted lead poisoning. Under this bill, if the primary residence of \na child who is less than 6 years of age is in a unit of public or \nprivate housing, and such child is diagnosed by a certified medical \npractitioner as having contracted lead poisoning, the public housing \nauthority or landlord for such residence shall immediately temporarily \nrelocate the affected family, conduct an inspection and risk assessment \nfor lead, and completely abate the unit in which such child resided.\n  Current law and regulation that aim to reduce lead-based poisoning in \nhomes do not cover all housing units. If we are to reach our goal of \neliminating lead poisoning by 2010, we must extend the reach of current \nlaw and regulations to cover all housing units. This bill will extend \nthat coverage to zero bedroom housing, housing for the elderly and \npersons with disabilities. Doing so will provide protections for \nchildren without regard for the type of dwelling in which they reside.\n  The Low Income Housing Tax Credit is the federal government's largest \nhousing rehabilitation program. Despite this fact, the LIHTC does not \nhave a single lead-based hazard control requirement. This legislation \nsets aside 5 percent of the LIHTC funding for lead-based hazard control \nmeasures.\n  Although weatherization measures can improve energy efficiency and \nsave homeowners on energy cost, these measures can also create lead \nhazards in homes. To protect our children from these hazards, this \nlegislation requires weatherization programs to do lead hazard controls \nas part of their weatherization work.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to continue our efforts \nto protect children against lead poisoning.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 2245.
