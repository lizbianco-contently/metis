There will be 20 minutes of debate \nand then a vote. Following the vote, the Senate will recess for our \nregular conference meetings.\n  Yesterday, cloture was invoked on the committee substitute. I hope \nthat at some point we will be in a position to agree to the amendments \nby unanimous consent or to get cloture for completing action on the FDA \nbill. There are still a number of amendments pending, and a preliminary \nreview by all the Parliamentarians indicates some of them are arguably \ngermane postcloture.\n  I would say on this matter, I informed the Republican leader \nyesterday we would not have any votes after 4 o'clock today, but that \ndoesn't mean we would not be in session. If we can't get some agreement \non running out the 30 hours, we will have to be in session until that \ntime expires, around 10 or 11 o'clock tonight. Then we would in the \nmorning come in and finish this FDA bill. Then it is my understanding--\nthe Parliamentarian can correct me if I am wrong--that there would be a \ncloture vote on WRDA at that time, unless some agreement is worked out \non that, to move to that bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/08/senate-section/article/S5675-7", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5675]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 1312\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, our friend and colleague, Senator Bennett, \nand I have joined together in the first bipartisan legislation to \nguarantee quality, affordable health care for all Americans in more \nthan a decade. I could have no better partner to deal with the premier \nissue here at home than Senator Bennett, who, of course, is a senior \nMember of the Senate Republican leadership and widely respected on both \nsides of the aisle. In the days ahead, together, we are going to be \ntalking with Senators of both parties and discussing this legislation \non the floor with one specific goal in mind; that is, Senate action to \nfix health care in America in 2007.\n  Now, of course, the popular wisdom is that something like this simply \ncould never, ever be done. All the Washington, DC, beltway pundits say \nfixing health care is something we can't do right now and that it will \nbe the job for the next President and the next Congress and everybody \nought to expect that maybe 2 years from now, in the spring of 2009, \nCongress will get around to dealing with the principal domestic issue \nof our time.\n  I and Senator Bennett don't believe we were given election \ncertificates to sit around for 2 more years, when the American people \nare saying they cannot afford for the Congress to wait on fixing health \ncare. It is the top issue here at home. It has been studied, studied, \nand studied. It has been poked and prodded for an awfully long time. It \nis time for the Senate to act and act now.\n  Our citizens are staying up late worrying about how they are going to \nbe able to afford quality health care. I don't see how Members of \nCongress can explain going home at night without addressing our \ncitizens' concerns, and say we will talk about this again in a couple \nof years. The country wants action, and Senator Bennett and I are going \nto do everything we can to make sure they get it.\n  Yesterday, the CEOs of five major companies joined our push for \naction on health care this year. They focused on a handful of important \nprinciples. The principles pretty much mirror the Healthy Americans \nAct. I am very pleased the CEOs yesterday joined those who have already \ncome out in support of the Healthy Americans Act: the business leaders, \nthe labor leaders, the public health advocates, the advocates for \nconsumers, and those who want to have dignity for folks at the end of \nlife. They have already come out in support of the Healthy Americans \nAct, and I was very glad to be able to join the CEOs with Senator \nBennett yesterday to talk about why it is important for Congress to act \nand to act now.\n  The Healthy Americans Act is based on a handful of key principles. \nThe first is that if you are going to fix health care, you have to \ncover everybody. If you don't cover everybody, what happens in American \nhealth care is that those who are uninsured shift their costs to those \nwho are insured. So all the people who have private policies end up \npicking up the costs of those who are uninsured.\n  Second, we believe we ought to build universal coverage around \nprivate choices, while protecting current Government programs. Our \nlegislation, for example, keeps in place the basic structure of \nMedicare and veterans programs, making improvements in Medicare; for \nexample, creating incentives for prevention, particularly under Part B, \nwhat is called the outpatient portion of the program. We build the \nfuture of American health care around quality, affordable private \nchoices, while protecting current Government programs.\n  The third area we address is fixing the Tax Code. We have 180 million \npeople essentially getting health care in America by a historical \naccident. Back in the 1940s, there were wage and price controls. It \nwasn't possible to get quality affordable health care to our citizens, \nand it was essentially put on the backs of the employers. Then the Tax \nCode came along to support that decision. Now, more than $200 billion \ngoes out the door in a way that disproportionately favors the most \naffluent and also promotes inefficiency. If you are a high-flying CEO, \nyou can go out and get a designer smile and write it all off on your \ntax bill, but if you are a hard-working woman in a furniture store, you \nget virtually nothing out of the Tax Code. So Senator Bennett and I \nthink it is time to fix something in the Tax Code that might have made \nsense 65 years ago but certainly doesn't make sense today.\n  Then, we propose to cut the link between employers and insurance. \nThere is no reason why we ought to say--at a time when our citizens \nchange their job something like seven times by the time someone is 35, \nand we live in a society where people want portability, the ability to \nmove quickly from job to job and take their benefits with them--there \nis no reason to say the future of American health care ought to require \nthe employer to continue to be the focus of how health care is \ndelivered. Certainly, at a time when our employers are up against \nglobal competition--and not competing with somebody in Denver or Texas \nbut in global markets--it makes no sense to dump all this onto the back \nof the employer. So Senator Bennett and I would cut the link between \nhealth insurance and employment.\n  We have put a special emphasis on creating a new culture of wellness \nand, in a sense, dealing with the fact that America doesn't have health \ncare at all. What we have is ``sick'' care. Medicare will spend \nthousands of dollars under Part A for senior citizens' hospital bills \nand virtually nothing under Part B for prevention to keep people well. \nSo we make those voluntary incentives part of Medicare so that if a \nsenior, for example, in Montana were to lower her blood pressure or her \ncholesterol for the first time, that senior in Montana would be able to \nget a lower Part B premium and actually see, on a voluntary basis, why \ngood health pays off in terms of the premium costs seniors face.\n  Finally, our judgment is we are spending enough money today on health \ncare. We are not spending it in the right places. To put it into \nperspective, this year we are going to spend $2.3 trillion on health \ncare. There are about 300 million of us. If you divide 300 million into \n$2.3 trillion, you could go out and hire a personal physician for every \nseven families in America and pay that doctor $200,000 a year, and then \nwe would all have quality, affordable health care. Picture that in the \nState of Montana or in another part of our country: Seven families, for \nthe amount of money we are spending today, could have their own \npersonal physician who would get paid $200,000, and their job would be \nto take care of seven families. Whenever I bring that up to the \nphysicians groups--I am sure my colleague from Montana would see this \nas well--whenever I bring it up to physicians, they say: Ron, where do \nI go to get my seven families? It sounds pretty good. It would be \npretty good to be able to practice medicine again today rather than \nbeing a bean counter and an administrator and somebody who has to \nshuffle through all the paper and bureaucracy.\n  We are spending enough; we are not spending it in the right places. \nSo that is why we have to say the first thing we are going to do is \nspend what is being allocated by American health care today more \nwisely.\n  The Lewin Group is sort of the gold standard of doing health care \nanalyses. They analyzed the Healthy Americans Act and the President's \nproposals and proposals from various States, and they have found that \nunder the legislation that Senator Bennett and I are working on in the \nSenate, it would be possible to save $1.45 trillion--that is with a T--\non health care spending in the years ahead, the first proposal to \nactually lower the rate of growth in health spending. So the facts are \nindisputable. People who are insured today--and you often ask why \nshould they support changes--are picking up the bills of those who are \nuninsured. As Senator Bennett has often said, we have universal \ncoverage already today. That is the way it works. Those people are \ngoing to get care; it is just not going to be done in a very efficient \nfashion.\n\n  So the facts are not in question. Medical costs are gobbling up \neverything in sight. Our employers are at a disadvantage when it comes \nto U.S. competitiveness. There has been a huge increase in chronic \nillness. A tiny percentage of the Medicare population, for\n\n[[Page S5677]]\n\nexample, consumes most of the Medicare dollars, essentially as a result \nof problems relating to heart disease and diabetes and a host of other \nillnesses that could be prevented. Of course, it is well understood by \nevery Senator that there is a demographic avalanche coming with many \nmore older people.\n  So with the facts not in dispute, with the country saying act now, \ndon't put this off for another 2 years, the Senate has an opportunity \nto work in a bipartisan way.\n  Senators on my side of the aisle have made it clear--correctly in my \nview--that we have to get everybody covered. It is not right for this \ncountry to be the only western industrialized nation that cannot figure \nout how to get everybody under the tent. It is important to get \neverybody covered.\n  Senator Bennett and others on the Republican side of the aisle have \nbeen correct in saying the public doesn't feel comfortable with the \nidea of having Government run it all. The people in my State voted \nagainst what is known as a ``single payer plan'' in 2002 by a 3-to-1 \nmajority.\n  What Senator Bennett and I have put together, for the amount of money \nthat is being spent today, is a bill that will save close to $1.5 \ntrillion over the next 10 years. It is legislation you can explain at \nany townhall meeting in Montana, Oregon, or anywhere else, and that is \nthat every citizen would have access to a private health policy at \nleast as good as their Member of Congress has. It is very simple to \nunderstand.\n  I have a Blue Cross card in my pocket. I was able, during the period \nof open enrollment, which the Senator from Montana experienced when he \ncame to the Senate, to make choices, make an evaluation of the various \nprivate health policies that were offered to me. As a result, my \nchildren and I have that private health coverage. I want that same set \nof choices and set of opportunities for those whom I represent and the \npeople of this country.\n  My good friend Senator Bennett has joined me on the floor. I am going \nto yield soon for him to speak.\n  I think the debate in the Senate has reached the critical moment, at \nleast for this session of Congress. We know we have to get action on \nmajor issues in 2007. We are going to spend a lot of time next year \nelecting a new President. You probably don't have to have the President \nactually sign a piece of legislation in 2007, but you have to get \nserious action. Senator Bennett and I believe there is an opportunity \ntoday that we have not had in years and years, and that is to bring \nDemocrats and Republicans together to work for universal coverage.\n  My friend Senator Bennett has made the point very eloquently that we \nare already paying for it today. We are just not, in many respects, \ngetting our money's worth. So we have spent a great deal of time \nlistening to folks in the private sector, in business, and labor, and \nGovernment, Democrats and Republicans, and we want to bring the Senate \ntogether.\n  I also point out that the Healthy Americans Act, which Senator \nBennett has agreed to be the lead Republican sponsor on, mirrors the \nletter that 10 Senators--5 Democrats and 5 Republicans--sent to the \nPresident earlier this year, indicating we want to work with him. \nHealth care has been studied and studied. The time for action is now. I \nam very pleased my good friend Senator Bennett is going to be joining \nme in this effort.\n  I repeat to the Senate, this is the first time in more than a decade \nthere has actually been a bipartisan piece of legislation to provide \nfor universal health coverage in America. The last one, in fact, was \nlargely developed by the late Senator Chafee, who sought to do much of \nwhat Senator Bennett and I are seeking to do.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/08/senate-section/article/S5677-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5677-S5679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HEALTHY AMERICANS ACT\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my friend \nfrom Oregon. I wish to make it very clear that if it were not for his \ndogged persistence in going after the issue of health care reform in \nthis Congress, we would not be where we are. Many of us talk about \nthis. We talk about it in the dining room. We talk about it as we are \nwaiting between rollcall votes. We sit in the cloakroom and say, \nwouldn't it be great? Yes, why don't we do it? It would be fabulous if. \n. . .\n  Senator Wyden goes beyond the talk. He is determined to go after \nthis. He and I have had a number of conversations, and I know he has \nhad conversations with the administration at the White House and at the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. He is a bulldog on this issue. \nIf it gets done, it will be a tribute to his tenacity. I am beginning \nto believe it will get done. I am getting his enthusiasm.\n  I want, for a moment, to spend a little time on history so we can \nunderstand how we got in the mess we are in, and why the proposal \nSenator Wyden has laid down--and I am proud to cosponsor--is the right \ndirection in which to go. We got in the mess where we are with health \ncare back in the Second World War, when the Federal Government decided, \nonce again, it was going to repeal the law of supply and demand. I have \nsaid here many times, if I can control what we carve in marble around \nhere to remind us of our duties, along with these Latin phrases I love, \nwe should also have something before us that says you cannot repeal the \nlaw of supply and demand. The law of supply and demand is as immutable \nas the law of gravity. Because it occurs in economics, some people \nthink we can get around it.\n\n  In the Second World War, we had wage and price controls. We were \ngoing to prevent inflation by Federal fiat. In other words, we were \ngoing to repeal the effects of the law of supply and demand. All right, \nso that means if I had an employee, I could not give him a raise. All \nright. Senator Wyden opens a business and he wants my employee. Since \nit is a new job, he offers my employee more than I can pay, and I \ncannot match that because it is against the law. So in order to hold my \nemployee, I say: I will tell you what I will do: instead of giving you \na raise in dollars that you can put into your paycheck, I will give you \na raise in value. The value will be a health insurance policy that is \nworth more than Senator Wyden is offering you in money. And here is the \ngood thing about it: You won't have to pay taxes on this raise. I will \npay the taxes on it; that is, it will be deductible. You won't have to \npay taxes on it. So you get more value and you get a tax break. Isn't \nthat a good deal? And the employee says: Yes, I will stay with you \ninstead of switching jobs because you can, in fact, get around the \nGovernment's effort to prevent you from giving me a raise.\n  That sounds innocent enough, but it started us down the road of \nhaving the employer spending the employee's money. They say, no, that \nis not employee money, that is employer money; the employer is paying \nfor it. No, he is not. The employee earned that amount of money, \nreturned that amount of value to his employer, but he didn't get it in \nhis W-2. That meant the employer ultimately determined how it would be \nspent. So we started down the road to where there is a major divide in \npaying for health insurance. The employer is spending the employee's \nmoney, but the employer wants to hold that amount down because it will \nmean savings in his overall business plan.\n  So the primary economic motive on the part of the employer is to hold \nthe costs down. He will make a deal, therefore, that produces a \ntemporary, short-term cost advantage for him. The consumer of the \nservice, the employee, has a different agenda. He wants the best care \nhe can get. But since he doesn't control the dollars, even though they \nare his dollars in terms of his earnings, he is stuck with whatever \ndecision the employer makes.\n  That might make a little bit of sense if the employee stays with the \nemployer his entire career. But we have gone long beyond that. I tell \ngraduates of the university they can expect to change jobs 10 times \nbefore they are 50, and they may even change careers. You may be \ntrained as a veterinarian and end up as a Senator. We have two examples \nof that here in the Senate today. I thought I was going to spend my \nentire career in the glass and paint business, a business my \ngrandfather founded, my father ran, and when I graduated, I assumed I \nwas going to be there for the rest of my life. I was there for 4 years, \nand a change came along, and then there was another change. I sat down \nwhen I was 50 and\n\n[[Page S5678]]\n\ndiscovered I had changed jobs 17 times from the age of 20 to the age of \n50. In terms of health care, that meant 17 times I was exposed to \nhaving my health care canceled--17 times, when they were worried about \npreexisting conditions; 17 times when I would be in a situation I would \nnot like. Indeed I was, because there was a period in that 30-year \ntimespan when I had no health coverage at all. The employer I was \nworking for could not provide it, or under some circumstances I had no \nemployer, period.\n  So I understand how the precedent set in the Second World War simply \ndoesn't apply to the 21st century. If we were to have a system where \nthe employee controls his dollars--not the employer--and takes the \nproduct he buys with those dollars with him from employer to employer, \nwe could solve an enormous amount of the problems we have in health \ncare.\n  Let's talk about overall costs. John Goodman had a piece in the Wall \nStreet Journal where he talked about quality. He pointed out a study \nthat said the best quality in health care can be found in three cities \nin the United States. One was Seattle, WA; one was Rochester, MN--and \nthe Mayo Clinic comes to mind--and the third was Salt Lake City, \nUT. Naturally, that makes me feel pretty good. It pointed out if every \nAmerican received the kind of health care that was available in Salt \nLake City, UT, the cost would go down by one-third and the quality \nwould go up substantially.\n\n  So why doesn't everybody do that? Because they can't take their \ndollars and shop. They are stuck with whatever plan the employer \ndecides to buy, and even as he is buying, the employer does not have \ntransparency or information that would say to him: The best health care \nis available at Intermountain Health Care in Salt Lake City. Instead, \nthe salesman who comes in to sell the employer the policy will say: I \ncan save you this much money in this kind of situation. All right, I \nwill buy that policy. The focus is on the dollars rather than the \nquality.\n  This is an ironic situation that when quality and competition is \nfocused on, cost comes down automatically. That is what happens in the \nrest of the economy. Why shouldn't it happen in health care? It doesn't \nhappen in health care because of what we did in World War II, and the \nlegacy of that has followed downward.\n  What about Government health care? One of the problems with \nGovernment health care is we do it in Congress. Every private health \ncare plan had a drug component decades ago. Medicare didn't have a drug \ncomponent until the last Congress. Why? Because we in Congress couldn't \nagree as to what it should be. We always agreed there should be one, \nbut we argued about it: It should be better, it should be smaller, we \nhave a doughnut hole. All of the things we talked about that the \naverage consumer knows nothing about or cares nothing about tied it up \nfor decades.\n  We finally passed Part D. There were dire predictions that it \nwouldn't work because it wasn't a Government-run plan. It let in \nprivate competition. It allowed the senior citizens to make a choice \nbetween private offerors. And what has been the consequence of that?\n  We have some statistics: 2,596 different plans are now being offered \naround the United States. People are stunned at that number. They \nthought it would be a monopoly of big drug companies. But when the \ncustomer could choose and niche markets opened up, drug companies \nstarted to offer products in those niches, and the number of choices \nexploded.\n  I have heard the Senator from Wyoming say: We were worried about \nWyoming because Wyoming is so small. We didn't think there would be \nmore than one or two plans in Wyoming, if anybody wanted to come at \nall. We thought Wyoming would be bypassed by Medicare Part D.\n  There are now 34 Medicare Advantage plans in Wyoming--plenty of \nchoice--and the polls show that something in excess of 80 percent of \nthe seniors like Medicare Part D.\n  What has happened to the cost? It is one of the few Government \nprograms that I can identify where the cost has come in below \nprojections.\n  The one thing I always say on the floor of the Senate is, we know \nevery projection with respect to Government plans is always wrong. We \ndon't know whether it is wrong on the high side or wrong on the low \nside, but we know it is always wrong. But if you are going to bet, bet \nthat it is wrong on the low side. Bet that the program will cost more \nthan we project or than CBO projects. This is one that has come in \nbelow.\n  All of these straws in the wind tell me Senator Wyden is on to \nsomething very significant. It is the Healthy Americans Act which says \nlet the people control their own money. Let the people have their own \nplan that is going to give us better quality and lower costs.\n  We look around the world and we see other countries that have tried \nthe single-payer system, and they are retrenching. We look around the \nworld and we see other countries that tried a consumer-driven health \ncare plan, and they are prospering with respect to getting their health \ncare costs down.\n  With that history, Mr. President, I am proud to be the Republican \ncosponsor with Senator Wyden and salute him once again on his \nleadership and his tenacity in getting this program moving forward.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I believe we have about 13 additional \nminutes to go. The distinguished Senator from Utah has given a superb \ndescription of the history and why it is time to break with 60 years of \npolicy. I would like to, because the distinguished Senator was there \nduring the last effort, the 1993-1994 debate, get his sense about how \nthe approach that we have been talking about--linking together \nuniversal coverage with these private choices that individuals would \nmake--is it the Senator's judgment that had that been done in 1993 and \n1994 with the efforts of Senator Chafee, himself, and others that we \nmight well have been able to pass legislation right then, 15 years ago, \nhad we taken this approach?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Oregon that some \nof us proposed that during that debate. He is right to mention John \nChafee. John Chafee was a towering figure in this body. He was the head \nof the Republican health care task force. We talked about an individual \nmandate as opposed to an employer mandate.\n  The core of the bill that was on the Senate floor, sponsored by then-\nmajority leader George Mitchell, was an employer mandate. And in the \npartisan nature of that debate, we Republicans organized ourselves to \nstop that bill. We divided the bill into various sections, and \nmy assignment was to attack the employer mandate. I had a stack of \nmaterial that high to help me do that with my fellow Senators. But as I \nwould talk with people on the other side, I would say: Let's talk about \nan individual mandate. I think everyone should have some kind of \ncoverage.\n\n  I think it is in society's best interest to have everyone have some \nkind of coverage. We do it with auto insurance. You can't drive if you \ndon't have an individual insurance plan. So that is how we get \nuniversal coverage.\n  The political stars simply weren't lined up to deal with it. But this \nis not a new idea. It was around that long ago, and if we had done it, \nI think we could have passed legislation.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator's comments.\n  The other area I have picked up over the last 15 years where there \nhas been dramatic interest and is an opportunity for bipartisanship--\nand I have heard the Senator from Utah talk about it--is this area of \nprevention. We know with the Medicare Program that something like 4 \npercent of those on Medicare consume over half the dollars because we \nare seeing so much of the health care money go to treatment of what are \noften preventable illnesses--heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and \nothers.\n  What we have tried to do in the Healthy Americans Act is to create \nsome incentives for families and prevention, and, for example, if \nparents took a youngster to a wellness program--they wouldn't be \nrequired to do it, although we know it makes sense--the parents would \nbe eligible for a discount on the parents' premium, again using these \nvoluntary incentives.\n  What is the Senator's sense for the opportunities for prevention? I \nhave\n\n[[Page S5679]]\n\nbeen struck by some of what the Senator from Utah has said about \nprevention in the past.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, the record is very clear that when people \nspend time taking care of themselves, their health care costs go down \ndramatically. We had examples presented to us from companies that have \ndone that; that is, companies that have been very aggressive in trying \nto make sure their employees stay healthy rather than simply pay for \nwhat happens when they get sick.\n  The CEO of General Mills was with Senator Wyden and me at the press \nconference this week in which he talked about the things they have done \nin their company. They have held their health care cost increases to \nthe level of inflation. We would all be thrilled with that because \nhealth care costs have been going up in double digits for years now.\n  People respond to incentives, and if there are incentives for \nparents, incentives for employees to stay healthy rather than simply \nwaiting for the ultimate bill to come along, we will make a significant \ndifference.\n  If I can be personal for one quick moment, I once worked for Howard \nHughes. In the Hughes organization in the 1960s and 1970s, we had \nabsolutely total health care coverage. Anything that had to do with \nhealth care, we would send in the bill, and it would get paid 100 \npercent. I sent in my kids' orthodontist bills, and they paid for \nstraightening their teeth. There wasn't any concern about what was \ncovered or what wasn't. I figured I could have sent in the vet bills \nfor my dog and probably gotten reimbursed, but I didn't do that.\n  I look back on that and the sense of security and abundance that came \nfrom that led me to overuse the system and to not worry about how well \nwe were because they would take care of us. So I have had a personal \nexperience about how important it is to pay attention to health at the \nfront end.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I close, Mr. President--and the Senator has been very \ngracious to do this with me this morning--with why it would be \nimportant to have a bipartisan initiative now. As we have discussed, \nthe conventional thinking is that the Congress can't deal with \nsomething such as this now; that this will be for the next President. \nBut I think the two of us would very much like to bring the Senate \ntogether behind what the country wants to do today, which is to fix \nhealth care.\n  I have always gotten the sense that when you have divided \nGovernment--the President of one party, the Congress of another--that \nis the ideal time to try to bring the Congress together to tackle a big \nissue, and there is nothing bigger than health care at home. I think it \nwould be appropriate.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Utah for coming and for his support, to \nhear his thoughts on bringing the Congress together and the country \ntogether to finally deal with an issue where there has been so much \npolarization in the past.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, there is nothing that succeeds in \npolitics like good programs, like good policy. Ronald Reagan didn't \ninvent it, but he is known for repeating it, saying there is no limit \nto the amount of good you can do if you don't care who gets the credit. \nFar too much of the partisanship stems from the fact that we don't want \nthe other party to get credit for solving the problem.\n  When I have had discussions across the aisle about this and Social \nSecurity, I get told: Bob, we will address that right after the next \nelection. The next election never comes because there is always a next \nelection.\n  The Senator from Oregon is exactly right in that for the first time \nsince Dwight Eisenhower's election, we have an election where there is \nnot an incumbent in the White House on the ballot, either a sitting \nPresident or a sitting Vice President. So the Democrats who control the \nCongress have a political motive to show they can do something as they \ngo into the 2008 elections.\n  The Republicans cannot try to take credit for that with their \ncandidate because they are not going to have a candidate who is part of \nthe present administration. But the Republicans want to be able to say: \nWell, at least in the last days of the Bush administration something \nimportant got done.\n  The setting is rare. We should take advantage of it. This is the \nmoment, and I join with the Senator from Oregon in an attempt to seize \nit.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague from Utah. I see other Senators who \nare wishing to speak. We will be back to talk with Senators about this \nissue, to urge action in 2007, to support a bipartisan push in the \nSenate to deal with the premier domestic issue of our time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/08/senate-section/article/S5679-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5679-S5681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HIGH GAS PRICES\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, my two Texas colleagues and I would like to \ntalk about the Democratic response to high gas prices. Given the fact I \nbelieve we have about 12 minutes, we may just have a colloquy instead \nof each giving presentations.\n  Let me begin by making a couple of points. The press reported \nyesterday that U.S. average retail gas prices rose to an overall \nalltime high, breaking $3 a gallon. I know I paid $3.04, and this is up \njust about 20 cents a gallon over the last 2 weeks. Every family feels \nthis pinch.\n  Now, Democrats understand this, and that is why last year--and I know \nbecause I was going through a campaign at the time--they attempted to \ncapitalize on a similar spike in gas prices. They held press \nconferences all across the country pledging to lower gasoline prices.\n  Let me read one of the headlines that resulted from this publicity \nblitz from the New York Times. It says: ``Democrats Eager to Exploit \nAnger Over Gas Prices.'' This is an April 21, 2006, article, which \nreported, and I am quoting:\n\n       The recommendations of a memorandum sent by Democrat \n     campaign officials to Democratic candidates include holding a \n     campaign event at a gas station where you call for a real \n     commitment to bringing down gas prices.\n\n  I guess you can say: That was then, this is now. Now that the \nDemocrats are in charge, the question is, What have they done about the \nproblem they were all too quick to exploit back during the campaign? As \nfar as I can tell, the answer to that question is, exactly nothing. In \nfact, they tried to and to some extent did prevent Republicans, when we \nwere in control last year, from initiating a series of reforms that \nwould have actually done something about the problem and might have \nprevented some of what we see now. We were finally able to get \nlegislation passed to open the deep waters off the Gulf of Mexico for \noil and gas exploration to bring more supply on line--that was a very \npositive development--but when we tried to do other things, we were \nstopped by the Democrats.\n  I think it is important for us to challenge our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle who were very interested in the American public \nhaving to pay high gas prices back during the campaign last year. Well, \nyou are in charge. What have you done about it? The answer, so far, \nappears to me to be, exactly nothing.\n  Let me say to my colleague from Texas that I know a lot of our \nproblem is because of regulations that inhibit oil refineries from \nimproving their capability to refine more oil and gas or building new \nrefineries. It is very sensitive to what happens at the refineries. My \nrecollection is that there was a recent fire at one of the Texas \nrefineries.\n  Is it the case that we could do some things--and tried last year to \ndo some things--to make it easier from a regulatory standpoint for oil \nrefineries to increase their capacity? And isn't this one of the ways \nRepublicans have tried to ensure we have a larger supply, which would, \ntherefore, reduce the price of gasoline to our consumers?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, actually, that is absolutely right, \nand I will say to the distinguished Senator from Arizona that is only \none of the problems we have, and it is the reason my husband walked \ninto the house this weekend and said: I just spent $70 filling my gas \ntank; what are you going to do about it? Like every one of us, I am \nsure, who has this same experience, I think we should be doing \nsomething about it. We should be doing a variety of things about it.\n  Senator Kyl specifically asked about the refinery capacity. We are \nvery tight on refinery capacity. We did pass legislation in the last \nCongress that\n\n[[Page S5680]]\n\nwould try to ease the regulatory burden and therefore the timetable \nthat it takes from either starting a new refinery or adding critical \ncapacity in an existing refinery, but the regulations had not yet been \nput out as of a couple of weeks ago.\n  One of the refiners in my State that wants to add capacity asked me \nif I would help and at least say to the Department to please issue the \nregulations so they can go forward, knowing they would have the \nguidance to move forward with expansion plans and add more refinery \ncapacity.\n  In addition to that, I have to say that one of the things we see \ncontinuing to be blocked on the other side of the aisle is the ability \nto explore and drill in our own waters. The Department of the Interior, \njust last week, put out a lease-sale proposal in eight areas, including \nthe Gulf of Mexico, the Outer Continental Shelf, Virginia, and Alaska.\n  In Virginia, the legislature is taking the first steps to \nproduction--by supporting the exploration of gas. The capability for \nearning money for the treasury of Virginia caused the Virginia \nLegislature to say: Yes, we want to do it, but there has to be a waiver \nof a previous extension of the moratorium in drilling. We're hearing \nsignals that the Congress is not going to allow that, even though the \nLegislature of the State of Virginia and the Governor have said they \nwant to be able to explore to see what is out there, 50 miles out.\n  The people who represent the people of Virginia have seen, as so many \nof our legislatures have, that technology today is not what it was 25 \nyears ago. You can drill and explore in an environmentally safe way and \nwe can do something about the price of gasoline at the pump if we will \ntake these kinds of measures. The Department of the Interior is now \ntrying to do that. Yet we are seeing already the signs of obstruction \non the other side of the aisle. So I guess we are going to let these \nprices continue to go up without any regard to what we have in our own \nresources, under our own control, which could alleviate some of this.\n  It is not just drilling and production and exploration, either. We \nare also trying to put forward nuclear power, which is the cleanest, \nmost efficient form of energy. The French have proven that it can be \nvery effective as a clean energy source. Yet we are thwarted from the \nopportunity by the other side of the aisle to explore that avenue, and \nthen lawsuits crop up, which have stymied our efforts to increase \nnuclear capacity in our country.\n  So I would suggest to my friend from Arizona, or my friend from \nTexas, if we are going to continue to be stopped from using our own \nnatural resources and if we are not going to be able to increase our \nrefinery capacity, then I think we are looking at the capability for \ncountries that have denounced America and said they want the \ndestruction of America to, in fact, be able to hurt our economy by \ncutting off the oil supply.\n  I would ask my colleagues, what should we do if we are not going to \nhave cooperation?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I think my colleague from Texas, Mr. Cornyn, \ncan certainly answer that question, but first allow me to make a few \nadditional comments.\n  News reports suggest that increased gas prices can be linked to \nproduction shortages at a time of increased demand. More directly, the \nproblem can be traced to a continuing lack of refining capacity and \nunexpected outages at the Nation's oil refineries. A series of recent \noutages, largely for maintenance, have reduced the supply of domestic \ngasoline.\n  The price of a gallon of oil is still $10 below last year when prices \nspiked: however, demand has increased 2.3 percent from the same period \nlast year. Existing refineries are unable to meet the ever-rising \ndemand for gasoline. The system also cannot handle unexpected outages, \nfor example, the recent fire in Texas. The U.S. saw the strain on \nrefinery capacity during Katrina when prices nationwide went up 45 \ncents in 1 week due to refinery damage in the region.\n  Because of high costs, regulatory redtape, and public opposition, \nrefiners haven't built a new facility since 1976--30 years ago. The \nsystem is under such strain that any outages or disruptions are quickly \nfelt in the market in the form of increased prices.\n  The lack of domestic refining capacity also increases our reliance on \nforeign sources of refined gasoline. America now imports about a \nmillion barrels of gasoline every day--that means that about one of \nevery ten gallons of gas Americans get at the pump is refined in a \nforeign country.\n  Regulations requiring a variety of new regional gasoline blends also \nincrease the price and make it difficult to address shortages by moving \nsupply from one area of the country to another.\n  Last year, Republicans saw the strain on the existing system, and we \ntried to do something about it. We passed legislation that opened new \nareas in the deep waters off the Gulf of Mexico to oil and gas \nexploration to bring more supply on line. Republicans recognize that it \nis in our national security interest to increase domestic supply, \nincluding ANWR, and reduce our reliance on foreign oil.\n  I also introduced legislation to ensure that oil companies pay their \nfair share for the oil and gas they produce from public lands. And I \nintroduced legislation to remove the 54 cent import tariff on ethanol, \nto lower the price consumers pay at the pump.\n  Republicans also tried to address the lack of domestic refinery \ncapacity. We introduced legislation to streamline permitting to build \nnew refineries, and we were blocked by Democrats. Republicans \nintroduced legislation to incentivize building new refineries, and we \nwere blocked by Democrats. Republicans introduced legislation to reduce \nthe number of boutique blends of gasoline, and we were blocked by \nDemocrats.\n  Now the Democrats have to do more than block legislation--they have \nto solve problems.\n  The Democrats will talk about price gouging legislation and say that \nis the solution. The FTC looked at this last year after Hurricane \nKatrina and did not find evidence of price gouging. More hearings will \nnot reduce the price of a gallon of gasoline since there are already \nlaws in place to prosecute price gouging.\n  The Democrats will talk about conservation and higher CAFE as well. \nWe all support conservation as a long-term solution, but we also need \nto take action to address our near-term problems and reduce our \nreliance on foreign oil. We need to increase domestic production and \nincrease our refining capacity.\n  The theme that I think we see developing here is that the Democrats \ncampaign rhetoric is catching up with them, and now they must prove \nthey can govern and solve people's problems. They are 0 for 7 in '07 \nwith their agenda. Gas prices are only the most recent example of \nfailure. We still don't have a comprehensive energy policy. We still \nhaven't taken steps to improve health care. Democrats campaigned on big \nideas, but they are playing small ball.\n  The Washington Post wrote in an article this weekend entitled \n``Democrats Momentum is Stalling,'' which stated that: ``Not a single \npriority on the Democrats' agenda has been enacted, and some in the \nparty are growing nervous that the `do nothing' tag they slapped on \nRepublicans last year could come back to haunt them.'' That was the \nWashington Post, May 5, 2007.\n  I hope the Democrats will work with us for real solutions to people's \nproblems, including reducing gas prices.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I think the senior Senator from Texas is \nexactly right. There are a lot of laws that Congress can pass--we can \neven repeal laws--but we can't repeal the law of supply and demand. The \nonly way we are going to see these gas prices come down is to produce \nmore supply, as we look for alternative forms of energy. The Senator \nmentioned, obviously, nuclear power, but we are even investing in clean \ncoal-burning technology. I think we basically need to look at all \naspects of the energy issue.\n  The Senator from Arizona was exactly correct as well. We have gone \nfrom a high of 324 refineries in this country down to 132. Because we \nare in a global marketplace for gasoline, which essentially can be \ntransported wherever the prices tend to be higher, that is why we have \nseen gas prices in excess of $3 a gallon at the pump.\n  I remember well that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nlast year,\n\n[[Page S5681]]\n\nwhen we were in the majority, said they wanted to know what the \nRepublican plan was to relieve the pain at the pump. Well, the \nDemocrats are in charge now, and we would like to know what their plan \nis. We believe this is something we ought to work on together, on a \nbipartisan basis, to try to relieve the pain at the pump being \nexperienced by working men and women and families all across this \ncountry. The only way we are going to be able to do this is on a \nbipartisan basis, but the Democrats control the agenda. The majority \nleader basically controls the time on the Senate floor. We need to know \nwhen he plans to bring up some meaningful relief for the American \nconsumers to try to bring that price down.\n  We need to do this in the short term, the near term, not the long \nterm only. We do need nuclear power. We need to do research in the \nbiofuels and other alternatives. We need to employ wind energy and \nother clean technologies that will provide for part of our energy \nneeds. We haven't discovered a way to make any of those useful to \noperate our vehicles. It is oil, and it is gasoline.\n  The only way we are going to be able to provide relief in the near \nterm is to increase supply by reducing our dependency on imported \nenergy, producing more of it domestically, and relieving some of the \nregulatory impediments which have made it impossible to create a new \nrefinery in this country in the last 30 years. Only by increasing the \nsupply in the near term are we going to be able to see prices come down \nat the pump as we continue to explore alternative forms of energy and \nother ways to meet our energy needs, while continuing to see our \neconomy grow and continue to create jobs.\n  I hope the majority will take this request seriously and will come \nback and tell us what their plan is to relieve the pain at the pump \nAmerican consumers are experiencing today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/08/senate-section/article/S5681-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             VISITING STUDENTS SEE GOVERNMENT IN OPERATION\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we have in the galleries today students \nfrom the seventh grade of the Saligman Middle School in the \nPhiladelphia suburbs. I am not permitted under Senate rules to \nacknowledge their presence, except verbally, but my granddaughter, \nSilvi Specter, is among a very impressive group of 59 students who left \nPhiladelphia before dawn today to come to the Nation's Capital to see \ngovernment in operation.\n  I wish I had the opportunity to visit the Senate when I was in the \nseventh grade. It took me a little longer to get here. I have sensed \nfrom this very bright, intelligent group of students that we may \nproduce a Senator or we may produce a President because the sky is the \nlimit if the students apply themselves and work hard.\n  I was explaining, when we took a picture on the steps today, that the \nCongress of the United States makes the laws for the country. This is \nbasic civics, but it is good to repeat it. The House of \nRepresentatives, consisting of 435 Members, is a representative body, \none for every approximately 700,000 people in the United States. Each \nof our 50 States has 2 Senators. We consider legislation, we vote--pass \nbills by both the House and Senate--and then we get together on a \nconference. We have an agreement and a conference report is then voted \non separately. The measures then go to the President of the United \nStates.\n\n  We have a fascinating part of the legislative process right now with \nthe issue of the funding of the Iraq war. The Constitution creates the \nCongress under article I and creates the office of the executive \nbranch, the Presidency, under article II. We have a unique \nconstitutional confrontation. I think it is not an overstatement to say \nit is of historic proportion--perhaps the most dramatic constitutional \nconfrontation between the article I power of the Congress to \nappropriate, commonly known as the power of the purse, and the \nauthority of the President under his power as Commander in Chief.\n  The President is insisting on carrying out the program he has in mind \nwith the addition of troops, a surge in Iraq, to try to restore order \nto that country. I believe had we known Saddam Hussein did not have \nweapons of mass destruction, we would not have gone into Iraq to start \nwith, but once there, we do not want to leave it in a state of turmoil. \nSo we are trying to work our way through the problems as best we can.\n  The President laid down two markers for the Iraqis in his State of \nthe Union speech: first, that they should secure Baghdad; and second, \nthat they should end sectarian violence. Regrettably, they have done \nneither.\n  Congress legislated, providing the funding the President asked for \nbut setting dates for withdrawal. The President vetoed that, saying \nidentifying a withdrawal date would be to tell the enemy how long they \nwould have to stay there to outlast us. Now we are looking for some \nresolution. It is complicated. The House is talking about appropriating \nhalf of the $100 billion and having another vote in July. The Senate \nhas yet to formulate a proposal.\n  For certain, by September, when we face the full $500 billion \nappropriation bill, there is a very difficult time ahead unless we can \nsee light at the end of the tunnel.\n  On the front page of the New York Times today, one of our Members \nsaid that in September there will not be support unless we see some \nsignificant progress. The metaphor ``light at the end of the tunnel'' \nperhaps is accurate or perhaps we will not be at that place. Because \nthere is grave concern about radical Islamic fundamentalists with the \ndetermination by radical Islamic fundamentalists to destroy our society \nand to kill us--as they did with the striking events of 9/11--there is \na concern if we do not fight the insurgents in Iraq, we will be \nfighting them in the United States.\n  These are weighty issues and there is a lot of controversy. Speaking \nfor myself, I am still considering what the right course is. I voted \nagainst a withdrawal date at this time because there has been a \ncommitment to a surge, 30,000 additional troops. They are not all there \nyet. Perhaps we will have better results by September. But those are \nthe issues which await a determination.\n  I reference this in terms of the big issue of the day and how it \nillustrates the functioning of American Government, Congress and the \nPresidency, and what we have as a constitutional confrontation.\n  I know the time has come to move on to other business. I thank my \ncolleagues and the Chair for permitting me to go beyond the 11 o'clock \nhour.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

All the new Army recruits there pass by it, and all the \nregulars know the story it tells by heart.\n  This plaque declares the Joint Readiness Center to be named after a \nKentucky soldier who volunteered for his country, served a cause he \nbelieved to be just and right, and made the ultimate sacrifice.\n  So I ask the Senate to pause today in grateful memory of SFC Robert \nV. Derenda, a Ledbetter, KY, resident assigned to the First Brigade, \n98th Division of the U.S. Army Reserve.\n  Sergeant Derenda was killed on August 5, 2005, when a civilian fuel \ntruck collided with the humvee he was driving as the lead vehicle for a \nconvoy mission in Rubiah, Iraq. He was 42 years old.\n  It could have been far worse if not for Robert's astute driving \nskills and rapid reaction. His quick maneuvering of the humvee just \nprior to impact saved his men in the back seat.\n\n[[Page S5682]]\n\n  Sergeant Derenda was there to act because he volunteered to drive the \nlead vehicle, knowing the likely danger inherent in his choice. He \nstepped forward because most of his fellow soldiers had wives and \nchildren at home. This final heroic act defined who Robert was, how he \nlived, and how he served the country he loved.\n  For his valorous actions as a soldier, Sergeant Derenda was made an \nhonorary Green Beret, and he received numerous awards and medals \nincluding the Purple Heart and the Silver Star.\n  Not only did the Army name a building after him in Fort Dix, NJ, but \na street also bears his name in his hometown of Cheektowaga, a suburb \nof Buffalo, NY.\n  Robert graduated from the State University of New York at Buffalo \nwith a degree in psychology. No doubt that degree, combined with his \nlong history of military service, is what molded him into a superb \ndrill sergeant. At Robert's funeral, MG Bruce E. Robinson called him a \n``natural'' at whipping young men into fighting shape.\n  After graduation, Robert served on active duty with the Army for 6 \nyears. He returned to his alma mater and earned a chemical engineering \ndegree while serving in the Army Reserve.\n  It was his work as an engineer that brought him to Calvert City, KY, \nleading Robert to live in nearby Ledbetter and call the Bluegrass State \nhome.\n  However, this outstanding leader was shaped by more than the work \nthat he so enjoyed. A cross-country runner in high school, Robert would \nreturn to his parents' home in New York each Thanksgiving to run in the \nannual Turkey Trot. When he wasn't running, you might see Robert on his \nHarley-Davidson motorcycle, cruising around town.\n  Robert was also a deeply religious man. A fellow soldier described \nhim as a ``good Catholic boy,'' and his priest, the Reverend Theodore \nC. Rog, said simply that when it came to Robert's faith, ``He lived \nit.''\n  Robert also cherished his relationship with his two nephews, Nicholas \nand Thomas Kibby. Although his sister, Caroline Kibby, raised her \nfamily in a town near Pittsburgh, Robert remained close. He left his \nentire estate to Caroline, but told her that should anything happen to \nhim, it was all to go to her boys.\n  His devotion to them, however, went deeper than any material wealth \nthat he could offer. Robert told Caroline that the reason he wanted to \ngo to Iraq with the Army was to make the world a safer place for \nNicholas and Thomas. He understood the dangers that lurked in the \nworld, and wanted his nephews never to know such evil.\n  Robert's beloved family members include his father, Valerian, his \nmother, Loretta, his sister, Caroline Kibby, his brother-in-law, Scott \nKibby, and his two nephews, Nicholas and Thomas Kibby. I ask the entire \nSenate to keep them in your thoughts and prayers. I know they will be \nin mine.\n  No plaque or street name can heal the tragic loss of the Derenda \nfamily after their beloved son, brother, and uncle has been taken from \nthem.\n  But there are two boys growing up near Pittsburgh right now who will \nalways remember the example their uncle set for them.\n  And a lifetime of family, friends, and fellow soldiers will be \ninspired by SFC Robert V. Derenda's noble act of sacrifice. Such \nexamples are worth far more than any bronze plaque could ever be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 1082, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1082) to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act to reauthorize and amend the prescription drug \n     user fee provisions, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Landrieu amendment No. 1004, to require the Food and Drug \n     Administration to permit the sale of baby turtles as pets so \n     long as the seller uses proven methods to effectively treat \n     salmonella.\n       Stabenow amendment No. 1011, to insert provisions related \n     to citizens petitions.\n       Brown (for Brownback/Brown) amendment No. 985, to establish \n     a priority drug review process to encourage treatments of \n     tropical diseases.\n       Vitter amendment No. 983, to require counterfeit-resistant \n     technologies for prescription drugs.\n       Inhofe amendment No. 988, to protect children and their \n     parents from being coerced into administering a controlled \n     substance in order to attend school.\n       Gregg/Coleman amendment No. 993, to provide for the \n     regulation of Internet pharmacies.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, we continue the discussion today on S. \n1082. I am joined by Senator Enzi as a cosponsor of that bill, with \nSenator Kennedy. We are considering several amendments this morning \nthat are designed to and will increase access to lifesaving \nprescription drugs. I wish for a moment to talk about a couple of those \namendments.\n  One is the Stabenow/Thune amendment No. 1011, cosponsored by Senator \nLott of Mississippi and by me, which will stop drug companies from \nintentionally jamming up the Food and Drug Administration approval \nprocess for generic drugs, exploiting the citizen petition process to \nblock price competition in the marketplace.\n  Free market economies rely on price competition. When brand-name drug \ncompanies block price competition, they are not only cheating generic \ndrug manufacturers, they are cheating consumers, businesses, and tax-\nfunded health care programs. None of us can afford that.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates the Stabenow amendment will \nsave taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars over the next 10 years. \nThose are just the savings that accrue to tax-funded health programs. \nThere will also be significant savings to consumers and employer-\nsponsored health plans.\n  This amendment preserves the rights, as we should, of citizens to \npetition their government. But it stops the gaming of the patent system \nby the name-brand drug companies which have very effectively stymied \nprice competition. I think unanimously in this body we support the \nwhole idea of price competition.\n  The savings of this bill will go to seniors and others who have seen \nlarge out-of-pocket expenses in their purchase of prescription drugs. \nThe savings will go to businesses helping us globally compete better \nthan we might otherwise. The savings will go to taxpayers, through a \nvariety of different Government programs that help people buy their \nprescription drugs. So every Member's support is crucial on the \nStabenow-Thune amendment.\n  I want to highlight an amendment that has been offered by my \ncolleague Senator Brownback and myself. According to the World Health \nOrganization, more than 1 billion people--nearly one in every six \npeople worldwide--are affected by at least one neglected tropical \ndisease. In addition, neglected tropical diseases claim roughly 500,000 \nlives each year.\n  However, less than 1 percent of the 1,400 drugs registered between \n1975 and 1999--over a 25-year-period--fewer than 1 percent of the 1,400 \ndrugs registered treated such diseases.\n  This disparity is clearly due to the lack of financial incentive for \npharmaceutical companies to bring neglected tropical disease treatments \nto market because these diseases disproportionately affect low-income \ncountries, with the poorest of the poor in those countries needing \nthose medicines, most of them in Africa.\n  Creating incentives for companies to invest in treatments for these \ndiseases is not only in our country's national interest, but it is \nconsistent with our longstanding tradition of caring for those who are \nless fortunate around the world. In other words, it is consistent with \nAmerican values.\n\n[[Page S5683]]\n\n  Senator Brownback's and my amendment would award a priority review \nvoucher to any company that brings a neglected tropical disease \ntreatment to market. Priority review is an existing FDA process by \nwhich drugs are reviewed in 6 months, as opposed to the average review \ntime of 18 months, significantly speeding the process.\n  The priority review voucher would be transferrable and could be \napplied to any drug in a company's pipeline. This amendment will help \nto bring about research and new drugs treating these tropical diseases \nand speed the process of getting them to market.\n  This voucher, which would be worth hundreds of millions of dollars \nfor a company with a new blockbuster drug, would also benefit \nconsumers. That is because it would give consumers earlier access to a \nnew prescription drug. Most importantly, creating incentives for \npharmaceutical companies to develop and to manufacture neglected and \ntropical disease treatments will save lives.\n  I commend Senator Brownback for his work on behalf of impoverished \npopulations who desperately need our attention. He is offering Members \nof this body an opportunity to simultaneously save lives in developing \nnations, give U.S. consumers access to new medicines more quickly, and \nengage the drug industry in a win-win proposition.\n  It is a rare opportunity. I urge Members on both sides of the aisle \nto support the Brownback-Brown amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Cochran amendment requires a \ncertification by the Secretary of Health and Human Services which we \nknow from previous experience now cannot or will not be made by the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services.\n  Therefore, I was going to ask the Senator from Wyoming a couple of \nquestions, if at some point he might come back so I can engage him in a \ncolloquy.\n  The point of the Cochran amendment is that it will now nullify the \nentire amendment that was offered by myself, Senator Snowe, and 33 \nother Senators who had cosponsored the amendment. I wanted to point out \nthat in the amendment, it not only allowed for reimportation of \nprescription drugs--FDA-approved prescription drugs from other \ncountries whose chain of custody was identical or virtually identical \nto ours so that the American people would have access to lower priced, \nFDA-approved prescription drugs--but we also included in that \namendment, which would now be nullified because the Secretary of HHS \nwill not be able to certify, counterfeit-resistant technologies.\n  Now, I believe those counterfeit-resistant technologies are as \napplicable to our existing drug supply domestically as they are to any \npotential imports that would be brought into this country.\n  I want to read just a couple of comments about this. Then I would \nlike, if the Senator from Wyoming would be willing, to entertain some \nquestions or at least engage in a colloquy on this subject. I would \nlike to discuss with him the provisions in the bill that would be \nnullified by Senator Cochran's amendment because the Secretary could \nnot certify, and so all of the amendments that we offered would be \nnullified. The provisions dealing with counterfeit-resistant \ntechnologies, it seems to me, probably should proceed because all of us \nare concerned about the issue of counterfeit drugs, whether it is \nthrough reimportation or counterfeit drugs in the existing drug supply.\n  All of the discussions about counterfeit drugs that have been had on \nthe floor of the Senate have nothing to do with reimportation; it has \nto do with the existing circumstances. So the counterfeit-resistant \ntechnologies, that portion of the amendment--which will also now be \nnullified--I think should be restored. I have offered a second-degree \namendment to do that, simply to restore for the current drug supply in \nthis country the safety provisions that would exist with respect to the \ncounterfeit-resistant technologies.\n  Let me read it for a moment. The provisions in the amendment were, \nthe packaging of any prescription drugs would incorporate, one, a \nstandardized numerical identifier unique to each package of such drug \napplied at the point of manufacturing and repackaging, in which case \nthe numerical identifier shall be linked to the numerical identifier \napplied at the point of manufacturing; and, two, overt optically \nvariable, counterfeit-resistant technologies that are visible to the \nnaked eye, providing for visual identification of product authenticity \nwithout the need for readers, microscopes, lighting devices, or \nscanners, similar to that used by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing \nto secure U.S. currency, that are manufactured and distributed in a \nhighly secure, tightly controlled environment.\n  But the point is, I held up a twenty-dollar bill yesterday on the \nfloor of the Senate and said: This has designed into it--the \narchitecture of this counterfeit-resistant bill has designed into it a \nlot of protections in order to prevent counterfeiting of the twenty-\ndollar bill.\n\n  We are all concerned about the counterfeiting of prescription drugs, \nso we have put a provision in the amendment that we had offered, \nsomething called counterfeit-resistant technology. My point is, it \nseems to me we should at least make that apply to the domestic drug \nsupply, even if we have already made a decision we are going to nullify \nthe opportunity for reimportation.\n  We will come back to that decision later. The Senate will debate that \nagain and vote on that again. But for now, at least, it seems to me we \nshould not lose the provisions of that amendment dealing with \ncounterfeit-resistant technologies.\n  Might I ask the Senator from Wyoming, the ranking member on the \ncommittee, his feeling about adding that provision that would, I think, \nsubstantially safeguard the domestic drug supply?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I appreciate the question. I appreciate the \neffort that has gone into adding ways the drug supply can be more safe \nin the United States. Of course, we are interested in that. The primary \nfocus of the bill was to make sure the U.S. drug supply was as safe as \npossible.\n  There were a number of amendments, one of which was withdrawn last \nnight, that dealt with Internet sales. That could have been Internet \nsales in the United States as well as Internet sales outside of the \nUnited States. The reason it was withdrawn is the sponsor of it did not \nwant it to get polarized into a debate as to whether that would undo \nwhat you have been working on. It was not. It was to add some more \nsafety and security.\n  Senator Kennedy and I have been working on this FDA bill for over \n2\\1/2\\ years now. We also have been working on some things that deal \nwith pedigree and licensure in the United States as well as outside of \nthe United States. We did not put that in. We didn't want it to be \nsomething, again, that would polarize people and maybe distract from \nbeing able to do it at a very logical time.\n  So most of our effort right now is to make sure we do not enter into \nsome budget points of order, that we are able to accomplish the bill \nand get it to conference where additional changes will be made.\n  Our committee works maybe differently from others; I am not sure. I \nknow it works differently from the Banking Committee that I also serve \non. It has been one of the most contentious committees in the Senate. \nBut over the last 2\\1/2\\ years we have changed that perspective a bit \nand really accomplished a lot.\n  One of the biggest changes we have had is the way that we do a bill. \nBefore we tried to stuff it at every possible opportunity; that meant \nin committee as well. You will notice this bill had only 1 day of \nmarkup. That is phenomenal for that committee. Three days a week is not \nunusual for the committee. We got it out of there in 1 week, which \nhelped us to understand the concerns of the people on the committee.\n\n[[Page S5684]]\n\n  We promised to work on that when it went to the Senate floor. We have \nworked on it after it came to the floor. More amendments have been put \nin. We have worked with people. Senator Durbin had one on food safety. \nWe worked with him and got that in; anything that does not appear to \npolarize, does not appear to add budget points of order, and things \nthat have been considered before, we are trying to work into this bill. \nNew concepts, we would like to talk about them a little bit more, \nexplore them a little bit more, but we want everything to be as safe as \npossible. That is what we are working for.\n  There are some huge costs that may potentially be involved in what \nyou are talking about there. If the costs add to the costs of drugs, \nthen someone has to pay it. Then, perhaps, we will be making less \naccess to drugs. We do not want that, and I know you don't want that. \nYour focus has been on getting lower cost drugs to everyone.\n  It is the same with the amendment that Senator Stabenow has. We have \nworked on that for days. It is a concept that we have been working on \nbefore and held some hearings on. I think we have arrived at some \ncompromises to put that in. We are trying to wind up with some \nbipartisan things that we can do to get it to conference where more can \nbe done. And some of these issues we have revisited.\n  We are one of the busy committees on the Hill. We are holding a \nhearing as we speak. I had to leave that to come over to the floor to \ndo just exactly this.\n  I appreciate the Senator's efforts and ideas and creativity. I hope \nhe will work with us.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his response. It is \ntrue the bill on the floor of the Senate is a bill dealing with drug \nsafety. But I think it is also the case that a lot of the discussion on \nthe floor of the Senate has been about counterfeiting and about the \npotential danger counterfeiting would pose with respect to \nreimportation, and also the danger counterfeiting poses with respect to \nthe existing drug supply.\n  If that is the case, it seems illogical to me not to include \npedigrees and serial numbers and RFID technology and the latest \ncounterfeit technology in this bill. What we had done with 33 of us \ncosponsoring the reimportation bill is, we understood with respect to \nreimportation you need to be sure it is safe before you proceed.\n  So we drafted a section on that, consulting with all of the experts. \nWe spent a lot of time on it. We have worked on it for a couple of \nyears now. That section, it seems to me, would vastly improve the \nunderlying bill. Maybe it is not a consensus. I understand the \npharmaceutical industry does not want to do pedigree and serial \nnumbers, and so on, the way we have described it. But it seems to me it \ncertainly should be the case that we add as much as we can to this \nbill--not load it down but add as much as we can on the issue of \nprotecting against counterfeit drugs, whether it is through \nreimportation or the domestic drug supply.\n  I guess I do not quite understand--I don't believe there is a budget \npoint of order. I don't believe we are talking about any dramatic new \ncosts. In any event, I would expect we should not have a tradeoff of a \nless safe drug supply versus the cost of the drug. I think all of us \nwant the same thing. I believe Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi would \nboth want the safest possible drug supply we could have.\n  Again, I come back to this notion of, we spend a lot of time worrying \nabout how to detect a counterfeit twenty-dollar bill, and we have \nengineered substantial safety precautions. Why should we not do the \nsame with respect to this bottle of Lipitor, if I might have consent to \nshow it again.\n  This is produced in Ireland. It contains a 20-milligram tablet of \nLipitor to lower cholesterol. Why would we not want something on this \nbottle from the manufacturer that gives us the opportunity to \nunderstand the pedigree, the serial number, and so on? There are some \nmarkings on it, but we can do much better. That is the purpose of my \noffering a second-degree amendment, to preserve the counterfeiting and \nsafety standard a bipartisan group of us has created. I would be happy \nto yield for a response if the Senator wishes.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I would like to respond.\n  I like his example of the twenty-dollar bill or any other \ndenomination. This has nothing to do with the pharmaceutical companies. \nThis is a discussion Senator Kennedy and I have had ongoing for a long \ntime, and we brought in some technical people to figure out how we can \nprovide that security in a number of different ways. The way that \ndiffers from the twenty-dollar bill is that for everybody who handles--\nnot everybody, most people--twenty-dollar bills on a regular basis, the \nsame design stays in play for a long time. But with the pill bottle, \nmaybe the first pill bottle one gets will be the only pill bottle. \nHaving the knowledge of what exactly to look for on there is not \nsomething we teach in school or in pharmacies or anywhere else. It has \nto be something that people can tell whether it truly is. That is what \nadds to the cost when it comes to pharmaceuticals. We are looking at \ninventors who are coming up with different ways all the time to make \nthings secure, not just medicines. We haven't found the answer yet.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Might I ask the question, are you moving in your \ncommittee toward requiring a pedigree and serial numbers? Is that where \nyou are going to move in committee to have consensus? That is what I \nunderstand.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, that is correct. We have been working on a \npedigree and licensure amendment--it is actually structured as a \nseparate bill--in anticipation of trying to add to this when we can \nfind a solution that we feel comfortable with, and we haven't gotten \nthere yet. I think we are close, but we haven't gotten there yet. It \nhas been a joint effort with Senator Kennedy and I and both our staffs.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I may further, this is the first I \nunderstand that there is an issue with the anticounterfeit measures we \nhave put in our reimportation bill. We have the counterfeit-resistant \ntechnologies that we have put in the bill. I guess if I hear the \nSenator from Wyoming correctly, he is not comfortable with those at \nthis point. I had thought the issue was generally the philosophy of \nreimportation and pricing. Then I think we have a deeper chasm than I \nexpected. I thought there was generally consensus that the technology \nthat now exists, whether it is RFID or lots of new things that are \navailable, the technology that exists should be used with respect to \nthe latest available technology to resist counterfeiting. I thought \nthere was perhaps a consensus on that. Maybe I was wrong. If there is a \ndisagreement about whether we should have standardized identifiers, \nthen I suppose there should be some hearings on that. I had thought we \nwere beyond that point.\n  That was the purpose of my offering a second-degree amendment. I did \nnot expect it would be controversial to apply, whether it is to the \ndomestic drug supply or the potential reimportation at some future \npoint, the counterfeit-resistant technologies that already exist to be \nmade available if we simply require it.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, another technicality that we work on on this \nand a principle we have established that works well for the committee \nis we try not to be ultraspecific on what we are doing so that we are \npicking winners and losers. That is a difficulty we had with the \namendment the Senator proposed as well. Not that it can't be worked \nwith and come up with something that fits the criteria of the \nprinciple. One of the difficulties of debating things on the floor as a \nnew amendment and unamendable is that usually there are other ideas, \nsome principles, other ways of working with it that are very difficult \nto do from the floor standpoint.\n  That is why we start with the markup and some of the other things and \nkeep working with them. I think you have to admit this has been pretty \nprogressive in trying to get something done. There hasn't been the \neffort to stall things out. There has been a lot of opportunities to do \nthat, but we have been trying to keep things going and hope to get \nsomething finished up on this bill so it can get to conference.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I certainly don't intend to stall this \nbill. This legislation is going to pass. I indicated yesterday I wanted \nto see what was in the managers' package. Several\n\n[[Page S5685]]\n\nof the proposed amendments, even at that point when I saw the package, \nwere still under some reform or some change. Having reviewed it now, I \ncan tell my colleagues I have no difficulty with the baby turtle \nprovision, the pet baby turtle provision. I considered that at great \nlength last night. I stayed awake considering it. But I decided to \nsupport the baby turtle provision and the tanning bed provision, for \nthat matter, along with ginseng. I understand these are things that are \nbeing adjusted in the managers' package.\n  I have looked through it. I don't have a problem with the specifics \nof the managers' package. My issue today was to come to talk about the \ncounterfeit-resistant technologies that will be available to fight the \nissue of counterfeit drugs. The reason I felt it important to do that, \nmost of the discussion to defeat the Dorgan-Snowe amendment and to \nimpose the Cochran amendment was because of the discussion on the \nfloor, what if we get counterfeit drugs under this proposal. So the \ndiscussion was all about not the counterfeit drugs that have come in \nunder the proposal but the counterfeit drugs that have already come in \nunder existing circumstances. My thought is, if counterfeiting is a big \nproblem, then the underlying bill dealing with drug safety should have \nthe strongest possible provisions relating to counterfeit-resistant \ntechnologies. That is regrettably not the case.\n  I will end up voting for this bill when we get to final passage \nbecause it is a step forward. But it is not out there where it ought to \nbe with respect to counterfeit-resistant technologies. I understand \npart of the reason is the pharmaceutical industry is not supportive of \nmoving as far as we should move. At any rate, I appreciate the Senator \nresponding to me. Frankly, it is fine on the floor to have a \ndiscussion. I don't think all discussion ought to be somewhere in \ncommittee. We ought to have pretty interesting discussions on the floor \nabout what is in a bill and what is not, what we ought to add that \nwould improve it. But I appreciate the Senator from Wyoming responding \nto me. As I indicated, I have a second-degree amendment along with a \ncouple of others.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, Senator Dorgan is offering an important \ncompromise. He is saying we should at least preserve the drug safety \nprovisions in his reimportation amendment. These provisions are the \nresult of significant discussion with public safety experts, and I \nbelieve the Senate should support the Dorgan amendment. Whether we \nagree on the issue of reimportation--and there is clearly a split in \nthis body--we do agree on the importance of safety in our domestic \nsupply. There have clearly been attempts to counterfeit inside the \ndomestic supply. The Dorgan amendment brings us to a place that can \nhelp us answer those questions. I think the opponents to reimportation \nare wrong, but I understand they raise issues of drug safety. Those \nsame issues of counterfeiting are present in our domestic supply, as \nSenator Dorgan said, under the law, under the situation we are in \ntoday.\n  It sort of begs the larger question of drug safety overall. One of \nthe worst ways we compromise drug safety is by limiting access to \naffordable prescription drugs. That limitation of access is because of \nthe high cost of prescription drugs. Too many of us know of situations \nwhere people have said to me, in Zanesville and Lima and Toledo and \nCleveland: I had to cut a prescription in half so they last twice as \nlong or I took the pills every other day. Until we can find ways, which \nthis bill takes some steps in that direction with the citizen petition \nprocess and other things, of getting lower cost prescription drugs into \npeople's hands when their doctors prescribe them, the reimportation \nissue was one way we could have done that better. I am hopeful we can \nwork with Senator Dorgan on some of these issues to bring us to the \npoint that we are satisfied that the domestic supply for prescription \ndrugs is as safe as it can be.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Ohio for his \ncomments. But I wish to give a little bit more of an answer to the \nSenator from North Dakota, who has invested a lot of time and effort \nover the years in a variety of these issues that deal with the safety \nof our drug supply. I have to tell him, we got his second-degree \namendment. Anything we have had has been a very cursory look. We are \nwilling to sit down. We hope his staff will sit down with my staff and \ntake a look at it and see what can be done.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Might I point out, the second-degree amendment is \nlanguage taken out of the Dorgan-Snowe bill that we filed months and \nmonths ago. It is identical language with respect to counterfeit-\nresistant technology. It is not new language.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am hoping that since we did not have a \nchance on drug importation--and I wish to make the point that that is \nimportation, not reimportation--we didn't have a chance to sit down and \nwork on that and work through it and see what changes could be made, it \nwould only be logical that for a portion of that, we probably ought to \nsit down and look at it. We are never sure on a second-degree amendment \nwhether it is exactly the same, but we didn't have the opportunity to \nwork on it with the Senator. I think all the staffs that have been \nworking on this have been working in a bipartisan way to come up with a \nsolution. We will take a look at that specifically and see what can be \ndone with it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment which I filed last \nweek with Senator Bingaman on conflict-of-interest issues before the \nadvisory committees of the Food and Drug Administration. I understand \nthere may be an objection--I hope there is not--to setting aside the \npending amendment and calling this one up for consideration. I don't \nwant to catch anyone off guard with my request. I hope the Senator from \nWyoming will note what I am about to request. If it is not consistent \nwith his current wishes, I am asking unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and that we move to amendment No. 1034 which I \nhave filed at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENZI. Reserving the right to object, there are several other \npeople in that same position of wanting to call up amendments. We are \ntrying to come up with a logical order, so I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator. I wouldn't take it personally. The \nissue I am raising here needs to be dispelled.\n  What is the Food and Drug Administration? It is a relatively small \nFederal agency with a huge responsibility. We spend about $1.7 billion \na year on the Food and Drug Administration in a huge Federal budget. \nThis tiny agency is responsible for the safety of about 25 percent of \nall that we purchase as Americans. They have responsibility when it \ncomes to drugs, devices, biologics, food, veterinary medicines, all \nsorts of things, equipment. This small agency has a huge \nresponsibility. We give them more and more things to do, and we trust \nthe integrity of the Food and Drug Administration. We believe the Food \nand Drug Administration giving its approval means something. We can \ntrust it. They have reached a decision that something we are about to \nbuy is safe and effective. For most Americans, that is the seal of \napproval.\n  How do they reach that level of integrity? They set up advisory \ncommittees. These are the wisest men and women they can find who take a \nclose look at each one of the things they review and inspect to \ndetermine whether they truly are safe and effective. It is kind of a \njury. The jury may be 10, 20, 30 different people who sit and make a \ndecision.\n  These decisions are critically important. I don't think I overstate \nit when I say these decisions are life-and-death decisions. They will \ndecide that a certain pill which a pharmaceutical company says will \nhelp you with your heart condition, in fact, is safe to take and is \neffective, it will do what it is supposed to do. If they make a bad \ndecision and the pill is not safe, a person's health can be \njeopardized. So truly these are life-and-death decisions the advisory \ncommittees make at the\n\n[[Page S5686]]\n\nFood and Drug Administration. In addition, these are very important \neconomic decisions. Giving the seal of approval for a new drug means \nfor that drug company the potential of making millions, if not \nbillions, of dollars. So the stakes are high. Each time the advisory \ncommittee makes a decision, they know lives are on the line, and they \nalso know a thumbs-up and a decision of approval can mean the stock of \nthis company is going to rise, their profits will rise, they will make \nmore money for shareholders, and they will have more money for \nresearch. It is a big undertaking.\n\n  So it is not unfair for us to ask: Who are the people who sit on \nthese advisory committees? Who are the people who are the jurors who \ntry to impartially look at these issues and decide what is best for the \nAmerican people?\n  Well, it turns out we have had some problems--some significant \nproblems--in the past. One would think it would be obvious to us that \nwe don't want to appoint people to sit on the juries, on the advisory \ncommittees, who have a conflict of interest. What about someone who is \non the payroll of the pharmaceutical company that wants a drug \napproved; would you want that person sitting on the advisory committee? \nWhat about someone who has earned $50,000 coincidentally speaking to \nthis company's annual retreat in some Caribbean island; would you want \nthat person on the advisory committee? What about someone who is on the \npayroll receiving money from a company that can stand to make millions \nof dollars if the decision goes the right way? The natural human \nreaction is: Well, shouldn't those people sit somewhere else? They \nshouldn't really be in the room if we are talking about their employer, \nif we are talking about someone who has paid them money. They shouldn't \nbe part of this, should they? We want people sitting in that room who \ndon't have any conflict of interest or any vested interest in the \ndecision. We want people who are truly objective, dispassionate, and \ntruthful. I think most Americans would agree. That is pretty obvious.\n  Well, it turns out that over time the Food and Drug Administration \ngot a little bit lax, a little bit sloppy. Back 7 or 8 years ago, USA \nToday published a dramatic expose about these advisory committees. They \ncame to the conclusion that the experts sitting on these advisory \ncommittees who were supposed to be independent many times had a direct \nfinancial interest in the decision they were about to make. How often \ndid it occur? In 92 percent of the advisory committee meetings--this \ngoes back 7 or 8 years now, but in 92 percent of the meetings, at least \none member sitting in that room deliberating had a financial conflict \nof interest. At more than half of the meetings, half or more of the \nmembers of the committee had a conflict of interest. What difference \ndoes it make? Does it make any difference if the person deciding the \nfate of a product that means profit or loss for a major corporation is \non the payroll of that corporation? I think it does. It turns out it \nwas a problem then, which the Food and Drug Administration started to \naddress but, unfortunately, has not addressed effectively.\n  Last week, a study by the New England Journal of Medicine, widely \nrecognized and respected, examined the pharmaceutical industry's \nfinancial ties to doctors. Here is what they found:\n\n       More than one-third of doctors report being reimbursed by \n     the drug industry for the cost of attending professional \n     meetings and continuing medical education; and almost 30 \n     percent said they had been paid for consulting, giving \n     lectures, or signing up patients for clinical trials.\n\n  So when it comes to doctors in general, it turns out that a third of \nthem have a conflict of interest. So any patient walking into a \ndoctor's office and the doctor says: You know, I think you should take \nXYZ drug, you would like to believe that doctor made that decision \nbecause they think that is the best drug for you or a member of your \nfamily. It is worrisome that in some instances, these doctors have a \nconflict of interest.\n  The New England Journal of Medicine also went on to say, in the words \nof a prominent Harvard expert, Jerry Avorn, the ``penetration of \ncommerce into the province of science'' causes great concern. It is the \nsame issue here when it comes to these advisory committees.\n  Now, the argument that comes back from the FDA and from the \npharmaceutical industry is there just aren't enough smart people out \nthere. We have to turn our employees and people we have on the payroll \nand people we have paid money to into these advisory committees because \nthere aren't enough good people out there to sit on these advisory \ncommittees.\n  Well, I think the New York Times made a good observation when it \ncomes to that. Here is what they said:\n\n       Unless the Food and Drug Administration makes a more \n     aggressive effort to find unbiased experts or medical \n     researchers to start severing their ties with industry, a \n     whiff of bias may taint the verdicts of many advisory panels.\n\n  Here is what they have found over and over again: These conflicts of \ninterest can cause a problem.\n  Let's be very specific. In February of 2005, an FDA advisory \ncommittee considering the painkillers Vioxx, Bextra, and Celebrex, \nwhether they should be sold to the public. There were 10 scientists \nsitting on that advisory committee who had conflicts of interest. They \nhad some financial connection with the companies that made the products \nthey were judging. Had the votes of those 10 scientists been excluded \nbecause of their conflicts of interest, the panel would have favored \nwithdrawing Bextra from the market and blocking the return of Vioxx. \nInstead, with the 10 conflicted scientists and experts, they voted that \nthe drugs return to the market. These drugs were very dangerous. People \nwere having heart problems and other medical difficulties. They should \nnever have been brought back to the market.\n  What impact did the presence of these people with conflicts of \ninterest have on the deliberations? It could not have been positive. It \ncould not have been objective. They came to this with some financial \ninterest, at least in the companies that were affected by the decision.\n  Here is what my amendment does. The amendment says the Food and Drug \nAdministration would be limited to only one waiver per advisory \ncommittee meeting.\n  Mr. President, I understand under a previous consent order that we \nare moving at 12:15 to the consideration of a judge who will be voted \non in 20 minutes, Judge Kapala of Illinois. I would like to have the \ntime start on that. I ask unanimous consent to close my remarks on my \namendment, say a few words about Judge Kapala, and then the remaining \n10 minutes for Senator Specter to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will be very brief because I see Senator \nSpecter is on the floor.\n  So what I am trying to do is make sure we only have one waiver per \nmeeting, one person sitting on that advisory committee per meeting who \nmight have a conflict of interest.\n  We go on to say that any person with a financial interest could \nprovide information to an Advisory Committee but can't be participating \nin or voting on the final decision. I think that only makes sense.\n  The third thing we say is that the Food and Drug Administration has \nto actively promote more objective scientific experts without conflicts \nof interest.\n  I don't think this is a radical proposal. Don't we want peace of mind \nat the end of the day that the advisory committee has made a decision \nbased on science and medicine and what is good for America as opposed \nto the bottom-line profit-and-loss statement of the pharmaceutical \ncompany?\n  There is a lot of discussion on this floor about the safety of drugs \nand the products that the FDA considers. I hope this amendment, which \nis critical to the integrity of the FDA, is approved by my colleagues \non a bipartisan basis. I hope to offer this amendment tomorrow after we \nhave gone through this rough procedural patch.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/08/senate-section/article/S5687-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5687-S5689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5687]]\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF FREDERICK J. KAPALA TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n                 FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 11:50 \na.m. having arrived, the Senate will proceed to executive session for \nconsideration of Executive Calendar No. 84, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Frederick J. Kapala, of \nIllinois, to be United States District Judge for the Northern District \nof Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say a few words about Judge Kapala. \nFrederick Kapala has been nominated by Senator Obama and myself to be a \nFederal district court judge in the Northern District of Illinois. \nJudge Kapala has served with distinction as a State court judge in \nIllinois for the past quarter century, and he has earned a great \nreputation. It is a very positive thing to say that 99 percent of the \nattorneys surveyed gave Judge Kapala a positive recommendation for his \ntemperament, integrity, and management skills. He had a unanimous \nrating of ``well qualified'' by the American Bar Association, the \nhighest rating a nominee can receive. He has been judged by many to be \nan excellent candidate for the Federal bench.\n  I have met with him personally. I have met his family. I like this \nman. I think he will serve our judiciary well. I hope when we vote on \nthis in a few minutes he will receive an overwhelming vote of support.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I support the nomination of Judge Frederick \nJ. Kapala to serve as a judge on the United States District Court for \nthe Northern District of Illinois. Judge Kapala's career exemplifies a \nstrong commitment to public service. He currently serves as an \nappellate judge on the Second District Appellate Court in Illinois, a \nposition he has held since 2001. Prior to his service on the Second \nDistrict Appellate Court, Judge Kapala was a circuit court judge for \nthe 17th Judicial Circuit for Winnebago and Boone Counties for 7 years. \nPrior to that service, Judge Kapala was an Associate Circuit Court \nJudge for the same circuit for 12 years.\n  After graduating from the University of Illinois College of Law in \n1976, Judge Kapala became an assistant State's attorney in Winnebago \nCounty. He made a brief foray into private practice, joining the law \nfirm of Pedderson, Menzimer, Conde, Stoner, and Killoren in Rockford \nfrom 1977 to 1982.\n  Judge Kapala is a magna cum laude graduate of Marquette University. \nHe proudly served his country in the U.S. Army on both Active and \nReserve duty from 1970 to 1980.\n  Judge Kapala has dedicated his life and career to the public good. \nWhether it was his military service or his judicial service to the good \npeople of Rockford and the counties of Winnebago and Boone, Judge \nKapala has served with compassion and distinction.\n  I am pleased to join the Senate in confirming him to the United \nStates District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Illinois \nwho has spoken in support of the nomination of Judge Frederick J. \nKapala to be a U.S. district court judge for the Northern District of \nIllinois. He has an outstanding academic record--graduating magma cum \nlaude from Marquette University in 1972, where he was Phi Beta Kappa. \nHe obtained his law degree from the University of Illinois, where he \nwas a moot court board member.\n  He has a professional career which is diversified and with extensive \njudicial experience. From 1970 to 1980, Judge Kapala served our country \nin the United States Army, on both active and reserve duty. He obtained \nthe rank of Captain before his honorable discharge. Upon graduation \nfrom law school, he was assistant State's attorney--that is the \nprosecuting attorney in Illinois--for 1 year. He then practiced law for \n5 years. He has been an associate circuit court judge from 1982 to 1994 \nand a circuit court judge for 7 years, until 2001. Since 2001, he has \nbeen an appellate court justice for the State of Illinois. He has \nextensive community activities. He was rated by the American Bar \nAssociation as unanimously ``well qualified.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my \nremarks, a summary of Judge Kapala's curriculum vitae be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. My sense from prior confirmation proceedings and votes \nin the Senate is that Judge Kapala will receive a strong vote, probably \nunanimous.\n\n\n                           Immigration Reform\n\n  In the remaining time, I will discuss what we are doing on the \nimmigration bill because there have been so many inquiries.\n  We all know the history of the immigration legislation from the 109th \nCongress. The Judiciary Committee reported out a bill. It came to the \nfloor of the Senate, with many amendments, and it was passed with \nsubstantial bipartisan support. The House of Representatives had a very \ndifferent configuration on the bill. They were concerned only with the \nborder security, contrasted with the Senate bill, which was a \ncomprehensive bill.\n  We have had numerous meetings in an effort to structure a consensus \nbill in the course of the last many weeks. For many weeks, we met on \nTuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday from 4 o'clock to 6 o'clock, with as \nmany as a dozen Republican Senators present, with the Secretary of \nHomeland Security and the Secretary of Commerce present. We have had \nsubstantial White House involvement reflecting the President's \nstatement that he wants a comprehensive immigration reform bill. We \nhave spent many hours on extended meetings with Democrats. There were \nhalf a dozen Democrats attending these meetings and a rather unique \nprocess illustrated last week where we met for 2\\1/2\\ hours with a \ndozen Senators being present. It is pretty hard to keep a dozen \nSenators sitting in one room at one time going over a great many ideas. \nWe have come to an agreement on what we have called a ``grand \nbargain,'' which is the outline of an immigration bill.\n  There is no doubt that we need to protect our borders and we have \nlegislated for fencing. We want to provide fencing to protect the major \nmetropolitan areas, and we can't have a fence for the entire length of \nthe border. We have proposed and are prepared to enact legislation \nwhich would provide for 6,000 additional Border Patrol agents to bring \nthe number to 12,000. We are proposing very strong employer sanctions. \nWe do not want employment in the United States to be a magnet for \nillegal immigration, and it is now technically possible to have \nfoolproof identification. It can be costly and we are still working \nthrough the details, but there is no doubt we want to secure the border \nand stop illegal immigration as the first item.\n  We are talking about triggers so that we don't move ahead to dealing \nwith the 11 million undocumented immigrants or dealing with a temporary \nworker program until we have solved the problem of securing the border \nand providing for identification so that there is a basis for using \ntough sanctions on the employers. But you can't do that unless they \nhave a fair opportunity to know who is legal and who is illegal.\n  We are rejecting the idea of amnesty for the 11 million undocumented \nimmigrants. They are going to have to earn being on the citizenship \npath at the end. It will be required that they pay taxes, have \ncommunity roots, have a substantial period of employment, and that they \nlearn English. We are going to do our best to deport those who have \ncriminal records. There is a real security risk with some of the \nundocumented immigrants who have criminal records and where they do \ncommit crimes. It is a practical impossibility to deport 11 million \nundocumented immigrants.\n  We are trying to structure a temporary worker program which is \ntemporary, coming only for the purpose of filling needs and then \nreturning to their in native countries. We are looking at a system so \nthat if there are U.S.\n\n[[Page S5688]]\n\ncitizens, people in this country who can take the jobs, they will have \nthe first choice.\n  The majority leader has stated publicly his intention to proceed \nunder rule XIV and file a bill this week--perhaps tomorrow, and it will \nbe listed for floor debate next Monday. There is a lot of concern among \nRepublicans about proceeding in that way with concern that the bill \nthat was reported out of committee does not have widespread support and \nthe bill that passed the Senate does not have widespread support. And \nthat there is a disinclination how it will go. Nobody knows for sure, \nbut there is a disinclination to support a motion to proceed, raising \nthe possibility that there may be a filibuster there.\n  There is a concern in many quarters that we need more time. We have \nbeen proceeding diligently with very extended meetings. I have to \nconfess there has been a fair amount of wheel spinning, but that we are \nnot ready to proceed next Monday on the 14th to take up the bill the \nlast 2 weeks before Memorial Day, as the leader has scheduled. I can \nunderstand the majority leader's concern about moving ahead and holding \nour feet to the fire to try to produce a bill but we are still working \non it. Staff worked over the weekend. There was a meeting at the White \nHouse on Sunday. I had an extended discussion yesterday with Senator \nKennedy. Senator Kennedy met with one of the Secretaries, and we are \nworking at top speed.\n  It will certainly be preferable if we can come up with a bill that \nwould not have to have S. 2611, which passed the Senate last year or \nthe chairman's mark or the bill that came out of Judiciary. I have been \nasked about this every time I step into the corridor, so I thought it \nwould be useful to give this brief summary, without impacting on \nSenator Leahy's time. I will note that some Democratic time on the \njudicial nomination was taken up by Senator Durbin earlier.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         Frederick Joseph Kapala, Northern District of Illinois\n\n       Judge Frederick Joseph Kapala was first nominated on \n     December 6, 2006. He was renominated on January 9, 2007. A \n     hearing was held on his nomination on March 13, 2007, and he \n     was unanimously reported out of the Judiciary Committee on \n     April 25, 2007.\n       Judge Kapala has truly outstanding academic and \n     professional qualifications.\n       He received his B.A. magma cum laude, in 1972 from \n     Marquette University where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa \n     and Pi Gamma Mu (social science honors). He received his J.D. \n     from the University of Illinois College of Law in 1976. \n     During law school, he participated in Moot Court and served \n     as a member of the Moot Court Board.\n       From 1970 to 1980, Judge Kapala served our country in the \n     United States Army, on both active and reserve duty. He \n     obtained the rank of Captain before his honorable discharge.\n       After graduation from law school, Judge Kapala served for \n     one year as an Assistant State's Attorney in the County of \n     Winnebago, Illinois before joining the law firm of Pedderson, \n     Menzimer, Conde, Stoner and Killoren in 1977. He practiced \n     both litigation and transactional law with that firm until \n     1982.\n       Between 1981 and 1982, he also served part time as a \n     Special Assistant Attorney General in the Illinois Attorney \n     General's Office, prosecuting consumer fraud cases.\n       As a practitioner, Judge Kapala tried over 100 cases to \n     verdict.\n       In 1982, Judge Kapala was first appointed to the state \n     court bench as an Associate Circuit Court Judge for the 17th \n     Judicial Circuit, a state trial court. While serving in this \n     office, he was presiding judge of the juvenile court in \n     Winnebago County from 1989 until 1991.\n       In 1994, Judge Kapala was first elected a full Circuit \n     Court Judge in the same circuit, and since then, he has been \n     re-elected twice. During his tenure in this capacity, Judge \n     Kapala was appointed as the presiding judge of the criminal \n     court division in Winnebago County from 1995 until 2001. In \n     2001, he was assigned to serve as a Judge of the Appellate \n     Court of Illinois, Second District.\n       The ABA unanimously rated Mr. Kapala as ``Well Qualified.''\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from Vermont \nhave?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized for 6 \nminutes.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Leahy pertaining to the introduction of S. 1327 \nand S. 1328 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are making significant progress today \nwith another confirmation of a lifetime appointment to the Federal \nbench. I am sure Frederick J. Kapala will be confirmed for the District \nCourt for the Northern District of Illinois. His nomination is \nsupported by the home State Senators. I thank Senator Durbin for \nchairing the hearing on this nomination.\n  Judge Kapala serves as a state appellate judge on the Second District \nAppellate Court in Illinois. He has almost 20 years of experience as a \nstate trial court judge. Before coming to the bench, he worked for the \nRockford, Illinois law firm of Pedderson, Menzimer, Conde, Stoner and \nKilloren, and he worked as an Assistant State's Attorney in Winnebago \nCounty. Prior to his legal career, he served 10 years in the U.S. Army.\n  This will be the 17th judicial confirmation this year. The calendar \njust turned to the month of May, it is spring, and we have already \nconfirmed as many judges as were confirmed during the entire 1996 \nsession, when President Clinton's nominees were being reviewed by the \nRepublican-controlled Senate majority. We have done as much in May in a \nDemocrat-controlled Senate as the Republican-controlled Senate did in a \nwhole year for President Clinton. That was a session when not a single \ncircuit court nominee was confirmed. Of course, we have already \nconfirmed two circuit court nominees in the early months of this \nsession.\n  I mention this because it is somewhat frustrating to hear the gross \nmisstatements made by some of the Republican leaders, such as Vice \nPresident Cheney, Mr. Rove, and others, who speak for the President on \nthe pace of judicial nominees. Not only is this the 17th judicial \nconfirmation this year, it is also the 117th judicial confirmation in \nthe approximately 2 years I have served as Judiciary chairman over the \npast 6 years. That exceeds by more than a dozen the confirmations \nSenator Hatch presided over during the 2 years he was Judiciary \nchairman. It also exceeds by more than a dozen the district court \nnominees confirmed during the two years he was Judiciary Chairman.\n  With the confirmation of Judge Hardiman to the Third Circuit earlier \nthis year, the total circuit court confirmations achieved during my \nchairmanships, which have not yet extended over the 24 months of \nSenator Hatch's chairmanship, also exceed those achieved during his. I \nonly mention this because if you listen to what comes down to being \ntotal mistruths by the Vice President or others, you would think we \nblocked the President's judges.\n  Actually, we have done far better for President Bush--far better than \nwhen a Republican majority was here and pocket filibustered 61 of \nPresident Clinton's nominees. It is a little known, and obviously \nunappreciated, fact that during the more than 6 years of the Bush \nPresidency, more circuit judges, more district judges, and more total \njudges have been confirmed while I served as Judiciary Committee \nChairman than during the tenures of either of the two Republican \nChairman working with Republican Senate majorities did.\n  The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts lists 48 judicial \nvacancies. Yet, the President has sent only 25 nominations for these \nvacancies. Twenty-three of these vacancies--almost half--have no \nnominee. Of the 16 vacancies deemed by the Administrative Office to be \njudicial emergencies, the President has yet to send us nominees for six \nof them.\n  Despite the harping and the criticism, the Judiciary Committee has \nbeen working hard to make progress on those nominations the President \nhas sent to us.

The Senator from New York is recognized.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this week we in Congress are continuing \nto work toward a solution in Iraq that both supports our troops and \nchanges our mission away from policing a civil war to more narrowly \nfocusing on what should be our first and foremost goal--fighting \nterrorism, counterterrorism, to make sure al-Qaida cannot set up a camp \nand strike at us.\n  I rise today because we are beginning. We have said all along that \nthis is going to be a long battle. Because we do not have 61 votes in \nthe Senate, because the President has the veto power and we certainly \ndo not have 68 votes to override a veto in the Senate, we are going to \nhave to continue to bring up resolution and amendment after resolution \nand amendment until we persuade our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle to do what the American people want, to do what the American \npeople asked for in November of 2006; that is, dramatically change the \ncourse in Iraq, the mission--greatly reduce the number of troops so we \ncan keep some troops there who can fight terrorism, but that will be \nmany fewer. Most will be out of harm's way.\n  We are getting good signs. First, 6 months ago President Bush said he \nwouldn't accept any benchmarks or any limitation. Now the word from the \nWhite House seems to be that they will accept some types of benchmarks \nor other types of language that would not just be a simple funding the \ntroops without our other goal, changing the mission. But second and \nmore significant, what I and my colleague from Washington--and I \nbelieve my colleague from Illinois will be speaking about--are seeing \nis our Republican colleagues begin to set their own timetables, their \nown deadlines. This weekend, House minority leader John Boehner \nsignaled that, as this debate wears on, the President will continue to \nlose support among the members of his own party.\n\n       By the time we get to September or October, members are \n     going to want to know how well this is working and, if it \n     isn't, what is plan B?\n\n  That sure seems similar to what we are trying to do, although we want \nto do it now.\n  Mr. Boehner's comments are echoed by a number of other Republicans \nwho are hearing back in their States and districts that we must change \nthe mission in Iraq. There are many comments.\n  Trent Lott:\n\n       I do think this fall we have to see some significant \n     changes on the ground in Baghdad and other surrounding areas.\n\n  There are many more. One of those is Jim Walsh, from my home State of \nNew York. Today, the New York Times reports that Mr. Walsh is replying \nto his constituents that he could soon be prepared to reassess our \npolicy and begin withdrawing our troops.\n  Republican Congressman Ray LaHood is indicating he expects Republican \nmembers will grow increasingly ``nervous'' about the President's \nstrategy.\n  Asked about the President's demand for a funding bill with no \nbenchmarks, no conditions, and no reports, says Senator Collins, who \njust spoke here:\n\n       Many of us on both sides of the aisle don't see that as \n     viable.\n\n  We are going to try to come up with a very strong resolution that \nboth supports our troops and changes the mission. But we know we are \nmaking progress because our Republican colleagues themselves have been \nsetting timetables, benchmarks, and other types of goals--limitations \nthat are not terribly dissimilar from ours.\n  We will continue this battle, this struggle to require the President \nto change course in Iraq. We eagerly await our Republican colleagues \njoining us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New York. I \nknow my colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, will be here shortly \nas well to talk about a critical juncture at which we are now in terms \nof the war in Iraq.\n  Last week, both the House and Senate sent a very strongly worded bill \nto the President of the United States supporting our troops, saying we \nare there for them when they need us, but we also said it is time for a \nchange of course in Iraq, that we can no longer leave our troops in the \nmiddle of a civil war. It is disappointing to all of us that the \nPresident chose to veto that bill and sent it back to us. But I think \nit is very important for us to set the context of where we are now as \nwe look at what we are going to send back to the President.\n  These are the facts. There is increased violence in Baghdad as we \nspeak. There is increased violence outside Baghdad today. In fact, over \n100 American soldiers died last month alone, and at least 27 more \nAmerican troops have been killed this month. In my home State of \nWashington, we got the sad news yesterday morning that six of our Fort \nLewis soldiers were killed over the weekend. These are\n\n[[Page S5690]]\n\nfamilies--husbands, children, grandchildren--who will be impacted \nforever and who will not forget.\n  Months ago, the President said to the American people that he was \ngoing to change his course by having a surge of American troops--\n25,000, 30,000, 40,000 new troops. They are now on the ground in Iraq. \nWhat we are seeing is increased violence inside and outside of Baghdad, \nmore American soldiers losing their lives. And what are we looking at? \nAn Iraqi Government that has not changed, has not stood up to the mark \nto care for their own country and make the tough decisions they need to \nmake. The bill we sent to the President was designed to give him the \ntools to turn to Iraq and say: You need to take on your own battles and \nmake these tough decisions. It is time for Iraqis to stand up. Four \nyears after removing Saddam from Iraq, the Iraqis have still not made \nthe political compromises necessary to bring peace to their own \ncountry. In fact, they are on pretty shaky ground today, even as we \nspeak, as we hear of factions that may pull out.\n  Most important, what is happening here in our country? Mr. President, \n64 percent of Americans and 65 percent of independents support setting \na timetable for redeployment.\n  That is the ground we are now on, as the President vetoed that very \nimportant piece of legislation which funded our troops. We had funding \nfor our veterans as they came home and important, critical funding for \nKatrina and other important causes.\n  Despite all the facts I just laid out--the increased violence, the \nsoldiers being killed, the Iraqis not standing up for their own \nGovernment--we have seen Republicans on the other side of this aisle \nstubbornly stand with President Bush and refuse to set a timetable for \nour troops to come home, refuse to set a timeline to force Iraqis to \ntake responsibility for their own future, and refuse to set a timetable \nto let Iraqis know we are not going to be there endlessly, month after \nmonth, year after year, for decades.\n  Mr. President, what is heartening to me today, after the President's \nveto, is we now are hearing from many of our Republican colleagues that \nthey, too, believe we cannot continue to send a message that we will \ncontinue to be there forever.\n  Senator Schumer was just here on the Senate floor and spoke of some \nof our Republican colleagues who have been speaking out. House Minority \nLeader Boehner said:\n\n       Over the course of the next 3 to 4 months, we'll have some \n     idea how well the plan is working. Early signs are indicating \n     there is clearly some success on a number of fronts. But, by \n     the time we get to September or October, Members are going to \n     want to know how well this is working, and if it isn't, \n     what's Plan B.\n\n  We are now hearing, thankfully, our Republican colleagues set forth \ntime tables of their own. I think it is important we listen to what \nthey are saying because despite the fact they said no time tables in \nthe bill, we are hearing them say there is a timeline; that this \ncountry cannot continue to send our troops to Iraq without Iraqis \nstanding up.\n  Importantly, as well, we are hearing our Republican colleagues talk \nabout benchmarks. We know benchmarks without consequences are \npointless. But unlike the President, our Republican colleagues are \nstarting to realize this and are breaking with the White House.\n  Senator Susan Collins said:\n\n       Obviously, the President would prefer a straight funding \n     bill with no benchmarks, no conditions, no reports . . . Many \n     of us, on both sides of the aisle, don't see that as viable.\n\n  I hear that as very promising language from our colleagues on the \nother side. We are hearing from many others--Senator Voinovich, who \nspoke out this weekend. We are hearing from House minority whip Roy \nBlunt, who says he ``can support binding benchmarks on the Iraqi \nGovernment tied to a `consequences package,' so long as it would not \nput restrictions on the military.''\n  Mr. President, we support our troops. The bill we sent to the \nPresident last week supports our troops. Our troops have done \neverything we have asked them to do and more, and they have done it \ncourageously. It is time now for us to give them the tools they need so \nthe Iraqis will stand up and take control of their own government.\n  We can no longer simply say: We will stand down when you stand up to \nthe Iraqi people. I hope our Republican colleagues will join with us in \nstanding up as well, now, to send a strong message to the Iraqi people \nthat it is time for our troops to get the support they need and to know \nthat they will be brought home in a timely manner.\n  It is encouraging to hear the comments we are hearing. I hope they \nare met by the courage of our colleagues on the other side to stand \nwith us, find some language we can agree on, and send the supplemental \nto the President. I hope that is what we can do over the next several \ndays. I encourage our colleagues to work with us to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Iraq Supplemental\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for a long time in Washington, if you \ntalked about a deadline or a timetable, the response from the \nPresident, from the administration, even from the Republican side of \nthe aisle, was the same. When you talked about a specific end to this \nwar, they argued: It endangers our troops.\n  I did not agree with that premise. In fact, I believed this was the \nonly way to convince the Iraqis we were not going to stay forever. If \nthey think the very best military in the world, the American military \nforces, will stay there indefinitely, there is no incentive for them to \nmake the right decisions, the hard decisions to govern their own \ncountry.\n  Well, time has passed at great cost to our Nation. As of this \nmorning, we have lost 3,361 of our best and brightest soldiers--3,361. \nThe month of April was the deadliest month this year in Iraq: 104 \nAmerican soldiers lost their lives. I think we all understand now that \nas each day passes, more American soldiers are in danger and, sadly, \nmore will give their lives. So to wait for a month, two or three or \nfour, is, sadly, to extend that period of time of danger.\n  Now we find from Republican leaders a new approach. No longer are \nthey rejecting the idea of deadlines or timetables. In fact, they are \nstarting to speak in more specific terms.\n  This is a quote from the Republican leader of the House, John \nBoehner, who said:\n\n       By the time we get to September or October, members are \n     going to want to know how well this is working, and if it \n     isn't, what's Plan B?\n\n  That, to me, sounds like a deadline of September or October.\n  Then, of course, our colleague from Mississippi, Senator Lott, said:\n\n       I do think this fall we have to see some significant \n     changes on the ground, in Baghdad and other surrounding \n     areas.\n\n  I think it is an indication that our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle are hearing the same thing we hear when we go home: First, an \nimmense pride in our men and women in uniform, pride as well in their \nfamilies who have stood by them through this long struggle; an \nunderstanding of the sacrifices that are being made by our soldiers as \nwell as those who love them so very much but, secondly, an \nunderstanding that this is a failed policy that the President is \npursuing in Iraq.\n  This is the fifth year of this war. This war has lasted longer than \nWorld War II. It is now only exceeded in cost by the cost of World War \nII in today's dollars. It is an extremely expensive undertaking, first, \nin human life, with over 3,000 Americans dying, and then with thousands \ncoming home injured, some very seriously injured, with traumatic brain \ninjury and amputations.\n  Senator Murray of Washington has been a leader when it comes to the \ncare for our returning soldiers and veterans. We know our system is \nbreaking down and falling behind, increasing the sense of urgency I \nfeel and many feel in Illinois, as I see them on the streets of Chicago \nand Springfield and all around my State. They understand this is a \nheavy cost we are paying.\n  When our friends on the Republican side of the aisle say all we need \nis maybe 4 or 5 more months, I hope they understand that time they are \nasking\n\n[[Page S5691]]\n\nfor is time that will have a heavy price. They want us to buy some time \nfor political purposes but at a heavy price.\n\n  We think, and I hope they will come to understand, we need to tell \nthe Iraqis now they have the responsibility to govern and lead. If they \nfail, then American troops are not going to stay there indefinitely. \nSome worry when American troops leave, there may be an unstable \nsituation in Iraq. That is entirely possible. That can happen if we \nleave in 10 months, 10 years, or 15 years.\n  They have to understand the responsibility of the future of Iraq lies \nin the hands of the Iraqis. We cannot put that burden on American \nsoldiers and their families any longer. I am heartened by these \nstatements from the Republican side that finally they understand we \ncannot stay there forever, that the policy of this administration has \nnot succeeded, that we owe it to soldiers and their families to treat \nthem humanely, to let them know they will be coming home to a hero's \nwelcome soon.\n  Our colleagues, Senator Jim Webb and Carl Levin, as well as Jack \nReed, have spoken out about the readiness of our troops, too. I worry \nabout that. As the President has extended this war, far beyond what \nanyone ever dreamed of, those who voted for that authorization of \nforce, as he has extended this war, have put pressure on our soldiers \nbeyond anything we could have imagined.\n  We have extended the tours of duty for National Guard members to the \nlongest period of time since World War II. We now know many of our \nsoldiers are asked to stay on an additional 3 months after they have \nserved 12. We know when they come home, they do not receive the rest \nthey were promised, the time with their family. They are quickly \nreactivated and sent into battle.\n  This has to have an impact on morale. It certainly has a negative \nimpact on their families. So I believe as we talk about how this war is \nto be waged and what the next stage will be, regardless of what our \nplan may be, it has to include readiness and a commitment to these \ntroops. I think it is important that we say to the President: Don't \nsend a single soldier into harm's way or into combat unless they have \nhad the time to rest, unless they have been retrained and equipped, \nunless they are prepared to go to battle with all of the forces they \nneed to come home safely.\n  Shortchanging our soldiers is not a strategy that we should follow in \nIraq. Let's come up with a plan to start bringing these troops home. We \nsent one to the President last week. He, in a press conference, told \nthe American people he was going to reject it. We haven't heard \nanything back from him since then. But, in the meantime, many members \nof his own party have decided it is time for them to finally speak up. \nWe welcome them. We need them. We need them particularly on this \nsupplemental bill.\n  Mr. President, if a handful of Republican Senators will now cross the \naisle and join us, we can have a positive impact on changing this \nfailed policy in Iraq. We can finally stand as one in a bipartisan way \nand say there is a better way; that the Iraqis cannot take long \nvacations while the members of their parliament relax as our soldiers \nrisk their lives. We have to tell the Iraqis we are not going to stay \nindefinitely.\n  When leaders such as Mr. Boehner of Ohio speak of plan B, just \nremember what the B stands for. The B stands for bring our soldiers \nhome. That is what we need to start doing in an orderly, sensible way \nas soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Immigration\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I want to take a few moments this \nafternoon to follow up on my remarks of last evening about concerns I \nhave involving the immigration process that is ongoing in the Senate \nand what Senator Reid, the Democratic leader, has indicated he plans to \ndo.\n  I absolutely believe a framework exists for us to develop \ncomprehensive immigration reform that can be worthy of the American \npeople, to create a lawful system of immigration that will work. It \nwill be difficult in a number of areas, but we can do that. A framework \nis being discussed, I know, because I have seen the PowerPoint \npresentations and some of the other discussions about it. A framework \nexists that could lead to effective immigration reform. There is no \ndoubt that this Nation needs comprehensive immigration reform. The \nwhole system is broken. Nothing about it works. The legal system is an \nembarrassment to us as a nation and a source of frustration to the \nAmerican people. They rightly are concerned about it, and politicians \ndon't seem to be. That is why we have had a problem for so long, and \nfrustration and anger gets built up. People sometimes call in to radio \nstations and say things they shouldn't say that are unkind. A lot of it \nis a direct response to a failure of the Congress and the executive \nbranch to do what is required to create a lawful system of immigration. \nFor Heaven's sake, don't we all agree with that concept, a lawful \nsystem of immigration?\n  What interests should it serve? It should serve the national \ninterest, the American interest. I asked Secretary Chertoff of Homeland \nSecurity and Secretary Gutierrez of Commerce at a hearing of the \nJudiciary Committee not long ago, what should a lawful system of \nimmigration do? Should it not serve the national interest? They said: \nYes, sir.\n  Professor Borjas, a Cuban refugee, at Harvard has written a book on \nimmigration. He said: If you tell me what interest you wish to serve, I \ncan help you draft an immigration policy that will work. For example, \nif you say it should be the national interest, I can help you achieve \nthat. If you want to serve the interest of poor people around the \nworld, I can help achieve that. He basically said in his book \n``Heaven's Door,'' we could serve poor people around the world by just \nletting them all in. That would be in their interest. We know that. In \n2000, we had 11 million people apply for 50,000 lottery slots. The \nnames are drawn out of a hat randomly. Only 50,000 are drawn out a \nyear. We had 11 million apply for those slots.\n  We have to look at the basics. More people want to come to this \ncountry than we can accept, and those whom we accept should be based on \nwhat is in our interest. How much more simple can it be than that? I \nsubmit that is a moral and legitimate basis.\n  We always have a humanitarian component to immigration. I would not \nreduce that. About 16 percent of those who come, thereabouts, are for \nhumanitarian reasons. I think we will always want to have that \navailable for people who are persecuted or otherwise need humanitarian \nrelief. Fundamentally, the rest of our program ought to serve the \nnational interest.\n  This is what has happened. There are supposedly bipartisan \ndiscussions going on--and I know they are going on--to try to take the \nframework that has been agreed on by the President, Cabinet members, \nand some Members and to flesh that out and develop an immigration \npolicy. That hasn't reached fruition. I understand some of the leaders \non the Democratic side have walked away. They are not prepared to \nfollow through on the overall agenda item for a given area, this \nframework. When you start writing down the words that will actually \neffectuate what you promise to do, then people start backing off.\n  I have said a number of times on the floor that we have a great deal \nof interest in immigration reform, except that we need a lawful system \nwhich will work. If it is a system that will actually work, we find \nimmediately people start objecting.\n  Senator Reid has said these negotiators--I sometimes want to call \nthem masters of the universe; I don't know who selected them--are \nmeeting here and they are deciding the fate of American immigration. I \nwant to say, well, let's see what they produce. I have told my \nconstituents I hope they will discuss it, and maybe some agreement can \nbe reached, one I could support. But I\n\n[[Page S5692]]\n\npromised my constituents--and every Senator ought to make this \ncommitment--that I am going to read that bill. Just because people have \ngreat sounding words, if you don't read the words carefully and what \nthey will actually mean in the effort to enforce immigration law, then \nyou don't know what you are going to get. You are going to end up as we \ndid in 1986, with a program that was an utter failure. The one we had \nlast year would never have worked. It would have been a disastrous \nfailure. It had no chance of being successful or ever achieving the \nideas it purported.\n  Senator Reid apparently is unhappy. He has the power, as the \nDemocratic leader, to call up any piece of legislation he wants to call \nup. He has said: I am not happy with the speed of this. He has said he \nis going to call up, under the power of the majority leader under rule \nXIV, last year's bill, and that this will be on the floor. Then he will \nwant the negotiators to continue to negotiate, and maybe they will \nfigure out what would be better. Then he might substitute this newly \nnegotiated bill that hasn't been written yet--nobody has seen a word of \nit--and then we will vote. That will make everybody happy.\n  Let me say this, with all sincerity: The American people know \nimmigration is a big issue. It is an important issue; it really is. It \nsays a lot about the nature of this country. Are we going to be a \ncountry that the world knows has laws that are never enforced, that our \nimmigration policies make a mockery of the law, as they do today? Will \nwe continue to see people all over the world get the idea in their \nheads--correct today, basically--that if they can just get into \nAmerica, sooner or later we will make them citizens and give them \neverything, even if they came illegally? Is that the kind of message we \nwant to send?\n  Senator Reid has said he is going to bring up last year's bill. He \nalso indicated that after last year's bill is introduced and maybe a \ncompromise would be reached. Maybe they would substitute this \ncompromise as a new bill which we have never seen before, nor the words \nin it.\n\n  Let me tell my colleagues, an immigration bill is not an itty-bitty \nthing. An immigration bill consists of a lot of pages. A group of us, \nabout 15 of us, wrote to the majority leader and asked that we have 7 \ndays--I thought that was way too short--to read the bill. Isn't that \npathetic? The immigration bill last year was 700-plus pages. Seven \nhundred pages. This never before seen compromise version may be longer. \nAt least last year's bill came out of the Judiciary Committee, and we \nhad a chance to argue over it in there, although the train ran right \nthrough the Judiciary Committee and it ran through--basically through \nthe floor of the Senate. But we began to read it before it was over, \nand I remember making a speech down here, several speeches, pointing \nout 17 loopholes in that bill, fatal flaws in the legislation. But \nanyway, it passed, but the House refused to even consider it.\n  Based on what was in the New York Times and Rollcall or The Hill or \none of the publications, the plan would then presumably be for Senator \nReid to bring up last year's bill, which is unthinkable, in my view. It \nwas fatally flawed. We will stay on that bill for some time, and then \nperhaps they will plop on it a substitute and take out all or parts of \nlast year's bill and substitute an entirely new bill, 600, 700 or 800 \npages, and then we will vote on it. That will be good for the masters \nof the universe, you see, because when you do that, there would not be \ntime for the American people or for Lou Dobbs or Rush Limbaugh to find \nout what is in it and to tell the American people what is in it so they \ncan get mad about it. That is basically what it is about. They want to \nslide it through with the least possible time to discuss it. I think \nthat is irresponsible. It is wrong.\n  We should spend plenty of time on this legislation. We should go to \nthe American people with honesty and integrity and tell them: Some of \nthe things you want to do, Mr. and Mrs. America, we can't do. We are \nnot going to be able to make immigration come out exactly like you \nwould want it or exactly like I would want it. We are going to have to \nreach a compromise, but we understand we have a commitment to you, and \nthat commitment is to create a system that will work in the future.\n  But I am worried about it because from what I am hearing, the system \nseems to be moving in a way that is going to create an opportunity to \nvote on a completely unseen immigration bill--nobody has read it except \na little group--and move it through this Senate. Now, remember, the \nbill that passed last year was a bad piece of legislation, but it did \npass this Senate. People thought it would die in the House, and sure \nenough, it did die in the House and it was never considered. They \nwouldn't even look at it. But I am not sure that is going to happen \nthis time.\n  So we may have this plan in the works, and it will work something \nakin to this: Well, we spend 2 or 3 days talking about immigration, \nburning time and filibustering, filing cloture on a motion to proceed, \nand we get on the bill for a day or two and then all of a sudden a new \nbill comes on and in a day or two, it is passed. Hardly anybody knows \nwhat is in it or has had a chance to read it. Then it goes to the House \nof Representatives, where the Democratic majority now has a 15 seat, 16 \nseat or so majority over there; some of the Republicans would clearly \nbe in favor of whatever passed out of the Senate. They don't have any \nway to delay votes over there, so the bill could be brought up and \npassed, the same bill, without any amendment. That could happen. Then \nit goes to the President and he signs it and then we will find out 2, 3 \nor 4 years from now whether it works.\n  I don't think it is going to work. I am worried about it. I am \nworried about it. I am worried there is not a commitment among the \nexecutive branch to enforce the immigration laws.\n  Anybody who would like to be elected President--the new executive \nbranch leader has a commitment to ensuring a lawful system of \nimmigration. That is all the American people want. They are not saying \nthey don't want any immigrants in America.\n  So I am saying this because I am concerned this is where we are \nheaded. I think it is unhealthy for the Senate. If we do that, we would \nhave failed in an august responsibility. This is the body that is \nsupposed to let the passions cool, where Senators look over important \nissues, think them through, and then make a decision on them. Also, the \ndelay and the slowdown that goes on in the Senate is helpful so the \nAmerican people can be advised on what their representatives are \nactually doing. So I am worried about it, and Senator Reid's strategy \nis frightening to me.\n  So let me repeat: I believe the framework that has been mentioned for \nthe drafting of a comprehensive immigration reform bill actually has \nthe potential to be successful. But based on my experience in the 10 \nyears I have been in the Senate and the debate we have seen on \nimmigration, I am inclined to believe they will have positive-sounding \nwords on the headlines in big print, but the real language will not \neffectuate the promises they make or the goals they set. We could end \nup with no progress whatsoever. We could end up with amnesty and no \nenforcement in the future.\n  That is what happened in 1986. If you remember, in 1986, they said \nthere are probably a million people in the country illegally. The \nsystem was not working. We had to do something, so we should grant \namnesty to the people who came illegally, contrary to law, and then we \nwould develop a new system in the future so that this would be the \namnesty to end all amnesties. There would be no more amnesties. Well, 3 \nmillion people showed up to take advantage of it rather than 1 million \npeople, and in the 20-plus years--21 years--since, we now have found in \nour country an estimated 12 million to 20 million people here \nillegally. So now we want to, I guess, give amnesty again on a promise \nthat we will have a system that will work in the future. But the \nAmerican people, you see, are cynical about it. They are not \ncomfortable with us anymore on this subject, and frankly they are right \nto be cynical. Because there are a lot of special interests out there \nwho are asking for what is in their interests but not what is in the \nnational interests. It is time for us to consider what is in the \nnational interests and do the right\n\n[[Page S5693]]\n\nthing on immigration. I firmly believe we will do a better job of \nwriting a bill that will work, a bill that will serve our national \ninterests, that will create a lawful immigration system, if the \nAmerican people know what is going on, because that is what they want.\n\n  The American people have been consistently right on this issue. Their \ninstincts have been right consistently. Oh, there are some nutty folks \nout here who are mean spirited, there is no doubt about that, but they \nrepresent a very small number. The basic feeling of the American people \nis sound on immigration and has been. It is the Congress and the \nexecutive branches that have failed them for 50 years. We don't have to \ncontinue to fail the American people. We have a responsibility to make \nit work, and I am hopeful that in the discussions for the first time \nwith Secretary Chertoff and Secretary Gutierrez helping behind the \nscenes to develop some plans that would actually work, we might even \nget this thing done. There is some possibility. I wouldn't have \nbelieved it, but now I am beginning to think it is possible.\n  But if at the last minute the special interest groups who seem to \nhave dominated last year get their way, we would not be able to pass \nthe bill we can be proud of. We would not pass a bill that will work, \nand we will be back in 10 years, 15 years, 20 years from now, dealing \nwith another crisis.\n  So I will not go on anymore about it. I will mention what the \nframework, as I understood it, contained, that these PowerPoint \npresentations that were shown around and got leaked to the press, it \nhas real improvement in border enforcement. We need that. That is \nessential. If you are serious about immigration, you want border \nenforcement. It set up as a goal a very effective job workplace \nenforcement, something that could actually work, using biometric \nidentifying cards, helping the businesses and telling them exactly what \nthey need to do so they can't be prosecuted or sued for doing something \nwrong. They are told exactly what to do and what will work. We can make \nthe workplace cease to be the magnet for illegal jobs. That is very \nimportant, and it can be done. We need to deal compassionately and \nrealistically with the people who are here illegally, but I don't \nbelieve that someone who broke the law in our country should be given \nevery single benefit that we give to those who come lawfully. We will \nhave to wrestle with that, and nobody is going to be happy, I am sure, \nwith the way that comes out. That is the way it is with any big piece \nof legislation.\n  We need a genuine temporary seasonal worker program that is separate \nand apart from the program that would allow people to come into the \ncountry on a citizenship track. On the basic entry, citizenship entry \ninto the United States, we need to be far more similar to Canada, which \nhas a merit-based, skill-based system that evaluates applicants on what \nthey bring to Canada: Do you speak English? Do you have an education? \nDo you have skills that Canada needs? It is a skill-based point system. \nIt is objective and fair, and it serves the Canadian interests, and \nthey are very happy with it. So is Australia, so is New Zealand, and I \nthink the United Kingdom is also moving forward in this direction. A \nmerit-based point system can actually be a framework for success. I \nunderstand that is being discussed. We do not need to promote such a \nframework, and then vote on a bill that doesn't create the merit-based \npoint system when you read the fine print. That would be a failure.\n  So those are my concerns, and I will object with every ability I \nhave, I will utilize every tool I have to ensure that whatever bill \nhits this floor, that Senators and the American people have time to \nevaluate it and an opportunity to know what is in it. But there are \nways that this time and opportunity can be denied if the leadership is \ndetermined and can get the support. We could deny the American people \nthat right, and it would be wrong to do so.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Tornado in Greensburg, Kansas\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I just returned from Greensburg, KS, \nyesterday, where we had a horrific tornado hit late Friday evening. I \nwant to share with my colleagues some of the damage assessments, some \nof the pictures of what has taken place, and some of the needs we have \nfor this community. It is a community I have been to a number of times \nwhile serving in different positions in Kansas. It is a wonderful \ncommunity, full of community spirit, with people who have been there \nfor a number of years. They have a celebration around a hand-dug well \nthat is kind of an unusual event. It is the world's largest hand-dug \nwell. You can go to the bottom of it, and I have done that.\n  Greensburg is a community with a lot of spirit in the middle of the \nState and in the middle of our country. Now it is experiencing this \ntremendous devastation. The tornado covered 40 miles in 90 minutes. It \nwas first spotted at 8:24 p.m. last Friday 3 miles south of Sitka, KS, \nin Clark County.\n  The tornado tracked through six counties: Comanche, Kiowa, Edwards, \nStafford, Pratt, and Barton. At 9:45 p.m., the tornado demolished \nGreensburg before wrapping north and dissipating before 10 p.m. \nFortunately, the National Weather Service and a weather man out of \nDodge City spotted it and warned the community, and the community had \nabout a 20-minute warning that a tornado was coming and that it was a \nbig one.\n  When Greensburg was struck, the tornado's wind forces exceeded 205 \nmiles per hour, falling into the highest category on the Enhanced \nFujita Scale, EF-5. The size of the tornado was 1.7 miles in diameter, \nwhich, if you know anything about tornadoes, is enormous. Twelve people \nhave died as a result of this storm cell. They found another two \nindividuals yesterday.\n  When a tornado hits--and you will see pictures here--often the houses \nwill blow up in the process because of the air pressure outside of the \nhouse that is much reduced from the air pressure in the house, and \nthere will be a blowing up of the house, or the wind comes in and hits \nit. It can be destroyed by the wind.\n  Thirteen people are still in the hospital, with four of them in \ncritical condition today. There was some good news on Sunday. We found \na person still alive underneath the rubble.\n  Ninety percent of the town has been destroyed, from Greensburg to the \nNortheast, which was hit by multiple tornadoes that were spawned by the \nsame supercell thunderstorm. It is an older community. More than 50 \npercent of the population is 45 years of age or older, and 25 percent \nof the population is 65 years of age or older. Primarily, the economic \ndrivers of the community are farming and oil and gas production.\n  We will need substantial assistance. I want to show pictures from the \nwreckage I toured yesterday. I am pleased to note that the President is \ncoming tomorrow. I was there yesterday with the Governor and several \nmembers of the congressional delegation. Senator Roberts was there on \nSaturday. It is devastating to see.\n  Here you see a structure left standing there, which is a grain \nelevator. That is really the only structure left standing in the town. \nThe courthouse is standing, but its roof has been ripped off. It is \namazing people can actually survive something like this. Most people \nhave storm shelters or basements they can go into, and they did with \nthe warning, and some called other people in the community. All of \nthese trees were denuded in the area, and the whole place was ripped \nand torn into shreds in the county and in this particular community.\n  This is one of the main structures in the downtown area of \nGreensburg. All of the brick around it is damaged.\n  They were able to keep the Greensburg sign still posted in this \npicture. These were taken when the storm system was still in the area. \nThere was a tornado the next day within a mile of Greensburg, from the \nsame supercell system. It dumped 10, 12 inches of rain in northeast \nKansas.\n  You can still see ominous-looking clouds in this photo. It was very \ndicey over the entire weekend.\n  This was one of the more stable houses that remains standing in the \narea. I went into a house that was somewhat like this, which was built \nalmost 100 years ago. I talked with the\n\n[[Page S5694]]\n\nowner. They were going to celebrate the 100-year anniversary for the \nhouse, which was built in 1908. He said, ``We didn't quite make it.'' \nThe house is going to be demolished now. It will not survive.\n  This is a view of some of the damage to vehicles. This is a blank \nlandscape in the backdrop. I wanted to give some views of what has \ntaken place in the community. It has been completely and utterly \ndestroyed.\n  I would like to note that FEMA has been questioned by me and by a \nnumber of my colleagues. Prior to Katrina, it had done a lot of good \nwork that people had respected and appreciated. They felt there was a \ngood group on the job. But then Katrina happened and you looked and \nsaid: Where is the FEMA that I knew that would go in and respond in \nthese situations? We are watching carefully to see how FEMA responds to \nour situation, to our devastation.\n  I am pleased to state--and I talked with a number of individuals in \nthe community--they are meeting the needs. The needs of the community \nare being met. They are there on the grounds, being aggressive in \ndealing with it. The people appreciate they are there. We are going to \nwatch and make sure all of their needs are met.\n  I will ask my colleagues for assistance as well. This is a small, \nolder community. It lacks much in the way of resources. We need help in \nthis particular situation. We are going to be pushing--Senator Roberts \nand I--for 100-percent coverage on public assistance and on matters \nsuch as debris removal and repair and rebuilding public facilities: \ncity hall, fire stations, hospitals, water/wastewater, city powerplant, \nand gas and diesel generators. The community lacks the resources to \nmeet these needs. We will look to remove the 25-percent local match for \nFEMA funds. The entire town and their economy was destroyed. There is \nno way Greensburg can come up with the match of funds that is necessary \nin this community.\n  I also want to try something innovative. This is a community in the \nHigh Plains. The New Homestead Act is a bill that Senator Dorgan from \nNorth Dakota and I have been pushing for some time. I have been a lead \ncosponsor. As I said, it is a bill called the New Homestead Act. We \nhave had many communities drained in the High Plains, particularly in \nthe Midwest, because of a consolidation in agriculture primarily, but \nalso other features, to where we have had out-migration in huge areas. \nThis is a county that has experienced a lot of out-migration. I would \nlike to see us use Kiowa County--Greensburg is the county seat--as a \npilot project for the New Homestead Act.\n\n  The biggest concern, once we complete cleanup, is getting the people \nand their businesses back up and going. Here is a chance for us, given \nthe level of public commitment in place and the desire to rebuild this \ncommunity, to try this New Homestead Act that can work as a magnet to \nattract people back into these communities that have had difficulty \ntransitioning from an agricultural economy to something else. This bill \nis to encourage people to move to rural areas that have depopulated. \nThis bill will help repay college tuition loans for people who move \nback into the community, help folks buy their first home and set up \nindividual homestead accounts to help people save for the future. Also, \nthis bill will help pump capital to Main Street America through a rural \nventure capital fund.\n  I think these are things we can look at and say let's try this here \nand let's see it work. Let's see what we can model off of to help many \nplaces in the High Plains that have experienced this depopulation. We \nwill be pushing also for an enhanced USDA rural development package.\n  There has been a controversy coming up that I think is unfortunate. \nThat has been the question about whether there has been enough \nequipment from the National Guard--the Kansas National Guard, on the \nground in Greensburg to take care of this atrocity, this disaster, or \nhas too much been diverted to the war on terrorism and in Iraq. \nYesterday, I asked specifically the Kansas adjutant general--the head \nof the Kansas National Guard: Do you have enough equipment on the \nground to take care of Greensburg? He said: Yes, we have enough \nequipment.\n  I made the point: If you don't, we are going to push Fort Riley and \nother places to come up with this equipment.\n  He said: No, we have enough equipment.\n  Unfortunately, this has grown into a bit of a controversy as to \nwhether there is sufficient equipment or if too much has been diverted \nto Iraq. The specific statement by Kansas' head of the National Guard--\nthe adjutant general--says there is sufficient equipment on the ground \nto meet this need. I think it is important that be stated and that be \nclear because these needs are existing, but they are being met and the \nequipment is there.\n  I want to make sure that we can respond. I want to note, finally, to \nanybody who is interested, fortunately, because of the nature of the \ncountry and generous people in the United States, they want to help. \nThey want to know what they can do for the people of Greensburg.\n  There are three places that I suggest they look to contribute: the \nAmerican Red Cross, Salvation Army, and the United Way of the Plains in \nWichita, KS. Those three groups are ones that are receiving and \nfunneling funds into Greensburg. Being a small community, it didn't \nhave these sorts of organizations there. But these groups do work. Cash \ndonations are being accepted. There is no current need for donations \nin-kind, but I hope people will look back and come back in the future \nand consider that on in-kind items. Those groups would be helpful. The \nUnited Way of the Plains established a Greensburg disaster fund to \nwhich people can contribute. I hope people will consider contributing \nto those three entities.\n  We have a number of different groups that are stepping up, including \nPizza Huts through Kansas, which are donating 20 percent of their \nprofits on Thursday, May 10, to go to this United Way of the Plains--\nthe Greensburg disaster fund. I hope other groups will also do that so \nGreensburg can rebuild and renew itself and grow into the future. These \nare tough times for this community, but it is a resilient community.\n  It impresses me when you see horrific disasters such as this, just a \ncomplete devastation, and you talk to the people and they want to \nrebuild and dig out and they want to go on. That is the resilience of \nthe human spirit in the face of a horrendous disaster, loss of life and \nproperty, and a loss of almost an entire community. The people there \nwere talking about how to rebuild. It is beautiful to see that.\n  We mourn their losses. The people of Greensburg and Kansas are \nthankful for all the prayers people have given for that community, in \nall of their tragedy and difficulty. They will be back and they will \nrebuild and they will go forward and raise the next generation of \nfamilies in Greensburg and Kiowa County.\n  The country is going to help out, and I think the country will help \nin a powerful, positive way, and we will celebrate as Greensburg comes \nback.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, today is a somber day in Nevada. Last \nnight, a helicopter crashed in Austin, NV, killing all five crew \nmembers on board. It is believed the flight was from Fallon Naval Air \nStation.\n  Also yesterday, Nevada lost another soldier in Iraq--25-year-old SGT \nCoby Schwab--to an improvised explosive device.\n  Our State and our Nation mourn the loss of all six servicemembers who \nserved with honor and courage. Our hearts and our prayers are with the \nfamilies.\n  No one wants success in Iraq more than we in the Senate. I can think \nof no greater tribute we can pay to those six servicemembers and the \nmore than 3,300 others who have lost their lives in Iraq than to reach \na responsible and successful end to the war which has cost so much in \nso many different ways.\n  The Washington Post this morning ran an article entitled ``The Cost \nof\n\n[[Page S5695]]\n\nWar, Unnoticed.'' It tells us that the war in Iraq is about to become \nthe most expensive conflict in United States history, after World War \nII. But unlike World War II, which was fought all over the world--in \nfaraway Japan, Africa, all the islands in the South Seas, all over \nEurope--the Iraq conflict is taking place in a country the size of the \nState of California.\n  Also unlike past wars, President Bush is putting the costs squarely \non the shoulders of our children and grandchildren by financing it \nentirely through borrowing and raising the national debt.\n  Robert Hormats, a former Republican administration official, says:\n\n       They tried to do this on the cheap and without a candid \n     conversation with the American people about the cost. But the \n     irony is the great wartime leaders have seen it in the \n     opposite way.\n\n  From the beginning, President Bush has called this war a great \nchallenge of our time. Yet his actions don't match his rhetoric. He has \nexpected sacrifice from our troops now, but has pushed the sacrifice of \nAmerican taxpayers years and years into the future and long past his \nterm in office.\n  In 18 months, there will be a new election--18 months--to select a \nPresident. All Americans will continue to bear the financial burden of \nthis war in the future, long past a new President assuming office. But \nright now, we are seeing the toll it is taking on our security at home.\n  In the wake of the tragic tornadoes that ripped through Kansas this \npast weekend, our National Guard did the best job it could there, a \nfantastic job, and we are grateful for their work, of course, but the \ntoll of the war in Iraq crippled the ability of our National Guard to \ndo the dangerous and heroic jobs they are charged with doing.\n  According to the Governor of Kansas, Kathleen Sebelius:\n\n       Fifty percent of our trucks are gone. Our front loaders are \n     gone. We are missing humvees that move people. We can't \n     borrow them from other States because their equipment is \n     gone. It's a huge issue for States across the country to \n     respond to a disaster like this.\n\n  We can't expect our first responders to keep America safe if they \ndon't have the supplies and the equipment to get the job done.\n  Our men and women in uniform, both active and in the Guard and \nReserve, are bearing the bulk of the burden of this war. But we all pay \na price, whether in death and injury to troops, or whether tremendous \nfinancial burden not yet fully realized, or whether in the inability of \nthe Kansas National Guard to rescue and recover more quickly. That is \nwhy it is crucial and well past time to change course toward a \nsuccessful and responsible end to the war.\n  We continue to negotiate with the White House and our Republican \ncolleagues in Congress. We continue to stand firm in our belief that \nthe time for a new direction has come. Even some of our Republican \ncolleagues who have long supported the President on the war now seem to \nagree it can no longer be open-ended.\n  Yesterday my colleague Senator Lott said:\n\n       This fall we have to see some significant changes on the \n     ground.\n\n  Over the weekend, House Minority Leader Boehner said:\n\n       By the time we get to September or October, members are \n     going to want to know how well this is working, and if it \n     isn't, what's Plan B.\n\n  Just yesterday, my colleague Republican Leader McConnell echoed \nLeader Boehner's sentiments.\n\n       I am glad to hear them move to our view, to set their own \n     timeline. But we can't wait until fall. We have to have a \n     responsible plan B right now.\n\n  Plan B gradually reduces combat operations and refocuses our troops \non protecting America's security throughout the world.\n  Our plan B begins to bring troops and equipment home, where they can \nprotect American lives in Kansas and across the country.\n  Our plan B begins to reduce the financial burden that this war is \nweighing on our shoulders and the shoulders of future generations.\n  And our plan B puts the pressure on the Iraqi Government that will \nultimately lead them to take responsibility for their own future.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, there will be no more votes today. The \nmanagers are working to try to come up with a package that can be \naccepted. As I have indicated, the time on postcloture will run out \nsometime tonight about 10 or 11 o'clock. We hope it is not necessary to \nrun the clock that long, but we are going to finish this bill in the \nmorning, and we will see how many votes we have. We will try to be \naware of people's schedules, but the Senate itself has a schedule we \nhave to deal with. So we are going to do our best to finish this bill \ntomorrow and move on to other business.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Inhofe pertaining to the introduction of S. 1335 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Susan Gordon\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I will address the Senate as in morning \nbusiness for a few minutes on two points of great personal privilege \nfor me.\n  The first is, I read last week of the retirement of Susan Gordon, \nexecutive secretary and office manager of the Office of Legislative \nCounsel in the Georgia General Assembly. That might seem an odd thing \nfor me to come to the Senate floor and talk about, but for me Susan is \nemblematic of all of the people who make us look good in this job of \npublic service.\n  For 31 years, she served the people of Georgia and the Office of \nLegislative Counsel for the Georgia General Assembly. In my 17 years in \nthat assembly, I can think of hundreds of times where Susan stayed late \nor went the extra mile to see to it that legislation was drafted, \nperfected, and got to the floor within the constraints of the general \nassembly. She never played Republicans over Democrats or Democrats over \nRepublicans, and she loves the State of Georgia.\n  When I learned of Susan's retirement, it only seemed appropriate for \nme to memorialize on the Senate floor to her my appreciation for all \nshe has done for me, and countless other legislators who have gone \nbefore me in Georgia would say precisely the same thing.\n  I say for all those others who work in our offices, in legislative \ncounsel, and in the departments of government, the unsung heroes of \nthis great thing we call democracy and public service, to all the \n``Susan Gordons,'' thank you very much.\n  In particular, I thank the Susan Gordon I know in Atlanta, GA. I \nmemorialize my thanks and appreciation for her 31 great years of \nservice to me and the people of Georgia.\n\n\n                     Birth of Cecilia Gay Mitchell\n\n  Mr. President, on a second point of personal privilege, at 4:33 p.m. \non Sunday afternoon, my daughter, Julie, gave birth to Cecilia Gay \nMitchell, my seventh grandchild.\n  With Mother's Day coming up on Sunday, I was struck while on the \nplane flying here on Monday by the generations of people before us, \nwhat they have done and the importance of family and the importance of \nmotherhood.\n  You see, Gay is a family name on my wife's side: My wife's great-\ngrandmother Gay Deam, my wife's mother Gay Davison, my wife Dianne Gay, \nmy daughter Julie Gay, and now Cecilia\n\n[[Page S5696]]\n\nGay--a fifth generation of Gays, all ladies, all but one a mother, all \nclose and treasured by me.\n  I will never claim to be the equal of Robert Byrd in terms of his \ngreat Mother's Day speech, which I think we will all hear on Friday, \nbut for me on the celebratory day where I celebrate the birth of a \nseventh grandchild and the fifth-generation Gay in our family and the \nDavison family and the Isakson family, I pay tribute to my daughter \nJulie, her husband Jay, and my expression of thanks to them on behalf \nof Dianne and me for the greatest present that could ever be given to a \nparent--that is the gift of a grandchild, especially a fifth-generation \nGay.\n  I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Immigration Reform\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in the coming weeks the Senate will again \nconsider legislation to reform our broken immigration system. The \nPresiding Officer has been personally and deeply involved in this issue \nsince coming to the Senate. I thank him for his leadership.\n  I think we all understand the challenge is substantial. If we want to \nsolve the problem, we need a comprehensive approach that is tough but \nfair. We should improve border security by increasing manpower and \ndeploying new technology. We should enforce the law against employers \nwho are hiring millions of undocumented workers. And we need a \nrealistic, honest approach to the 12 million undocumented immigrants \nwho live and work in our country illegally.\n  Most importantly, we must ensure that immigration reform legislation \nprotects the American economy and American workers as well.\n  I am concerned about the H-1B visa program as it is currently \nstructured. I am afraid it is being abused by foreign companies to \ndeprive qualified Americans of good jobs.\n  To address this problem, Senator Grassley and I have introduced S. \n1035, the H-1B and L-1 Visa Fraud Abuse Prevention Act of 2007. This is \na bipartisan bill. It would overhaul the H-1B and L-1 visa programs to \nprotect American workers and crack down on unscrupulous employers.\n  The H-1B visa program was designed to allow employers to attract and \nhire high-skilled foreign workers with specialized knowledge. H-1B \nvisas are probably best known for their use in technology to import \ncomputer engineers and programmers.\n  I can't tell you how many leaders in industry, including one this \nafternoon, come into my office and say: We absolutely need H-1B visas. \nWe can't find enough people with specialized education for our \nbusinesses. If you won't allow us to bring these workers in from \noverseas, we are going to be facing the possibility of taking our \nproduction facilities overseas where they live.\n  It is a compelling argument. I understand it on its face. But let me \nexplain some of the problems with the current system and why Senator \nGrassley and I believe the system needs to be changed.\n  Supporters claim the goal of the H-1B program is to help the American \neconomy by allowing U.S. companies to hire needed foreign workers. The \nreality is that H-1B visas are being used to facilitate the outsourcing \nof American jobs to other countries. It seems counterintuitive that a \nvisa that allows people to come into the United States could lead to \njobs being outsourced overseas, but when you hear my illustrations, you \nwill understand the conclusion.\n  A recent expose in the International Herald Tribune disclosed that 8 \nof the top 10 H-1B visa applicants last year were outsourcing firms \nwith major operations in one country--India. So in many cases it wasn't \nthe American high tech company using the H-1B visa that was given this \nopportunity but, rather, a firm, more likely in India than any other \ncountry, that was given the authority to use H-1B visas to send workers \ninto the United States. The Herald Tribune concluded:\n\n       As Indian outsourcing companies have become the leading \n     consumers of the [H-1B] visa, they have used to it further \n     their primary mission, which is to gain the expertise \n     necessary to take on critical tasks performed by companies in \n     the United States and perform them in India at a fraction of \n     the cost.\n\n  According to this report, the Indian Government has been lobbying \nhard for the United States Government to increase the number of H-1B \nvisas. Kamal Nath, the Indian Commerce Minister, was very blunt when he \nsaid recently that the H-1B visa ``has become the outsourcing visa.'' \nHe concluded:\n\n       If at one point you had X amount of outsourcing and now you \n     have a much higher quantum of outsourcing, you need that many \n     more visas.\n\n  That is a very candid statement by this commerce minister in India. \nIt should give us pause as we think about this program, what it was \ndesigned to do and what it is actually doing.\n  In other words, the Indian Government wants more H-1B visas so Indian \ncompanies can outsource more American jobs to India.\n  Let me be clear. India is a valuable American partner in commerce, \ndiplomacy, and many other endeavors. Indians who have come to the \nUnited States have made immeasurable contributions to the benefit of \nour country in so many ways. I trust them as great friends. But some in \nIndia today understand that we have a weakness in our visa system and \nare using it for their own economic advantage.\n  It is not surprising the Indian Government is advocating on behalf of \nIndian companies. The American Government should advocate on behalf of \nAmerican companies. I don't criticize the Indian Government for doing \nthat. But we should expect the same from our Government for our \nworkers. We need to stand up to make sure American workers don't lose \ntheir jobs to outsourcing because of H-1B visas.\n  H-1B supporters claim we need more H-1B visas to stop American jobs \nfrom being outsourced. That was the logic behind H-1B visas. It appears \nthe opposite is true. Under the current system, more H-1B visas will \nmean more outsourcing.\n  Let me give an example. Indian outsourcing company Wipro was No. 2 on \nthe list of top applicants for H-1B visas in the year 2006. Wipro has \nmore than 4,000 employees in the United States, and approximately 2,500 \nof them are here on H-1B visas. It is pretty clear that when it comes \nto Wipro's American operation, the majority of the workers are here on \nH-1B visas. Every year Wipro brings 1,000 new temporary workers here \nfrom India, while they send another 1,000 U.S. trained workers back \nto India. This is essentially an outsourcing factory.\n\n  Here is what the Herald Tribune concluded:\n\n       Rather than building a thriving community of experts and \n     innovators in the United States, the Indian firms seek to \n     funnel work--and expertise--away from the country.\n\n  It is hard to believe, but it is perfectly legal to use the H-1B visa \nprogram for outsourcing. A foreign outsourcing company with a U.S. \noffice can use H-1B visas to import workers from their home country, \ntrain the workers in the United States, and then outsource them back to \ntheir home country to populate businesses competing with the United \nStates. They are not required to make any efforts to recruit American \nworkers for these jobs. In fact, they can explicitly discriminate \nagainst American workers who apply for the same jobs by recruiting and \nhiring only workers from their home country.\n  Here is what the Labor Department says about the current law:\n\n       H-1B workers may be hired even when a qualified U.S. worker \n     wants the job, and a U.S. worker can be displaced from the \n     job in favor of a foreign worker.\n\n  Is that what we had in mind with H-1B visas? That certainly wasn't \nthe way it was explained to me. In fact, under current law, only \nemployers who employ H-1B visa holders as a large percentage of their \nU.S. workforce are required to attempt to recruit American workers \nbefore bringing in foreign workers.\n\n[[Page S5697]]\n\n  Senator Grassley and I have taken a look at this system. We both \nreject the notion that what is wrong with the H-1B program is that we \nneed more visas. We have to look at the system that generates these \nvisas and the way they are used. The legislation we have introduced \nwould overhaul the H-1B program, protecting American workers first, and \nstopping H-1Bs from being exploited as outsourcing visas.\n  Here are the highlights. First and foremost, we would require all \nemployers who want to hire an H-1B worker to attempt to hire an \nAmerican worker first. Employers would also be prohibited from using H-\n1B visas to displace American workers. You can't fire an American and \nturn around and appeal to our Government for an H-1B visa to bring \nsomeone in from overseas to replace that worker.\n  This is an important principle. We have to make it clear that \ncompanies doing business in the United States have to give first \npriority to American workers.\n  Our bill would require that before an employer may hire an H-1B \nworker, the employer must first advertise the job opening to American \nworkers for 30 days on the Department of Labor Web site.\n  Some companies that abuse the H-1B visa program are so brazen, they \nsay ``no Americans need apply'' in their job advertisements. Hundreds \nof such ads have been posted on line. They say things such as ``H-1B \nvisa holders only'' or ``we require candidates for H-1B from India.''\n  Is that what we have in mind, to create this perverse discrimination \nagainst American workers? That isn't the way it was explained to me. \nOur H-1B reform bill would prohibit this blatant discriminatory \npractice.\n  There is another serious problem with the H-1B visa program. Federal \noversight is virtually nonexistent. Under current law there are many \nroadblocks to effective Government enforcement. For example, the \nDepartment of Labor does not have the authority to open an \ninvestigation of an employer suspected of abusing the H-1B program \nunless the Department receives a formal complaint, even if the \nemployer's application is clearly fraudulent. Even if there is a \ncomplaint, the Labor Secretary--and this is something that is almost \nunique in our law--must personally authorize the opening of an \ninvestigation.\n  These restrictions in the law are aggravated by lax Government \nenforcement. According to the Department of Homeland Security's own \nInspector General, Homeland Security has violated the law by approving \nthousands of H-1B applications in excess of the annual cap of 65,000. \nThe Government Accountability Office found that the Labor Department \napproves over 99.5 percent of H-1B petitions it receives, including \nthose that on their face clearly violate the law.\n  There is virtually no Government oversight of potential abuse in this \nsystem. The Labor Department's inspector general has concluded that the \nH-1B program is ``highly susceptible to fraud.'' Remember, this program \nwas designed to help the American economy, to help create jobs and \nprosperity in our country. Our Government is not even watching it \nclosely to make sure that fraud isn't being perpetrated.\n  The bill Senator Grassley and I are proposing would give the \nGovernment more authority to conduct employer investigations and \nstreamline the investigative process. Currently, the Labor Department \nis only authorized to review applications for ``completeness and \nobvious inaccuracies.'' Our bill would give the Labor Department more \nauthority to review employers' H-1B applications for ``clear indicators \nof fraud or misrepresentation of material fact.''\n  Our bill would authorize the Labor Department to conduct random \naudits of any company that uses the H-1B program and require the \nDepartment of Labor to conduct annual audits of companies that employ \nlarge numbers of H-1B workers. We would also increase the penalties for \ncompanies that violate H-1B visa rules and authorize the hiring of 200 \nadditional Government investigators to oversee and enforce the H-1B \nprogram.\n  Last month, the government began accepting H-1B visa petitions for \nFiscal Year 2008. In the first 24 hours, the government received \n150,000 petitions for 65,000 slots, supposedly for the whole year. \nBased on last year's statistics, it is likely that the top petitioners \nfor visas were companies from India. They understand the system. They \nunderstand how to make this profitable. But this is not the way it has \nbeen described to most Members of Congress. It certainly isn't \nconsistent with our intent.\n  There is another program I wish to mention, the L-1 visa. The L-1 \nvisa allows companies to transfer certain employees from foreign \nfacilities to the United States for up to 7 years.\n  Experts have concluded that some employers use the L-1 program to \nevade restrictions on the H-1B program, because the L-1 program doesn't \nhave an annual cap and doesn't include even minimal protections for \nAmerican workers. As a result, efforts to reform the H-1B program are \nunlikely to succeed if the L-1 program is not overhauled at the same \ntime.\n  The bill Senator Grassley and I have prepared would reform the L-1 \nprogram. We would establish for the first time whistleblower \nprotections for those who call attention to employer abuses of L-1 \nprograms, and for the first time we would authorize the Government to \ninvestigate and audit L-1 employers suspected of violating the law.\n\n  Before we are persuaded to increase the number of H-1B visas, we have \nto reform the program to protect American workers first and to stop H-\n1Bs from being used as outsourcing visas that send jobs and business \naway from America. That is what our bill would do, and that is what \nSenator Grassley and I will be pushing for as the Senate considers \ncomprehensive immigration reform legislation.\n  I know this immigration debate is contentious, controversial, and \nsome think it is politically dangerous, but it is long overdue. The \ncurrent immigration system in America has failed us.\n  We now have upwards of 800,000 undocumented immigrants who come \nacross the borders each year. That has to change. We have to reach a \npoint where we have control of our borders. Some of the measures that \nhave been suggested during the course of the debate I think are \nextreme. We don't have to move in that direction.\n  I recently met with Senators from Mexico who were visiting the \nCapital last week and encouraged them to join with us in a joint effort \nbetween the United States and Mexico to police the border, to try to \nmake sure there is less exploitation of people who are coming across \nfor jobs or for moving drugs or contraband--whatever the reason may be. \nI think more cooperation would go a long way between our two countries.\n  We also need to be sensitive and cognizant of the burden facing many \nemployers in this country. If someone presents themselves, in downstate \nIllinois in a meat-packing plant, with a name and a Social Security \nnumber and a local address, what is the responsibility of the employer \ntoday? It certainly isn't to launch a full-scale investigation. If the \npapers presented to that employer appear to be legal on their face, \nmost employers will hire the person. They may learn later on that the \ndocuments were fraudulent.\n  How can we change that system? I think we need to move toward some \nform of identification that is reliable so the person carrying the card \nwho is here in a legal and temporary employment status can prove their \nidentity to the employer, so that the system is able to police itself \nmore.\n  We also need to deal with the reality of 12 million undocumented \npeople currently here. I know all about these folks because almost 90 \npercent of our casework in our Senate office deals with immigration. I \nhave met many of them and their families. We need to find a fair way to \nhold them accountable, to make certain that over a period of time they \ncan earn their way into legal status. They have to have a job and no \ncriminal record; they have to pay a fine, pay their taxes, learn \nEnglish, whatever it takes, to make sure that over a period of time, it \nis clear they have every intention to be a citizen of this country, and \na good one. In that way, they can earn their way, over many years, into \na position of citizenship or permanent legal status.\n  This country is great because of the immigrants who came here. My \nmother was one of them. I am very proud of that fact and happy to serve \nin a State\n\n[[Page S5698]]\n\nthat would elect me and in a State that has so many immigrants who can \ntell the same story I have to tell.\n  I think the immigrant spirit is something that has made America a \nunique country. I think of people who, in their foreign lands, get up \none day and say: We are not going to take it anymore. We are coming to \nAmerica. We have a better chance. That is the kind of get-up-and-go we \nlike to see that has made this a much better country.\n  I think we can capture that spirit in real, comprehensive immigration \nreform and avoid abuses such as those I have just described with the H-\n1B program and at the end of the day have a program and a law supported \nby both political parties that will really move us forward as a Nation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Automobile Sensor Device\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, in the month of April, 16 \nchildren in this country have been backed over and killed by an \nautomobile backing out of the driveway. Each of us can visualize what I \nam saying right now because we have a car in the garage or in our home \ndriveway, we walk around to make sure there are no obstructions and \nthen get into our car, and we really don't know that a small child may, \nin fact, have gotten in the way.\n  Last year, over 200 children in this country--in the United States \nalone--over 200 children were killed by these kinds of accidents. Last \nmonth, of the 16 who were killed nationwide, 3 of them were in Florida. \nI have had come to me moms and dads who have agonized and who have gone \nthrough the grieving of losing a child. A couple from Boca Raton, FL, \nwho have spurred a national effort, came to me. Their child was only 5 \nfeet in front of the mom, and out backs a car as they are walking down \nthe sidewalk and it was too late; that child is gone.\n  It is so easily fixable with our technology. If you rent an Avis \nrent-a-car and it is a high-end car, it already has a built-in device \nthat has a sensor in the back. Higher end automobiles such as the Lexus \nhave a television screen with a little camera mounted in the rear. The \nsensor emits a beep, and the frequency of the beep increases as you get \ncloser and closer to an object. It is estimated that such a device may \ncost in the range of $50.\n  So the question is, Are we going to encourage the automobile \nmanufacturers to include this to stop these kinds of needless deaths? \nIncreasingly, the Members of the Senate are going to hear from moms and \ndads who have gone through the grief of losing a child that could have \nbeen prevented. So it is my hope we will get some action.\n  I now bring to the attention of the Senate that it is my \nunderstanding this is getting ready to be put on the consent calendar \nin the House of Representatives, and it is my understanding we would \nconsider this under unanimous consent here in the Senate, and we could \nthen save some children's lives; otherwise, their parents will grieve \nforever.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Trade\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, our trade policy is fundamentally flawed. \nYears of wrongheaded trade pacts have sent millions of jobs overseas \nand have devastated far too many of our communities and have opened our \nNation to new and serious homeland security concerns.\n  When we open our borders to trade, as we should, we open them to \nnational security threats. Congress must assure the American people \nthat we have done everything within our power to protect their safety, \nhealth, and welfare while promoting trade.\n  It is estimated that less than 10 percent of foreign cargo is \ninspected before entering our country--only 10 percent.\n  We must both ensure our ports are operating securely and with clear \nlines of accountability--unlike the deal to transfer ownership of six \nU.S. ports to a State-owned company controlled by the United Arab \nEmirates that this administration approved about a year ago.\n  The decision to allow a UAE-controlled company had significant \nnational security implications, including warnings that the UAE was a \nfinancial and travel outlet for known terrorists. It took leaders of \nboth political parties, here and in the House of Representatives, to \ncall attention to this enormous blunder.\n  Something else may be happening. This administration has recently \nsigned a free-trade deal with South Korea and will soon ask this \nCongress to approve it under fast track, or trade promotion authority. \nOne of the major goals South Korea sought in these negotiations was \nsecuring special treatment for products made in the Kaesong Industrial \nComplex, located in North Korea.\n  In Kaesong, South Korea, companies employ more than 11,000 North \nKorean workers. South Korea intends to expand the complex over the next \nfew years and will employ close to 70,000--70,000--North Koreans by the \nend of this year, according to a Congressional Research Service report. \nU.S. negotiators had vehemently opposed including the Kaesong complex \nin the trade deal. But then, in a rush to sign a deal, our trade \nnegotiators backed off--as they too often do when it comes to \nrepresenting our national interests--and allowed room for future \nnegotiations on the Kaesong complex.\n  This is a dangerous precedent, and it opens this agreement to a \nseries of national security questions:\n  How much income, for example, does this Kaesong complex currently \nprovide the North Korean Government? How much income can we anticipate \nit providing North Korea under its expansion plans? How are these North \nKorean workers treated? Under a fair trade agreement, would our \ngovernment's actions be no different than the repressive North Korean \nGovernment?\n  Free-trade agreements, as currently written, live well beyond \npolitical administrations. We can't predict the future decisions and \nintentions of the South Korean Government, nor any other trading \npartners. As national security concerns continue to accompany efforts \nto promote trade, Congress must take proactive steps to ensure our \nhomeland security needs are secured every bit as much as our economic \nwell-being.\n  Last week, Senator Dorgan of North Dakota and I introduced the Trade-\nRelated American National Security Enhancement and Accountability--\nTRANSEA--Act. This act requires the Office of U.S. Trade \nRepresentative, in collaboration with the Department of State, the \nDepartment of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, and the \nDepartment of Agriculture to submit a report to Congress detailing the \nnational security considerations of proposed trade agreements prior to \ncommencing negotiations and the trade agreement again after concluding \nthe trade negotiations.\n  The bill also requires future trade agreements negotiated by the \nadministration to include a national security waiver that allows the \nPresident to suspend any terms of the agreement should it be required \nin the interests of United States national security.\n  Lastly, as a final safeguard, the legislation creates a new \nCongressional Executive Commission on Trade Security, which requires \nthe appointment of Commissioners by both political parties in both \nChambers of this Congress. The Commissioners will be charged with \nannually certifying that the terms of the free-trade agreement do not \npose a threat to U.S. national security interests.\n  Should the Commission find that compliance with the agreement would \npose a threat, the President would be obligated to exercise his or her \nwaiver to the extent necessary to ensure the safety and security of the \nUnited States.\n  In a post-9/11 world, U.S. economic policy can no longer be simply \nviewed\n\n[[Page S5699]]\n\nin a vacuum of bottom lines and profit margins. Homeland Security \nSecretary Michael Chertoff said in 2006:\n\n       We have to balance the paramount urgency of security \n     against the fact that we still want to have a robust global \n     trading system.\n\n  It is the responsibility of our Government to ensure that while \nopening markets for our exporters--again, as we should--our first \npriority remains the safety and the security of the American people.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I, first, thank Senator Enzi, the \ndistinguished Senator from Wyoming, for his terrific work, both as the \nranking member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pension Committee, \nbut more precisely today and yesterday for the work he has done on this \nlegislation in working out agreements on a set of very complicated \nissues.\n  His staff has been terrific in explaining some of the more archaic \nparts of this legislation, and I am very appreciative. I know Senator \nKennedy is very appreciative, and I know Members on both sides of the \naisle are as well.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Pet turtles less than 10.2 centimeters in diameter have \n     been banned for sale in the United States by the Food and \n     Drug Administration since 1975 due to health concerns.\n       (2) The Food and Drug Administration does not ban the sale \n     of iguanas or other lizards, snakes, frogs, or other \n     amphibians or reptiles that are sold as pets in the United \n     States that also carry salmonella bacteria. The Food and Drug \n     Administration also does not require that these animals be \n     treated for salmonella bacteria before being sold as pets.\n       (3) The technology to treat turtles for salmonella, and \n     make them safe for sale, has greatly advanced since 1975. \n     Treatments exist that can nearly eradicate salmonella from \n     turtles, and individuals are more aware of the causes of \n     salmonella, how to treat salmonella poisoning, and the \n     seriousness associated with salmonella poisoning.\n       (4) University research has shown that these turtles can be \n     treated in such a way that they can be raised, shipped, and \n     distributed without having a recolonization of salmonella.\n       (5) University research has also shown that pet owners can \n     be equipped with a treatment regimen that allows the turtle \n     to be maintained safe from salmonella.\n       (6) The Food and Drug Administration should allow the sale \n     of turtles less than 10.2 centimeters in diameter as pets as \n     long as the sellers are required to use proven methods to \n     treat these turtles for salmonella.\n\n     SEC. __. SALE OF BABY TURTLES.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Food and \n     Drug Administration shall not restrict the sale by a turtle \n     farmer, wholesaler, or commercial retail seller of a turtle \n     that is less than 10.2 centimeters in diameter as a pet if--\n       (1) the State or territory in which such farmer is located \n     has developed a regulatory process by which pet turtle \n     farmers are required to have a State license to breed, hatch, \n     propagate, raise, grow, receive, ship, transport, export, or \n     sell pet turtles or pet turtle eggs;\n       (2) such State or territory requires certification of \n     sanitization that is signed by a veterinarian who is licensed \n     in the State or territory, and approved by the State or \n     territory agency in charge of regulating the sale of pet \n     turtles;\n       (3) the certification of sanitization requires each turtle \n     to be sanitized or treated for diseases, including \n     salmonella, and is dependant upon using the Siebeling method, \n     or other such proven non-antibiotic method, to make the \n     turtle salmonella-free; and\n       (4) the turtle farmer or commercial retail seller includes, \n     with the sale of such a turtle, a disclosure to the buyer \n     that includes--\n       (A) information regarding--\n       (i) the possibility that salmonella can re-colonize in \n     turtles;\n       (ii) the dangers, including possible severe illness or \n     death, especially for at-risk people who may be susceptible \n     to salmonella poisoning, such as children, pregnant women, \n     and others who may have weak immune systems, that could \n     result if the turtle is not properly handled and safely \n     maintained;\n       (iii) the proper handling of the turtle, including an \n     explanation of proper hygiene such as handwashing after \n     handling a turtle; and\n       (iv) the proven methods of treatment that, if properly \n     applied, keep the turtle safe from salmonella;\n       (B) a detailed explanation of how to properly treat the \n     turtle to keep it safe from salmonella, using the proven \n     methods of treatment referred to under subparagraph (A), and \n     how the buyer can continue to purchase the tools, treatments, \n     or any other required item to continually treat the turtle; \n     and\n       (C) a statement that buyers of pet turtles should not \n     abandon the turtle or abandon it outside, as the turtle may \n     become an invasive species to the local community, but should \n     instead return them to a commercial retail pet seller or \n     other organization that would accept turtles no longer wanted \n     as pets.\n\n     SEC. __. FDA REVIEW OF STATE PROTECTIONS.\n\n       The Commissioner of Food and Drugs may, after providing an \n     opportunity for the affected State to respond, restrict the \n     sale of a turtle only if the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services determines that the actual implementation of State \n     health protections described in this title are insufficient \n     to protect consumers against infectious diseases acquired \n     from such turtle at the time of sale.\n\n                    amendment no. 1041, as modified\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

The amendments are set aside.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I congratulate everybody on reaching the \npoint we just reached with the unanimous consent agreement that was \ndone. I thank the Senator from Ohio for his tremendous work on the \ncommittee and then on the floor, and on working through some of these \namendments.\n  I particularly thank Senator Kennedy for his efforts. He is having a \nspectacular day. I am sure actually he is probably on a plane again \nnow. He represented the United States at the unification treaty signing \nin Ireland today. He left as soon as we finished voting last night, \ntraveled through the night, attended that ceremony, and will travel \nvirtually through the night tonight to get back again so he will be \nhere for tomorrow morning's votes.\n  That is just the kind of tireless dedication that he puts in on \ninternational issues, as well as the issues that come before our \ncommittee. I am very impressed with the stamina he has and the \ncapability he has to do all these things.\n  This has been a long road and it has had a few lumps in it, but there \nhas been cooperation on both sides. The staff people who have worked on \nthis have gone into excruciating detail on every amendment to make sure \nit would do what people said it would do and that it would work, both \nin a United States context and in an international context.\n  I think we have progressed to a point where we can do three votes and \nthen final passage tomorrow and have this on the way to having the Food \nand Drug Administration reformed so they have more tools in the toolbox \nand can get the job done that we have always been expecting, and have \nmore confidence that our food and drug supply in the United States will \nbe safe.\n  Everybody has been tremendously cooperative. We look forward to \nfinishing in the morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to elaborate on a food safety \namendment that has been accepted on both sides.\n  Under current law, the FDA's most decisive legal recourse for dealing \nwith suspect food imports is to stop them at our boarder. My amendment \nstrengthens the FDA's hand by providing explicit authority under \nsection 415 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act, to proactively \ndeny entry of all food products from questionable suppliers if they \nfail to cooperate and allow timely inspection of their facilities.\n  Events of recent weeks have made clear that the FDA's ability to \ninspect foreign food is inadequate. In the case of melamine tainted \nwheat gluten from China, FDA inspectors were forced to wait more than 2 \nweeks before the Chinese Government would grant them access. Two weeks \nis unacceptable. There is simply no excuse for such delays if you want \nto ship food into this country. FDA must be able to respond quickly to \nidentify threats and protect public health and safety.\n  My amendment provides a succinct and direct legal basis for the FDA \nto seek access and inspect foreign food facilities on demand. If a \nforeign exporter to the United States delays access for FDA inspectors \nunnecessarily, the FDA can stop all food imports from that firm \nimmediately thereby denying them access to our markets. If an exporter \ndoes not want to let the FDA inspect its firm--on FDA's schedule--that \nexporter can't ship to this country. It is that simple. For the vast \nmajority of firms and countries, this is not a problem. But for those \ntimes it is needed, it will be an important tool.\n  This amendment will not fix all of the problems that are out there. \nThis Congress needs to do some thorough oversight and develop a \ncomprehensive plan to improve food safety and security. I intend to \nparticipate in that process and will exercise my prerogatives as \nchairman of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee to see that the \nFDA follows through.\n\n[[Page S5707]]\n\n  Again, I appreciate the help of Senators Kennedy and Enzi and their \ntalented staff in getting this amendment included in this bill. They \nhave been very helpful, and I look forward to providing them any \nassistance they need in order to keep this in conference.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 993\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, last week, the FDA just sent out a warning \nto American consumers regarding purchasing medications from certain \nInternet sites because the FDA cannot verify that the drugs purchased \nover those sites are going to be safe or that they won't be \ncounterfeit. We need to give the FDA the authority and the resources to \naddress the issue of unsafe Internet pharmacies and the Gregg Internet \npharmacy amendment does just that. It creates a comprehensive framework \nto assure consumers that they can shop with confidence, knowing that \nthe drugs they purchase online will be safe and effective. Hopefully, \nwe will address this important and timely drug safety issue, if not \nnow, at least before this bill completes the whole process and comes \nback from the conference committee\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for his interest \nand work on this important issue. Ensuring that people have access to \nsafe and effective medications when purchasing prescription drugs \nonline is an important part of our efforts in the area of drug safety. \nThe Dorgan legislation in this bill includes some provisions on the \nissue of Internet pharmacies, but I am willing to work with my \ncolleague and our colleagues in the Senate to enhance these provisions \nto address the important issues he has raised over the course of this \ndebate.\n  Mr. ENZI. I would also like to take the opportunity to express my \nsupport for the need to address the issue of unsafe Internet \npharmacies. We have worked very hard in other portions of this bill to \nensure the safety of prescription drugs on the market, and as this bill \nadvances, I look forward to working with you both to enhance the \nprovisions in this bill relating to the safety of Internet pharmacies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the contributions \nof Tom Clewell to Sparks, NV. After serving the city of Sparks for more \nthan 36 years, Tom retired from his 3-year post as fire chief on May 4, \n2007.\n  Tom is a native Nevadan, attending school in Reno and raising a \nfamily in Sparks. He joined the Sparks Fire Department as a temporary \nfirefighter in April 1971, and eventually climbed the ranks to become \nthe city's 10th fire chief in its history. He served in many roles \nthroughout his time with the Sparks Fire Department including operator, \ncaptain, battalion chief, and division chief.\n  Throughout his 36 years, Tom led the fire department through many \nchanges in Sparks. For example, Tom reorganized the department creating \nfour division chiefs. Tom also encouraged greater training of \nfirefighters in Sparks. He also managed the rapid growth surrounding \nSparks and introduced fire prevention measures as housing developments \nbegan heading toward the foothills.\n  Upon his retirement, the city manager of Sparks said, ``Tom has been \none of the greatest leaders I have ever been associated with.'' That \nquote speaks volumes about Tom's leadership. I have known Tom for many \nyears. His professional accomplishments are numerous, but I think Tom \nwould likely describe his family as his greatest honor. He is the proud \nfather to Angela and Lindsey. He shares in this joy with his wife \nFrancine.\n  I am privileged to have the opportunity to honor Tom Clewell before \nthe United States Senate today.

It is \nbipartisan legislation that I introduced with Senator Tom Coburn, \nranking member of the Human Rights and the Law Subcommittee, Senator \nPatrick Leahy, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Senator John \nCornyn.\n  The Genocide Accountability Act would close a legal loophole that \nprevents the U.S. Justice Department from prosecuting individuals who \nhave committed genocide. Under current law, genocide is only a crime if \nit is committed within the United States or by a U.S. national outside \nthe United States. The Genocide Accountability Act would amend 18 \nU.S.C. 1091, the Genocide Convention Implementation Act, to allow \nprosecution of non-U.S. nationals who are brought into or found in the \nUnited States for genocide committed outside the United States.\n  I recently received a letter from David Scheffer, U.S. Ambassador at \nLarge for War Crimes from 1997 to 2001, which makes clear the impact \nthat the Genocide Accountability Act could have. Ambassador Scheffer's \nletter explains that the loophole in our genocide law hindered the U.S. \nGovernment's efforts to secure the apprehension and prosecution of \nformer Cambodian dictator Pol Pot, one of the worst war criminals of \nthe 20th century. If the Genocide Accountability Act had been law when \nPol Pot was alive and at large, maybe the United States would have been \nable to bring him to justice.\n  The Genocide Accountability Act recently passed the Senate \nunanimously. I am hopeful that in short order the House of \nRepresentatives will pass it and the President will sign it into law.\n  The United States should have the ability to bring to justice \nindividuals who commit genocide, regardless of where their crime takes \nplace and regardless of whether they are a U.S. national. The Genocide \nAccountability Act would end this immunity gap in U.S. law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have Ambassador Scheffer's \nletter to which I referred printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was to be printed in the Record \nas follows:\n\n                                          Center for International\n\n\n                                                 Human Rights,\n\n                                                    April 6, 2007.\n\n     Re lost opportunities to achieve international justice.\n\n     Senator Richard Durbin,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law, Committee \n         on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Durbin: you have asked me to recount how \n     limitations in U.S. federal law during the 1990's prevented \n     the Clinton Administration, in which I served as U.S. \n     Ambassador at Large for War Crimes Issues (1997-2001), from \n     ensuring the speedy apprehension and prosecution of the \n     former Cambodian leader, Pol Pot, on charges of genocide, \n     crimes against humanity, or war crimes (``atrocity crimes'') \n     prior to his death in March 1998. Because such limitations in \n     U.S. law remain, particularly with respect to the crime of \n     genocide, it may be useful for Members of Congress to \n     consider how historically devastating was this lost \n     opportunity to achieve some measure of justice for the deaths \n     of an estimated 1.7 million Cambodians under Pol Pot's rule \n     from 1975 to 1979.\n       In June 1997 the then two co-prime ministers of Cambodia, \n     Hun Sen and Norodom Ranariddh, sent a letter to the \n     Secretary-General of the United Nations seeking assistance to \n     establish an international criminal tribunal that would \n     render justice to the senior Khmer Rouge leaders, none of \n     whom had been prosecuted with the sole exception of a highly \n     dubious in absentia trial of Pol Pot and his foreign \n     minister, Ieng Sary, in a Cambodia in 1979 shortly after the \n     fall of the Khmer Rouge regime. The jointly-signed letter in \n     June 1997 opened two pathways of action by the Clinton \n     Administration: the first continues to this day, namely how \n     to investigate and prosecute surviving senior Khmer Rouge \n     leaders and bring them to justice before a credible court of \n     proper jurisdiction; the second interrelated issue dealt with \n     effective measures to apprehend and hold suspects in custody \n     until they could be brought to trial.\n       Since no international criminal tribunal existed in 1997 \n     that was specially designed to\n\n[[Page S5708]]\n\n     investigate and prosecute senior Khmer Rouge leaders and \n     because the judicial and political situations within Cambodia \n     did not favor domestic prosecution at that time, we began in \n     late June 1997 to examine options for prosecution of Pol Pot \n     and his leadership colleagues before a yet-to-be-created \n     international tribunal or before either U.S. federal \n     courts or foreign domestic courts. We were receiving \n     signals that Pol Pot, who had been in hiding since his \n     fall from power in 1979, might be located and in a \n     position either to be captured or to surrender in a manner \n     that would facilitate his transfer to a court of competent \n     jurisdiction.\n       Among all the options we examined at the time, the most \n     desirable was the establishment of an international criminal \n     tribunal by authorization of the U.N. Security Council acting \n     under U.N. Charter Chapter VII enforcement authority. This \n     was the means by which the International Criminal Tribunals \n     for the Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda were created. I pursued \n     that option until the summer of 1999, when various factors \n     made it unrealistic and required a change of strategy that \n     ultimately resulted in the creation of a hybrid domestic \n     court in Cambodia called the Extraordinary Chambers in the \n     Courts of Cambodia. But because, beginning in mid-1997, we \n     began to experience episodes where the prospects of capturing \n     Pol Pot (and later one of his top officials, Ta Mok), were \n     quite high, I needed to find a jurisdiction (U.S. or foreign) \n     which would receive Pol Pot and hold him until the \n     international criminal tribunal could be created and then he \n     could be transferred to the jurisdiction of that tribunal. If \n     we chose or were compelled (by virtue of no foreign country \n     accepting Pol Pot) to transfer Pol Pot to U.S. territory, we \n     had to be prepared to prosecute him before a U.S. court in \n     the event the U.N. Security Council failed to create an \n     international criminal tribunal with jurisdiction to \n     prosecute senior Khmer Rouge leaders.\n       But Pol Pot was not a natural candidate for a genocide \n     prosecution before any U.S. court. Under 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1091(d) (1999), only an American citizen who is charged \n     with committing genocide anywhere in the world or anyone \n     (including an alien) who commits genocide in the United \n     States can be prosecuted. This seemed incredulous to me at \n     the time, given the prima facie case against Pol Pot for \n     atrocity crimes, including genocide, and this rare \n     opportunity to capture and bring him to justice. Instead of \n     stepping forward immediately and making U.S. courts available \n     to prosecute this notorious individual, I had to wade into a \n     thicket of diplomacy to try to find a willing government \n     somewhere who would accept Pol Pot (if captured) and either \n     detain him until an international criminal tribunal was \n     created or prosecute him in its own courts.\n       Nonetheless, efforts were made by the Justice Department \n     (beginning in late June 1977) to explore options under U.S. \n     law for a possible prosecution of Pol Pot if he were captured \n     and brought to U.S. territory. Initially, attention focused \n     on whether any U.S. official personnel were victims of the \n     atrocity crimes of the Pol Pot regime. The roster of federal \n     agencies from which personnel could be identified for this \n     purpose was set forth in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1114. The Central \n     Intelligence Agency was not listed in that roster of \n     agencies. U.S. courts would have had jurisdiction over a \n     crime committed (in this situation, in Cambodia) against U.S. \n     personnel from one of the designated agencies in Section \n     1114. However, no such individual could be identified by the \n     Justice Department. Therefore, we lost our best opportunity \n     for jurisdiction for the reason that, according to the \n     Justice Department research, no U.S. government personnel (at \n     least from the agencies identified in Section 1114) lost \n     their lives under the Pol Pot regime. There were American \n     citizens who died in Cambodia during the relevant period \n     (1975-1979) of Pol Pot's rule, but they did not qualify \n     under U.S. law at the time as triggering federal \n     jurisdiction.\n       There was a second rational for prosecution of Pol Pot \n     which arose in March 1998 when we were very close to \n     achieving apprehension of Pol Pot and flying him out of \n     Cambodia or Thailand to U.S. territory. Justice Department \n     officials put forward a theory called the ex post facto \n     limitation analysis. It was a high risk gamble in federal \n     court that rested, essentially, as I recall, on applying the \n     customary law principles codified in the Convention on the \n     Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and the \n     Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or \n     Degrading Treatment or Punishment to the events that \n     transpired in Cambodia in the late 1970's, and joining those \n     principles with the President's broad authority under the \n     foreign affairs powers of the U.S. Constitution. One must \n     remember that the Genocide Convention Implementation Act of \n     1988 (the Proxmire Act) was not adopted until 1988 and thus \n     acts of genocide committed during the late 1970's would not \n     have qualified in any event for U.S. prosecution even if the \n     standard grounds for personal or territorial jurisdiction \n     under the law were satisfied. The Justice Department \n     officials warned that there was no assurance whatsoever that \n     a federal court would be persuaded by the ex post facto \n     limitation analysis and if the judicial effort failed, then \n     Pol Pot might walk away free from U.S. detention and onto \n     U.S. territory. Ultimately, by September 1998, the Attorney \n     General signaled her unwillingness to attempt prosecution if \n     Pol Pot were brought to U.S. territory for any period other \n     than a very temporary stay (see below).\n       Of comparable concern to my Justice colleagues in 1997, \n     1998, and 1999 when either Pol Pot or Ta Mok or other senior \n     Khmer Rouge leaders were within our sights for apprehension \n     or surrender in Cambodia, was how to defeat a habeas corpus \n     petition by any one of them if they were detained on U.S. \n     territory or held by U.S. authorities on foreign territory. \n     That concern meant that Justice needed to be confident there \n     was enough evidence on the detainee to make a prima facie \n     case against him or at least provide sufficient documentation \n     to the court to ensure that the habeas petition would be \n     defeated. Although this concern was relevant for Pol Pot, it \n     became extremely significant with respect to other senior \n     Khmer Rouge leaders (such as Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary, Ta \n     Mok, Nuon Chea, and others) for whom the evidence had not yet \n     been collected to a degree and in a manner that satisfied the \n     Justice officials.\n       In response to this concern, the Justice Department \n     deployed lawyers to Yale University in New Haven, where \n     documents from the Pol Pot era were being stored, and \n     ultimately to the Documentation Center for Cambodia in Phnom \n     Penh, to examine documents that might implicate senior Khmer \n     Rouge leaders. I seem to recall that those research efforts \n     left the lawyers still concerned about whether a federal \n     court would dismiss a habeas challenge from any one of the \n     senior Khmer Rouge leaders.\n       These were critical arguments to factor into the overall \n     strategy. Justice officials advised that they would not want \n     to hold Pol Pot or his colleagues on U.S. territory for more \n     than about ten days if there was no likelihood of bringing \n     them to trial before a federal court. They also could not \n     rationalize any perpetual detention that would \n     unquestionably survive a habeas challenge. If we were not \n     prepared to prosecute the senior Khmer Rouge leaders in \n     federal court, including under the high-risk strategy of \n     ex post facto limitation analysis, then any detention on \n     U.S. territory must be exceptionally temporary (no more \n     than ten days), thus essentially serving as a way-station \n     to a confirmed onward destination (namely, a foreign \n     national court or an international criminal tribunal).\n       These significant concerns, prompted by the absence of a \n     genocide law that had jurisdiction over Pol Pot and senior \n     Khmer Rouge leaders and by concerns over habeas corpus \n     challenges in the federal courts, pointed us to a detention \n     strategy that stood a much better chance of defeating, if not \n     avoiding, a habeas challenge and ultimately using a \n     jursdiction (national or international) willing to prosecute \n     these individuals.\n       When the net was closing in on Pol Pot in March 1998, we \n     arranged with Palau that it serve as a likely destination for \n     Pol Pot, who would be flown there by U.S. aircraft with the \n     permission of the Government of Palau and the Government of \n     Cambodia. U.S. Marshalls would guard Pol Pot until a suitable \n     jurisdiction could be found for his trial (and we knew that \n     might take some time). After Pol Pot's sudden and untimely \n     (not to mention mysterious) death in Cambodia in late March \n     1998, we focused on using Palau as a detention site for any \n     other senior Khmer Rouge leaders who could be apprehended \n     and, with the permission of the Government of Cambodia, \n     transported out of Cambodia (or Thailand if anyone of them \n     had crossed the border during a chase) to Palau to await a \n     final destination for trial. But the dynamics of custody \n     evolved following Pol Pot's death. Arrangements for potential \n     detention on Palau were finalized and by August and September \n     1998, the internal argument prevailed that any custody on \n     Palau should be joint custody by Cambodian and American \n     guards, undertaken at the request of the Cambodian \n     Government, and preferably (though it was not essential) \n     achieved even at the request of the detainee. At that point, \n     we knew that most potential detainees (senior Khmer Rouge \n     leaders) did not wish to be incarcerated in Cambodia. Indeed, \n     we knew that shortly bcfore his death Pol Pot had reportedly \n     told journalist Nate Thayer that he was prepared to go to the \n     United States to face justice. We also knew by September 1998 \n     that Ta Mok was not willing to surrender for a trial in \n     Cambodia, but we wondered whether that was a signal that he \n     might agree to stand trial outside of Cambodia.\n       The joint custody arrangement on Palau, especially if it \n     could be supplemented by the request of the detainee himself, \n     could greatly strengthen the Justice Department's case in the \n     event of a habeas corpus challenge to federal court by anyone \n     of the detainees that might be held in Palau. Even though \n     Palau was by then an independent nation, its former U.S. \n     territorial status and the fact of U.S. custody on Palau \n     raised enough concerns that the shield of joint Cambodian-\n     American custody, the request of the Government of Cambodia, \n     and the approval of the Government of Palau all combined to \n     reassure us of the viability of a Palau detention site. One \n     indeed was created; U.S. Marshalls were deployed in \n     anticipation of arrivals of captured senior Khmer Rouge \n     leaders; and even the U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines, who \n     included Palau in his portfolio, at one point stood ready at \n     the site to receive the suspects. I need to \n     emphasize, however, that Palau was seen strictly as a \n     relatively temporary detention site until a proper and \n     willing national jurisdiction could be found or, with the \n     possibility of an international criminal tribunal, created \n     for\n\n[[Page S5709]]\n\n     purposes of investigating and prosecuting these \n     individuals. But we had no expectation of it taking more \n     than several months to find suitable jurisdiction \n     (particularly given the high-profile reality of Pol Pot \n     finally in custody and our hope that having him in custody \n     would spur Security Council interest in finding a means to \n     prosecute him).\n       As it turned out, not a single senior Khmer Rouge leader \n     was ever captured with the assistance of U.S. authorities. \n     The cooperation of the Cambodian Government for detention of \n     suspects at Palau collapsed by early 1999. The plan would \n     have been activated if our efforts to capture Pol Pot had not \n     been scuttled by his sudden death in late March 1998. Our \n     vigorous efforts to capture Ta Mok (or secure his surrender) \n     during the rest of 1998 and into early 1999 finally were \n     overtaken when he was captured by Cambodian forces and \n     detained in Phnom Penh. Other senior Khmer Rouge leaders \n     surrendered under arrangements that kept them out of prison \n     in Cambodia, with the exception of Kang Kek Ieu (alias \n     Comrade Duch), the chief of the notorious Tuol Sleng prison, \n     who remains imprisoned to this day by Cambodian authorities \n     in Phnom Penh. So the habeas corpus concerns never were \n     tested even under the remote circumstances that would have \n     been presented with a joint custody arrangement in Palau.\n       The other story in this saga concerns my efforts to find \n     the alternative jurisdiction before which Pol Pot and his \n     colleagues could be held until transferred to a newly \n     established international criminal tribunal or prosecuted for \n     genocide and other atrocity crimes. In all of these efforts, \n     which I will describe briefly, the fact that the United \n     States was incapable of prosecuting the crime of genocide \n     against Pol Pot and the senior Khmer Rouge leaders was \n     diplomatically crippling. It forced me to concede that the \n     United States had not stepped up to the plate itself with \n     some reasonable application of universal jurisdiction for \n     genocide. How could I credibly persuade other governments to \n     stretch their domestic law to prosecute Pol Pot et al. when \n     the United States was not prepared to do so (and had as much \n     if not more reason to try to do so in the case of Cambodia \n     than, say, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, or Spain). If the United \n     States had had the legal tools wit which to prosecute Pol \n     Pot, but was hampered for some political or logistical \n     reason, at least then I could have argued with credibility \n     that a foreign government also has the responsibility to step \n     forward and bring this man to justice. So I was dealt a very \n     weak hand.\n       I pursued two tracks of diplomatic strategy to find a \n     jurisdiction willing and able to prosecute Pol Pot and the \n     senior Khmer Rouge leaders. Both tracks were launched \n     immediately in June 1997 when the first opportunity arose to \n     apprehend Pol Pot. The first track was to approach countries \n     either with some capability in their domestic criminal codes \n     to exercise a form of universal jurisdiction over genocide \n     and/or crimes against humanity or (we thought) might be \n     willing to find an innovative way to prosecute Pol Pot. These \n     countries at first included Canada and Denmark and later, in \n     April 1998, expanded to include Germany, Spain, Norway, \n     Sweden, Australia, and Israel. Each one of them declined the \n     opportunity I presented to receive Pol Pot for trial in the \n     event the United States Government arranged for his capture \n     and then transport to such country. Each one also declined \n     the opportunity to hold Pol Pot temporarily until a \n     suitable national court or international criminal tribunal \n     could be found or created for the purpose of prosecuting \n     Pol Pot and other senior Khmer Rouge leaders.\n       The second track of diplomatic strategy was to persuade \n     U.N. Security Council members to join us in approving the \n     establishment of an international criminal tribunal to \n     investigate and prosecute the senior Khmer Rouge leaders \n     (including Pol Pot while he was still alive). This proposal \n     went through various stages of evolution, and included plans \n     for sharing certain functions, such as the prosecutor and the \n     appeals chamber, with the International Criminal Tribunal for \n     the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). In late April and early May of \n     1998 I worked closely with the U.S. Mission to the United \n     Nations to formally present a draft resolution, with a draft \n     statute for the tribunal appended, to other Security Council \n     members for their consideration. Concerns by other members \n     arose as to germaneness for the Council (i.e., whether there \n     still existed a threat to international peace and security in \n     Cambodia that would trigger Security Council jurisdiction), \n     whether the ICTY's jurisdiction (or perhaps that of the \n     International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda) should be \n     expanded, whether the Government of Cambodia would formally \n     request such a tribunal (which one permanent member \n     considered essential), and how the cost would be borne. China \n     and Russia, in particular, balked at the proposal and refused \n     to indicate any support whatsoever. Tribunal fatigue on the \n     Security Council also took hold to slow down the Cambodia \n     option. Another key factor was the advent of the permanent \n     International Criminal Court and concerns that an initiative \n     on Cambodia would shift attention and resources away from \n     that key priority for many of the Security Council members \n     (permanent and non-permanent).\n       Without any leverage to threaten U.S. prosecution in the \n     absence of an international criminal tribunal, I could only \n     press the merits of the issue as hard as possible, knowing \n     that achieving international justice for the atrocity crimes \n     of the Pol Pot regime was not a high priority for most other \n     governments. Indeed, for some it may have been viewed as a \n     threat to their own national interests. I would have \n     benefited, however, if at key junctures in the negotiations \n     over an international criminal tribunal I could have asked \n     whether our colleagues on the Security Council would be more \n     comfortable with a U.S. federal court examining the evidence \n     or would they find more palatable a tribunal of international \n     composition investigating Pol Pot's deeds. I never had the \n     opportunity to offer that choice in my talks.\n       By August 1999 I had exhausted my final efforts to achieve \n     a Security Council international criminal tribunal with both \n     the Government of Cambodia and with other Security Council \n     members. At that point the Clinton Administration shifted its \n     focus to creating a hybrid court in Cambodia and intensive \n     efforts led by late 2000 to what became the Extraordinary \n     Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, approved initially by the \n     Cambodian National Assembly in early 2001. But by August 1999 \n     the prospect of looking to the United States as a plausible \n     jurisdiction for prosecution of genocide in Cambodia already \n     had become a distant memory.\n       In conclusion, I would stress that the inability of U.S. \n     courts to prosecute Pol Pot and the senior Khmer Rouge \n     leaders contributed to significant delays in bringing these \n     individuals to justice, delays that reverberate to this day \n     as the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia \n     struggle to overcome one obstacle after another before \n     proceeding to indictments and trials. Several key suspects \n     died before they could be brought to trial, including Pol \n     Pot, Ke Pauk, and Ta Mok. Their fates--dead before justice \n     could be rendered--did not necessarily have to become the \n     historical record. We could have moved much faster and more \n     decisively in 1997 and 1998 to secure their custody, ensure \n     proper medical care, and bring them before a court of either \n     national or international jurisdiction if the reality of U.S. \n     jurisdiction for at least the crime of genocide had existed. \n     If we seek to influence others to prosecute the crime of \n     genocide, and if we aspire to arming our diplomats with the \n     arguments they need to influence other governments to accept \n     their responsibilities for international justice, we must be \n     able to demonstrate that our courts have, within reasonable \n     parameters, the jurisdiction to prosecute the crime of \n     genocide. Even if such jurisdiction may rest upon the \n     discretion of, say, the Attorney General under certain \n     extreme circumstances, we must be able to use it for the \n     worthy purpose of credible justice.\n       During the final negotiations for the Rome Statute of the \n     International Criminal Court in July 1998, I presented the \n     U.S. position that with respect to the crime of genocide, the \n     International Criminal Court should exercise universal \n     jurisdiction. That U.S. position in the negotiations was \n     partly influenced by our unfortunate experience with Pol Pot \n     months earlier.\n       I would hope that given all of this experience-stretching \n     back to the Holocaust and even earlier, and given the logic \n     that must apply to ending the crime of genocide, U.S. law at \n     long last could reflect the illegality of genocide committed \n     by anyone anywhere in the world and the ability of our courts \n     to prosecute the perpetrators of genocide, including when \n     they are non-citizens who stand on U.S. soil.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                   David Scheffer,\n         Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw/Robert A.

I hope that they are able to take comfort in the \nfact that Brian Botello died honorably as an American patriot and he is \nnow in a better place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/08/senate-section/article/S5709-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5709-S5710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today marks a historic moment for \nNorthern\n\n[[Page S5710]]\n\nIreland and for countless people in Ireland, Great Britain, the United \nStates, and around the world who have prayed and hoped and worked for \nlasting peace.\n  Today, the devolved Government of Northern Ireland stands up to \ngovern peacefully and democratically. The commitment of everyone \ninvolved, their constructive negotiations, their sacrifice, and their \nfaith led us to this day of a new government and renewed hope.\n  I am proud of the role my husband and I were able to play in helping \nto bring about peace in Northern Ireland and to help make today \npossible.\n  Of course, some doubted that lasting peace could be possible. So many \nhad lived through decades of violence, hate, and ill will; so many had \nburied loved ones. So many were resigned to what had felt, for them, \ninevitable: their children and their children's children would suffer \nthe same fate. Their children were destined to grow up, go to school, \nand start their own families in the shadow of history and hostility. In \nrecent months and years hope was fading. But not for the people of \nNorthern Ireland who have endured great hardships who said to their \nleaders, ``It is time for peace.''\n  I remember in my visits to Northern Ireland meeting with women and \nmen, leaders and citizens, who shared the same longing for peace, the \nsame hopes for their children, and the same desire for a better future. \nIt was this spirit that triumphed, that rose above the bad blood, that \nhelped a people overcome a difficult legacy, to escape that shadow. It \nwas this spirit that led to the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in \n1998. It is this spirit that we honor on a historic day.\n  I remember when Bill, Chelsea, and I traveled to Ireland in 1996. It \nwas an important trip for lasting peace, and it was a memorable trip \nfor me personally--among the most special in my time in the White \nHouse. In Ireland, I met the Nobel prizewinning poet Seamus Heaney. His \nwords would become the theme for our visit and for this moment in Irish \nhistory.\n\n     History says, Don't hope\n     On this side of the grave,\n     But then, once in a lifetime\n     The longed-for tidal wave\n     Of justice can rise up\n     And hope and history rhyme.\n\n  For mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, and sons and daughters \nof Northern Ireland, history said to them ``don't hope.'' But they \nhoped.\n  When we traveled through Ireland in 1996, I spent time with women \nworking for peace. I was struck by so many who had suffered but did not \nsuffer without hope; women who lost husbands and sons and loved ones \nbut did not lose faith.\n  I will always carry the memory of 65-year-old Joyce McCartan, a \nremarkable woman who founded the Women's Information Drop-in Center in \n1987 after her 17-year-old son was shot dead by Protestant gunman. She \nhad lost more than a dozen family members to violence. Joyce and other \nwomen had set up the center as a safe house, a place for women of both \nreligions to convene and talk over their needs and fears. I remember \nJoyce saying, ``It takes women to bring men to their senses.''\n  I met with Joyce and several women sitting around a table who \ndescribed over tea how worried they were when their sons and husbands \nleft the house and relieved when they arrived safely home. When I left \nour meeting, Joyce gave me a teapot to remember them by. Joyce died \nbefore having the chance to see the Good Friday Agreement and before \nthis historic day. But when I spoke at the first memorial lecture in \nher honor in 1997 in Belfast, I brought with me that teapot. I put the \nteapot on the podium and spoke of the courage of Irish women like Joyce \nwho, at kitchen tables and over pots of tea, helped chart a path to \npeace. She helped make lasting peace possible; she helped write the \nsong in which hope and history could rhyme. I still fill with emotion \nwhenever I see that teapot or think about her.\n  I hope we can continue to draw inspiration from these stories of \ncourage. There are countless people like Joyce whose names we will \nnever know who helped make this day possible.\n  I also want to commend the political parties. Many people have \nsuffered deep losses and the healing process will continue far into the \nfuture. I praise everyone involved, especially Prime Minister Blair and \nTaoiseach Bertie Ahern, who stayed strong when it seemed hope was \nfading. I know that the Catholic and Protestant leaders who have been \nworking to see this day become reality are grateful for a bright and \nprosperous Northern Ireland.\n  During my last visit to Northern Ireland and Ireland I had the \npleasure of seeing familiar faces and to visit with party leaders who I \nknow all wanted a new day and a new beginning. And I commend political \nleaders like Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein, the Reverend Ian Paisley of the \nDUP, and all the others past and present who have worked hard.\n  I also want to remember the efforts of people like Senator George \nMitchell, John Hume, David Trimble, Martin McGuinness, David Ervine \nSeamus Mallon and Mo Mowlam; people involved so deeply in the \nnegotiations leading up to the 1998 agreement. The sacrifices and \ncompromises made back then formed the basis of today's devolved \ngovernment.\n  So many worked so hard and sacrificed so much over the past years and \nI think we must acknowledge everyone for their work and their endurance \nin traveling the long and difficult road to reach today's milestone.\n  I want to commend my colleagues here in the Senate and across the \nRotunda in the House, people like Senators Ted Kennedy, Chris Dodd, and \nPatrick Leahy; Congressmen Richie Neal, Joe Crowley, Jim Walsh, Peter \nKing, Brian Higgins. I want to commend everyone who labored to show the \nsupport of the American people and the Congress. Thank you for your \nleadership.\n  I have been proud to work among civic and business leaders on a \nvariety of cross-border, cross-community efforts designed to spread the \nprosperity that is possible when people work together. I am grateful \nfor the business leaders who have been strong partners in furthering \nthe peace process and for the contributions they make to society in \nspurring job growth, economic investment, and trade throughout Ireland \nand beyond.\n  What has happened--and what is happening--in Northern Ireland should \nserve as a model for peace and reconciliation in our world and I \nbelieve people will look back upon these times and realize how truly \ngreat the accomplishment is for humanity.\n  I also want to recognize the Irish and Scots-Irish Americans who \nhelped make the United States what it is today. Not only does today \nmark a victory for the people of Northern Ireland, today also marks the \n62nd anniversary of Victory in Europe, which helped usher in peace and \nprosperity across Europe and the world.\n  The movement toward lasting peace in Northern Ireland is a model for \nhow we, as a nation, can engage the rest of the world. But the progress \nwe are commemorating today represents a larger note of hope: peace is \npossible.\n  I want to honor the leaders who now assume great responsibility to \ngovern, heal and lead Northern Ireland into a new era. America must \nalways stand with those working on behalf of Northern Ireland, and all \npeople working and longing for a brighter, peaceful, more hopeful \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/08/senate-section/article/S5710-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5710-S5711]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING FORMER SENATOR ROBERT STAFFORD\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to speak today in remembrance of \nformer Senator Robert Stafford, who passed away this past December and \nfor whom we will be having a memorial service this evening.\n  I personally remember Bob as a moderate voice in the Senate, never \nputting partisan politics above his principled ideals. He and I served \ntogether on the Senate Committee of Labor and Human Resources in the \nearly 1980s, beginning when I was a relatively young first-term Senator \nchairing the committee and Bob was beginning his third decade of \ncongressional service. I often found Bob's advice and counsel to be \nhelpful in handling many of the issues which came before the committee.\n  I, personally, remember what a profound influence Bob had on the \nLabor and Human Resources Committee while I was chairman. As a young \nchairman and a relatively new Member\n\n[[Page S5711]]\n\nof the Senate, I was sometimes frustrated with the way Bob and Senator \nLowell Weicker often voted with the Democrats on almost every issue. \nThis disparity of views within my committee forced me to work even \nharder to forge worthwhile and well-thought-out bipartisan compromises \nin order to move important legislation. This proved to be an enormous \nchallenge but one that shaped my career and made me a better \nlegislator. There is no question that challenges and beliefs of Bob and \nLowell made me the legislator I am today.\n  Bob was born in 1913 in Rutland, VT. As a product of the Rutland \npublic schools, he attended Middlebury College and received his first \ndegree in 1935. He graduated from Boston University Law School in 1938 \nand immediately began what would be a long and distinguished career in \npublic service.\n  Immediately after graduating from law school, Bob served as a Rutland \nCounty prosecuting attorney. In 1942, he left the prosecutor's office \nto serve our country in World War II. Enlisting in the Navy as a \nlieutenant commander, he served in active duty for the duration of the \nwar.\n  Bob returned home to Rutland, VT, in 1947 and became a Vermont \nstate's attorney. He served in that capacity for 4 years before \nvolunteering to serve in our Nation's military in another foreign \nconflict, this time in Korea. Bob once again served honorably in the \nNavy from 1951 to 1953.\n  Returning home again in 1953, Robert began his career in Vermont \nState politics. I think both Senators Leahy and Sanders would agree \nthat Bob was iconic figure in Vermont's political history.\n  Bob worked in the Vermont Attorney General's Office from 1953 to \n1957, serving those last 2 years as Vermont's attorney general. In \n1957, he was elected Lieutenant Governor, and in 1959, he was elected \nto be the State's Governor.\n  After rising quickly to the top of Vermont state politics, he was \nelected to Vermont's only seat in the House of Representatives in 1960 \nand, after being elected to five successive terms, he resigned his seat \nin 1971 to accept appointment to the Senate, temporarily filling the \nvacancy left by the death of Senator Winston L. Prouty.\n  Though he began his Senate tenure as a temporary replacement, Bob \nwould, in many ways, become a permanent part of this institution. He \nwon a special election in 1972 to serve out the remainder of Senator \nProuty's term, and he would remain Vermont's Senator for 17 more years, \nretiring on his own terms in 1989.\n  As an educated man himself, he was always a champion of higher \neducation. In fact, our Nation's most prominent student loan program \nwas renamed after Bob during his last term in office.\n  He also played an important role in modernizing Federal disaster \nrelief. In 1988, President Reagan signed into law the Robert T. \nStafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, which created \nthe system in place today by which a Presidential disaster declaration \nof an emergency triggers financial and physical assistance through the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA. Obviously, Bob was \ninstrumental in passing this landmark legislation.\n  During his time in Congress, Bob and I worked together to reform \nparts of the Federal entitlement system and to trim the fat from costly \nFederal programs. Although he and I would often disagree, I always \nenjoyed hearing his persuasive arguments to articulate his commitment. \nEven if you didn't agree with Bob's politics, you had to respect the \nthoughtful and genuine effort he put in to formulating his opinions and \narguing his positions. I appreciated Bob very much for his convictions \nand his passion.\n  Mr. President, in Bob, our Nation has lost an elder statesman and a \nprincipled leader. His leadership and tireless public service are \nexamples for all of us who have aspired to serve this great Nation. I \nam grateful for this evening's opportunity to remember his service and \nto reflect on his example.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/08/senate-section/article/S5711-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5711]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         LEARNING FROM KATRINA\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, once we were able to see beyond the \ndeath, destruction, and suffering that Hurricane Katrina wrought, we \nsaw that America is unprepared for a megacatastrophe. We learned that \nlesson at the expense of those in the gulf states.\n  Nevertheless, our vulnerability is not limited to Louisiana, \nMississippi, and Texas, or to our Southern Atlantic States.\n  Fifty-seven percent of Americans live in areas prone to earthquakes, \nhurricanes, or other massive disasters. We know about the quakes that \nhave rocked California, Oregon, and Alaska. But the largest earthquake \nto strike the continental U.S. was centered in New Madrid, MO, in 1811. \nIt rattled a swath of land that spanned from Mississippi to Michigan, \nfrom Pennsylvania to Nebraska.\n  Twenty States, including Hawaii, and States that share a shoreline \nwith the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico, face the threat of \nhurricanes or severe storms every year.\n  New Jersey experienced the second most severe storm in its history \njust last month. These downpours forced nearly 5,000 New Jerseyans to \nevacuate their homes and led to the deaths of at least three.\n  Increasing numbers of people make those areas of vulnerability their \nhomes every day. Eight out of the eleven most costly U.S. natural \ncatastrophes have occurred since 2001.\n  The failures of Katrina--from neglected levies to negligent \nleadership--must be acknowledged and addressed now, before the next \ncatastrophe strikes. We have a moral obligation to learn from that \nexperience.\n  America needs an integrated program that unifies State and Federal \npolicies to prepare and protect American families from the devastation \nof natural catastrophes.\n  There are steps we can and must take--and we must take them today.\n  We must prevent unnecessary loss of life and property by encouraging \nState and local governments to enact sensible building codes and land \nuse policies that recognize the exposure to natural catastrophes.\n  We must support first responders with the equipment, training, and \npersonnel needed to save lives and reduce property damage.\n  We must educate consumers and provide them the tools they need to \nprepare for catastrophes and protect their families and homes from \nharm.\n  We must establish a rigorous process of continuous improvement by \nlearning from past mistakes and assessing recovery efforts after every \ndisaster to identify ways to continually improve our ability to recover \nfrom catastrophes.\n  My Senate colleagues, the warnings before Hurricane Katrina were \nshamefully ignored and unheeded, the response was slow and erratic, and \nthis Nation paid an enormous price.\n  We have been warned. We must learn from the lessons of Katrina and \nexhibit the leadership America needs to be prepared and protected from \ncatastrophes to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/08/senate-section/article/S5711-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5711-S5712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PRESIDENT ALVARO URIBE\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to speak for a moment today \nabout a recent Washington Post editorial and President Alvaro Uribe of \nColombia.\n  I noted with interest the Washington Post Sunday editorial concerning \ncriticism President Uribe has received lately. I believe the Washington \nPost made some good points and asked the right questions. Like, why do \nsome Americans heap criticism on a man who is one of our few allies in \na region dominated by the likes of Hugo Chavez and Fidel Castro and who \nhas dedicated himself to ending the violence in his country and \nbringing justice to Columbia?\n  I agree with the Washington Post, that perhaps we should be more \ndiscerning in who we criticize and treat those who would be friends to \nthe United Sates with a little more deference.\n  Additionally, I ask unanimous consent that an editorial concerning \nPresident Uribe from the Washington Post be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 6, 2007]\n\n    Assault on an Ally: Why are Democrats so ``Deeply Troubled'' by \n                        Colombia's Alvaro Uribe?\n\n       Colombian President Alvaro Uribe may be the most popular \n     democratic leader in the\n\n[[Page S5712]]\n\n     world. Last week, as he visited Washington, a poll showed his \n     approval rating at 80.4 percent--extraordinary for a \n     politician who has been in office nearly five years. \n     Colombians can easily explain this: Since his first election \n     in 2002, Mr. Uribe has rescued their country from near-\n     failed-state status, doubling the size of the army and \n     extending the government's control to large areas that for \n     decades were ruled by guerrillas and drug traffickers. The \n     murder rate has dropped by nearly half and kidnappings by 75 \n     percent. For the first time thugs guilty of massacres and \n     other human rights crimes are being brought to justice, and \n     the political system is being purged of their allies. With \n     more secure conditions for investment, the free-market \n     economy is booming.\n       In a region where populist demagogues are on the offensive, \n     Mr. Uribe stands out as a defender of liberal democracy, not \n     to mention a staunch ally of the United States. So it was \n     remarkable to see the treatment that the Colombian president \n     received in Washington. After a meeting with the Democratic \n     congressional leadership, Mr. Uribe was publicly scolded by \n     House Majority leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), whose \n     statement made no mention of the ``friendship'' she recently \n     offered Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. Human Rights Watch, \n     which has joined the Democratic campaign against Mr. Uribe, \n     claimed that ``today Colombia presents the worst human rights \n     and humanitarian crisis in the Western hemisphere''--never \n     mind Venezuela or Cuba or Haiti. Former vice president Al \n     Gore, who has advocated direct U.S. negotiations with the \n     regimes of Kim Jong II and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, recently \n     canceled a meeting with Mr. Uribe because, Mr. Gore said, he \n     found the Colombian's record ``deeply troubling.''\n       What could explain this backlash? Democrats claim to be \n     concerned--far more so than Colombians, apparently--with \n     ``revelations'' that the influence of right-wing paramilitary \n     groups extended deep into the military and Congress. In fact \n     this has been well-known for years; what's new is that \n     investigations by Colombia's Supreme Court and attorney \n     general have resulted in the jailing and prosecution of \n     politicians and security officials. Many of those implicated \n     come from Mr. Uribe's Conservative Party, and his former \n     intelligence chief is under investigation. But the president \n     himself has not been charged with wrongdoing. On the \n     contrary: His initiative to demobilize 30,000 right-wing \n     paramilitary fighters last year paved the way for the current \n     investigations, which he and his government have supported \n     and funded.\n       In fact, most of those who attack Mr. Uribe for the \n     ``parapolitics'' affair have opposed him all along, and for \n     very different reasons. Some, like Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-\n     Vt.), reflexively resist U.S. military aid to Latin America. \n     Colombia has received more than $5 billion in economic and \n     military aid from the Clinton and Bush administrations to \n     fight drug traffickers and the guerrillas, and it hopes to \n     receive $3.9 billion more in the next six years. Some, like \n     Rep. Sander M. Levin (D-Mich.), are eager to torpedo \n     Colombia's pending free-trade agreement with the United \n     States. Now that the Bush administration has conceded almost \n     everything that House Democrats asked for in order to pass \n     pending trade deals, protectionist hard-liners have sized on \n     the supposed human rights ``crisis'' as a pretext to \n     blackball Colombia.\n       Perhaps Mr. Uribe is being punished by Democrats, too, \n     because he has remained an ally of George W. Bush even as his \n     neighbor, Venezuela's Hugo Chavez, portrays the U.S. \n     president as ``the devil.'' Whatever the reasons, the \n     Democratic campaign is badly misguided. If the Democrats \n     succeed in wounding Mr. Uribe or thwarting his attempt to \n     consolidate a democracy that builds its economy through free \n     trade, the United States may have to live without any Latin \n     American allies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/08/senate-section/article/S5712-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       2007 NATIONAL TEACHER DAY\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I recognize May 8, 2007 as \nNational Teacher Day.\n  Teachers play a vital role in our society. They are a driving force \nin the course this great Nation takes. The molding of young minds is a \ndaunting task. Yet teachers willingly accept the challenge with open \narms. Being a former math teacher, I know the great challenges teachers \nface every day. Teachers often have thankless jobs, getting little \nappreciation for the myriad of tasks they do on a daily basis. They tie \nshoes, wipe noses, dab tears, and provide comfort all without asking \nfor anything in return. Teachers are disciplinarians, educators, and \nfriends. Their job is truly invaluable and priceless. Teachers give \neach student a toolbox full of essential tools to use, training them \nfor many of life's situations that might come their way. These tools \ngive students the confidence to face each day prepared for living.\n  Historian Henry Adams said, ``A teacher affects eternity; he can \nnever tell where his influence stops.'' I couldn't agree more. \nEducators all over the country teach and train America's next \ngeneration. Students are given direction and guidance for their futures \nfrom their teachers. Teachers can be very influential in the lives of \ntheir students, and thus influence generations of people to come.\n  Let me take this opportunity to recognize Ms. Tamara Tiong for her \nrecent nomination for the National Teacher of the Year Award. Ms. Tiong \nis a special education teacher at Dulce Elementary School in Dulce, NM, \nand has taught for 8 years. She is a shining example of what all \nteachers strive to be: challenging, encouraging, and compassionate. I \nthank Ms. Tiong today for her great service and wish her many more \nyears of teaching and training America's youth.\n  Join me today in saying thank you to our teachers for all they do. \nThey deserve our thanks and support. Thank you, teachers, for every \nlife you have touched and every life you will touch in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/08/senate-section/article/S5712-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate took two rollcall \nvotes. The first vote was on Senator Cochran's second degree amendment, \nS.A. 1010, to Senator Dorgan's prescription drug importation amendment, \nS.A. 990. The Cochran amendment passed the Senate by a 49 to 40 vote. \nThe second vote was on the motion to invoke cloture on the committee \nsubstitute amendment to the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendment Act of \n2007, S. 1082, which was agreed to by an 82 to 8 vote.\n  Although I was unable to be present for these two votes, I would like \nto state for the record how I would have voted. I would have opposed \nSenator Cochran's amendment which requires the Secretary of HHS to \ncertify that drug importation would not pose any safety risk to \nconsumers. As a matter of practice, the Secretary is not able to \ncertify that any drug from any facility, here in the United States or \nabroad, would not pose a safety risk. As such, this amendment \neffectively would block the implementation of Senator Dorgan's \namendment.\n  The fact that the Cochran amendment passed is unfortunate. It is \nunconscionable that Americans are paying on average twice as much for \nlifesaving drugs as citizens of other countries, and our State and \nFederal health programs are struggling to bear these costs.\n  Finally, my HELP Committee colleagues have spent months negotiating \nand drafting the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendment Act, which \ncontains a number of critical reauthorizing and drug safety provisions. \nI would have voted in favor of cloture on this bill and look forward to \nits passage later this week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/08/senate-section/article/S5712-3", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the need for hate \ncrimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate \ncrimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate crimes \nlaw, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our \nsociety. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight \na separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On August 22, 2002, in San Francisco, CA, Jack Broughton and his \nfemale companion, Jean Earl, beat two women outside a gay poetry event. \nPolice reported that Earl began kicking and punching people while \nshouting anti-gay epithets at the event's participants. After being \nkicked out, Broughton and Earl beat a 34-year-old woman outside. \nBroughton then punched the first victim's partner, who joined in the \nscuffle. The first victim suffered minor injuries, for which she was \ntreated at a hospital.\n  According to reports, the victim's were attacked solely because of \ntheir sexual orientation.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew \nShepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by \npassing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts \nand minds as well.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/08/senate-section/article/S5713-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5713]]\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n           TRIBUTE TO PRUDENTIAL AWARD MASSACHUSETTS HONOREES\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today it is my pleasure to \ncongratulate and honor two young Massachusetts students who have \nachieved national recognition for exemplary volunteer service in their \ncommunities. Alyssa Bickoff of Brookline and David Poritz of Amherst \nhave been named State honorees in the 2007 Prudential Spirit of \nCommunity awards program. One high school student and one middle school \nstudent from each State are honored annually.\n  Alyssa Bickoff, an eighth-grader at Solomon Schechter Day School in \nNewton, is being honored for her efforts in raising nearly $25,000 to \nhelp find a cure for ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease. Alyssa's father lost \na best friend to the neuromuscular disease, which motivated her \ncommitment to help raise money to fund the research necessary to find a \ncure. Alyssa raised this money by selling specially inscribed \nwristbands and participating in fundraising walks. The money that \nAlyssa raised has been used not only to fund research, but has also \npurchased wheelchairs and mobility items for patients. Alyssa's story \nis a true example of hope for a brighter America.\n  David Poritz, a senior at Amherst Regional High School, is recognized \nfor founding a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping communities \nadversely affected by oil contamination in the Amazon River basin of \nEcuador. David researched cases involving oil contamination in Ecuador. \nHe spent a month learning to speak Spanish fluently, and then organized \na drive throughout New England collecting 12,500 pairs of shoes for \nchildren in Ecuador. Since then, David's organization, Esperanza \nInternational, Inc., has raised money to furnish educational materials \nto impoverished schools, and provide medical supplies and support to \nlocal clinics. He has guided groups of students and teachers to the \nEcuadorian jungle, spoken with Ecuadorian cancer patients, and served \nas a liaison for doctors and other medical specialists visiting the \narea. David believes in the importance of reaching out and helping \nthose in need. His attitude and dedication to help the people of \nEcuador is highly commendable and inspiring to other young Americans.\n  In light of numerous statistics that indicate that Americans today \nare less involved in their communities than they once were, it is vital \nthat we encourage and support the kind of selfless contributions both \nof these young people have made. People of all ages need to think about \nhow we, as individual citizens, can work together at the local level to \nensure the health and vitality of our towns and neighborhoods. Young \nvolunteers like David and Alyssa are inspiring examples to all of us, \nand are among our brightest hopes for a better tomorrow.\n  The program that brought these young role models to our attention--\nThe Prudential Spirit of Community Awards--was created by Prudential \nFinancial in partnership with the National Association of Secondary \nSchool Principals in 1995 to impress upon all youth volunteers that \ntheir contributions are critically important and highly valued, and to \ninspire other young people to follow their example. Over the past 11 \nyears, the program has become the Nation's largest youth recognition \neffort based solely on community service, and has honored more than \n75,000 young volunteers at the local, State and national level.\n  Both Alyssa Bickoff and David Poritz should be extremely proud to \nhave been singled out from the thousands of dedicated volunteers who \nparticipated in this year's program. As part of their recognition, they \nwill come to Washington in early May, along with 100 other 2007 Spirit \nof Community honorees from across the country, for several days of \nspecial events, including visits to their Senators' offices on Capitol \nHill.\n  I applaud both of them for their initiative in seeking to make their \ncommunities better places to live, and for the positive impact they \nhave had on the lives of others. I also would like to salute other \nyoung people in my State who were named Distinguished Finalists by The \nPrudential Spirit of Community Awards for their outstanding volunteer \nservice. They are: Matthew Chase of Dover-Sherborn High School in \nDover, Kelsey Chisholm of Lynnfield High School in Lynnfield, Cieu Lan \nDong of Cambridge, Elizabeth Handel of Needham High School in Needham, \nGregg Katz of Nipmuc Regional High School in Upton, and Courtney Mota, \nDighton-Rehoboth Regional High School of Rehoboth.\n  All of these young people have demonstrated a level of commitment and \naccomplishment that is truly extraordinary in today's world, and \ndeserve our sincere admiration and respect. Their actions show that \nyoung Americans can--and do--play important roles in their communities, \nand that America's community spirit continues to hold tremendous \npromise for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/08/senate-section/article/S5713-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5713-S5714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:21 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 30.

A bill to amend the Act of July 3, 1890, to provide for the \ngranting to a State of a parcel of land for use as an agricultural \ncollege and to proscribe the use of earnings and proceeds thereof; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today, with my colleague from Idaho, \nSenator Craig, I rise to introduce a bill to amend the Idaho Admissions \nAct of July 3, 1890 to permit Idaho to administer Morrill Act lands and \nthe proceeds there from in accordance with contemporary investment \nstandards.\n  The State of Idaho has been working to update its management of \nendowed assets received as part statehood from the Federal Government \nto ensure the maximum long-term financial return to the beneficiaries. \nKey to endowment reform is the implementation of contemporary \ninvestment principles that require asset diversification to reduce the \nrisk of loss and that permit a trustee to deduct reasonable costs of \nadministration of the assets normally incurred by a prudent fiduciary. \nOf the Federal grants to Idaho as part of statehood, only the Morrill \nAct limits investments in bonds of the United States or Idaho and \nprecludes deducting reasonable administrative expenses incurred by the \ntrustee. This bill would allow the State of Idaho to administer the \nMorrill Act assets under the same fiduciary standards now applicable to \nall of Idaho's other federally granted endowments.\n  Additionally, a broad group of state, Federal, and private interests, \nincluding the University of Idaho College of Agricultural and Life \nSciences, the State of Idaho, United Dairymen of Idaho and Allied \nIndustry, College of Southern Idaho, the Idaho Cattle Association, \nIdaho Wool Growers, the Idaho National Laboratory, and Federal agencies \nhave joined together in developing plans for the Idaho Center for \nLivestock and Environmental Studies to serve as a premier center for \nresearch and education in dairy and beef science. The important mission \nof the center is ``To enhance the quality of life for the citizens of \nIdaho, the Pacific Northwest, and the Nation by furthering the \neducational and scientific mission of the University of Idaho and its \npublic/private partners, by providing a state-of-the-art animal \nresearch facility capable of large-scale research that provides sound \nscientific results and educational opportunities intended to: protect \nour air, land and water, improve the welfare and productivity of our \nlivestock, encourage the efficient use of energy and capital, and \nenhance workforce and economic development.''\n  The University of Idaho, as a partner in the project and beneficiary \nof the Morrill Act endowment, is well positioned to utilize endowment \nassets to both continue to carryout the educational purposes and \nmaintain the underlying real estate endowment while contributing to the \nproject. However, modernization of the management of endowed assets \nneeds to occur in order for such a worthy project to move forward.\n  That is why the legislation Senator Craig and I are introducing today \nwill provide more flexibility while allowing for the allocation of \nmanagement expenses in the same fashion as other State endowments, \nexpand investment authority to match other State endowments, and \nprovide for the use of the earnings from management of the sale of \nendowed lands to be used for the acquisition, construction, and \nimprovements for the operation of research farms for teaching and \nresearch purposes.\n  I ask that my colleagues act on this measure in a timely manner.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANDERS:\n  S. 1326. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve and \nenhance compensation and pension, health care, housing, burial, and \nother benefits for veterans, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Comprehensive \nVeterans Benefits Improvements Act of 2007.\n  The purpose of this bill is to address many of the long-standing \nbenefit and other policy issues that are a priority to the national \nveteran service organizations and millions of their members all across \nour country. The legislation tracks many of the recommendations made in \nthe Independent Budget, IB, for fiscal year 2008. The IB, as it is \nknown, is ``the collaborative effort of a united veteran and health \nadvocacy community that presents policy and budget recommendations on \nprograms administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the \nDepartment of Labor.'' It is a guide for how this country should treat \nits veterans. It is written jointly by AMVETS, Disabled American \nVeterans, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and Veterans of Foreign Wars \nand supported by over 50 other prominent organizations. I am very happy \nto have consulted extensively with the Independent Budget authors to \ncraft this legislation.\n  For too many years veterans' needs have been sent to the back of the \nline in Congress behind tax cuts for the rich and corporate welfare for \nmultinational corporations. This legislation is one step forward in \ncorrecting the shortcomings of the way our current system treats \nveterans. Instead of turning a blind eye to our veterans' needs as has \nhappened often in recent years, this bill begins to say ``thank you'' \nwith real action.\n  The Comprehensive Veterans Benefits Improvements Act makes more than \n25 separate changes to veterans' programs ranging from disability \npayments, to insurance premiums, to grants for disabled veterans to \nadapt their cars to make them easier to use.\n  We also try to make progress on long standing injustices in the VA \nand DoD benefit and retirement systems that veterans and their families \nhave fought to correct for years. Among them are:\n  Category 8 Veterans: In January of 2003 the VA announced that it \nwould no longer allow Category 8 veterans to enroll into the VA health \ncare system. The Administration justified this move on the grounds that \nthese are ``higher income'' veterans. The truth, however, is that these \nveterans can make as little as $27,000 a year. VA estimates that more \nthan 1.5 million category 8 veterans will have been denied enrollment \nin the VA health care system by fiscal year 2008. This legislation \nrepeals that ban.\n  Concurrent Receipt: As the Military Officers Association of America \nexplains, the Concurrent Receipt or Disabled Veterans' Tax issue exists \nbecause of a ``19th century law that required a dollar-for-dollar \noffset of military retired pay for disability compensation received \nfrom the VA . . . Retired pay is earned for a career of uniformed \nservice and VA disability compensation is recompense for pain, \nsuffering and lost future earning power due to service-connected \ndisabilities.'' For that reason veterans should receive both payments \nand not have one offset the other. This legislation would allow \nveterans to receive both compensation/pension benefits and retired or \nretirement pay.\n\n  Dependency and Indemnity Compensation-Survivor Benefit Plan Offset: \nUnder current law, the survivors of veterans who die as a result of \nservice-connected causes are entitled to compensation known as \ndependency and indemnity compensation, DIC. In addition, military \nretirees can have money deducted from their pay to purchase a survivors \nannuity. This is called the Survivor Benefit Plan, SBP. However, if the \nmilitary retirees dies from service-connected causes his or her \nsurvivors will receive a SBP payment offset dollar for dollar by the \namount of the DIC payment they receive. Like the offset between \nmilitary retiree pay and VA disability payments, this SBP/DIC offset \nunfairly denies beneficiaries the full amount of 2 programs that are \nmeant to compensate for different loses. This legislation repeals the \noffset between dependency and indemnity compensation and the Survivor \nBenefit Plan.\n\n[[Page S5720]]\n\n  Veterans' Claims: We also take a new approach to improving the system \nfor rating claims by creating an agency dedicated to electronically \nsharing clinical information between the VA and the DoD.\n  For too long these issues have been ignored by the Congress. It is \ntime for that attitude to change.\n  This legislation also amends other benefit programs important to \nveterans.\n  Over time, Congress and the Department of Veterans Affairs have added \nmany benefits and assistance programs for our Nation's veterans and \ntheir families. As with many programs, the benefits did not meet all \nthe needs of our veterans and others also have not been updated in many \nyears rendering many of their benefits much less useful. For example, \nthe IB notes the low level of grants the VA gives severely disabled \nveterans for adapting their cars:\n\n       In 1946 the $1,600 allowance represented 85 percent of \n     average retail cost and a sufficient amount to pay the full \n     cost of automobiles in the `low-price field.' By contrast, in \n     1997 the allowance was $5,500, and the average retail cost of \n     new automobiles, according to the National Automobile Dealers \n     Association, was $21,750. Currently, the $11,000 automobile \n     allowance represents only about 39 percent of the average \n     cost of a new automobile, which is $28,105.\n\n  This legislation increases this car grant amount to $22,484 and \nadjusts this amount automatically each year using an average retail car \ncost index established by the Secretary.\n  This is not the only example of a veterans' benefit being chipped \naway by inflation. When we look at assistance family members get for \nburying a loved one we find that the current benefits have not kept up \nwith inflation. As a result, the current benefit of $300 only pays for \na small fraction of the costs of a burial. The legislation I am \nintroducing today increases the plot allowance from $300 to $745 and \nexpands the eligibility for the plot allowance for all veterans who \nwould be eligible for burial in a national cemetery, not just those who \nserved during wartime. This section also contains a provision to adjust \nthese payments annually.\n  This legislation contains many other similar corrections and updates, \nbringing benefits into the 21st Century so that these programs are \nmeaningful again.\n  These are not controversial proposals. These changes are the least we \ncan do to show our appreciation for those who sacrifice for their \ncountry.\n  This legislation is attempting to strengthen the current VA system so \nthat it can fully provide for those veterans already in the system and \nthose thousands more returning from Iraq and Afghanistan and all over \nthe world that will soon come to the VA for care.\n  This is just the beginning; one part of a larger effort to honor our \nveterans and their service. We here in Congress have so much more to do \nto care for our veterans such as improving mental health care for \nveterans, Traumatic Brain Injury treatment, Post Traumatic Stress \nDisorder treatment, transition assistance, polytrauma care, caring for \nhomeless veterans, and eliminating the waiting lines and claims \nbacklogs at the VA. As a parent of a fallen soldier told our Committee, \nthese veterans have survived the war, now ``[w]e've got to help them \nsurvive the peace.''\n  We have much work to do in the Veterans Affairs Committee and I look \nforward to working under the leadership of Chairman Akaka and the other \ncolleagues on our Committee and in the Senate to make sure that \nmeaningful and substantial veterans' legislation is passed this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1326\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to create and extend certain temporary district court \njudgeships; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am introducing bipartisan \nlegislation to address the needs of the Federal Judiciary, our coequal \nbranch of Government. This bill would respond to a discrete situation \nin five States regarding the need for temporary judgeships. In order to \nadequately address fluctuations in a court's caseload, Congress can \nauthorize a judgeship on a temporary basis. These temporary fixes do \nnot undermine the independence that comes with lifetime appointment to \nthe judiciary because the judges assigned to fill these vacancies, are, \nin fact, appointed for life, as are all Federal judges. They are \ntemporary in the sense that when these judgeships expire, the next \nvacancy in the jurisdiction is not filled and the extra judgeship \nexpires.\n  Last Congress two of these needed temporary judgeships were allowed \nto expire. One was in Nebraska and the other in California. That was \nunfortunate in my view since they continue to have high caseloads. This \nlegislation would restore those judgeships by reauthorizing those \ntemporary judgeships to restore the status quo in those two busy \ndistricts.\n  In addition, three districts have temporary judgeships that are close \nto expiration. Caseloads in Ohio, Hawaii, and Kansas remain at a high \nlevel. I\n\n[[Page S5726]]\n\nsupport acting to ensure their continuation until we have had the \nopportunity to conduct a comprehensive review of the judgeship needs \nthroughout the Federal system. I hope to undertake that review next \nyear.\n  This legislation would extend each of the five temporary judgeships \nfor 10 years. This will allow Congress some flexibility with regard to \nfuture judgeship needs.\n  This measure is supported by the Judicial Conference of the United \nStates and every Senator representing the five States. I thank Senators \nFeinstein and Brownback, who also serve on the Judiciary Committee, for \ntheir work on this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1327\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TEMPORARY JUDGESHIPS FOR DISTRICT COURTS.\n\n       (a) Additional Temporary Judgeships.--\n       (1) In general.--The President shall appoint, by and with \n     the advice and consent of the Senate--\n       (A) 1 additional district judge for the eastern district of \n     California; and\n       (B) 1 additional district judge for the district of \n     Nebraska.\n       (2) Vacancies not filled.--The first vacancy in the office \n     of district judge in each of the offices of district judge \n     authorized by this subsection, occurring 10 years or more \n     after the confirmation date of the judge named to fill the \n     temporary district judgeship created in the applicable \n     district by this subsection, shall not be filled.\n       (b) Extension of Certain Temporary Judgeships.--Section \n     203(c) of the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990 (Public Law \n     101-650; 28 U.S.C. 133 note) is amended--\n       (1) in the second sentence, by inserting ``the district of \n     Hawaii,'' after ``Pennsylvania,'';\n       (2) in the third sentence (relating to the district of \n     Kansas), by striking ``16 years'' and inserting ``26 years'';\n       (3) in the fifth sentence (relating to the northern \n     district of Ohio), by striking ``15 years'' and inserting \n     ``25 years''; and\n       (4) by inserting ``The first vacancy in the office of \n     district judge in the district of Hawaii occurring 20 years \n     or more after the confirmation date of the judge named to \n     fill the temporary judgeship created under this subsection \n     shall not be filled.'' after the sixth sentence.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of \nChairman Leahy's bill, S. 1327, which will reestablish temporary \njudgeships where needed in the district courts and extend other \ntemporary judgeships that are about to expire. The bill will \nreestablish a 10-year temporary judgeship in the Eastern District of \nCalifornia, where it is sorely needed.\n  The Eastern District has had a temporary judgeship before, but it \nexpired in the fall of 2004. Even before the temporary judgeship \nexpired, the caseload in the district was already the second highest in \nthe Nation: 787 filings per judge, which was almost 50 percent more \nthan the national average.\n  Since that time, the situation in the Eastern District has grown even \nmore dire. Average caseloads across the Nation have declined, but in \nthe Eastern District they have increased by 18 percent.\n  The Eastern District of California now has the highest caseload in \nthe country: 927 filings per judge. That is twice as many cases as the \nnational average.\n  It is no exaggeration to say that the judges of the Eastern District \nare in desperate need of relief. They have continued to serve with \ndistinction in the face of the crushing caseloads. Mr. President, two \nof the court's senior judges still carry full caseloads after taking \nsenior status. Two other senior judges are also continuing to hear \ncases in the district. There is another reason why it is imperative for \nthe Senate to act now and adopt this bill. In just a few months, there \nwill be a vacancy in the Eastern District when Chief Judge David Levi \nleaves the bench after 17 years of distinguished service.\n  It is my hope that Chief Judge Levi's seat can be filled as quickly \nas possible with a well qualified nominee. But, as a practical matter, \nit is unlikely that the confirmation process for a new judge will be \ncomplete when Chief Judge Levi leaves office.\n  This will leave the Eastern District with still fewer judges to \nhandle its highest-in-the-Nation caseload. The district will need even \nmore help to ensure that cases continue to be handled with the care, \nattention, and promptness that are essential to the fair administration \nof justice.\n  I view this bill as an important first step toward getting California \nall of the judges it needs. According to the 2007 recommendations of \nthe Judicial Conference, California needs a total of 12 new judges, \nmore judges than are needed in any other State in the Nation. Four of \nthose judges are needed in the Eastern District alone. By adding a \ntemporary judgeship in the district, this bill will help fill the gap \nuntil the Senate acts to carry out the Judicial Conference's \nrecommendations.\n  I thank Chairman Leahy for taking this important first step toward \nensuring that the Federal courts in California have all the judges they \nneed.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to support this bill \naddressing the need to extend a number of our temporary judgeships.\n  My colleagues and I share a common interest in ensuring that the \nAmerican public is provided with the most efficient court system \npossible. However, across the nation many of our judicial resources are \nstrained due to our growing population and an increase in the number of \ncaseloads per judge. Hawaii is no exception, and this bill addresses \nour need to maintain our current number of judgeships. This bill offers \na much needed relief to our over-worked courts.\n  Thank you for allowing me this opportunity to share with you my \nthoughts as to the importance of this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S. 1328. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \neliminate discrimination in the immigration laws by permitting \npermanent partners of United States citizens and lawful permanent \nresidents to obtain lawful permanent resident status in the same manner \nas spouses of citizens and lawful permanent residents and to penalize \nimmigration fraud in connection with permanent partnerships; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to reintroduce the \nUniting American Families Act. This legislation would allow U.S. \ncitizens and legal permanent residents to petition for their foreign \nsame-sex partners under our family-based immigration system. I hope \nthat the Senate will demonstrate our Nation's commitment to equality \nunder the law by passing this measure.\n  I am pleased to act today in concert with Congressman Nadler, who is \nintroducing this same measure in the House of Representatives. \nCongressman Nadler has been a steady advocate for these changes, and I \ncommend his efforts to promote fundamental fairness for Americans whose \nloved ones are foreign citizens.\n  Under current law, foreign same-sex partners of Americans are unable \nto benefit from the family-based immigration system, which accounts for \nthe majority of green cards awarded annually. As a result, gay \nAmericans in this situation face the difficult choice of living apart \nfrom their partner, or leaving the U.S. to reside together.\n  This bill provides parity while also retaining strong prohibitions \nagainst fraud. To qualify as a permanent partner, potential \nbeneficiaries must be at least 18 years old and in an exclusive, \ncommitted relationship with an adult U.S. citizen or legal permanent \nresident, where both parties intend a lifelong union. The couple must \nprove that their union is not cognizable as a marriage under the \nImmigration and Nationality Act. Penalties for fraud would be the same \nas in any other marriage-based case: up to 5 years in prison and \n$250,000 in fines for the petitioner, and possible deportation for the \nalien partner.\n  Like many people across the country, Vermonters involved in permanent \npartnerships with foreign nationals often feel abandoned by immigration \nlaws and restrictions. This bill would allow them, and other gay and \nlesbian Americans, to become more fully integrated into our society. \nPromoting family unity has long been a critical aim of Federal \nimmigration policy, and we should honor that purpose by providing all \nAmericans regardless of their sexual orientation the opportunity to be \nwith their loved ones.\n\n[[Page S5727]]\n\n  The idea that immigration benefits should extend to same-sex couples \nis not new. Many nations recognize that their respective immigration \nlaws should respect family unity, regardless of sexual orientation. \nIndeed, 16 of our closest allies--Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, \nDenmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Israel, the Netherlands, \nNew Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Sweden and the United Kingdom all \nacknowledge same-sex couples for immigration purposes.\n  Our immigration laws treat gays and lesbians in committed \nrelationships as second-class citizens. This injustice should be \naddressed not only on behalf of those individuals but also to promote \nmore broadly a fair and consistent policy for America. I hope that the \nSenate will act to demonstrate our Nation's commitment to equality \nunder the law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1328\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to extend the Acadia National Park Advisory \nCommission, to provide improved visitor services at the park, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I don't know if the Presiding Officer has \never visited Acadia National Park along the coast of Maine. It is an \nextraordinary place, a place of special beauty. I rise today to \nintroduce the Acadia National Park Improvement Act Of 2007, with the \nsenior Senator from Maine, Ms. Snowe, as my cosponsor.\n  This legislation would take important steps to ensure the long-term \nhealth of one of America's most beloved national parks. It would \nincrease the land acquisition ceiling at Acadia by $10 million, \nfacilitate an off-site intermodal transportation center for the Island \nExplorer bus system, and extend the Acadia National Park Advisory \nCommission.\n  In drafting this legislation, I have worked very closely with park \nofficials and also with Friends of Acadia, a nonprofit community \norganization that works hard to support the park.\n  A little background might be helpful. In 1986, Congress enacted \nlegislation designating the boundary of Acadia National Park. Many \nprivate lands were, however, contained within the permanent authorized \nboundary. Congress authorized the park to spend a little over $9 \nmillion to acquire those lands from willing sellers.\n  While all of that money has now been spent, rising land prices have \nprevented the money from going as far as Congress originally intended. \nThere are now more than 100 private tracts left within the official \npark boundary. Nearly 20 of these tracts are currently available from \nwilling sellers, but the park simply no longer has the funds to \npurchase them. Our legislation would authorize an additional $10 \nmillion to help acquire these lands. I wish to emphasize that the lands \nalready fall within the authorized boundary of the park, so we are not \ntalking about enlarging the boundary of the park but, rather, filling \nin the holes at Acadia.\n  Our legislation would also facilitate the development of an \nintermodal transportation center as part of the Island Explorer bus \nsystem. The Island Explorer has been extremely successful over its \nfirst 7 years. These low-emission, propane-powered vehicles have \ncarried more than 1.5 million riders since 1999. In doing so, they have \nremoved hundreds of thousands of vehicles from the park and \nsignificantly reduced pollution. Unfortunately, the system lacks a \ncentral parking and bus boarding area. As a result, day-use visitors do \nnot have ready access to the Island Explorer.\n  My legislation would further facilitate the Department of Interior's \nassistance in planning, construction, and operation of an intermodal \ntransportation center in Trenton, ME. Mr. President, $7 million for \nthis center was included in the 2005 highway bill at the request of \nSenator Snowe and myself. This will include parking for day uses of the \npark center, a visitor orientation facility highlighting park and \nregional points of interest, a bus boarding area, and a bus maintenance \ngarage. This center, which will be built in partnership with the \nFederal Highway Administration, the U.S. Department of Transportation, \nthe Maine Department of Transportation, and other partners, will reduce \ntraffic congestion, preserve park resources, enhance the visitor \nexperience, and ensure a vibrant tourist economy.\n  Finally, our legislation would extend the 16-member Acadia National \nPark Advisory Commission for an additional 20-year period. This \nCommission was created by the Congress back in 1986, and, regrettably, \nit expired last year. The Commission consists of three Federal \nrepresentatives, three State representatives, four representatives from \nlocal towns, three from the adjacent mainland communities, and three \nfrom the adjacent offshore islands. These representatives serving on \nthis Commission have provided invaluable advice related to the \nmanagement and the development of the park. The superintendent has \nfound it to be very valuable. The Commission has proven its worth many \ntimes over, and it deserves to be extended for an additional 20 years. \nIn fact, it probably should just be made permanent.\n  Acadia National Park is a true gem of the Maine coastline. The park \nis one of Maine's most popular tourist destinations, with more than 2 \nmillion visitors each year. While unsurpassed in beauty, the park's \necosystem is very fragile. Unless we are careful, we risk substantial \nharm to the very place that Mainers and, indeed, all Americans hold so \ndear. In 9 years, Acadia will be 100 years old. Age has brought both \nincreasing popularity and greater pressures on this national treasure. \nBy providing an additional $10 million to protect sensitive lands \nalready within the boundary of the park, by expanding the highly \nsuccessful Island Explorer transportation system, and by extending the \nAcadia National Park Advisory Commission, this legislation will help to \nmake the park stronger and healthier than ever on the occasion of its \ncentennial anniversary.\n  I yield the floor.\n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Levin, Mr. \n        Menendez, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Boxer, \n        Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 1331. A bill to regulate .50 BMG caliber sniper rifles; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators \nKennedy, Levin, Menendez, Mikulski, Clinton, Durbin, Boxer and \nLautenberg in introducing the Long-Range Sniper Rifle Safety Act of \n2007, which would regulate a single type of firearm, 50 BMG caliber \nsniper rifles.\n  Mr. President, 50 BMG caliber sniper rifles are among the most \ndangerous firearms in the world. These sniper rifles are capable of \nbringing down airplanes and helicopters that are taking off or landing, \nand they can pierce light armored personnel vehicles. They have \nextraordinary range, up to a mile with accuracy, with a maximum \ndistance of up to 4 miles. Under President Clinton, the State \nDepartment suspended all export of these weapons for civilian use in \nforeign countries. The Bush administration initially changed this rule \nto allow such sales, but after 9/11 it decided to reinstate this ban.\n  Yet here in the United States, our laws continue to classify these \nweapons as ``long guns'', subject to the least government regulation of \nany firearms. Current Federal law makes no distinction between a .22 \ncaliber target rifle, a .30-06 caliber hunting weapon, and this large-\ncaliber .50 BMG combat weapon. In some States, youngsters who are 14 \nyears old can get .50 BMG caliber sniper rifles, with no limitation on \nsecond-\n\n[[Page S5730]]\n\nhand sales. In fact, anyone who can own a rifle can buy a .50 BMG \ncaliber sniper rifle. No permits. No licenses. No wait.\n  That is why I am introducing this legislation today, just as I have \nintroduced similar legislation in the last 3 sessions of Congress. The \nbill would:\n  Add these uniquely powerful sniper rifles to the list of firearms \nclassified as ``destructive devices'', which would mean they must be \nregistered when purchased or sold;\n  require the same registration for any ``copycat'' sniper rifles that \nmight be developed in the future with destructive power that is \nequivalent to the .50 BMG caliber sniper rifle; and\n  allow people who already possess .50 BMG caliber sniper weapons up to \n7 years to register their existing firearms, by implementing a \nregistration process similar to what was used when ``street sweeper'' \nand other firearms were reclassified as ``destructive devices'' in \n1994.\n  This bill would not ban any firearms, including .50 BMG caliber \nsniper rifles. Instead, it would change the law by treating .50 BMG \ncaliber sniper rifles in the same way we now treat ``street sweeper'' \nshotguns, silencers, and any rifle with a dimension larger than .50 \ncaliber. It would regulate these weapons, making it harder for \nterrorists and others to buy these combat weapons for illegitimate use.\n  This is not your classic hunting rifle. These weapons weigh up to 28 \npounds, and have a price tag of between $2,200 and $6,750. And they \nfire the most powerful commonly available cartridges, the massive BMG, \nBrowning Machine Gun, bullet, which has a diameter of \\1/2\\ inch and a \nlength of 3-6 inches.\n  These rounds are almost as big as my hand. The Congressional Research \nService says that a .50 BMG caliber cartridge weighs four and a half \ntimes more, and has five times more propellant, than the cartridges \nused in similar midsize rifles, like the .308 Winchester.\n  This is a weapon designed to kill people efficiently, and destroy \nmachinery, at a great distance. And the distances are frankly \nastonishing. In fact, this weapon was able to kill a person from a \ngreater distance than any other sniper rifle with a world-record \nconfirmed distance of 2,430 meters, a mile and a half away.\n  These weapons are ``accurate'' up to 2,000 yards, a distance that \nmeans it will strike a standard target within this range more than a \nmile away. To illustrate what this means, a shooter standing on \nAlcatraz Island off of San Francisco could sight and kill a person at \nPier 39.\n  And the gun has a maximum range of up to 7,500 yards, meaning that \nwhile accuracy cannot be guaranteed, the round can strike a target at \nthis distance. Imagine 75 football fields lined up end to end, a \ndistance of over 4 miles. This means a shooter at the Sausalito marina \ncould send bullets crashing into the San Francisco marina.\n  In short, these are military combat-style weapons. The .50 BMG \ncartridge has been used by our forces in machine guns since World War \nI, and our military has utilized .50 BMG caliber sniper rifles in the \ngulf war, and now in Afghanistan and Iraq. They can shoot through \nalmost anything, a bunker, bulletproof glass, a 3\\1/2\\ inch thick \nmanhole cover, a 600-pound safe.\n  But as the GAO noted in 1999, many of these guns also wind up in the \nhands of domestic and international terrorists, religious cults, \ninternational and domestic drug traffickers, and violent criminals.\n  In 1998, Federal law enforcement apprehended three men belonging to a \nradical Michigan militia group. The three were charged with plotting to \nbomb Federal office buildings, destroy highways and utilities. They \nwere also charged with plotting to assassinate a Governor, and other \nhigh-ranking political and judicial officers. A .50-caliber sniper \nrifle was found in their possession along with a cache of weapons that \nincluded three illegal machine guns.\n  One doomsday cult headquartered in Montana purchased 10 of these guns \nand stockpiled them in an underground bunker, along with thousands of \nrounds of ammunition and other guns.\n  At least one .50-caliber gun was recovered by Mexican authorities \nafter a shoot-out with an international drug cartel in that country. \nThe gun was originally purchased in Wyoming.\n  Since the GAO report, it was also revealed in a federal trial in \nManhattan that al-Qaida received .50-caliber sniper rifles, rifles \nmanufactured right here in the United States. Essam al Ridi, an al-\nQaida associate, testified that he acquired 25 Barrett .50-caliber \nsniper rifles and shipped them to al-Qaida members in Afghanistan.\n  What sort of damage could these weapons do in the wrong hands? The \nU.S. Air Force conducted a study, and determined that planes parked on \na fully protected U.S. airbase would be as vulnerable as ``ducks on a \npond'' against a sniper with a .50-caliber weapon, because the weapons \ncan shoot from beyond most airbase perimeters.\n  The RAND Corporation confirmed this, releasing a report which \nidentified 11 potential terrorist scenarios at Los Angeles \nInternational Airport. In one scenario, ``a sniper, using a .50 caliber \nrifle, fires at parked and taxiing aircraft.'' The report concludes: \n``we were unable to identify any truly satisfactory solutions'' for \nsuch an attack.\n  One need not even search for reports, the weapon's manufacturers \nadmit it. One Barrett .50 caliber brochure says:\n\n       [A] round of ammunition purchased for less than ten U.S. \n     dollars can be used to destroy or disable a modern jet \n     aircraft. The compressor sections of jet engines or the \n     transmissions of helicopters are likely targets for the \n     weapon, making it capable of destroying multimillion dollar \n     aircraft with a single hit delivered to a vital area.\n\n  And it is not just aircraft. A terrorist using this rifle could punch \nholes in pressurized chemical tanks, igniting combustible materials or \nleaking hazardous gases. Or penetrate armored vehicles used by law \nenforcement, or protective limousines, like those used here in \nWashington.\n  No wonder a broad coalition of law enforcement officers and groups, \ndetailing the threat that these weapons pose to our first responders, \nsaid:\n\n       The fact that these weapons have a range of more than four \n     miles and can take down commercial airliners is reason enough \n     to keep these weapons off our streets. It is of special \n     concern to the law enforcement community that these weapons \n     of war are capable of penetrating our special operations \n     vehicles, tactical equipment and helicopters.\n\n  This gun is so powerful that one dealer told undercover Government \nAccountability Office investigators:\n\n       You'd better buy one soon. It's only a matter of time \n     before someone lets go a round on a range that travels so \n     far, it hits a school bus full of kids. The government will \n     definitely ban .50-calibers. This gun is just too powerful.\n\n  In fact, many ranges used for target practice do not even have enough \nsafety features to accommodate these guns.\n  Special ammunition for these guns is also readily available in stores \nand on the Internet. This is perfectly legal. Moreover, ``armor-\npiercing incendiary'' ammunition, which explodes on impact, can be \npurchased online, as demonstrated in a ``60 Minutes'' news report. \nSeveral ammunition dealers were willing to sell armor-piercing \nammunition to an undercover GAO investigator, even after the \ninvestigator said he wanted the ammunition to pierce an armored \nlimousine or maybe to shoot down a helicopter.\n  The bottom line is that the .50 BMG caliber sniper rifle is a \nnational security threat requiring action by Congress. It makes no \nsense for us to spend billions of dollars on homeland security while we \nallow terrorists and criminals to get weapons that can serve as tools \nfor terrorism.\n  The legislation that I am introducing has been carefully tailored, \nand refines my earlier bills. In fact, it is narrower than my earlier \nbills, in that it regulates only .50 ``BMG'' caliber sniper rifles, not \nall .50 caliber rifles.\n  There is no doubt that the .50 BMG caliber is the most powerful \ncommonly available cartridge not considered a destructive device under \nthe National Firearms Act. It is in a class by itself. And that's why \nthis bill puts .50 BMG caliber sniper rifles into the class of firearms \ncalled destructive devices. Because that is where they belong.\n  Congress would not be alone in treating the .50 BMG caliber sniper \nrifle as the unique weapon of destruction that it is. My home State of \nCalifornia has regulated .50 BMG caliber sniper rifles since 2004, in a \nlaw signed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The bill I introduce \nwould adopt a similar registration system nationwide.\n\n[[Page S5731]]\n\n  In fact, Congress itself has previously recognized the unique \ndestructive properties of this weapon. Ever since 2000, our DOD \nAppropriations bills have contained a special restriction on the \nDepartment of Defense's ability to sell surplus armor-piercing \nammunition for .50 caliber weapons to civilians through its \ndemilitarization program.\n  This is a weapon that should not be openly available to terrorists \nand criminals, but should be responsibly controlled through carefully \ncrafted regulation. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1331\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to revise and \nextend projects relating to children and violence to provide access to \nschool-based comprehensive mental health programs; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's a privilege to join my colleagues \nSenator Dodd, Senator Domenici and Senator Ensign in introducing the \nMental Health in Schools Act of 2007 to assist the Nation's public \nschools in providing better access to mental health services for their \nstudents.\n  The need for these services has never been greater. The tragic events \nat Columbine, Nickel Mines, and Virginia Tech underscore the fact that \nwhen left untreated, childhood mental disorders can lead to academic \nfailure, family conflicts, substance abuse, violence, and suicide.\n  Comprehensive school mental health program should be designed for all \nstudents. They should obviously include both identification and \nreferral of specific individuals for treatment, but they should also \ninclude programs and services that promote positive mental health and \nprevent mental health problems for a broader population of students.\n  Strong mental health, similar to strong physical health, makes it \npossible for children to develop socially, emotionally, and \nintellectually. We know that mental illnesses often appear for the \nfirst time during childhood and adolescence. One in five children has a \ndiagnosable mental disorder, yet three-quarters of children and youth \nwho need mental health services do not receive them. With proper care \nand treatment, approximately 80 percent of people with mental illness \nexperience a significant reduction of symptoms and a better quality of \nlife.\n  Our schools are important settings for recognizing and addressing \nchildren's mental disorders. In fact schools often function as the de \nfacto mental health system for children and adolescents. Especially in \nrural areas, schools are likely to provide the only mental health \nservices available, for children.\n  Effective school mental health programs reflect the cooperation and \ncommitment of families, students, educators, and other community \npartners.\n  However, of the 95,000 public schools in the United States, only half \nreport having formal partnerships with community mental health \nproviders to deliver mental health services.\n  The services and support provided through these partnerships should \nbe family-centered and community-centered, and should also be \nculturally and linguistically appropriate.\n  The goal of the Mental Health in Schools Act is to assist local \ncommunities in developing comprehensive school mental health programs \nthat provide a continuum of services for students.\n  I urge the Senate to join us in supporting schools and communities in \nexpanding their mental health programs to make them more comprehensive, \nso that our school children across the nation can receive the proper \nsupport and services they need in order to thrive in our society and \nbecome productive citizens.\n  I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1332\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Mental Health in Schools Act \n     of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Approximately 1 in 5 children have a diagnosable mental \n     disorder.\n       (2) Approximately 1 in 10 children have a serious emotional \n     or behavioral disorder that is severe enough to cause \n     substantial impairment in functioning at home, at school, or \n     in the community. It is estimated that about 75 percent of \n     children with emotional and behavioral disorders do not \n     receive specialty mental health services.\n       (3) Only half of schools across the United States report \n     having formal partnerships with community mental health \n     providers to deliver mental health services.\n       (4) If a school is going to respond to the mental health \n     needs of its students, it must have access to resources that \n     provide family-centered, culturally and linguistically \n     appropriate supports and services.\n       (5) Effective school mental health programs reflect the \n     collaboration and commitment of families, students, \n     educators, and other community partners.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       It is the purpose of this Act to--\n       (1) revise, increase funding for, and expand the scope of \n     the Safe Schools-Healthy Students program in order to provide \n     access to more comprehensive school-based mental health \n     services and supports; and\n       (2) provide for in-service training to all school personnel \n     in--\n       (A) the techniques and supports needed to identify early \n     children with, or at risk of, mental illness;\n       (B) the use of referral mechanisms that effectively link \n     such children to treatment intervention services; and\n       (C) strategies that promote a school-wide positive \n     environment.\n\n     SEC. 4. AMENDMENTS TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT.\n\n       (a) Technical Amendments.--The second part G (relating to \n     services provided through religious organizations) of title V \n     of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 290kk et seq.) is \n     amended--\n\n[[Page S5732]]\n\n       (1) by redesignating such part as part J; and\n       (2) by redesignating sections 581 through 584 as sections \n     596 through 596C, respectively.\n       (b) Purpose and Authority.--Subsection (a) of section 581 \n     of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 290hh(a)) is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(a) In General.--The Secretary, in collaboration with the \n     Secretary of Education and in consultation with the Attorney \n     General, shall, directly or through grants, contracts or \n     cooperative agreements awarded to public entities and local \n     education agencies, assist local communities and schools in \n     applying a public health approach to mental health services \n     both in schools and in the community. Such approach should \n     provide comprehensive services and supports, be \n     linguistically and culturally appropriate, and incorporate \n     strategies of positive behavioral interventions and supports. \n     A comprehensive school mental health program funded under \n     this section shall assist children in dealing with \n     violence.''.\n       (c) Activities.--Section 581(b) of the Public Health \n     Service Act (42 U.S.C. 290hh(b)) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``implement programs'' \n     and inserting ``implement a comprehensive culturally and \n     linguistically appropriate school mental health program that \n     incorporates positive behavioral interventions and \n     supports'';\n       (2) in paragraph (3), by inserting ``child and adolescent \n     mental health issues and'' after ``address'';

SCHOOL-BASED MENTAL HEALTH AND CHILDREN AND \n                   VIOLENCE.''.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senator \nKennedy and Senator Dodd to introduce the Mental Health in Schools Act \nof 2007. This bill amends the Safe Schools Healthy Students Act to \nreauthorize projects relating to children and violence and also expands \nthe program to help provide access to school-based mental health \nprograms.\n  The mental health of our children is as important as their overall \nphysical health. As a Nation, we have repeatedly seen tragic stories \nrelated to children whose mental health needs were not met. Recent \nstudies indicate approximately 1 in 5 children have a diagnosable \nmental disorder and one in ten children have a serious emotional or \nbehavioral disorder that is severe enough to cause substantial \nimpairment in functioning at home, at school, or in the community.\n  The Mental Health in Schools Act of 2007 provides funding to local \neducation agencies, LEAs, in partnership with their communities to \ndevelop and implement mental health service programs in schools. The \nfunding will also be used to provide for in-service training to all \nschool personnel in the techniques and supports related to mental \nhealth. It is our belief that these programs have the potential to not \nonly improve access to care for mental health disorders but also to \nhelp increase academic competency and improved family functioning.\n  Investing in effective mental health treatment can mean the \ndifference between a child's success and failure in school and in \nsociety. The most effective mental health care must be tailored to the \nchild's and family's needs, and must be accessible and available when \nand where they need it. Children and their families' needs often cross \nmultiple systems. Communities need sustainable tools to link or \nintegrate those systems to meet those needs.\n  We must recognize that children do not have to remain neglected when \nit comes to their mental health. The future of children's mental health \ncare is very promising. Programs promoting mental health work, and when \nthey do, the resilience of a child can grow while diminishing the \nchallenging behaviors associated with mental health problems and \nemotional disturbances. It is important to recognize that as a Nation \nand as a society, we have come a long way in understanding mental \nillness and its impact on children and adolescents. Research has made \nextraordinary leaps forward, giving us a better understanding of the \ndisorders and the evidence-based treatments, services and supports that \nbuild resilience and facilitate recovery for children and adolescents.\n  We have seen over and over again that not offering effective mental \nhealth care has many ramifications, not the least of which is violence, \nsubstance abuse and poor academic performance. Much more is required of \nus as a Nation to secure the whole health and well-being of our future, \nour children and youth. Now is the time to begin a national debate on \nmental health care and its importance to our children. I think the bill \nwe are introducing here is a great start and I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to pass this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 1333. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nstrengthen the earned income tax credit; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Strengthen the \nEarned Income Tax Credit Act of 2007. Congressman Pascrell is \nintroducing the companion measure in the House. Since 1975, the EITC \nhas been an innovative tax credit which helps low-income working \nfamilies. President Reagan referred to the EITC as ``the best \nantipoverty, the best pro-family, the best job creation measure to come \nout of Congress.'' According to the Center on Budget and Policy \nPriorities, the EITC lifts more children out of poverty than any other \ngovernment program.\n  It is time for us to reexamine the EITC and determine where we can \nstrengthen it. It should not have taken Hurricane Katrina to show what \nCensus data has proven--- some Americans are not benefiting from our \neconomic recovery. The poverty rate for 2005 was 12.6 percent, \nbasically the same as the rate for 2004. In 2005, there were 37 million \nmen, women and children living in poverty. One-quarter of all jobs in \nthe United States do not pay enough to support a family of four above \nthe poverty level.\n  Hurricane Katrina affected many individuals who were already faced \nwith difficult economic situations. Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama \nare the first, second, and eighth poorest States in the Nation \nrespectively. The income of the typical household in these three States \nis well below the national average. In the hardest hit counties, 18.6 \npercent of the population is poor, compared with a national average of \n12.5 percent.\n  Time after time, the Republican controlled Congress passed tax cuts \nwhich are skewed towards those with the most. In 2003, some of the 2001 \ncuts were phased-in at a faster rate and this did not include \nadjustments to the EITC. The Urban Institute, Brookings Institution's \nTax Policy Center, reports that households with incomes of more than $1 \nmillion a year, the richest three-tenths of the population, receive an \naverage tax cut of $118,000. These individuals do not have to worry \nabout how they will have to pay for a roof over their heads or enough \nfood for their families. We should not be focused on extending tax cuts \nwhich help those who do not have to worry about living pay check to pay \ncheck.\n  We need to help the low-income workers who struggle day after day \ntrying to make ends meet. They have been left behind in the economic \npolicies of the last 6 years. We need to begin a discussion on how to \nhelp those that have been left behind. The EITC is the perfect place to \nstart.\n  The Strengthen the Earned Income Tax Credit Act of 2007 strengthens \nthe EITC by making the following four changes: reducing the marriage \npenalty; increasing the credit for families with three or more \nchildren; expanding credit amount for individuals with no children; and \npermanently extending the provision which allows members of the armed \nforces to include combat pay as income for EITC computations. By making \nthese changes, more individuals and families would benefit from the \nEITC.\n  First, the legislation increases marriage penalty relief and makes it \npermanent. In the way that the EITC is currently structured, many \nsingle individuals that marry find themselves faced with a reduction in \ntheir EITC. The tax code should not penalize individuals who marry.\n  Second, the legislation increases the credit for families with three \nor more children. Under current law, the credit amount is based on one \nchild or two or more children. This legislation would create a new \ncredit amount based on three or more children. Under current law, the \nmaximum EITC for an individual with two or more children is $4,716 and \nunder this legislation, the amount would increase to $5,306 for an \nindividual with three or more children. The poverty level for an adult \nliving with three children is $20,516. In total, 37 percent of all \nchildren live in families with at least three children and more than \nhalf of poor children live in such families. Under current law, an \nadult living with three children who is eligible for the maximum EITC \nwith income equivalent to the phase-out income level would still have \nincome below the poverty level. Under this legislation, an individual \nwith three children and who is eligible for the full credit amount \nwould be lifted above the poverty level by the amount of the credit.\n\n[[Page S5734]]\n\n  Increasing the credit amount would make more families eligible for \nthe EITC. Currently, an individual with three children and income at \nand above $37,783 would not benefit from the credit. Under this \nlegislation, an individual with children and income under $40,582 would \nbenefit from the EITC.\n  Third, this legislation would increase the credit amount for \nchildless workers. The EITC was designed to help childless workers \noffset their payroll tax liability. The credit phase-in was set to \nequal the employee share of the payroll tax, 7.65 percent. However, in \nreality, the employee bears the burden of both the employee and \nemployer portion of the payroll tax.\n  Under current law, an individual without children and income just \nabove the poverty level would owe more than $800 in Federal income and \npayroll taxes in 2007, even with the EITC. This calculation is based on \njust the employee's share of the payroll tax. If you include the \nemployer's share this individual would owe more than $1,600 in taxes. \nThe decline in the labor force of single men has been troubling. \nBoosting the EITC for childless workers could be part of solution for \nincreasing work among this group. Increasing the EITC for families has \nincreased labor rates for single mothers and hopefully, it can do the \nsame for this group.\n  This legislation doubles the credit rate for individual taxpayer and \nmarried taxpayers without children. The credit rate and phase-out rate \nof 7.65 percent is doubled to 15.3 percent. For 2007, the maximum \ncredit amount for an individual would increase from $428 to $855. The \ndoubling of the phase-out results in taxpayers in the same income range \nbeing eligible for the credit.\n  Fourth, the Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004 included a \nprovision which would allow combat pay to be treated as earned income \nfor purposes of computing the child credit. This provision expires at \nthe end of the year. This legislation makes this provision permanent. \nThere is no reason why a member of the armed services should lose their \nEITC when they are mobilized and serving their country.\n  This legislation will help those who most need our help. It will put \nmore money in their pay check. We need to invest in our families and \nhelp individuals who want to make a living by working. We are all aware \nof our fiscal situation and we should legislate in a responsible \nmanner. It is a time for shared sacrifice. We cannot keep adding to the \ndeficit, but we cannot leave the poor behind.\n  I ask for unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1333\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend section 2306 of title 38, United States \nCode, to make permanent authority to furnish government headstones and \nmarkers for graves of veterans at private cemeteries, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will \nrestore the rights of veterans and their families to receive an \nofficial grave marker from the Department of Veterans' Affairs in \nacknowledgement of their service to this Nation. I am pleased to be \njoined by Senators Kerry, Voinovich, Conrad, Byrd, and Brown as \noriginal cosponsors. This legislation addresses a serious, and easily \nremedied, inequity that exists for veterans who passed away during the \nperiod between November 1, 1990, and September 11, 2001.\n  There is an inscription in Colleville-sur-Mer, France, at Omaha \nBeach, commemorating those Americans who perished in the World War II \nbattle there, that reads:\n\n       This embattled shore, this portal of freedom, is forever \n     hallowed by the ideas, the valor and sacrifice of our fellow \n     countrymen.\n       Their graves are the permanent and visible symbols of their \n     heroic devotion and their sacrifice in the common cause of \n     humanity.\n       These endured all and gave all that justice among nations \n     might prevail and that mankind might enjoy freedom and \n     inherit peace.\n\n  Monuments like this, or like the many spectacular memorials right \nhere in Washington, DC, serve as a reminder of the service, dedication, \nand sacrifice of our Nation's veterans. They are a tribute not to the \nsuffering and darkness of war, but to the tremendous courage of those \nwho served so that, as the inscription says, ``mankind might enjoy \nfreedom and inherit peace.'' And in a small way, the markers placed at \nveterans' gravesites serve as a similar reminder for the friends and \nfamily members who visit a loved one's grave.\n  Until 1990, the family of a deceased American veteran could receive \nreimbursement for a VA headstone, a VA marker, or a private headstone. \nHowever, I regret to say, in the name of cutting costs, measures were \ntaken to prevent the VA from providing markers to those families that \nhad purchased gravestones out of their own pockets.\n  In my view, this constitutes a serious injustice; one that we must \ncorrect. It is shocking to me that veterans who passed during those 11 \nyears are denied an official grave marker, and yet that is the effect \nof current law.\n  We owe it to these brave men and women to honor their service to this \ncountry. We have seen too many instances in which our veterans have not \nbeen accorded the respect they deserve. The accounts that have surfaced \nabout the deplorable conditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and \nthe consistent underfunding of the Veterans Health Administration shine \nan unpleasant spotlight on the ways in which we have fallen far short \nof our obligations to our Nation's veterans. And now, how can we deny \nveterans the simple honor of recognizing their service with a graveside \nmarker?\n  This body first endorsed a provision restoring the right of every \nveteran to receive a grave marker as early as June 7, 2000, as part of \nthe fiscal year 2001 Defense Authorization bill. This body approved \nthis language again on December 8, 2001. But it was not until December \n6, 2002, that legislation was\n\n[[Page S5735]]\n\nsigned into law as part of the Veterans Improvement Act, allowing VA \nmarkers to be provided to deceased veterans retroactively. \nUnfortunately, however, when the bill went to a conference with the \nHouse of Representatives, this benefit was inexplicably applied \nretroactively only to September 11, 2001, rather than to November 1, \n1990, the date at which the new VA regulation came into effect.\n  In my view, to arbitrarily deny veterans who passed away during that \n11-year period is unconscionable. Their service to our Nation was no \nless dedicated than the service of those who passed away before and \nafter that period. It is an insult to their memories and to the \nfamilies and friends who loved them.\n  This legislation is quite simple. It merely allows all veterans who \nhave passed away since 1990 to be provided with official VA grave \nmarkers and it repeals the expiration of the VA's authority to provide \nthese grave markers. The VA is supportive of this legislation, which I \nbelieve will ensure that all of our Nation's veterans are accorded the \nrespect they are due for their sacrifices. In a report submitted to \nCongress on February 10, 2006, the VA endorsed both provisions of this \nlegislation, recommending that the grave marker authority be made \npermanent and retroactive to 1990.\n  Moreover, this bill is inexpensive. The Congressional Budget Office \nestimated the cost of this bill to be just $1 million over 5 years and \n$2 million over 10 years. Who can argue that this is too high a price \nto pay to honor our fallen heroes?\n  We are approaching the 9th anniversary of the passing of Mr. Agostino \nGuzzo, a Connecticut resident who bravely served in the U.S. Armed \nForces in the Philippines during World War II. His family interred his \nbody in a mausoleum at the Cedar Hill Cemetery in Hartford, CT. The \nfamily was not aware of the VA's restrictions on grave markers at the \ntime, and was told by the VA that there was no way to receive official \nrecognition.\n  Agostino's son, Mr. Thomas Guzzo, brought the matter to my attention, \nand we were able to pass legislation granting Agostino the memorial he \ndeserves. But too many families are still denied such markers. This \nlegislation honors the memory of Agostino Guzzo and all of the veterans \nwho have served their country in war and in peace. Thomas Guzzo's \ncommitment to this issue has not ended. The commitment of this Congress \nshould continue, as well.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1334\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. MODIFICATION OF AUTHORITIES ON PROVISION OF \n                   GOVERNMENT HEADSTONES AND MARKERS FOR BURIALS \n                   OF VETERANS AT PRIVATE CEMETERIES.\n\n       (a) Repeal of Expiration of Authority.--Subsection (d) of \n     section 2306 of title 38, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by striking paragraph (3); and\n       (2) by redesignating paragraph (4) as paragraph (3).\n       (b) Retroactive Effective Date.--Notwithstanding subsection \n     (d) of section 502 of the Veterans Education and Benefits \n     Expansion Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-103; 115 Stat. 995; 38 \n     U.S.C. 2306 note), the amendments made to section 2306(d) of \n     title 38, United States Code, by such section 502 and the \n     amendments made by section 402 of the Veterans Benefits, \n     Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006 (Public \n     Law 109-461), other than the amendment made by subsection (e) \n     of such section 402, shall take effect as of November 1, \n     1990, and shall apply with respect to the graves of \n     individuals dying on or after that date.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE (for himself and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 1335. A bill to amend title 4, United States Code, for declare \nEnglish as the official language of the Government of the United \nStates, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, last year I said that this Nation of \nimmigrants requires an official language. An overwhelming majority of \nthe Senate agreed with me on my amendment to that effect on the \nimmigration bill. I am convinced that official English will command \nanother majority should it receive a rollcall vote in this session. \nThat is why today I am introducing S. 1335 to make English the official \nlanguage of our Nation.\n  The English language has played a critical role in establishing the \nunity of this Nation from its beginning. As I have said before, a \ncommon means of communication has created one giant market for goods \nand labor in our Nation, from Maine to California. A resident of Tulsa \ncan seek work in New Hampshire, Oregon, or Georgia without having to \nlearn a second language. A company based in Oklahoma City can readily \nsell its products from Portland, ME, to Los Angeles.\n  In Europe, by contrast, a resident of Berlin cannot look for work in \nParis or Warsaw without surmounting considerable language barriers. A \nGerman company cannot usually sell its product in Madrid, again, in \npart, because of language barriers. The European Union is an effort to \ncreate a U.S.-like common market in Western Europe. Among other things, \nEuropeans are spending billions of euros to try to replicate what we in \nAmerica have enjoyed for free these past 230 years.\n  Recognizing that English is necessary for successful business and a \ngrowing economy, the Santa Ana Chamber of Commerce recently announced \nthat it is spearheading a multimillion dollar campaign to help about \n50,000 of its residents to learn the language. I regret to report that \nwe have spent the last few decades giving away this priceless \nlinguistic unity.\n  Clinton Executive Order No. 13166 demands that all recipients of \nFederal funds function in any language anyone speaks at any time, \nburdening taxpayers with extraneous costs of an enabling policy while \nproviding incentives for immigrants to circumvent learning English and, \nregretfully, hurt their chances at effective assimilation.\n  My constituents agree that foreign language ballots deserve no place \nin an American election. My bill will eliminate these foreign language \nvoting materials and multilingual voting mandates imposed on Oklahoma \nand other States. Only citizens are allowed to vote in our Nation, and \none of the requirements to become a good citizen is to show an \nunderstanding of English. Money to provide foreign language ballots \nwould be better spent on such constructive activities as simply \nteaching people how to speak English.\n  Not only does my bill repeal foreign language ballots, it is aimed at \nthe entire forest of mandatory multilingualism. My legislation \nbasically recognizes the practical reality of the role of English as \nour official language and states explicitly that English is our \nofficial language and provides English a status in law it has not held \nbefore. Making English the official language will clarify that there is \nno entitlement to receive Federal documents and services in languages \nother than English and will end the practice of providing translation \nentitlements at taxpayer expense.\n  My bill declares that any rights of a person, as well as services or \nmaterials in languages other than English, must be authorized or \nprovided by law. It recognizes the decades of unbroken court opinions \nthat civil rights laws protecting against national origin and \ndiscrimination do not create rights to government service and materials \nin languages other than English. While my bill will end federally \nmandated and funded foreign language entitlement, it certainly still \nallows for Democratic and Republican activists to offer palm cards and \nsample ballots in any language they wish--from Cherokee to Chinese--on \nelection day and for individuals to bring along their own translaters \nto any Federal Government office.\n  It is important to note that my bill only affects the language spoken \nby the Government, not the language choices of people speaking among \nthemselves.\n  Official English is popular even among Hispanics. As I have cited \nbefore on the floor of the Senate, in 2006, a Zogby poll found 84 \npercent of Americans, including 71 percent of Hispanics,\n\n[[Page S5736]]\n\nbelieve that English should be the national language of government \noperations. According to a 2002 Kaiser Family Foundation survey, a poll \nof 91 percent of foreign-born Latino immigrants agreed that learning \nEnglish is essential to succeed in the United States.\n  Allow me to conclude by remembering the founder of the official \nEnglish movement, U.S. Senator S.I. Hayakawa. The son of Asian \nimmigrants, S.I. Hayakawa became a professor of English, a college \npresident, and, in 1976, a U.S. Senator. Senator Hayakawa became the \nleader of the official English effort in this Chamber when he \nintroduced an official English bill on April 27, 1981. Senator Hayakawa \nused to say ``bilingualism for the individual is fine but not for a \ncountry.'' While I never served with Senator Hayakawa, I would like to \nhonor his efforts and continue his important work by offering the S.I. \nHayakawa Official English Act of 2007, which is S. 1335.\n  Let me say, it seems so ridiculous that as we travel around the \nworld, there are some 51 countries that have English as their official \nlanguage, and yet the United States doesn't. I was recently in Ghana, \nWest Africa. They have English as their official language. We don't \nhave it in the United States.\n  Zambia, Uganda, and Zimbabwe have English as their official language \nbut not the United States. This is something that should be a no-\nbrainer. Of the 80-some percent of the people polled, up to 91 percent \nwant English as the official language, and yet, for some unknown \nreason, people seem to be catering to some maybe small, radical group \nthat doesn't want it. I think it is time for the majority of the \nAmerican people to realize this could very well be the reality.\n  Let me also say, when I had this amendment on the floor before, there \nwere all kinds of objections that came down that didn't have any \ncredibility at all. One of them that came down said: Well, you have all \nthese flags of the various States that have foreign languages; you \nwould have to do away with State flags. This has nothing to do with \nthat. One came down that said: You would no longer be able to use \nSpanish on the floor of the Senate. It has nothing to do with that. \nThey said: You would be drowning Hispanics. I said: Explain that to me. \nThey said: Well, we have ``no swimming'' signs in the Potomac where the \ncurrents are very strong, so people would go in there and they would \ndrown. This is how desperate people are to find something objectionable \nabout something that 90 percent of the people in America want.\n  So we are very serious about this. We are going to carry on the works \nof the good Senator from California and hopefully respond to 90 percent \nof Americans who want English as an official language.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Bayh):\n  S. 1336. A bill to provide for an assessment of the achievement by \nthe Government of Iraq of benchmarks for political settlement and \nnational reconciliation in Iraq; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to speak to the monumental and \nconsequential matter regarding the future course of the United States \nand our courageous men and women in uniform in Iraq.\n  Today, we are at a profoundly challenging moment in time, and at a \ncritical crossroads with respect to our direction in this war. That \nsense of urgency was compounded by my recent trip to Iraq this past \nweekend where I had the privilege of meeting with some of America's \nbravest and finest serving in Baghdad, including Mainers. I came away \nbelieving more firmly than ever that the Iraq Government must \nunderstand that our commitment is not infinite, and that Americans are \nlosing patience with the failure of the leadership to end the sectarian \nviolence and move toward national reconciliation.\n  My visit further underscored the fact that there is not a military \nsolution to the problem, and in the final analysis, the situation \nrequires demonstrable action by the Iraq Government on true political \nreform and reconciliation. My firsthand experience reinforced that \npolitical will and diplomatic initiatives must form the core of our \nsuccess, and that our goal must be to bring about reconciliation as \nsoon as possible so that all of America's soldiers including those from \nMaine can return home to their families and loved ones.\n  None of us arrive at this question lightly. In my 28-year tenure in \nCongress, I have witnessed and participated in debates on such vital \nmatters as Lebanon, Panama, the Persian Gulf, Somalia, Bosnia, and \nKosovo. And indisputably, myriad, deeply-held beliefs and arguments \nwere expressed on those pivotal matters, some in concert, some \ncomplementary, some in conflict. Yet, without question, all were rooted \nin mutual concern for, and love of, our great Nation. And there was, \nand should not be today, no question about our support for our brave \nand extraordinary troops.\n  It is therefore with the utmost respect for our troops that Senator \nEvan Bayh and I today introduce a bill which allows them the ability to \ncomplete the mission they have selflessly undertaken, while assuring \nthem that their valor shall not be unconditionally expended upon an \nIraqi Government which fails to respond in kind.\n  Before proceeding any further, let me pause to express my deep \nappreciation and immense gratitude to Senator Bayh for his tremendous \nleadership and indispensable contribution in forging this welcomed, \nbipartisan measure. If there ever were a time for us to fashion a way \nforward, together, it is surely now, and because of Senator Bayh and \nhis tireless efforts we have a measure that represents a significant \nstep in the right direction. I thank him and his staff for bringing \nthis fresh approach to fruition today.\n\n  The Snowe-Bayh Iraq bill requires that government to actually achieve \npreviously agreed political and security benchmarks while the Baghdad \nSecurity Plan, commonly referred to as the ``surge,'' is in effect, or \nface the redeployment of those U.S. troops dedicated to that plan.\n  Specifically, this legislation would require that, 120 days after \nenactment, a point in time at which our military commanders have stated \nthat they should know whether the surge will succeed, the commander of \nMulti-National Forces, Iraq would report to Congress as to whether the \nIraqi Government has met each of six political and security-related \nbenchmarks which it has already agreed to meet by that time. These six \nbenchmarks are: Iraqi assumption of control of its military; enactment \nand implementation of a militia law to disarm and demobilize militias \nand to ensure that such security forces are accountable only to the \ncentral government and loyal to the constitution of Iraq; completion of \nthe constitutional review and a referendum held on special amendments \nto the Iraqi Constitution that ensure equitable participation in the \nGovernment of Iraq without regard to religious sect or ethnicity; \ncompletion of a provincial election law and commencement and specific \npreparation for the conduct of provincial elections that ensures \nequitable constitution of provincial representative bodies without \nregard to religious sect or ethnicity; enactment and implementation of \nlegislation to ensure that the energy resources of Iraq benefit Sunni \nArabs, Shia Arabs, Kurds, and other Iraqi citizens in an equitable \nmanner; and enactment and implementation of legislation that equitably \nreforms the de-Ba'athification process in Iraq.\n  The Iraqi Government must know that any opportunity gained from our \nincreased troop levels in Baghdad is a window that we will soon close \nif it fails to take urgent action and show tangible results in tandem. \nIf, at the end of 120 days, the commander of Multi-National Forces, \nIraq reports the Iraqi Government has not met the benchmarks, then the \ncommander should plan for the phased redeployment of the troops we \nprovided for the Baghdad Security Plan, period.\n  That is why, under the Snowe-Bayh measure, after 120 days, should the \ncommander report that the Iraqi Government has failed to meet any of \nthe benchmarks listed, he will then be required to present a plan for \nthe phased redeployment of those combat troops sent to Iraq in support \nof the Baghdad Security Plan and to provide plans detailing the \ntransition of the mission of the U.S. forces remaining in Iraq to one \nof logistical support, training, force protection, and targeted \ncounterterrorism operations, for examples, those functions set forth in \nthe\n\n[[Page S5737]]\n\nIraq Study Group Report, with the objective of successfully \naccomplishing this change in mission within 6 months of the date of his \ntestimony before Congress. The commander must further indicate the \nnumber of troops needed to successfully complete the changed mission \nand the estimated duration of that mission. As General Petraeus stated \nin March.\n\n       I have an obligation to the young men and women in uniform \n     out here, that if I think it's not going to happen, to tell \n     them that it's not going to happen, and there needs to be a \n     change.\n\n  My colleagues may recall that I opposed the surge because I did not, \nand still do not, believe that additional troops are a substitute for \npolitical will and capacity. General Petraeus said last month that a \npolitical resolution is crucial because that is what will determine in \nthe long run the success of this effort. I could not agree more. The \nfact is, America and the world require more than Iraq's commitment to \naccomplishing the benchmarks that will lead to a true national \nreconciliation, we must see actual results. The Iraqi Government must \nfind the will to ensure that it represents and protects the rights of \nevery Iraqi.\n  After our 4-year commitment, Iraq's Government should not doubt that \nwe must observe more than incremental steps toward political \nreconciliation, we require demonstrable changes. While limited progress \nhas been mad on necessary legislative initiatives such as the \nHydrocarbon Law, it is in fact a sheaf of laws and not just a single \nmeasure that must pass to ensure that all Iraqis have a share and stake \nin their government. Chief among these are constitutional amendments \nwhich will permit Iraqis of all ethnicities and confessions to be \nrepresented at the local level of government. Yet, so far, the review \ncommittee has yet to even finish drafts of these critical amendments.\n  I believe we were all encouraged by the recent ambassadorial meetings \nin Baghdad and last week's ministerial conference called at the Iraqi \nGovernment's request. These diplomatic talks are vital to securing \nIraq's border, reversing the flow of refugees, and stemming the foreign \ninterference which exacerbates sectarian divisions. But we also look \nfor the Iraqi Government's leadership in dismantling the militias and \nstrengthening the National Army so that it is truly a national \ninstitution that can provide the security so desperately desired by all \nIraqis in every province.\n  We are now 3\\1/2\\ months into the surge, and our troops have made \ngains in reducing the still horrific levels of violence on Baghdad \nthrough their heroic efforts. Yet it is deeply concerning to me that, \nmirroring the slowness with which the Iraqi Government has moved on \npolitical reforms, their sacrifice remains by and largely unmatched by \ntheir Iraqi counterparts.\n  Last month, Leon Panetta, a member of the Iraq Study Group, wrote the \nfollowing in a New York Times Op-ED, ``. . . every military commander \nwe talked to felt that the absence of national reconciliation was the \nfundamental cause of violence in Iraq. As one American general told us, \n`if the Iraqi Government does not make political progress on reforms, \nall the troops in the world will not provide security.' He went on to \nenumerate the progress or, more to the point, the lack of progress \ntoward the agreed upon benchmarks and concluded that `unless the United \nStates finds new ways to bring strong pressure on the Iraqis, things \nare not likely to pick up any time soon.' ''\n\n  In fact, over the past few months, many have come to the realization \nthat political action by the Iraqi Government is a paramount precursor \nto national reconciliation and stability and, without it, the Baghdad \nSecurity Plan is only a temporary, tactical fix for one specific \nlocation. And while we are hearing about incremental successes, I agree \nwith Thomas Friedman who said recently in an interview, ``there's only \none metric for the surge working, and that is whether we're seeing a \nnegotiation among Iraqis to share power, to stabilize the political \nsituation in Iraq, which only they can do . . . telling me that the \nviolence is down 10 percent or 8 percent here or 12 percent there, I \ndon't really think that's the metric at all.''\n  To this day, the public looks to the United States Senate to temper \nthe passions of politics and to bridge divides. And if ever there were \na moment when Americans are imploring us to live up to the moniker of \n``world's greatest deliberative body,'' that moment is upon us.\n  If I had a son or daughter or other family member serving in Iraq, I \nwould want at least the assurance that someone was speaking up to tell \nthe Iraqi Government, and frankly our government as well, that at my \nfamily's sacrifice must be matched by action and sacrifice on the part \nof the Iraqi Government. I would want to know that the most profound of \nall issues was fully debated by those who are elected to provide \nleadership. For those of us who seek success in Iraq, and believe that \na strategy predicated on political and diplomatic solutions, not merely \nincreased troop levels, presents the strongest opportunity to reach \nthat goal, let us coalesce around this bill, which will allow us to \nspeak as one voice, strong, together, and united in service to a \npurpose we believe to be right.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Smith, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. \n        Domenici):\n  S. 1337. A bill to amend title XXI of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for equal coverage of mental health services under the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is my great hope that Congress will move \nthis year to see that the successful, bipartisan State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program is allowed the opportunity to fulfill its \npromise to the low-income children of this country. For 10 years it has \nprovided, along with Medicaid, the type of meaningful and affordable \nhealth insurance coverage that should be ensured to each and every \nAmerican. Yet there is much work to be done, and the reauthorization of \nS-CHIP gives us the opportunity to expand these successful programs to \nas many of the 9 million uninsured children in the country today, \nstarting with the 6 million that are already eligible for public \nprograms but not yet enrolled.\n  But we must keep in mind that while expanding coverage to the \nuninsured is our top priority, it is equally important to ensure that \nthe types of benefits offered to our Nation's children are quality \nservices that are there for them when they need them. When it comes to \nmental health coverage, that unfortunately is not the case today. \nTherefore, I am introducing today, along with Senators Smith, Kennedy, \nand Domenici, the Children's Mental Health Parity Act which provides \nfor equal coverage of mental health care for all children enrolled in \nthe State Children's Health Insurance Plan, SCHIP.\n  Mental illness is a critical problem for the young people in this \ncountry today. The numbers are startling: Mental disorders affect about \none in five American children and up to 9 percent of kids experience \nserious emotional disturbances that severely impact their functioning. \nAnd low-income children, those the S-CHIP program is designed to cover, \nhave the highest rates of mental health problems.\n  Yet the sad reality is that an estimated two-thirds of all young \npeople struggling with mental health disorders do not receive the care \nthey need. We are failing our children when it comes to the treatment \nof mental health disorders and the consequences could not be more \nsevere. Without early and effective intervention, affected children are \nless likely to do well in school and more likely to have compromised \nemployment and earnings opportunities. Moreover, untreated mental \nillness may also increase a child's risk of coming into contact with \nthe juvenile justice system, and children with mental disorders are at \na much higher risk for suicide.\n  Unfortunately, many States' S-CHIP programs are not providing the \ntype of mental health care coverage that our most vulnerable children \ndeserve. Many States impose discriminatory limits on mental health care \ncoverage that do not apply to medical and surgical care. These can \ninclude caps on coverage of inpatient days and outpatient visits, as \nwell as cost and testing restrictions that impair the ability of our \nphysicians to make the best judgments for our kids.\n\n[[Page S5738]]\n\n  The Children's Mental Health Parity Act would prohibit discriminatory \nlimits on mental health care in SCHIP plans by directing that any \nfinancial requirements or treatment limitations that apply to mental \nhealth or substance abuse services must be no more restrictive than the \nfinancial requirements or treatment limits that apply to other medical \nservices. Your bill would also eliminate a harmful provision in current \nlaw that authorizes States to lower the amount of mental health \ncoverage they provide to children in SCHIP down to 75 percent of the \ncoverage provided in the benchmark plans listed in the statute as \nmodels for States to use in developing their SCHIP plans.\n  The mental health community is gathered in Washington today to mark \nNational Children's Mental Health Awareness Day and many of the leading \nadvocacy groups have endorsed the Children's Mental Health Parity Act, \nincluding Mental Health America, the American Academy of Child & \nAdolescent Psychiatry, the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, Fight \nCrime: Invest in Kids, The National Association for Children's \nBehavioral Health, the National Association of Psychiatric Health \nSystems, and the National Council for Community Behavioral Health care.\n  America's kids who are covered through SCHIP should be guaranteed \nthat the mental health benefits they receive are just as comprehensive \nas those for medical and surgical care. It is no less important to care \nfor our kids' mental health, and this unfair and unwise disparity \nshould no longer be acceptable. As we debate many important features of \nthe S-CHIP program during reauthorization, I look forward to working \nwith Members on both sides of the aisle to see that this important, \nbipartisan measure receives the support that it deserves.\n  I ask for unanimous consent that the text of the bill bill and \nletters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1337\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Gordon H. Smith,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: On behalf of the National Council for \n     Community Behavioral Healthcare, I am writing to congratulate \n     you for the introduction of the Children's Mental Health \n     Parity Act, which will require a non-discriminatory mental \n     health benefit in the State Children's Health Insurance \n     (SCHIP) Program. The National Council strongly supports your \n     bill because it directly reflects the service needs of the 2 \n     million children with mental and emotional disorders that our \n     members serve every year.\n       The seminal document Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon \n     General estimates that approximately one in five children and \n     adolescents experience the signs and symptoms of mental \n     disorders during the course of a year. Furthermore, \n     widespread conditions such as major clinical depression and \n     anxiety disorders are particularly prevalent in low-income \n     populations of children who are more likely to be enrolled in \n     the SCHIP Program. In many instances, these conditions \n     manifest themselves as physical complaints greatly \n     complicating the clinical management of both medical/surgical \n     conditions as well as mental disorders.\n       With many states limiting outpatient mental health benefits \n     to 20 visits and inpatient hospital services to 30 days or \n     less, youngsters with more serious mental illnesses will not \n     receive the mental health care they need. Indeed, these \n     arbitrary limits make neither clinical nor fiscal sense. When \n     children reach their SCHIP mental health policy limits, \n     National Council members are often charged with qualifying \n     these same kids for Medicaid coverage. During the Medicaid \n     eligibility determination process, their clinical condition \n     may deteriorate leading to expensive placements in \n     psychiatric hospitals or residential treatment facilities.\n       The Children's Mental Health Parity Act ends this \n     discriminatory treatment once and for all, while providing \n     additional mental health benefits for the kids who need them \n     most. Please count on the National Council to fight for this \n     important bill throughout the SCHIP reauthorization process.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Linda Rosenberg,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Mental Health America,\n\n                                Alexandria, Virginia, May 7, 2007.\n     Hon. John F. Kerry,\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Kerry, Smith, Kennedy, and Domenici:  I \n     commend you for your leadership in introducing the \n     ``Children's Mental Health Parity Act'' to require equitable \n     coverage of mental health services in the State Children's \n     Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). As you know, providing \n     access to needed mental health care is a key component of \n     ensuring that SCHIP covers the full array of services needed \n     for healthy childhood development.\n       As the Nation's oldest and largest advocacy organization \n     dedicated to addressing all aspects of mental health and \n     mental illness, we at Mental Health America greatly value the \n     importance of prevention and early identification of mental \n     illness. Thus, improving access to mental health care for \n     children and youth is one of our primary objectives, \n     particularly since some of the most serious mental illnesses \n     often first arise in adolescence.\n       Many children need extensive mental health services in \n     order to progress socially and emotionally and to \n     successfully complete their education. Mental disorders \n     affect about one in five American children and five to nine \n     percent experience serious emotional disturbances that \n     severely impair their functioning. Moreover, low-income \n     children enrolled in Medicaid and SCHIP have the highest \n     rates of mental health problems.\n       Unfortunately, over two-thirds of children struggling with \n     mental health disorders do not receive mental health care. \n     Without early and effective identification and interventions, \n     childhood mental disorders can lead to a downward spiral of \n     school failure, poor employment opportunities, and poverty in \n     adulthood. Untreated mental illness may also increase a \n     child's risk of coming into contact with the juvenile justice \n     system, and children with mental disorders are at a much \n     higher risk for suicide.\n       Discriminatory limits on mental health care are a primary \n     cause of this widespread lack of access to necessary mental \n     health services. And sadly, many state SCHIP plans impose \n     these restrictive limits on mental health care, including \n     caps on coverage of inpatient days and outpatient visits. \n     These limits are not based on the medical needs of children \n     enrolled in SCHIP or on practitioners' best practice \n     guidelines. They are far too restrictive for ensuring access \n     to adequate care for children with mental disorders. In fact, \n     research has shown that children with complex mental health \n     needs have access to full coverage for needed services in not \n     more than 40 percent of states due to the limited benefit \n     package in their state's SCHIP plan.\n       Thus, we greatly appreciate your introduction of the \n     ``Children's Mental Health Parity Act'' that would prohibit \n     discriminatory limits on mental health care in SCHIP plans by \n     directing that any financial requirements or treatment \n     limitations that apply to mental health or substance abuse \n     services must be no more restrictive than the financial \n     requirements or treatment limits that apply to other medical \n     services. Your bill would also eliminate a harmful provision \n     in current law that authorizes states to lower the amount of \n     mental health coverage they provide to children in SCHIP down \n     to 75 percent of the coverage provided in the benchmark plans \n     listed in the statute as models for states to use in \n     developing their SCHIP plans.\n\n[[Page S5739]]\n\n       We look forward to working with you to ensure enactment of \n     this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            David L.

Senator John Kerry,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Smith and Kerry: on behalf of the American \n     Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), we would \n     like to express our support for the ``The Children's Mental \n     Health Parity Act.''\n       The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry \n     (AACAP) is a medical membership association established by \n     child and adolescent psychiatrists in 1953. Now over 7,600 \n     members strong, the AACAP is the leading national medical \n     association dedicated to treating and improving the quality \n     of life for the estimated 7-12 million American youth under \n     18 years of age who are affected by emotional, behavioral, \n     developmental and mental disorders.\n       Mental health is integral to the health and well-being of \n     all children. Children coping with emotional and mental \n     disorders must be identified, diagnosed, and treated to avoid \n     the loss of critical developmental years that can never be \n     recaptured. Currently, under the State Children's Health \n     Insurance Program (SCHIP) mental health coverage is left up \n     to the states. This act will amend Title XXI of the Social \n     Security Act to provide for equal mental health coverage \n     under SCRIP and allow for millions of children to receive the \n     preventive care they need to live healthy productive lives.\n       We appreciate your leadership on this important issue. \n     Please contact Kristin Kroeger Ptakowski, Director of \n     Government Affairs, at 202.966.7300, x. 108, if you have any \n     questions concerning children's mental health issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Thomas Anders, M.D.,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          National Association for\n\n\n                                 Children's Behavioral Health,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 6, 2007.\n     Senator John Kerry,\n     Senate Russell,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: On behalf of the National Association \n     for Children's Behavioral Health, we want to thank you for \n     your leadership in introducing the Children's Mental Health \n     Parity Act. Allowing persistent discriminatory coverage in \n     mental health benefits in any health insurance policies is an \n     indignity which no longer can be tolerated. Correcting this \n     injustice in the State Children's Health Insurance Program, \n     recognizing the particular and multiple needs of low income \n     and disabled children, is an appropriate beginning.\n       The reauthorization of this program offers a critical \n     opportunity to rectify discriminatory limits on mental health \n     care that exist in SCHIP plans across the nation. Children in \n     SCHIP plans deserve comprehensive coverage for their mental \n     health needs. Not only does existing law not require parity \n     for mental health services in benchmark plans, it allows for \n     discriminatory lower actuarial values in benchmark equivalent \n     plans. This outrage must be corrected. Your bill takes the \n     courageous steps necessary to correct these injustices. We \n     stand ready to assist you any way to assure swift passage.\n       The National Association for Children's Behavioral Health \n     (NACBH) is a nonprofit trade association representing multi-\n     service treatment and social service agencies. Members \n     provide a wide array of behavioral health and related \n     services to children, youth and families. Services provided \n     by NACBH members include assessment, crisis intervention, \n     residential treatment, group homes, family-based treatment \n     homes, foster care, independent living, family services, \n     alternative educational services and programs, in-home \n     respite, outpatient counseling and a plethora of community \n     outreach programs and resources.

The State Children's Health Insurance \n     Program (SCHIP) can provide coverage for many effective \n     interventions that are proven to help treat kids with \n     behavioral or emotional problems--preventing later violence \n     and saving taxpayers money. However, to maximize its crime \n     reduction impact, current law regarding mental health \n     coverage must be strengthened to ensure that mental health \n     benefits are equivalent in scope to benefits for other \n     physician and health services. We are pleased that you, along \n     with Senators Smith, Kennedy and Domenici, are working to \n     amend the State Children's Health Insurance Program to \n     provide mental health parity.\n       SCHIP coverage can help provide evidenced-based, intensive \n     individual and family therapy programs for troubled youth \n     such as Multi-Systemic Therapy (MST). A study of MST followed \n     juvenile offenders until they were, on average, 29-years-old. \n     Individuals who had not received MST were 62 percent more \n     likely to have been arrested for an offense, and more than \n     twice as likely to have been arrested for a violent offense. \n     Unfortunately, a number of states limit the amount or \n     duration of mental health services coverage so that, in many \n     states, effective delinquency intervention treatments like \n     MST could not be covered.\n       Mental health benefits under SCHIP should be strengthened \n     to ensure that mental health benefits are equivalent in scope \n     to benefits for other physician and health services. The \n     Children's Mental Health Parity Act would amend SCHIP to \n     ensure that states' children's health plans include no \n     financial requirements and treatment limitations for mental \n     health care that are more restrictive than those of other \n     medical benefits of the plan.\n       We look forward to working with you to ensure that a strong \n     SCHIP reauthorization bill, which incorporates these mental \n     health parity provisions, moves to enactment. This will help \n     kids get off to a good start and make our communities safer.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    David S.

John F. Kerry,\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Kerry, Smith, Kennedy, and Domenici: On \n     behalf of the more than 600 members of the National \n     Association of Psychiatric Health Systems (NAPHS) and the \n     individuals and families that our members serve, we want to \n     thank you for your leadership in introducing the ``Children's \n     Mental Health Parity Act'' to require equitable coverage of \n     mental health services in the State Children's Health \n     Insurance Program (SCHIP).\n       Low-income children enrolled in Medicaid and SCHIP have the \n     highest rates of mental health problems. Unfortunately, over \n     two-thirds of children struggling with mental health \n     disorders do not receive mental health care. Untreated mental \n     illness may increase a child's risk of coming into contact \n     with the juvenile justice system, and children with mental \n     disorders are at a much higher risk for suicide.\n       Discriminatory limits on mental health care are a primary \n     cause of this widespread lack of access to necessary mental \n     health services. And sadly, many state SCHIP plans impose \n     these restrictive limits on mental health care, including \n     caps on coverage of inpatient days and outpatient visits. \n     These limits are far too restrictive for ensuring access to \n     adequate care for children with mental disorders. In fact, \n     research has shown that children with complex mental health \n     needs have access to full coverage for needed services in not \n     more than 40 percent of states due to the limited benefit \n     package in their state's SCHIP plan.\n       Thus, we greatly appreciate your introduction of the \n     ``Children's Mental Health Parity Act'' that would prohibit \n     discriminatory limits on mental health care in SCHIP plans by \n     directing that any financial requirements or treatment \n     limitations that apply to mental health or substance abuse \n     services must be no more restrictive than the financial \n     requirements or treatment limits that apply to other medical \n     services. Your bill would also eliminate a harmful provision \n     in current law that authorizes states to lower the amount of \n     mental health coverage they provide to children in SCHIP down \n     to 75 percent of the coverage provided in the benchmark plans \n     listed in the statute as models for states to use in \n     developing their SCHIP plans.\n       Again, thank you for all you have done to improve the lives \n     of millions of children with psychiatric disorders. We \n     enthusiastically support your bill and look forward to \n     continuing to work with you to pass this very important \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Mark Covall,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n[[Page S5740]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                     Judge David L.

Gordon Smith\n     Hon. Pete Domenici,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Kerry, Smith and Domenici:  On behalf of the \n     Judge David L. Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law--the \n     national leading legal-advocacy organization representing \n     children and adults with mental disabilities--I would like to \n     offer our strong support for the Children's Mental Health \n     Parity Act. We fully share your goal of eliminating \n     discriminatory limits placed on mental health services within \n     the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP).\n       As you well know, many states have imposed discriminatory \n     and restrictive limits on mental health services that would \n     not be permissible in Medicaid, including caps on both \n     inpatient and outpatient care, annual cost restrictions, and \n     limits on diagnostic services. As a result, many enrolled \n     children do not receive essential mental health care as an \n     important component of the range of services needed by \n     children for healthy development. Without access to needed \n     mental health care, children are placed at risk for a host of \n     adverse outcomes, including school failure, contact with \n     juvenile justice and even suicide.\n       It is vital that SCHIP plans provide mental health coverage \n     that is equivalent to the coverage provided for general \n     health care. The goal of SCHIP--to provide children with the \n     health insurance coverage they need--must be realized for all \n     eligible children. We look forward to working with you to \n     ensure enactment of this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Robert Bernstein,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senator \nKerry, Senator Domenici and Senator Kennedy to introduce a The \nChildren's Mental Health Parity Act that will have tremendous impact on \nmillions of low-income children who are living with a mental illness. \nThis bill will ensure mental health parity exists in the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, which provides health care \nto our Nation's low-income children.\n  Mental illness affects about one in 5 American children, yet an \nestimated \\2/3\\ of all young people with mental health problems are not \ngetting the help they need. Moreover, children in Medicaid and SCHIP \nhave the highest rates of mental health problems. Despite the \nprevalence of mental illness among our Nation's children, a large \nmajority of children struggling with these difficulties do not receive \nmental health care. Without early and effective identification and \ninterventions, childhood mental illnesses can lead to school failure, \npoor employment opportunities and poverty in adulthood. We also ow that \nsuicide is the sixth leading cause of death among 5 to 15 year olds and \nthe third leading cause of death for 15 to 24 year olds. Moreover, in \n1999, more teenagers and young adults died as a result of suicide than \ncancer, heart disease, HIV/AIDS, birth defects, stroke and chronic lung \ndisease combined. Currently, between 500,000 and one million young \npeople attempt suicide each year.\n  A parent with a son who struggled with a mental illness, I know all \ntoo well the indiscriminate nature of the illness and the frightening \nstatistics of its regular occurrence for those we love. That is why \nensuring access to care is so vitally important. Yet, our Nation's \nhealth care program dedicated to delivering care to children is falling \nbehind. Many States have imposed restrictive limits on mental health \nservices that would not be permissible in Medicaid, including caps on \nboth inpatient and outpatient care, annual cost restrictions, and \nlimits on diagnostic services. These limits are not based on the \nmedical needs of beneficiaries or best practice guidelines and result \nin coverage that is wholly inadequate for a child with a mental \nillness.\n  This is why the introduction of this legislation is so critical. The \nChildren's Mental Health Parity Act would prohibit discriminatory \nlimits on mental health care in SCHIP plans by directing that any \nfinancial requirements or treatment limitations that apply to mental \nhealth or substance abuse services must be no more restrictive than the \nfinancial requirements or treatment limits that apply to other medical \nservices. The bill also would eliminate a harmful provision in current \nlaw that authorizes states to lower the amount of mental health \ncoverage they provide to children in SCHIP down to 75 percent of the \ncoverage provided in the benchmark plans listed in the statute as \nmodels for States to use in developing their SCHIP plans.\n  My home State of Oregon had the wisdom and foresight to see that \nmental health parity was necessary. The Oregon Health Plan, through \nwhich SCHIP kids are covered, offers parity with physical health \nservices and a very comprehensive mental health benefit package, A 2004 \nreport by the Governor of Oregon's Mental Health Taskforce found that \nin any given year, 75,000 children under the age of 18 are in need of \nmental health services. It also listed as one of the major problems \nfacing the Oregon mental health system is the fact that mental health \nparity was not, at that time, in effect. That is no longer the case and \nI look forward to seeing significant improvements in the mental health \nsystem in Oregon as a result of the hard work done there.\n  Although we are fortunate to have mental health parity in Oregon, \nthere are millions children across the Nation that are in critical need \nof similar care. That is why the introduction of this Federal \nlegislation is so important, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to support this bill and work towards its swift passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Smith, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. \n        Collins, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Coleman, Mr. \n        Casey, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Burr, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. \n        Graham, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Cardin):\n  S. 1338. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for a two-year moratorium on certain Medicare physician payment \nreductions for imaging services; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and \ncolleague from Oregon, Senator Gordon Smith, to reintroduce the Access \nto Medicare Imaging Act. This legislation would place a 2-year \nmoratorium on the imaging cuts enacted as part of the Deficit Reduction \nAct, DRA, of 2005, pending the outcome of a comprehensive Government \nAccountability Office, GAO, study on imaging utilization and payment \nwithin the Medicare Program.\n  Each year, millions of Medicare patients receive medical imaging \nservices, including X-rays, CT-scans, MRIs, and PET scans, just to name \na few. Imaging technologies are a critical component of early diagnosis \nand treatment for many life-threatening conditions, like cancer and \nheart disease. Medical imaging equipment allows providers to rapidly \nexchange images across the internet, facilitating greater and timelier \nphysician consultation and improving the quality of care received by \npatients.\n  For individuals living in rural or medically underserved areas, such \nas many parts of West Virginia, imaging technology is particularly \nimportant. In West Virginia, access to imaging equipment is a very big \ndeal. Without these technologies, many individuals would be denied much \nneeded treatment and invaluable peace of mind. Sadly, provisions \nincluded as part of the DRA leave some of our most vulnerable citizens \nat risk by jeopardizing their access to these imaging services.\n  Consider, if you will, the Center for Advanced Imaging at West \nVirginia University. This state-of-the-art facility offers the rare \nintegration of clinical imaging with medical research and development. \nImaging services are provided for patients throughout the State of West \nVirginia and bordering rural regions in Ohio, Maryland, Kentucky, \nVirginia, and Pennsylvania. Because of imaging technology, trained \nmedical staff at West Virginia University can take a digital image and, \nwithin minutes, send a precise copy to a major medical facility in \nSeattle, WA. There, it can be read by a specialist, who can then return \na written report by email. A few years back this was still science \nfiction, but now it happens every hour, of every day, across the \ncountry.\n  As incredible as these services may seem, and as important as they \nare to the practice of effective clinical medicine, there is a \nperception that imaging services also come with an increased cost. Over \nthe past few years, the use of imaging services by Medicare \nbeneficiaries has increased significantly. In fact, MedPAC reported in \nMarch 2005\n\n[[Page S5741]]\n\nthat imaging grew at twice the rate of all other physician fee schedule \nservices between 1999 and 2003. During that time, MRI and CT procedures \nincreased by 15 to 20 percent per year on their own.\n  In addition to rising costs, MedPAC further reinforced ongoing \nconcerns about potential overuse of imaging services and the sudden \nincrease of outpatient-based imaging in primary care settings. Citing a \nlack of training and implementation of imaging guidelines, MedPAC \ncalled upon Congress to direct the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to define and execute such standards.\n\n  Given the MedPAC report, imaging reimbursement became an easy budget \ntarget during the reconciliation debate in 2005. On January 1, 2007, as \ndirected by the DRA, payments for medical imaging services delivered in \na physician's office or imaging center were capped at a rate not to \nexceed the rate paid to a hospital's outpatient department. In some \ninstances, this has resulted in a 30-50 percent reduction from previous \nMedicare imaging reimbursement rates and has created questions as to \nthe long-term availability of these vital services for Medicare \nrecipients.\n  I believe the $8 billion in imaging cuts were prematurely added to \nthe Deficit Reduction Act in order to meet a budget target and were not \nbased on sound public policy. These cuts represent almost a third of \nthe total savings included in the Deficit Reduction Act, yet they were \nnever debated by Congress. Physicians need imaging technology to ensure \nthe best possible health outcomes for their patients, and they deserve \nto be fairly compensated for providing their patients access to this \nrevolutionary technology.\n  The legislation that I am proposing today along with Senators Smith, \nKennedy, Collins, Murray, Isakson, Kohl, Coleman, Casey, Cornyn, \nMenendez, Burr, Lincoln, Graham and Harkin would declare a 2-year \nmoratorium on the imaging cuts included in the DRA so that both the \nGovernment Accountability Office and Congress can better assess what \npayment or policy reforms are necessary to maximize the effectiveness \nof the imaging technology available to Medicare recipients. The insight \ngarnered from a comprehensive GAO study will be invaluable to Congress. \nIn the meantime, however, we cannot stand by and allow our elderly and \ndisabled to suffer so that we can meet an arbitrary budget target. I \nurge my colleagues to join with us in supporting this timely \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1338\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965, the Higher Education Act of 1965, and the Internal Revenue \nCode of 1986 to improve recruitment, preparation, distribution, and \nretention of public elementary and secondary school teachers and \nprincipals, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, of all the challenges we face today, one \nof the most important is creating greater opportunities for the \nNation's children to learn and succeed in life. If America is to remain \ncompetitive in the global economy, if all Americans are to have access \nto the American dream, we must ensure that all our children receive a \ngood education.\n  A good education begins with a good teacher. One of the most \nsignificant steps we can take to improve the Nation's schools is to do \nmore to support the recruitment, training, and retention of high \nquality teachers.\n  We owe a great debt to America's teachers. Day in and day out, in \nthousands of schools across the country, they struggle to give our \nchildren the knowledge and skills they need to succeed. Our teachers \nare at the forefront of the constant effort to improve public \neducation. It is their vision, energy, hard work, and dedication that \nwill make all the difference in successfully meeting this challenge.\n  As Shirley Hufstedler, the Nation's first Secretary of Education, \nsaid:\n\n       ``The role of the teacher remains the highest calling of a \n     free people. To the teacher, America entrusts her most \n     precious resource, her children; and asks that they be \n     prepared, in all their glorious diversity, to face the rigors \n     of individual participation in a democratic society.''\n\n  All children need and deserve teachers who can help them succeed. We \nin Congress must do all in our power to help them do so.\n  We took a major step toward this goal when Congress passed the No \nChild Left Behind Act, which recognized that all students deserve \nfirst-rate teachers to help them reach their potential in school. The \nlaw established a goal to guarantee a highly qualified teacher in every \nclassroom by the end of 2006. Few states have reached that ambitious \ntarget, and much more remains to be done to achieve success.\n  Extensive research shows that teacher quality is the most important \neducational factor affecting student achievement. One recent study \nshowed that having a highly qualified teacher can improve student \nacademic growth by as much as one full year. Another showed that \nstudents taught by highly qualified teachers for 3 consecutive years \nsignificantly outperformed their peers on academic assessments. A \ncomparison of low-performing and high-performing elementary schools \nwith similar student populations found that differences in teacher \nqualifications accounted for 90 percent of the difference in \nperformance in reading and math. There's strong evidence that a good \nteacher can make all the difference in closing achievement gaps for the \nneediest students in our public schools.\n  Investing in teacher quality is cost effective and fiscally \nresponsible. A recent study involving 1,000 school districts found that \nadditional dollars invested in more highly qualified teachers resulted \nin greater improvements in student achievement than any other use of \nschool resources.\n  Unfortunately, research also shows that high quality teachers are the \nmost inequitably distributed educational resource in the Nation. The \nmost at-risk students are too often taught by the least prepared, least \nexperienced, and least qualified teachers. Students in high poverty \nschools are twice as likely to be taught by teachers with less than 3 \nyears of experience. Such teachers are less likely to receive the \nresources and support they need to succeed. Often they leave the \nprofession and further destabilize already struggling schools. By \ncontrast, children of the affluent and the privileged are much more \nlikely to be taught by highly prepared and qualified, expert teachers \nwith broad knowledge and experience in the subjects they teach.\n  To enable more teachers to receive the assistance they need to \nimprove their instruction, ensure that every child receives a high \nquality education, and level the playing field for America's students, \nCongress must act on a comprehensive plan to build and sustain a strong \nteacher workforce.\n  That is why today I am introducing the Teacher Excellence for All \nChildren Act of 2007, the TEACH Act. Its purpose is to assist the \nStates and districts in better recruiting, training, retaining and \nsupporting our teachers. Our distinguished colleague in the House, \nCongressman George Miller, is introducing companion legislation, and I \ncommend him for his leadership on this issue.\n\n[[Page S5742]]\n\n  The TEACH Act addresses four specific challenges head on:\n  It increases the supply of outstanding teachers and provides \nincentives to attract them to high-need schools;\n  It ensures all children have teachers with expertise in the subjects \nthey teach;\n  It improves teaching by identifying and rewarding the best teaching \npractices and by expanding professional development opportunities; and\n  It helps schools retain teachers and principals by providing the \nsupport they need to succeed.\n  Enrollment in public schools has reached an all-time high of 53 \nmillion students, and is expected to keep increasing over the next \ndecade. To educate this expanding population, additional high quality \nteachers are urgently needed.\n  Many schools today face a crisis in recruiting and retaining highly-\nskilled teachers, particularly in the Nation's poorest communities. We \nnow have approximately 3 million public school teachers across the \ncountry. Mr. President, 2 million new teachers will be needed in the \nnext 10 years to serve the growing student population. Yet we are not \neven retaining the teachers we have today. A third of all teachers \nleave during their first 3 years. Almost half leave during the first 5 \nyears. Over 200,000 teachers leave the profession each year--6 percent \nof the teaching workforce.\n  The shortage of highly qualified teachers is especially acute in the \nfields most essential to America's future competitiveness, and \nparticularly affects low-income students. A third of all math classes \nin high-poverty high schools are taught by teachers who don't have a \ndegree in math, compared to just 18 percent of such classes in low-\npoverty schools. Over half of all science classes in such schools are \ntaught by teachers without a degree in their field, compared to just 22 \npercent of such classes in low-poverty schools. Meanwhile, students in \nother nations are surpassing American students in math and science \nachievement.\n  Too often, teachers also lack the training and support needed to do \nwell in the classroom. They are paid on average almost $8,000 a year \nless than graduates in other fields, and the gap widens to more than \n$23,000 after 15 years of teaching. Mr. President, 37 percent of \nteachers cite low salaries as a main factor for leaving the classroom \nbefore retirement.\n  The TEACH Act will do more to recruit and retain highly qualified \nteachers, particularly in schools and subjects where they are needed \nmost. The bill provides financial incentives to encourage talented \nindividuals to pursue and remain in this essential profession, and it \noffers higher salaries, tax breaks, and greater loan forgiveness.\n  To attract motivated and talented individuals to teaching, the bill \nprovides up-front tuition assistance, $4,000 a year, to high-performing \nundergraduate students who agree to commit to teach for 4 years in \nhigh-need areas and in subjects such as math, science, and special \neducation. It also creates a competitive grant program for colleges and \nuniversities to recruit teachers among students majoring in math, \nscience, or foreign language.\n  The TEACH Act will also help deliver access to the best teachers for \nthe neediest students to help them succeed, and will help keep these \nteachers where they are most needed. In high-poverty schools, teacher \nturnover is 33 percent higher than in other schools. Clearly, we must \ndo a better job of attracting better teachers to the neediest \nclassrooms and do more to reward their efforts, so that they stay in \nthe classroom. To encourage expert teachers to teach where they are \nneeded, the bill provides funding to school districts to reward \nteachers who transfer to schools with the greatest challenges, and \nprovides incentives for teachers working in math, science, and special \neducation.\n  The bill establishes a framework to develop and use the systems \nneeded at the State and local levels to improve teaching and to \nrecognize exceptional teaching in the classroom. It encourages the \ndevelopment of data systems to provide teachers with additional data to \ninform and improve classroom instruction. It also encourages the \ndevelopment of model teacher advancement programs that recognize and \nreward different roles, responsibilities, knowledge, and positive \nresults with competitive compensation initiatives.\n  Too often, teachers lack the training they need before reaching the \nclassroom. On the job, they have few sources of support to meet the \nchallenges they face in the classroom, and few opportunities for \nongoing professional development to expand their skills. The bill \nresponds to the needs of teachers in their early years in the classroom \nby creating new and innovative models that use proven strategies to \nsupport beginning teachers. New teachers will have access to mentoring, \nopportunities for cooperative planning with their peers, and a special \ntransition year to ease into the pressures of entering the classroom. \nVeteran teachers will have an opportunity to improve their skills \nthrough peer mentoring and review. Other support includes professional \ndevelopment delivered through teaching centers to improve training and \nworking conditions for teachers.\n  Since good leadership is also essential for schools, the bill \nprovides important incentives and support for principals by improving \nrecruitment and training for them as well.\n  This legislation was developed with input from a broad and diverse \ngroup of educational professionals and experts, including the Alliance \nfor Excellent Education, the American Federation of Teachers, the \nBusiness Roundtable, the Center for American Progress Action Fund, the \nChildren's Defense Fund, the Education Trust, the National Commission \non Teaching and America's Future, the National Council on Teacher \nQuality, the National Council of La Raza, the National Education \nAssociation, New Leaders for New Schools, the New Teacher Center, \nOperation Public Education, the Teacher Advancement Program Foundation, \nTeach for America and the Teaching Commission. I thank them all for \ntheir help and their work on behalf of our nation's children.\n  The TEACH Act is good for America's children; it's good for America's \neconomy; and it's good for America's future. It is an essential part of \nour ongoing effort to ensure that ``No Child Left Behind'' becomes a \nreality and not just a slogan.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1339\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Conforming amendments.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) There are not enough qualified teachers in the Nation's \n     classrooms, and an unprecedented number of teachers will \n     retire over the next 5 years. Over the next decade, the \n     Nation will need to bring 2,000,000 new teachers into public \n     schools.\n       (2) Too many teachers and principals do not receive \n     adequate preparation for their jobs.\n       (3) More than one-third of children in grades 7 through 12 \n     are taught by a teacher who lacks both a college major and \n     certification in the subject being taught. Rates of ``out-of-\n     field teaching'' are especially high in high-poverty schools.\n       (4) Seventy percent of mathematics classes in high-poverty \n     middle schools are assigned to teachers without even a minor \n     in mathematics or a related field.\n       (5) Teacher turnover is a serious problem, particularly in \n     urban and rural areas. Over one-third of new teachers leave \n     the profession within their first 3 years of teaching, and 14 \n     percent of new teachers leave the field within the first \n     year. After 5 years--the average time it takes for teachers \n     to maximize students' learning--half of all new teachers will \n     have exited the profession. Rates of teacher attrition are \n     highest in high-poverty schools. Between 2000 and 2001, 1 out \n     of 5 teachers in the Nation's high-poverty schools either \n     left to teach in another school or dropped out of teaching \n     altogether.\n       (6) Fourth graders who are poor score dramatically lower on \n     the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) than \n     their counterparts who are not poor. Over 85 percent of \n     fourth graders who are poor failed to attain NAEP proficiency \n     standards in 2003.\n       (7) African-American, Latino, and low-income students are \n     much less likely than other students to have highly-qualified \n     teachers.\n       (8) Research shows that individual teachers have a great \n     impact on how well their students learn. The most effective \n     teachers have been shown to be able to boost their pupils' \n     learning by a full grade level relative to students taught by \n     less effective teachers.\n       (9) Although nearly half (42 percent) of all teachers hold \n     a master's degree, fewer than 1 in 4 secondary teachers have \n     a master's degree in the subject they teach.\n       (10) Young people with high SAT and ACT scores are much \n     less likely to choose teaching as a career. Those teachers \n     who have higher SAT or ACT scores are twice as likely to \n     leave the profession after only a few years.\n       (11) Only 16 States finance new teacher induction programs, \n     and fewer still require inductees to be matched with mentors \n     who teach the same subject.\n\n               TITLE I--RECRUITING TALENTED NEW TEACHERS\n\n     SEC. 101.

Res. 191\n\n       Whereas approximately half of households in the United \n     States subscribe to high-speed data service over current-\n     generation broadband networks, and the number of households \n     subscribing to high-speed data service is growing by more \n     than 20 percent annually;\n       Whereas households in the United States have used these \n     networks to access over the Internet and via direct \n     connections an increasingly broad array of critical \n     information, services, and applications;\n       Whereas the information, services, and applications \n     households in the United States access through these networks \n     serve important policy priorities of the United States, such \n     as improving health care and education, enhancing access to \n     domestic and international markets, and reducing energy \n     consumption and greenhouse gases;\n       Whereas, because new information, services, and \n     applications require increasing amounts of bandwidth, and \n     that trend is expected to accelerate dramatically, current-\n     generation broadband networks, with their limited bandwidth \n     capabilities, are proving insufficient to meet the electronic \n     access needs of households in the United States;\n       Whereas next-generation broadband networks, with \n     transmission speeds of 100 megabits per second, \n     bidirectionally, have the capabilities to provide access to \n     important bandwidth-intensive information, services, and \n     applications being developed and can readily increase these \n     capabilities for future developments;\n       Whereas, recognizing that next-generation broadband \n     networks are essential to the achievement of social \n     objectives, economic competitiveness, and global leadership, \n     other countries have adopted national objectives and \n     strategies to deploy next-generation broadband networks and \n     are already accelerating the construction of such critical \n     infrastructure to households;\n       Whereas next-generation broadband networks in the United \n     States pass through\n\n[[Page S5751]]\n\n     only approximately 5 percent of households today;\n       Whereas, at the current pace, next-generation broadband \n     networks will not be universally available in the United \n     States for more than 20 years, and, as a result--\n       (1) households in the United States will not have access to \n     critical information, services, and applications;\n       (2) entrepreneurs and businesses in the United States will \n     be constrained in developing new products and services that \n     are accessed over the Internet and broadband networks; and\n       (3) the overall welfare and economy of the United States \n     will suffer substantially; and\n\n       Whereas key leaders and organizations in the private sector \n     have called recently for the immediate development of a \n     national next-generation broadband network policy and \n     strategy: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) establishes a national next-generation broadband \n     network goal to bring, by 2015, universal and affordable \n     access to networks with the capability of transmitting data \n     at 100 megabits per second, bidirectionally, so that \n     households, businesses, and government offices in the United \n     States can access the Internet and, via direct connections, \n     access other households, businesses, and government offices; \n     and\n       (2) directs the relevant congressional committees to work \n     with the President--\n       (A) to develop a strategy to achieve the national next-\n     generation broadband network goal; and\n       (B) to begin, by the end of 2007, to enact specific \n     legislation and adopt policies to implement this strategy.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an important \npolicy matter facing our Nation. Many of us in this body have for years \ncalled for a national broadband policy. Today, I am formally proposing \nthe establishment of that national policy. I will propose that we take \ntwo steps: establish a goal, and develop a strategy to meet the goal.\n  Although broadband services are expanding and more consumers are \nsubscribing to broadband, our Nation is falling behind the rest of the \nworld in the deployment next generation broadband infrastructure. \nBroadband as we know it will be obsolete and we must begin to examine \nhow the United States can remain a leader in communications technology. \nAs a nation, we must have a thoughtful national policy to make sure all \nAmericans have the communications infrastructure that they need to \nlearn and compete in a global environment.\n  A national broadband policy is critical to the future of our country. \nHaving a very robust broadband network available to all Americans would \nprovide a tremendous social and economic benefit. The latest phrase in \nthe broadband lexicon is ``exaflood.'' It refers to the flood of new, \nhigh bandwidth applications that are now available to those with a fast \nconnection. The number of broadband applications now available is \nalmost unimaginable.\n  In the last year, social networking Web sites, such as YouTube and \nMySpace, have become integral parts of our society. But, expanded \nconnectivity would allow doctors to diagnose remotely medical \nconditions, music students to study with an instructor hundreds of \nmiles away, and scientists to monitor ocean floor vents from their \noffices on shore. This is the real potential of broadband to transform \nour lives.\n  Those who have a fast enough pipe to use those applications will \nenjoy a huge benefit, both social and economic. As we all recognize, \ncreating next generation broadband networks is crucial to our \ninternational competitiveness. It is not news that the United States is \nlagging many other nations in terms of penetration of current-\ngeneration broadband, for example, cable modems and digital subscriber \nlines. Perhaps more worrisome is that we are also falling behind in \nterms of next-generation broadband technology.\n  In Japan, tens of millions of people have access to a direct fiber \nconnection, and 100 megabit connections are commonplace. Korea has been \nthe leader in DSL for years, and now it also is extending fiber all the \nway to the home. The same is happening in Europe--100 megabit \nconnections are becoming routine in these countries, and it is crucial \nthat the United States not fall behind again. We must have a policy \nthat ensures the deployment of a strong broadband network for all \nAmericans.\n  The first step in going somewhere is to know where you are going, and \nthe same is true in public policy. We need a goal. And the goal should \nbe an ambitious, yet achievable one. The second step is to decide how \nto achieve that goal. We need a roadmap. And, we need it now. By the \nend of 2007, we should establish a national goal and pass a series of \npolicy actions designed to achieve our national goal. There will likely \nbe multiple parts to the plan, and we will likely need to modify those \nparts over time. But if we do not have a plan, we cannot expect to \naccomplish our goal.\n  So today I am introducing a resolution calling for two things: A \nnational goal of 10 megabits per second universally available in the \nUnited States by the end of 2010, and 100 megabits by the end of 2015. \nAs I said, that is ambitious, but achievable. A number of different \nwireline and wireless technologies are today capable of delivering five \nmegabits or more, and their efficacy is constantly increasing. Ten \nmegabits by 2010 is achievable. And by 2015 we can do much better and \nachieve true next generation speeds.\n  If we do our work, by 2015 we can become a true ``100 Megabit \nNation.'' Today, speeds of 30 megabits or higher are available to \nmillions of Americans due to the healthy competition developing between \ntelephone companies and cable television companies, complemented by \nmany forward-thinking real estate developers and municipalities. These \nentities are beginning to offer ``triple play'' services, voice, video \nand data, requiring them to deploy new technologies delivering very \nfast speeds. Having general availability of 100 megabits is achievable \nby 2015 if we push the technology envelope. We can do it, and we should \nresolve today to do so.\n  The second part of my resolution says that by the end of this year, \n2007, we will develop a strategy for achieving our national goal. I \nwill suggest policy actions for inclusion in that strategy, and many of \nyou will as well. I think we should have tax incentives to push the \nprivate sector beyond their current deployment plans, we should offer \nlow-interest loans for the same purpose, we should reform the Universal \nService Fund to encourage broadband deployment, we should free \nmunicipalities to deploy as they see fit, we should ensure the wise use \nof wireless spectrum, and the list goes on. There will be new proposals \nto deal with new challenges and new opportunities. We should develop \nthe first U.S. national broadband policy by the end of 2007, and we \nshould revisit it every year thereafter to modify it as necessary. That \nis what my resolution calls for.\n  I invite my colleagues to join me in this call for a national \nbroadband goal and strategy. We have talked about it for years. Now it \nis time to take action. We owe this to our constituents and the \ncountry. We must act to provide them with the benefits that a powerful \nbroadband network can bring, and we must begin today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/08/senate-section/article/S5751-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1061.
