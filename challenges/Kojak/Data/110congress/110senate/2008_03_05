I think that what has \ntranspired on the CPSC legislation is how we should legislate. I hope \nit continues that way. In that regard, it appears we have a piece of \nlegislation--it is bipartisan in nature, it came out of the committee \nafter much consternation.

It looks like a very good piece of bipartisan legislation.\n  We are going to finish this bill this week. I hope we can finish it \nsooner rather than later. I alerted my caucus that we would be in \nsession until we do finish the bill, but there is no reason we cannot \nfinish this very quickly. I see no reason we have to move to cloture. \nIf that becomes necessary, I will certainly talk to the distinguished \nRepublican leader. But I do not see that on the horizon at this stage.\n  I hope we can move forward on this legislation. I would comment on \nthis: The managers of the bill are somewhat hesitant on an amendment. \nThey did not know if we should vote on it. That was handled properly \nwhen the manager of the bill, Senator Pryor, moved to table an \namendment.\n  That is the way to go, not worry about people talking too much or, \nwell, they are not going to let us vote on it. The manager of the bill \nhas that prerogative when someone offers an amendment. They say their \npiece, they move to table. It is nondebatable. And we need do that on \nthis legislation and other pieces of legislation and not worry so much \nabout a difficult vote.\n  So I hope we can move forward as we have and finish this legislation \nas quickly as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/05/senate-section/article/S1549-7", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last week our friends on the other side \npulled the housing bill. But the problem the bill was meant to address \nobviously does not go away. The effects of the housing downturn \ncontinue to spread.\n  Yesterday the Fed Chairman called for a vigorous response from banks \nand\n\n[[Page S1550]]\n\nfrom lenders. He said aggressive action by lenders would help stressed \nhomeowners and help ensure the health and well being of the broader \nU.S. economy.\n  Well, we Republicans have been saying the same thing about Congress's \nresponse to the housing crisis for 2 weeks. The Democratic plan for \nstressed homeowners is to raise monthly mortgage payments on those who \nbuy new homes or refinance existing ones. We have a different view on \nthis side of the aisle. We want to expand the family budget, not the \nFederal budget, by helping homeowners with targeted assistance and \nhomebuyer tax credits that will make the problem better, not worse. We \nhave a concrete plan to foster the conditions that lead to more \nhomeownership by protecting existing jobs, creating new jobs, \nincreasing wages and keeping taxes low.\n  Among the things we can do to keep taxes low is to patch the loophole \nthat threatens tens of millions of middle-class Americans with a giant \nAMT tax this year. There is no reason we cannot come together now and \nremove any doubt Americans have about paying a tax that threatens to \ncost them, on average, $2,000 more in taxes this year.\n  We patch the AMT every year, and because it was never meant to hit \nmiddle-class taxpayers in the first place, we patch it without creating \nnew taxes somewhere else. In the current economy, we should spare \ntaxpayers the political theatre of waiting until the last minute to go \nthrough this annual charade.\n  Last night the Budget Chairman said the Democratic budget proposal \nthis year will include an AMT patch without an accompanying tax hike. I \nthink that is certainly good news. I commend him for that decision, and \nit is one more reason we should not put off passing the AMT fix. If \nthis is what the chairman intends, we should follow through on it now \nto give taxpayers added certainty. We should remove the doubt about the \nAMT now so Americans who are worried about the economy have one less \nthing to be concerned about.\n  Last year a Democratic-led standoff over passing an AMT patch \nthreatened to delay tax returns for 50 million taxpayers, totaling \nabout $75 billion in refunds. In this economy, we cannot afford to play \nthese kinds of games. We know we will patch the AMT at some point this \nyear. We should give some comfort to taxpayers by doing it now. It is \ntime to put American families' budgets in front of the ever-expanding \nFederal budget.\n  Mr. President, I share the view of the majority leader that we are \nmaking good progress on the underlying bill, and hopefully that will \ncontinue today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think it is important I respond to my \ndistinguished counterpart. We did not pull the bill. We were unable to \ngo to the bill. We moved to proceed to the bill and had to file \ncloture. We could not get 60 votes because we had 1 Republican vote \nwith us to move so we could legislate on housing.\n  As I have said so many times, if the Republicans were serious about \nlegislating on housing, they would have moved to the bill. I pulled the \nbill? That is as Orwellian as this conversation could be. I did not \npull the bill. I tried to go to the bill. Republicans would not let us \ngo to the bill.\n  We have five simple things in our housing package that are extremely \nimportant to the housing industry. Transparency is Jack Reed's \nprovision that all of these agreements should be transparent, they \nshould be understandable.\n  No. 2, the President asked, and we proceeded to do what he asked, to \nhave revenue bonds to take care of some of the distressed properties. \nNo. 3, we have large segments of--we were in a meeting that is still \ngoing on with faith leaders. The head of the Baptist Convention says in \nhis neighborhoods, one, two, and three houses are going into \nforeclosure every week. They have neighborhoods that are in trouble.\n  We have CDBG grants in our bill to allow States to step in and take \ncare of some of those troubled properties. We also have something that \nthe homebuilders care about a great deal, and that is a loss \ncarryforward. It is something they want that would be helpful to the \neconomy, that would be helpful to the housing market.\n  Finally, we have a provision that says: If you have a home, you \nshould be able to go to bankruptcy court and have the loan rate \nadjusted, just as you can if you have a vacation property that you need \nto have readjusted. Those are the five things, very simply.\n  But I say if my Republican colleagues think there is a housing \ncrisis, let us legislate the housing crisis. Come here, offer \namendments and deal with it.\n  But remember, they held a press conference on the same day, on the \nsame day they stopped us from going forward on housing. What did they \ndo in the press conference? Here is what they wanted to do to solve the \nproblems of housing around our country: tort reform. Now, you can \nimagine what a laugher that is, tort reform to solve the housing crisis \nin America today.\n  Secondly, they want to lower taxes. Now try that one on. They are not \nserious about the housing crisis or they would allow us to move \nforward. No, we did not pull the housing bill; they would not let us go \nto the housing bill. That is the record. Vote No. 35, 110th Congress, \ncloture, motion to proceed, cloture motion was rejected because we did \nnot get 60 votes.\n  So all we want are the facts. When you look at those nasty facts, it \nindicates the Republicans do not want to legislate on housing. They \nwant, as the President suggested in his press conference last week, to \nlet us see what happens in June when the rebates come back.\n  This is not a wait-and-see, this is a problem we have to address \nimmediately. What the President has done is voluntary in nature. It \nhelps less than 3 percent of the homes in foreclosures now. Reports \nyesterday said it was basically worthless.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/05/senate-section/article/S1550-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to use my time by following up on \nthe comments our leader has made with regard to the budget. It is \nbudget time in Washington right now. Although many people are focused \nvery heavily on the President's budget submission, the reality is that \nthe budget is a uniquely legislative responsibility. The President \nmakes a recommendation, but it is this Congress, the Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives, that establishes the budget for our Nation.\n  The budget that was announced yesterday and reviewed, which we will \nbe evaluating in the Budget Committee today, in my opinion, is not \nresponsible. In fact, it is an embarrassment.\n  We often talk about the fact that we want to avoid tax-and-spend \npolitics in Washington. But this budget plunges headlong back into the \nvery tax-and-spend policies of the past that have put us in the dire \nfiscal position we are in today.\n  The budget is a failure on the spending policy, it is a failure on \nthe tax policy, and it is a failure on the additions to our national \ndebt that are monumental, which it contemplates. It is a failure \nbecause it does not do a single thing about the most significant fiscal \nproblems facing us, namely the entitlement problems and the entitlement \nportion of our budget.\n  Let me go through all those briefly. To do so, I am going to \nexplain--this may be a little bit basic to those in the middle of \nbudgeting, but I am not sure the folks who pay attention to those \nunderstand exactly how the budgeting process works.\n  This year we will have the first budget that exceeds $3 trillion in \nFederal spending. In rough approximation, that budget is approximately \ntwo-thirds entitlements and spending on the interest on the national \ndebt. The other remaining third is made up of what we call \ndiscretionary spending.\n  Again, approximately half of that is our national defense budget, and \nthe\n\n[[Page S1551]]\n\nremaining half is the rest of our nondefense discretionary spending; \nbasically the rest of everything in Government more than our \nentitlement programs, interest on the national debt, and defense \nspending.\n  The problem, the most significant problem we face in our budget \ntoday, is the fact that the two-thirds portion I talk about, the \nentitlements and the interest on the national debt, are out of control. \nI often say they are on auto pilot, this spending in that two-thirds of \nour budget. That is growing at a rate that has often doubled, sometimes \nmore than doubled, even tripled or quadrupled the rate of the growth of \nour economy.\n  It grows without a vote in Congress. Previous Congresses have passed \nlegislation, and previous Presidents have signed the legislation into \nlaw that has established our entitlement programs.\n  Entitlement programs grow regardless of what we do in Congress. We \ncould never vote again here in Congress and this spending would \ncontinue at rates that have nothing to do with the health or strength \nof the economy and which, as I have said, far ourpaces our economy. \nWhat does the budget before us propose to do about this? Nothing. Yet \nagain we have no opportunity proposed in the budget that we will be \nbattling over to try to address this incredible fiscal problem our \nNation faces.\n  What does the budget do instead? It increases spending dramatically \nin the discretionary part of the budget as well as allowing the \nentitlement section of the budget to rage uncontrolled. We are looking \nin this budget at a $350 billion deficit, and that doesn't count war \nspending except for a small portion. It doesn't take into account the \nfact that we just passed a stimulus package that put another $150 \nbillion of debt on the backs of our children and grandchildren without \npaying for it under the pay-go rules we are required to live by in \nCongress--in other words, $150 billion of new spending with no offsets \nagainst any other spending immediately put on the backs of our children \nand grandchildren in the form of national debt which they will pay back \nat a much higher rate as interest compounds on it over the years.\n  What does this budget do in order to try to deal with this increased \nrush for spending? It raises taxes. It raises taxes over $700 billion \nin the next 5 years. How does that happen? By the way, this tax \nincrease America will face under the assumptions of this budget will \noccur with no vote in Congress. How does that happen? To explain that, \nI need to explain how the budget works.\n  As most people in America are becoming aware, there is a filibuster \nin the Senate that requires, on major policies where there is \ndisagreement, essentially that in order to move forward, 60 votes are \nneeded to get past the filibuster, to get cloture. Because of that 60-\nvote requirement on filibusters, it is difficult to either increase \ntaxes or cut taxes because there is usually opposition to either move, \nand it requires 60 votes to move forward. But there is one bill each \nyear on which we don't have to have 60 votes. It is called the \nreconciliation bill. It is a part of our budget process. Because of the \nway the law is set up, we can have a 50-percent-plus-one vote on that \nreconciliation bill each year. That is how the tax cuts of 2001 and \n2003 were put into place.\n  Those tax cuts, as a reminder, were reductions in the income tax \nmarginal rates for every American, with the largest percentage of those \nreductions in the lower and middle-income categories, reductions of the \ncapital gains tax, reductions of the dividends tax, and a number of \nother very important tax policies that in 2001 and 2003 reduced taxes \nbecause we were able to use the reconciliation bill to do so. The \nproblem is that the reconciliation process requires a sunset.\n  People around the country must wonder why we are facing a sunset of \nthese tax cuts. It is because in order to avoid the filibuster and get \nthe tax cuts put into place, the reconciliation process was used, which \nitself carries a sunset. So over the next 3 or 4 years, the tax cuts of \n2001 and 2003 will expire. Once they expire, taxes will go back up in \nnominal amounts on every American.\n  All we have to do is to extend those tax cuts to keep tax rates at \ntheir current levels, to be responsible about tax policy. But what does \nthis budget do? In order to facilitate the explosion of new spending \nthis budget contemplates, it assumes there will be no vote in Congress \nto extend those tax rates cuts. What does that mean?\n  Let's look at the first chart. Over the next 5 years, that means \ntaxes are going to go up by $1.3 trillion. The lower income tax rates \npeople are paying today are going to go back up. The child tax credit, \nthe marriage penalty elimination, the estate tax reductions, and the \nsmall business tax relief all go back up. One year of AMT fix is \ncontemplated, but the alternative minimum tax which is now slamming the \nmiddle class will not be accommodated in any year of this budget except \nfor the first year. There are other extensions of other types of R \ntax credits and other things that are important for our economy that \nwill go up. When you have totaled it all up, this budget contemplates \nand provides for $1.3 trillion of new taxes.\n  Over a 10-year period, the number is even more phenomenal: $3.9 \ntrillion of new taxes. That is how we are facilitating the increased \nspending contemplated in this budget.\n  As I indicated, we are now facing a situation where Washington has \nreturned to the tax-and-spend policies of the past. If we do nothing, \nwhich is what this budget contemplates, entitlement spending will \ncontinue to rage, driving up our debt. Discretionary spending will be \naccelerated, driving up the debt. Taxes will explode. When those tax \nrates go up, remember, it is going to happen with no vote in Congress. \nWe are simply going to sit back and let America have the hugest tax \nincrease it has ever had by taking no action to protect the American \ntaxpayer.\n  I was elected to the House of Representatives back in 1992 or 1993. \nEver since that time, we have tried to reduce taxes to accommodate a \nbetter tax policy and tax structure in this policy. Every time we have \nproposed a tax cut, that tax cut was attacked as a tax cut for the \nwealthy. That simply is not true. As our leader said, whether you look \nat the alternative minimum tax, the marriage tax penalty, the small \nbusinesses, the child tax credit, or the reductions of income tax rates \nacross the board for every taxpayer in America, these taxes squarely \nhit the middle class and every income category across the board. We \noften talk about that typical family of four and the several thousand \ndollars of taxes they are going to be asked to pitch in for this. But \nit really is not just that typical family of four; it is a single \nmother, a single man, a family with children, a family without \nchildren, a married couple. Everybody who pays taxes is going to see \ntheir taxes go up dramatically.\n  This budget is not responsible. It is not responsible on spending \npolicy. It is not responsible on taxing policy. It is not responsible \nbecause it provides for no action to deal with the entitlement reform \nso pressing in our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to \ntalk about one of my colleagues, the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain.\n  Last night, he secured the nomination of the Republican Party to be \nPresident of the United States. I must admit that about 6 months ago, I \nwas one of those who questioned whether Senator McCain would be \nsuccessful in this quest. While his passion for our Nation has never \nbeen in doubt, my sense was that his campaign for the Presidency was \nflickering to a close. What you saw last night is a reflection of \ncharacter, the character of John McCain, the character that allowed him \nto persevere through the terrible torture of tiger cages in Vietnam.\n  John McCain has never, ever given up on this Nation. In the end, at a \ntime when there is so much cynicism in the body politic and the public \nabout politicians, it is uplifting, not just for this party or for this \nbody, because the next President of the United States will come from \nthis body, but for this country to have as our candidate a man whose \ncharacter has been tested in a furnace that has burned hotter than any \none of us could possibly understand.\n\n[[Page S1552]]\n\n  At a time when the issues of security are so preeminent, we have as a \ncandidate John McCain, who has been as steadfast on protecting this \nNation as one could ever imagine. At a time when the public is \nconcerned about wasteful Washington spending, we have as our candidate \nan individual who has been a champion in fighting wasteful Washington \nspending.\n  I wanted to take a few moments to offer my congratulations to our \ncolleague from Arizona and to say to the American public, at a time \nwhen there is such doubt and cynicism, such division in this country, \nwe have before them an individual whose character is strong. His \ncourage is unquestioned. He has shown the ability to overcome the deep, \ndivisive, partisan divide that tears this body apart, that tears this \ncountry apart. That is a wonderful thing.\n  I offer my heartfelt congratulations to our colleague from Arizona, \nSenator McCain.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise to echo the sentiments of my \ncolleague from Minnesota. The great thing about being involved in \npublic service and having the opportunity to serve people from our \nrespective jurisdictions is the privilege of becoming associated with \nother individuals who are dedicated public servants. We stand on the \nverge of history right here because in this Presidential election we \nare going to have two Members of the U.S. Senate who are going to be \nvying to become Commander in Chief. I think all of us as Members of \nSenate ought to be justly and duly proud of all of those who have put \ntheir names out there, who have worked hard, campaigned hard, and been \nwilling to make the sacrifices necessary to travel the country \nexpressing their views and opinions about issues to become President.\n  Obviously, last night our good friend, Senator John McCain, became \nthe nominee on the Republican side. John deserves an awful lot of \ncredit for endurance, perseverance but, most importantly, for standing \nby his principles. That is the one thing we as Members of the Senate \nneed to look to John and say: There are ways to do this, and there are \nways not to. But you stood by your values. You stood by your \nprinciples. You did this in the right way.\n  He is unique in so many ways. Everybody in here has their own unique \nassets. Certainly John has a great and storied background from a \nmilitary perspective, and he served his country well before he ever got \nto this body. But once he got here, as my friend has just said, he \nexhibited great leadership from the standpoint of providing the kinds \nof ideas, the kind of vision that is needed from a national security \nand a national defense standpoint. He also, primarily, had a vision \nabout how the taxpayers' money, how the individuals he represents, as \nwell as all other taxpayers in the United States, ought to have their \nmoney spent. John has been a tireless advocate for the elimination of \nwasteful Washington spending. Assets such as those are what have \nprojected John to the nomination of our party. I am very proud of the \nfact that he is going to be leading us.\n  It is going to be a spirited campaign. All of us as Members of the \nSenate should be justly proud of all of these candidates who have been \nout there. I am very proud to stand today and salute my dear friend, my \ncolleague, Senator John McCain.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I echo the comments of my colleagues. \nCongratulations to John McCain and, more importantly, congratulations \nto Cindy McCain. Cindy has stood by his side every step of the way--\nthrough good, when people wanted to write his obituary, and now in the \nglow of being the nominee. She is clearly a wonderful partner in this \nprocess.\n  Many ask why John McCain succeeded. I would suggest it is because he \nloves America. He believes in America. He believes in the American \npeople. He stated it in a real and personal way. But as my colleagues \nhave highlighted, his background has set him up for this role at this \ntime in our history.\n  John is a man of consistency, so consistent, many times some of his \ncolleagues have been critical of the fact that he is that \nconsistent. But America is hungry for consistency. They are hungry for \nsomebody to represent them who actually does what they say, means what \nthey say, more importantly, takes on the tough issues.\n\n  John is passionate, John is courageous. His passion comes through \nsometimes in a different way than many of us, but he is tenacious when \nhe sets his mind toward a goal. I think we have seen that in this \nelection cycle. John is stubborn and he is real. I think the most \nincredible thing about John McCain is: What you see is what you get. He \nhas carried out straight talk with America, even when he went to \nMichigan and said things that were not popular. He has said about the \nwar: I would rather lose an election than to bring our troops home with \nless than victory. Well, John McCain meant it, and he meant it because \nhe understands the next generation is what the focus of his Presidency \nis about.\n  I am convinced this body should be proud because the next President \nwill be a Member of this body. I am excited and delighted for John and \nCindy McCain because their quest to be the Republican nominee has been \nfulfilled last night. I certainly commend him for his tenacity and for \nhis hard work as he has gone toward this quest.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for coming down and \nhighlighting the fact that the Presidential nomination on the \nRepublican side has finally come to a conclusion--Senator McCain won. \nTo all those who were in the race, I think I have a little taste of how \ndifficult it was for you and your families.\n  The Republican Party was blessed this year to have a group of \ncandidates who represented the best in the Republican Party: To \nGovernor Huckabee last night, he ran a great campaign; Governor Romney; \nRon Paul--whatever you want to say about Ron Paul, he bleeds, he won \nhis primary last night--and Mayor Giuliani. What a talented field we \nhad on our side. It is equally true on the other side. We are going to \nhave a Senator, as Senator Burr said, for both parties. I do not know \nwhen that last happened. But it is an exciting time.\n  I have had the pleasure of knowing Senator McCain for many years. \nThey will write books about how this happened because our campaign ran \ninto a wall in the summer. I think one of the things you can say about \nSenator McCain, as Senator Burr indicated, is that when he sets his \nmind to something, he is pretty hard to stop. He believes he has a \nlittle more service left in him.\n  If you want to know John McCain, you need to look at his family and \nthe way he has lived his life--his time in the Navy. He looks at being \nPresident as one more chance to serve the country.\n  I was talking to him last night. The idea of being President is \noverwhelming. It is such a prestigious office, it is such an important \noffice for the world and for our Nation. I just indicated to him: Just \nlook at it as another tour of duty. This time you are Commander in \nChief.\n  To the men and women in uniform out there who are serving in faraway \nplaces, standing watch as I speak, you are going to have a great \nCommander in Chief if John McCain wins. The other candidates are fine \npeople, but I think the differences are going to be real.\n  Senator Clinton said something last night. She is a very strong \ncompetitor and you never count the Clintons out and I do admire Senator \nClinton. This is going to be a spirited contest. But she said she \nwanted to end the war in Iraq and win in Afghanistan. Well, what the \nheck does that mean? I want to win in Iraq and I want to win in \nAfghanistan.\n  Senator Obama, who is a real phenomenon, who has come a long way in a \nshort period of time, says the world is watching. He talked about some \ngentleman, the grandfather of one of his campaign operatives, I think \nmaybe in Uganda, staying up all night to watch what we do in America. \nSenator Obama is absolutely right.\n  I can tell you who else is watching. Some of the most vicious killers \nknown to humanity are watching what we do in terms of Iraq and the war \non terror. They are measuring us. They are measuring our candidates for \nPresident.\n\n[[Page S1553]]\n\nThey are seeing who blinks and who does not. They are going to watch \nwhat we do in the Senate, and they are looking for openings.\n  This is going to be a great contest. What an important time for \nAmerica and the world. I hope we can have a civil debate. I am sure it \nwill be. But the fact that there are great differences in a democracy \nis a good thing. I say to the American people, you are going to be \nblessed with some good choices. Please choose wisely because a lot of \npeople depend on what you say or do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/05/senate-section/article/S1553-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1553-S1554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wish to commend my colleagues for coming \ndown to the floor and talking about Senator McCain, who won the \nRepublican nomination for President last night as a result of his \nsuccess in the Texas primary. If there is one thing I can relate to \nbeyond his security credentials, it is his commitment to eliminating \nwasteful Washington spending and making sure we are good stewards of \nthe taxpayers' dollars.\n  I would like to engage in a colloquy with my distinguished colleague \nfrom New Hampshire, the ranking member of the Budget Committee, about \nsome aspects of the budget we are going to be considering first in the \nBudget Committee and then on the floor of the Senate as early as next \nweek. Because this is front and center in terms of whether we are going \nto restore our reputation, frankly, as Senators who believe in limited \nGovernment, if we believe Government should work effectively and we \nshould keep our promises when it comes to how we deal with the American \npeople.\n  I wish to ask the distinguished Senator, through the Chair: As we \nawait the fiscal year 2009 budget today, I remember the majority last \nyear, the Democrats, said they were very proud to announce a surplus as \na result of that process. I would like to ask the Senator, how did that \nturn out?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, first, I would like to join with fellow \nMembers of the Senate who have risen today to congratulate Senator \nMcCain. He is a force for right in this country. He is a person whose \npersonal history is extraordinary. As somebody said: What you see is \nwhat you get. And what you get is an extraordinary American hero who \nunderstands we need to defend ourselves around the world and we need to \nbe fiscally responsible in the United States.\n  New Hampshire sort of brought him back in this campaign, and so we \nplayed a small role in that, although I was not necessarily a part of \nthat role. But, in any event, I now join with my colleagues and look \nforward to supporting him aggressively as he goes forward in this \ncampaign.\n  I think the Senator from Texas raised some excellent questions. The \nquestion is, what happened with the Democratic budget last year, as I \nunderstand it. Essentially, what happened was they produced a budget \nwhich they claimed was going to do one thing, and it ended up doing the \nexact opposite.\n  They claimed, for example, they were going to basically produce a \nbudget which would produce a surplus. In fact, they produced a budget \nwhich produced a huge tax increase--a $900 billion tax increase. To try \nto put that in context, that means every American--or 47 million \nAmericans who pay income taxes--will have their taxes go up $2,700 as a \nresult of the Democratic budget. It means 18 million seniors will have \ntheir taxes go up $2,400 as a result of the Democratic budget. It means \nsmall businesses across this country--24 million small businesses--will \nhave their taxes go up $4,700 because of this almost genetic factor \nwithin the Democratic Party which says they have to raise taxes and \nthey have to spend your money.\n  So their budget was a huge tax increase, I would say to the Senator \nfrom Texas, through the Chair.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from New Hampshire, \nthere was talk about a surplus, and then there ended up being a promise \nto extend middle-class tax cuts. I believe Senator Baucus, the chairman \nof the Finance Committee, proposed an extension of certain tax cuts.\n  I wonder if the Senator from New Hampshire can explain how you can \nhave a surplus and then ultimately how that relates to tax cuts the \nSenator promised.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, to respond the Senator from Texas, what \nhappened was the Democratic leadership last year produced a budget \nwhich raised taxes by $900 billion on the American people. They said: \nOh, but out of the generosity of our heart, we are going to offer an \namendment which cuts back that tax increase by about $154 billion, I \nthink it was--the Baucus amendment--because we are going to extend the \nchild care tax credit, the 10-percent individual rates, the marriage \npenalty. We are going to do all these wonderful things, even though we \nare raising taxes, even after that, by $750 billion.\n  But lo and behold, once again, we saw their actions be a lot \ndifferent than their words. Even though they passed that amendment, \ntook credit for that amendment, they never actually extended any of \nthose tax cuts. So those tax rates are still in place on the American \npeople, and that was a total fraud that was exercised last year by the \nBaucus amendment because nothing came of it.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from New Hampshire \nthrough the Chair: I remember the Budget Committee chairman saying on \n``60 Minutes'' last March that ``We need to be tough on spending.'' \nSurely, as the architect of the fiscal year 2008 budget, he was able to \ndo that; correct?\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, Mr. President, I regret to inform the Senator from \nTexas, not surprisingly, he was not. In fact, they dramatically \nincreased spending in last year's budget in the discretionary spending. \nThey increased it well over what the President asked for--$250 billion \nof additional spending over what the President asked for over 5 years \nin their budget. Then, on top of that--that was not enough for them--\nthey stuck $21 billion into the supplemental, which translates into \nanother $200 billion of spending increases. So they had a total of \napproximately $450 billion of new spending--almost $500 billion of new \nspending--over 5 years in their budget last year.\n  So they did not discipline the budget spending at all. So when \nSenator Conrad said on ``60 Minutes,'' ``We need to be tough on \nspending,'' they were not able to live up to that.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from New Hampshire, \nalthough he has pointed out this last year's budget raised taxes and \nfailed to control spending--indeed, spending increased----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Time has expired.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \nminute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair.\n  I ask the Senator, in addition to raising taxes and failing to \ncontrol spending, surely the budget last year dealt with the growing \nentitlement spending crisis, which has $66 trillion in unfunded \nliabilities that will be paid by our children and grandchildren. Could \nthe Senator address that?\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, Mr. President, again, regrettably, for the American \npeople at least, the Democratic leadership said one thing last year on \nthe budget and did the exact opposite. Not only did they not control \nany entitlement spending, entitlement spending expanded by $466 billion \nover their budget. This is similar to their claim they were going to \nnot be raising taxes, when they raised taxes over $750 billion; similar \nto their claim they were going to be tough on spending, when they \nactually increased spending on the discretionary side by over $450 \nbillion. This entitlement spending is another example of saying one \nthing and doing the opposite.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, I remember when you \nwere Budget chairman, Senator Gregg, we worked under the reconciliation \nprocess in fiscal year 2006 to reduce spending by nearly $40 billion \nover 5 years. Didn't the Democrats use reconciliation last year, too?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes, they definitely ``used'' it. In my view, the \nDemocrats manipulated the reconciliation process to increase gross \nspending by $21 billion, while saving a paltry net $750 million over 6 \nyears.\n\n[[Page S1554]]\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. I do remember Chairman Conrad insisting that closing a \nportion of the tax gap--in other words, collecting unpaid taxes that \nare owed--would give us about $300 billion in revenues to pay for all \nthis new spending. How much was recovered?\n  Mr. GREGG. Actually, none. The Democratic Congress last year passed \nup an opportunity to close the tax gap, failing to fund IRS enforcement \nefforts, and passed bills that would actually expand the tax gap.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Well, as a member of the Budget Committee, I have heard a \nlot from Chairman Conrad on the state of the gross Federal debt. I have \nheard lots of press-friendly sound bites from him like ``the debt is \nthe threat.'' Surely Democrats took some action to reduce the debt?\n  Mr. GREGG. No, again, no action. The fiscal year 2008 budget allows \nthe gross debt to grow dramatically, by $2.5 trillion over 5 years, and \nspends all of the Social Security surplus, which is more than $1 \ntrillion.\n  It is important to remember that this debt will be paid back by our \nchildren, so that a $2.5 trillion increase basically adds another \n$34,000 to the amount already owed by every American child under the \nage of 18.\n  Mr. CORNYN. What about budget enforcement mechanisms? For example, \nDemocrats have claimed their pay-go will ensure fiscal discipline, and \nI have heard Budget Chairman Conrad say that it is working. Is that \ntrue?\n  Mr. GREGG. No, it is not true. Democrats have waived, gimmicked or \nignored their own pay-go rules to the tune of $143 billion in deficit \nspending.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would like to learn more about this. To go back, when \nthe Democrats took the majority, one of the first things they did was \nto restore tough pay-go, correct?\n  Mr. GREGG. It started out that way, but took a left turn. Democrats \nin the Senate ended up with a watered-down version of pay-go: no first-\nyear deficit-neutrality test; no deficit-neutrality test for the second \n5 years--all about spending now, paying much later.\n  Mr. CORNYN. But I thought that the Democrats were congratulating \nthemselves for the hard choices they had to make in order to comply \nwith pay-go.\n  Mr. GREGG. They did congratulate themselves. They even boasted about \nthe ``pay-go surplus'' on the pay-go scorecard.\n  But they shouldn't congratulate themselves for hard choices--they \nshould congratulate themselves for thinking up gimmicks and \nmachinations to fool people into believing they made hard choices.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I have heard about a gimmick where the Democrats were \nable to increase mandatory spending for free by including it in an \nappropriations bill.\n  Mr. GREGG. Can you believe that? They included a 1-month extension of \nthe mandatory MILC program in the 2007 emergency supplemental. Then the \nchairmen of the Senate and House Budget Committees told CBO to put the \nspending into the baseline--which covers 10 years of the program--to \nthe tune of $2.4 billion.\n  The topper: They included an enforcement mechanism in their budget \nresolution that prohibited this practice, but they exempted the 2007 \nsupplemental.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I have also heard about early sunsets as a gimmick to \navoid pay-go. How does that work?\n  Mr. GREGG. In the SCHIP bill, the Democrats reduced funding from $14 \nbillion per year to $3.5 billion in the last year, 2012. The gimmick \nhides $45 billion in spending.\n  The farm bill in the Senate also used this early sunset tactic to \nhide $18 billion in costs.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Wow. Are there more tricks?\n  Mr. GREGG. You bet. The student loan reconciliation bill phased down \ninterest rates to 3.4 percent in 2011, then snap them back up again to \n6.8 percent in 2012. This kept $17 billion in costs hidden.\n  The student loan bill turned off mandatory Pell Grant spending in 1 \nof the 10 years--hiding $9 billion in spending.\n  Mr. President, $10 billion in farm bill spending is pushed out beyond \n2017--totally escaping pay-go enforcement.\n  I haven't even mentioned all of the corporate estimated tax shifts \nthey have used, which move revenues from one fiscal year into another. \nEven Budget Chairman Conrad himself called this ``funny-money \nfinancing'' during debate on the last highway bill.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Sounds like these gimmicks and violations add up to a \npretty hefty total.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, $143 billion--quite a chunk of change.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Is there anything we can do about it?\n  Mr. GREGG. We can try and reinstitute a first-year deficit test, and \nwe can try and reinstitute a second 5 years deficit test. We can adopt \na scoring rule that prohibits shifts such as the corporate estimated \ntax shift from being used to satisfy pay-go.\n  But I am not confident they will accept such changes. They seem \ndetermined to keep up what the Wall Street Journal called ``a con game \nfrom the very start.''\n  Mr. CORNYN. This is very disheartening. Are there other examples of \nDemocrats weakening budget enforcement rules?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes, in last year's budget, the Democrats failed to \nprotect Social Security for seniors. Democrats, in their fiscal year \n2008 budget, threw out both the bipartisan Social Security ``circuit \nbreaker'' and the bipartisan ``save Social Security first'' budget \npoint of order contained in the Senate-passed version, thus removing \ncrucial tools to eliminate the practice of spending the Social Security \nsurplus on other programs. Under the Democrats' fiscal year 2008 \nbudget, every dollar of the Social Security surplus, or $1 trillion, \nwas spent.\n  They failed to protect workers against tax increases. Democrats, in \ntheir fiscal year 2008 budget conference report, threw out a bipartisan \nbudget point of order against raising income tax rates that had been \nincluded in the Senate-passed version.\n  They failed to protect the integrity of the reconciliation process. \nDemocrats threw out a bipartisan point of order in the Senate-passed \nversion that would have limited any new spending in response to \nreconciliation instructions to 20 percent. By converting reconciliation \nto a spending exercise, Democrats allowed new spending that was 2,900 \npercent larger than the savings instruction in their budget.\n  They failed to protect State and local governments from expensive \nmandates. Democrats threw out a Senate rule requiring a supermajority \nto waive the unfunded mandates budget point of order, thus making it \nmuch easier to burden State and local governments with costs from \nFederal Government requirements.\n  They failed to protect the firewall between mandatory and \ndiscretionary spending. Democrats weakened a budget point of order \nagainst mandatory spending in appropriations bills, and exempted the \n2007 supplemental appropriations bill from the requirement altogether, \nthus allowing no enforcement protection against the $2.4 billion MILC \nprogram enacted last year.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Well, I certainly hope that we do not see a repeat of \nthis outrageous tax-and-spend budget this year, and that there is a \ngreat deal more honesty and transparency about what the Government is \nspending and how. I hope to see a return to fiscal discipline, with an \neye on how today's budget will impact future generations.\n  Mr. GREGG. I completely agree. As Republicans, our top priority is to \npass on prosperity and a strong economy to the next generation. We need \nto keep spending in check, take the needed steps to address entitlement \nreform, and keep the economy growing with a fair, progrowth tax system \nin place. It is unconscionable to leave behind this kind of fiscal mess \nthe majority is making.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning to spend \na few minutes talking about the future of our Nation's global aerospace \nleadership, because, frankly, I believe it is in serious jeopardy.\n  Now, for any of my colleagues who have not heard, last Friday, the \nAir Force awarded one of the largest military contracts in history. It \nis a $40 billion contract. But the Air Force picked\n\n[[Page S1555]]\n\na group led by the French company, Airbus, over an American company, \nBoeing, to supply our next generation of aerial refueling tankers.\n  I think I speak for many of us when I say it is deeply troubling we \nwould turn our aerospace leadership over to a foreign company. If the \ncontract had gone to Boeing, it would have meant 44,000 American jobs. \nSo now Airbus is arguing that this contract isn't outsourcing jobs \nbecause it teamed with Northrop Grumman, and they have their supporters \non the radio and TV talking about how excited they are about the work \nthat will come to the United States because of this deal.\n\n  I think we better step back and take a good hard look at what Airbus \nis planning before anybody pops the champagne. The reality is, we don't \nknow what Airbus is planning.\n  The Air Force has already said it did not consider jobs a factor when \nit awarded the tanker contract, so all we have to go on is Airbus's \nword. We have seen Airbus's slick marketing campaign before, and we \nhave very good reason to be worried. Airbus has a history of bending \nthe truth to try to convince Congress that it plans to invest in the \nUnited States, but when you examine their claims, they don't hold up.\n  Five years ago, when Airbus was first working to unravel Boeing's \ntanker contract, Airbus and its parent company, EADS, hired a small \narmy of lobbyists to come out here and assert to us that their business \nwas good for America. Well, at the time I was very skeptical of their \nPR campaign, so I asked our Commerce Department to investigate. Guess \nwhat I found. Airbus had claimed they had created 100,000 jobs here, \nbut the Commerce Department looked into it and it wasn't 100,000 jobs; \nit was 500. Airbus said it had contracted with 800 U.S. firms, but the \nCommerce Department came back and said it was only 250.\n  At that point, Airbus did something very funny. They changed their \nnumbers, decreasing the number of contracts from 800 all of a sudden to \n300, but they increased the alleged value of those contracts from $5 \nbillion to $6 billion a year. So I said at the time: You cannot trust \nAirbus's funny numbers.\n  What is interesting is, if you peel back the veneer on Airbus's \npromises this time, you start asking similar questions. Airbus had said \nit will build an assembly plant in Alabama. The Air Force says the \nplanes will be American. A plant doesn't exist in America, and the only \nthing we know about the jobs it will create is that most of that work \nis going to be done overseas. If you don't believe me, read the British \nnewspapers.\n  An article in a newspaper in Britain reported Monday that:\n\n       Airbus will build the planes in Europe, and fly them to a \n     plant in Mobile, Alabama, for fitting out.\n\n  Supposedly, this allows them to call them ``made in America.'' That \nis like shipping a BMW over from Germany, putting new tires on it, and \ncalling it America's newest luxury car.\n  As I have said before, you can put an American sticker on a plane and \ncall it American, but that doesn't make it American made.\n  I think we have to take some cues from the reaction of the French and \nGerman leaders about what this contract means for Boeing and the \nAmerican industry, and it is not good. German Chancellor Angela Merkel \ncalled the deal ``an immense success for Airbus and the European \naerospace industry.''\n  That is what they are saying in Europe.\n  A spokesman for French President Nicolas Sarkozy called this deal a \n``historic success.'' That is what they are calling it in Europe.\n  Four years ago, I stood on this floor to raise an alarm to my \ncolleagues about Europe's attempt to dismantle the American aerospace \nindustry, and I have spent years warning the administration and \nCongress that we have to defend our industry and demand that Airbus \nplay by the rules. For decades, Europe has provided subsidies to prop \nup Airbus and EADS. Airbus is, to them, a jobs program in Europe, and \nit has led to tens of thousands of layoffs in the United States because \nof their illegal tactics, which I have been out on the floor a number \nof times over the past years to delineate for all of my colleagues. The \nU.S. Government now has a WTO case pending against Airbus--against the \nexact company the Air Force has now awarded a $40 billion contract to.\n  So I think we have even more reason for concern because this contract \nnow gives Airbus a firm foothold as a U.S. contractor, and it is one \nthat is going to hurt our U.S. workers for years to come.\n  It took us 100 years to build an aerospace industry in the United \nStates. But once our plants shut down, the industry is gone. We can't \njust rebuild it overnight. So let's set the record straight. With this \ncontract--this Air Force contract--Airbus is not creating American \njobs; it is killing them. With this contract, we can say bon voyage to \n44,000 U.S. jobs and bon voyage to $40 billion of our taxpayer money.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin.

In the next few days, or in a week or \nso, we will have additional Members join, I am confident, based on a \nnumber of meetings and conversations I have had. So, again, I am happy \nto announce this important caucus to further the debate about a \npressing national challenge. Our point of view and our focus is clear: \nborder security and enforcement first.\n  Why join this caucus? Why form this caucus? Well, clearly, this \nproblem is a major challenge for the country. Right now, 1 in 25 U.S. \nresidents is here illegally. It is staggering when you think about it: \n1 in 25, or 4 percent. The American people have voiced their enormous \nconcern about this en masse, large-scale problem. They have also voiced \ntheir clear concern about some of the proposals put forward in \nWashington to allegedly solve the problem. One of those was shot down \nvery clearly, very soundly last summer, and that is a solution that \nleads with a big, broad amnesty program.\n  I believe this debate moved forward last summer because we defeated \nsoundly on the Senate floor that approach because the American people \nwere finally heard loudly and clearly. I believe the message was \nunmistakable, beyond debate: We don't want a big, broad amnesty; we do \nwant enforcement first. We want enforcement first. This caucus will \nbasically follow that lead of the American people and continue to push \nthe viewpoint and specific, concrete legislation that puts enforcement \nfirst, both at the border and at the workplace, as the way to begin to \nsolve this enormous illegal immigration challenge.\n  So, first, our goal is simple: to push for border security and \ninterior enforcement measures first, including workplace enforcement. \nThat can be a main part of addressing this challenge and solving this \nproblem. This caucus will be a platform to let Americans know that some \nin the Senate--a significant number--are continuing to make sure laws \nalready on the books will be enforced and to push for stronger border \nsecurity and interior enforcement legislation, and the funding, the \nmechanisms, and the systems we need in place to make that work. This \ncaucus will act as a voice for those concerned citizens who have \nexpressed that viewpoint--as I said, most clearly last July.\n  Another big point this caucus will help make over and over is a \nsimple message: attrition through enforcement. In this immigration \ndebate, I believe it has been a stale debate dominated by a straw man. \nThat is the false choice that either we have to grant a huge amnesty to \nfolks in this country illegally or we have to turn around the next day \nand have the law enforcement and resources to arrest, as some people \nput it, 13 million people. That is the false choice that is so often \nharped on\n\n[[Page S1556]]\n\nand presented on the Senate floor. That is a false choice.\n  There is a third way, and that is attrition through enforcement or \nwhittling down in a significant way this 13 million plus figure to \nsomething much smaller, much more manageable, through real enforcement \nmeasures, not only at the border which, of course, is necessary to make \nsure the numbers don't go up and up, but in the interior, specifically \nat the workplace.\n  According to a recent Zogby poll, when given the choice between mass \ndeportations, mass amnesty, and the third way, attrition through \nenforcement, a majority of Americans clearly choose attrition through \nenforcement. Of course, most polls leave out that option. Most polls \npromote the false choice. Most debate, quite frankly, on the Senate \nfloor promotes the false choice, but it is false. There is this real \nalternative.\n  How do we get there? Two main ways: border security--the good news \nthere is we have begun to make inroads, spending $3 billion on \nsignificant new border security in the last appropriations cycle, and \nthat was positive follow-on to the defeat of the amnesty bill last \nsummer. But there is also a second key ingredient, a second key \ningredient that has been largely ignored and not addressed in this \neffort, and that is interior enforcement, particularly at the \nworkplace.\n  In my opinion, that is the missing link, the missing piece of the \npuzzle to make all of this begin to come together. Border security is \ncrucial. We have done significant work there. We need to do much more. \nBut interior enforcement and enforcement at the workplace is at least \nas crucial. We need to have a real system that works for that \nsecurity--a real-time database, not a system based on paper documents \nwhich can so easily be forged--to ensure that companies only hire folks \nin this country legally. When we have that system in place, that will \nchange the dynamics overnight. That will begin this process of \nattrition through enforcement. That will bring that 13 million plus \nnumber down significantly, if we truly have the political will to \nproduce a system, a real-time database, a nonpaper system to ensure \nthat employers only hire folks in this country who are here legally. If \nthey do otherwise, then, of course, they should be hit with significant \ncriminal penalties.\n  So, again, I am proud to announce the organization of this new \ncaucus: the Border Security and Enforcement First Caucus. My colleagues \nwill be hearing a lot more from us in the coming days and months as we \nrepeat the message delivered by the American people last summer so \nloudly, so clearly: We don't want amnesty. We do want enforcement \nfirst, including workplace enforcement, including interior enforcement \nthat can lead to attrition through enforcement. Hopefully, we can begin \nto get our hands around this very crippling, potentially debilitating \nproblem of illegal immigration.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. How much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 14 minutes 16 seconds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/05/senate-section/article/S1556-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I rise this morning to respond to the \nranking member of the Budget Committee, who came out a few moments ago \nto talk about the budget. We are in the process right now of putting \ntogether this year's budget. It will be voted on in committee today or \ntomorrow and, of course, then out here on the floor. We will have a lot \nof floor time over the next week to discuss the budget.\n  I felt it was really important to set the record straight because it \nis that rhetorical time again when we will hear our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle come out and say Democrats are tax-and-spend \nliberals. Let me set the record straight.\n  Last year's budget had a $180 billion tax cut in it--not for the \nwealthiest Americans but for hard-working middle-class Americans.\n  We worked very hard to put together a fiscally responsible budget. We \nare not going to sit here and listen to ``tax and spend'' thrown at us \ntime and time again when, in reality, with the Democratic President 7 \nyears ago we came into the time with a budget that had a surplus, which \nwe soon saw diminished incredibly, and we are now in deficit spending \nbecause of an irresponsible tax cut the Republicans have been pushing \nfor the wealthiest of Americans, which even Senator John McCain didn't \nvote for at the time. It did leave us without the capacity to make sure \nwe had the investments we needed to be able to ensure that Americans \ncan stay in their homes; that they can have roads they can drive on to \nget to work; that they can make sure their children have the kind of \neducation they need so they can get a job and contribute back to this \ncountry; and, importantly, to take care of our veterans who are coming \nhome from Iraq and Afghanistan and finding long waiting lines at our \nmedical facilities and not getting the adequate care they need.\n  The budget that the Budget chair will present this afternoon is, once \nagain, a fiscally responsible document that understands the needs of \nAmericans and will make sure we are responding to the crisis we are in \ntoday in this country and invest in America's people. It is fiscally \nresponsible. It is not about tax cuts or tax increases, it is about \nmaking sure we have the revenues available to make sure every single \nAmerican today has the opportunity that is available for them, that \ndream that they can live to be a strong American citizen and to keep \nour communities and America strong.\n  So I reject the argument that we all hear thrown at us time and again \nthat Democrats are ``tax-and-spend'' liberals. We are fiscally \nresponsible Democrats, and we are proud of it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, as I understand, we are still in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. PRYOR.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 2663, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2663) to reform the Consumer Product Safety \n     Commission to provide greater protection for children's \n     products, to improve the screening of noncompliant consumer \n     products, to improve the effectiveness of consumer product \n     recall programs, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Pryor amendment No. 4090, of a technical nature.\n       Cornyn amendment No. 4094, to prohibit State attorneys \n     general from entering into contingency fee agreements for \n     legal or expert witness services in certain civil actions \n     relating to Federal consumer product safety rules, \n     regulations, standards, certification, or labeling \n     requirements, or orders.\n       DeMint amendment No. 4096, to strike section 21, relating \n     to whistleblower protections.\n       Feinstein amendment No. 4104, to prohibit the manufacture, \n     sale, or distribution in commerce of certain children's \n     products and childcare articles that contain specified \n     phthalates.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I wish to notify our colleagues that I \nthink we are making great progress on this legislation. Senator Cornyn \nis here to talk about one of his amendments. We know there are a few \nother amendments that are being discussed right now, maybe in the \ncloakrooms or in Senators' offices. That is very encouraging. The \nfeedback we have received has been very positive. It looks as if there \nare some amendments that will require votes.\n  I encourage all Senators who would like to come and speak to make \nplans to do that at some point today. I encourage anyone who has any \namendments that they would like to have\n\n[[Page S1557]]\n\nconsidered to run those down to the floor as quickly as possible, if \nthey have not already. We are really making good progress. I was \nencouraged yesterday by the vote we had at 5:30.\n  Here, again, we find that the Consumer Product Safety Commission is \nan agency that needs our reform. They need us to come in and to not \njust give them more resources--it is not a matter of just throwing \nmoney at the problem. They need more tools in their tool box and more \nresources and a little bit of restructuring. It has, again, been the \ngoal of this legislation to make sure the American marketplace is safe, \nmake sure that when people go to a store and buy a product, they can \nrely on the fact that there are safety standards, that it doesn't have \nmaterials in it that are dangerous or harmful. Really, this is an \neffort for us to accomplish something great in this Congress, in this \nelection year, for the people of this country. So I thank all my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle for their diligence in trying to \nget this done.\n  I ask any colleagues who would like to speak or anyone who has an \namendment, please let us know because I am starting to get this sense \nthat there are many who would like to wrap this bill up as quickly as \nwe can.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I again congratulate the Senator from \nArkansas and the Senator from Alaska for working on an important piece \nof bipartisan legislation, this reform of the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission. This is very important to all Americans.\n  I agree that we ought to be able to move through the amendments that \nare being offered. I have tried to offer amendments early so we don't \nbackload them and create problems later in the week. I appreciate what \nthe Senator from Arkansas had to say.\n  I have one amendment pending. In a moment, I intend to offer another \namendment, so it will be pending. I have told Senator Pryor that I am \nmore than happy to agree to a short time agreement and a time for a \nvote after a debate and everybody has had a chance to be heard. These \nare not complicated amendments, but they are important. I hope we can \nmove through this and vote on the amendments and complete our work \nshortly.\n  I told Senator Pryor that I do have another amendment I would like to \ncall up and get pending.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4108\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, at this time, I ask unanimous consent to \nset aside the pending amendment and call up amendment No. 4108 and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Reserving the right to object, once the Senator finishes \nhis presentation, we will go back to the pending amendment.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I agree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4108.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide appropriate procedures for individual actions by \nwhistleblowers, to provide for the appropriate assessment of costs and \n        expenses in whistleblower cases, and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 63, strike line 6 and all that follows through page \n     64, line 6, and insert the following:\n     in an amount not to exceed $15,000 for costs and expenses \n     (including attorneys' and expert witness fees) reasonably \n     incurred, as determined by the Secretary, by the complainant \n     for, or in connection with, the bringing of the complaint \n     upon which the order was issued.\n       ``(C) If the Secretary finds that a complaint under \n     paragraph (1) is frivolous or has been brought in bad faith, \n     the Secretary may award to the prevailing employer a \n     reasonable attorneys' fee, not exceeding $15,000, to be paid \n     by the complainant.\n       ``(4)(A) If the Secretary has not issued a final decision \n     within 210 days after the filing of the complaint, or within \n     90 days after receiving a written determination, the \n     complainant may bring an action at law or equity for review \n     in the appropriate district court of the United States with \n     jurisdiction, which shall have jurisdiction over such an \n     action without regard to the amount in controversy, and which \n     action shall, at the request of either party to such action, \n     be tried by the court with a jury. The proceedings shall be \n     governed by the same legal burdens of proof specified in \n     paragraph (2)(B).\n       ``(B) In an action brought under subparagraph (A), the \n     court may grant injunctive relief and compensatory damages to \n     the complainant. The court may also grant any other monetary \n     relief to the complainant available at law or equity, not \n     exceeding a total amount of $50,000, including consequential \n     damages, reasonable attorneys and expert witness fees, court \n     costs, and punitive damages.\n       ``(C) If the court finds that an action brought under \n     subparagraph (A) is frivolous or has been brought in bad \n     faith, the court may award to the prevailing employer a \n     reasonable attorneys' fee, not exceeding $15,000, to be paid \n     by the complainant.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I will explain to my colleagues what the \namendment does.\n  Under the bill as offered, it creates, unfortunately, a bounty, so to \nspeak, for alleged whistleblowers up to $250,000 in attorney's fees and \npenalties, which I think, rather than creating a level playing field \nand trying to address the legitimate concern that I happen to agree \nwith, that people who disclose or identify illegal conduct need to be \nprotected against arbitrary termination of their jobs when they are \njust trying to make sure the law is complied with and help contribute \nto the public safety. I think this bill, as currently written, tilts \nthe playing field too far in favor of whistleblower complainants and \nhas the unintended effect of encouraging frivolous and bad-faith \nallegations against employers.\n  So what my amendment would try to do would be to level that playing \nfield while protecting legitimate whistleblowers but not actually \nencouraging people who have, perhaps, engaged in other misconduct and \ngiving them a bounty, so to speak, to sue for under this statute.\n  Under the bill, an alleged whistleblower may file a complaint with \nthe Secretary of Labor, and if the Secretary of Labor fails to act, \nthen with the Federal district court. If the complainant prevails at a \nhearing or action, he or she can receive an unlimited amount of costs \nand expenses, including attorney's fees and expert witness fees. If the \nSecretary finds that the complaint is frivolous or brought in bad \nfaith, the amount the employer can recover is limited to $1,000.\n  Let me make sure my colleagues understand that. If the employee \nprevails in the action, they can recover unlimited damages and costs, \nincluding attorney's fees and expert witness fees. If the Secretary of \nLabor finds at the administrative level that it is frivolous or brought \nin bad faith, the employer can only recover $1,000--obviously an \nunequal playing field and one that will have the unintended impact of \nencouraging bad conduct. If the case goes to district court, the \nemployer cannot recover attorney's fees at all.\n  I submit that the rules ought to be fair for both parties and that \n$1,000 is not a significant deterrent to frivolous and bad-faith suits. \nIf the complaint process is going to have any integrity, there have to \nbe consequences for abusing the process with frivolous and bad-faith \ncomplaints.\n  What is more, the $1,000 limit on attorney's fees in the bill is \ninadequate to compensate an employer for the cost of defending against \na frivolous or bad-faith complaint. An employer who is a target of such \na suit will almost certainly incur more than $1,000 in fees just to \nhave a lawyer review the file, file a brief, and attend a hearing. If \nthe case goes to district court, the attorney's fees will be even \ngreater but will not be recoverable at all under the bill as written.\n  This amendment levels the playing field by capping the costs and fees \nrecoverable for both parties.\n  I might just add that I have to raise the question of whether a \nwhistleblower provision is necessary. We are still researching the \nmatter. Under most State laws, including the law in the State of Texas, \nan employer cannot fire an employee for reporting unlawful conduct. \nThere are already remedies in place under State law, and I have to \nquestion whether it is necessary to create an additional remedy under \nFederal law. Assuming there is, I think we should, I hope, agree that \nthere ought to be a level playing field.\n\n[[Page S1558]]\n\n  My amendment strikes a reasonable balance between the interests of \npunishing retributive employer conduct and of discouraging frivolous \nand bad-faith claims. The amendment punishes wrongdoers and makes \nvictims whole without creating incentives for employees to sue \nemployers for frivolous or harassing reasons.\n  The amendment is fair to complainants, who can recover costs and fees \nwhenever they prevail, as opposed to employers, who can recover only \nwhen the whistleblower complaint is shown to be frivolous or brought in \nbad faith. My amendment fully compensates complainants who prevail. \nComplainants can still get unlimited injunctive and compensatory \nrelief. In other words, they can get their job back and recover backpay \nto be made whole. In addition, complainants can receive consequential \nand punitive damage that are not available to the employer, which is \nwhy the amendment allows complainants to recover up to $50,000 in total \ncosts and fees and consequential and punitive damages, while employers \ncan receive only $15,000 in attorney's fees.\n  I believe this is a reasonable amendment offered in the spirit of \ncompromise, and I hope the other side will take a look at it and agree \nto accept the amendment. If not, I am willing, as I said earlier, to \nagree to some reasonable time agreement so we can debate it further and \nthen have a vote on it.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, before the Senator from Texas leaves, I \nwish to thank him publicly. He has been very constructive in this \nprocess. He has offered a couple of amendments that he feels very \nstrongly about, and we met with him and his staff on them. So I have \ntalked to him about them. He is being very constructive in the process. \nI thank my colleague from Texas.\n  The other thing I noticed, Madam President, is that Senator Collins \nof Maine just walked on the floor. This bill has been called the Pryor-\nStevens bill, but I could not exaggerate the amount of contribution \nSenator Collins has made to this effort as well. I have found her, in \nthe last 5 years, to be a wonderful colleague to work with. She has \nmade this bill better in some very fundamental ways--maybe not very \nexciting ways, but she really focused on one of the major problems we \nhave with the CPSC today, and that is that the CPSC, with all due \nrespect to the people who work there, has been almost incapable of \ndealing with imports in the way they should.\n  Senator Collins, I believe, had four amendments. We accepted all \nfour. We have worked with her office and with her personally to make \nsure the language is right, to make sure the policy is right, to make \nsure it is smart law, which I think it is, and also to make sure it is \na big improvement over the present situation; I don't think anybody can \nlook at her sections of the bill and ever say she is not greatly \nimproving our ability to protect our shores from dangerous and unsafe \nproducts. I am certainly glad she is here this morning to help manage \nthis legislation.\n  The other point I wish to add is, Senator Collins has a lot of \nrespect on both sides of the aisle. The fact that people know she \nworked on the legislation gives a comfort level on both sides of the \naisle, but certainly on the Republican side, because they have seen how \nshe has conducted her business since she has been in the Senate, but \nalso the fact that she has had hearings in her committee on CPSC and \nsome import problems. She has been a key player, a key architect in \nthis legislation. I thank her.\n  I know we are going to have a lot of amendments today and a lot going \non in this Chamber. We are going to try to clear a lot of amendments. \nAgain, I encourage colleagues to come to the floor if they do have \namendments or wish to speak. We are going to try to be in that process \ntoday of clearing amendments, putting a managers' package together, and \nhaving votes.\n  Before the day got crazy and confusing, I wanted to thank Senator \nCollins for her leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for up to 15 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Congratulations to Senator John Mc Cain\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, before I begin my remarks regarding \nthe very difficult situation that has arisen in South America between \nColombia and some of its neighbors, I wish to take a moment this \nmorning to congratulate our colleague and dear friend, Senator John \nMcCain, on his outstanding achievement last night, becoming the nominee \nof the Republican Party for the Presidential election and going forward \nas the nominee of our party for these upcoming elections.\n  Senator McCain is an example of resiliency in his life story but also \nparticularly in this election. I am extremely proud to call him a \nfriend, and I certainly wish him the very best as he goes forward. I \nknow all of us in the Senate take great pride in the fact that he is \ngoing to be the nominee of one of our major parties. I wanted to note \nthat event and give him my best wishes and congratulations on this very \nimportant achievement for him.\n\n\n                      Venezuela-Colombia Conflict\n\n  Madam President, I know many of us in this Chamber, across the \ncountry, and, frankly, across the Western Hemisphere and the world are \nwatching with concern the reports about the situation developing \nbetween Colombia and Ecuador and the complicating elements to it \nbrought on by Venezuela.\n  This past Saturday, Colombia conducted an antiterrorist operation. \nThe Government of Colombia does this on an ongoing basis because \nColombia has been attacked and under siege by a group of people who \nseek the overthrow by violence of that Government. So as they often do, \nthis Saturday, they conducted an operation which required an airplane \nflying within the Colombian airspace to fire into Ecuadorian territory \nby only a few feet. Then Colombian troops entered that area to clean \nout what appeared to be a permanent base camp of the FARC, the \nRevolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia which has ravaged Colombia for \nnow over 25, 30 years as an illegitimate terrorist organization bent on \nkilling, kidnapping, and maiming. The result of that action was the No. \n2 leader of the FARC was killed.\n  The FARC is the oldest, largest, and best equipped insurgency. As a \nresult of the actions of the Colombian military, with assistance and \ntraining from the United States, this insurgency has been lowered in \nits numbers from the times when it was many thousands. Today it is \nbelieved to be between 6,000 and 9,000 strong. It has for decades \naggressively sought to disrupt and destabilize the Colombian \nGovernment. Its stated goal is none other than ``the violent overthrow \nof the Colombian Government.''\n  Let there be no doubt that this is a terrorist organization. They \nkill, they kidnap, they hold innocent people for ransom while funding \nall of its violence by actively engaging in narcotics trafficking. We \nnow have learned they do have other sources of funding, and I will get \nto that in a moment.\n  Just as Hamas and Hezbollah, the FARC operates by using ruthless \nterrorist tactics. According to the State Department's most recent \nReport on Terrorism, the FARC is known to routinely conduct crossborder \noperations. What they do is they will attack in Colombia. They will \nkill. They will throw bombs. They will kidnap in Colombia and then \nretreat conveniently to their borders in friendlier countries, such as \nEcuador and Venezuela. Unfortunately, this new development has emerged \nbecause Ecuador has allowed its border with Colombia to be a sanctuary \nfor the FARC.\n  As we continue to receive updates on this situation, we cannot lose \nsight of the fact that the FARC has repeatedly and violently infringed \non Colombia's efforts at stability and democracy and is operating from \na neighboring country using it as a sanctuary.\n  It is the FARC that has declared war against the Colombian people. It \nis the FARC that has killed and kidnapped thousands of civilians. They \nhave kidnapped teachers, journalists, religious leaders, union members, \nhuman rights activists, members of the Colombian Congress, and \nPresidential candidates.\n  This organization today is known to be holding as many as possibly \n700 hostages. During their reign of terror,\n\n[[Page S1559]]\n\nthey have held at times as many as 100 American citizens. Today, they \nare currently holding three American citizens: Mark Gonsalves, Keith \nStansell, and Thomas Howes. They have been held hostage by the FARC for \nover 5 years, living in subhuman conditions in the jungle, chained to \ntrees. This is the fate of three Americans at the hands of the FARC.\n\n  In December of 2007, the Senate approved a resolution condemning the \nkidnaping of these three United States citizens and demanded their \nimmediate and unconditional release. It is time that these three \nAmericans be released. Their families have suffered long enough. It is \ntime that the FARC be called by the international community to end \ntheir reign of terror.\n  I believe Colombia has had no choice but to continue to confront this \naggression led by the FARC by military means. The antiterrorist strike \nof this past Saturday resulted in the death of Raul Reyes, a well-known \nsenior leader of the FARC--No. 1, maybe No. 2.\n  So who was Raul Reyes? He was a notorious and ruthless criminal who \nhad been long sought by our Government and the Government of Colombia. \nHe is on the FBI's most wanted list. He is on Interpol's most wanted \nlist. Since May of 2007, Reyes has been listed on the U.S. Department \nof the Treasury's foreign narcotics kingpin designation list, and in \nMarch of 2006, Reyes was among 50 FARC members indicted by the \nDepartment of Justice on drug and terrorism charges. So until his \ndeath, he was a fugitive of American justice. He was wanted by the \nColombian Government on more than 100 criminal charges, including more \nthan 50 homicides, and his actions should be condemned by all of us and \nby the international community.\n  Among the items retrieved by Colombia during the antiterrorist \nstrike, among other things, was Reyes's laptop. What a trove of \ninformation it appears to have yielded. I have received copies of some \nof the documents recovered from the laptop, and they show a consistent \npattern of communication and cooperation among Venezuela and the FARC, \namong the Government of Ecuador and the FARC, President Correa sending \npersonal communications and his foreign minister to meet with Mr. \nReyes; this avowed terrorist, this criminal of international justice \nmeeting with a foreign minister, dealing as if he were a head of state.\n  A copy of one letter recovered from a senior leader of the FARC to \nChavez states that ``it is important for his government and the FARC to \nmaintain close ties'' to ensure the success of their efforts. And part \nof the report obtained from these computer files indicates that the \nFARC may have received or was in the process of receiving as much as \n$300 million in financial support from Venezuela.\n  We know that the Government of Venezuela, while its people are \nsuffering shortages of goods, while the people are having to endure \nrationing and lines to get foodstuff for their children, this \nGovernment, now awash in petrodollars, is utilizing its funds, as we \nhave now seen through indictments in the Southern District of Florida, \nto meddle in the elections of other countries by sending cash, and now \nto meddle in the peaceful pursuit of Colombia's democracy by giving \n$300 million to a terrorist organization attempting to overthrow by \nviolence the Government of Colombia.\n  I wish to address the confrontational behavior of Venezuela regarding \nthis situation which happened between Ecuador and Colombia. I am not \nsure what Venezuela's business is in this matter. Venezuela's leader \nHugo Chavez has decided to take an aggressive stance. He has threatened \nColombia with military action and has amassed troops along the \nVenezuela-Colombia border. That is at the complete opposite end of the \ncountry. The Venezuela border has nothing to do with the Ecuador and \nColombia border. He is attempting to divert international attention \nfrom the very embarrassing facts that are being yielded from the \ncomputer files that have been found. He is trying to divert national \nand international attention from the suffering of his own people as a \nresult of his mismanagement of their economy, as a result of his \nmismanagement of the wealth he is obtaining through oil.\n  He has no role in this bilateral matter between Ecuador and Colombia, \nand yet he is attempting to derail any efforts of resolution, including \nthe ongoing negotiations of the Organization of American States. In \nfact, my colleague Senator Dodd clearly stated yesterday that \nVenezuela's ``recent troop buildup in the region is an irresponsible \nand clearly provocative act aimed at inciting further hostility.''\n  It is good to note that the Government of Colombia has used \nrestraint. They have not deployed troops. They have simply been going \nthrough computer files learning the truth about the relationship \nbetween these governments and this illegitimate terrorist group.\n  It is clear that Venezuelans are growing increasingly disenchanted \nwith their Government's unfulfilled promises and Chavez is trying to \nexploit the situation with Colombia and Ecuador to distract the world \nfrom the shortcomings of his Government's policies. This is an old \ntrick, tried and failed repeatedly in Latin America and elsewhere in \nthe world. It is not working and will not work.\n  This January, Chavez began calling for removal of the FARC from the \nterror lists of Canada and the European Union. Chavez has stated that \nthe FARC is not a terrorist group, claiming incomprehensively that they \nare a ``real army.'' he says they are a ``Bolivarian'' army that \nfollows the spirit of the South American liberator Simon Bolivar. \nNothing could be further from the truth. These claims are completely \ndivorced from the reality of what the FARC is and what they represent \nto the Colombian people and to the region.\n  In recent testimony, the Director of National Intelligence Mike \nMcConnell told us that ``. . . since 2005, Venezuela has been a major \ndeparture point for South American--predominantly Colombian--cocaine \ndestined for the United States market and its importance as a \ntransshipment center continues to grow.''\n  It is clear that Venezuela is not a part of the solution; it is a \npart of the regional narcotrafficking problem.\n  Venezuelan ports are increasingly becoming the departure points of \nchoice for Colombian traffickers. According to both the National \nIntelligence Center and Office of National Drug Control Policy, private \naircraft are increasingly choosing to route cocaine shipments from \nVenezuela to the island of Hispanola rather than relying on go-fast \nboats from Colombia because Venezuelan complicity makes it safer to do \nit that way.\n  It is also well known that both trafficking groups and guerrilla \ngroups enjoy safe haven inside Venezuela along the border with \nColombia.\n  Chavez has acknowledged his sympathy and support for the FARC, \ndespite the fact that they are also currently holding upwards of 200 \nVenezuelan nationals as hostages. The Colombian people are well aware \nof the barbaric practices of the FARC, and yet they are resilient \npeople.\n  On February 4, a few weeks ago, millions of Colombians peacefully \ntook to the streets in Colombia to demonstrate against FARC's violence \nand terrorism, demanding ``No more FARC.''\n  Countless others joined similar peaceful demonstrations in the United \nStates and around the world. An example of their resolve in the face of \nruthless FARC violence is Colombia's Foreign Minister, Fernando Araujo. \nI have had the privilege of meeting the Foreign Minister. He has been \nserving his nation capably for now almost a year, after bravely \nenduring 6 years of captivity at the hands of the FARC and surviving a \nmiraculous escape in February of 2007. Minister Araujo is a symbol of \nfreedom and hope for a better future without terrorism.\n  The killing of Raul Reyes is another success of the Colombian \nGovernment's increased efforts to combat terrorism, investigate \nterrorist activities inside and outside Colombia, seize ill-gotten \nassets, and bring terrorists to justice.\n  This operation is a testament to Colombian Armed Forces' \nprofessionalism and competence and a success for the Colombian \nGovernment's efforts to combat terrorism, investigate terrorist \nactivities inside and outside Colombia and to seize assets and to bring \nterrorists to justice.\n  President Uribe is a committed leader and our country will and should \ncontinue to support his mission. This\n\n[[Page S1560]]\n\nPresident was reelected overwhelmingly by his people and today enjoys \nan 80-percent approval rating among the Colombian people.\n  President Bush could not have been clearer yesterday when he stated \nthat:\n\n       America fully supports Colombia's Democracy [and that we \n     will] firmly oppose any acts of aggression that could \n     destabilize the region.\n\n  In the Congress, the best way we can show our support for democracy \nand the need for stability in Colombia is by ensuring the passage of \nthe Colombian Free Trade Agreement.\n  President Uribe has consistently made clear that passage of that \nagreement will show the Colombian people democracy and free enterprise \nwill, in fact, lead to a better life for all Colombians.\n  The Colombian people and President Uribe have made clear their \ncommitment to a hopeful future of a stable democratic and economically \nthriving Western Hemisphere. The FARC is our common enemy, and we owe \nour continued support to Colombia as it carries this shared fight \nagainst terrorists and drug traffickers.\n  The Colombian Ambassador was clear in his comments at the OAS \nyesterday. His country ``has not sent troops to their borders.''\n  He further stated their goal is to resolve this situation with \ncontinued discussion and cooperation.\n  As we are ourselves fighting a global war on terror, we have to \nunderstand terrorism anywhere is terrorism that we need to be against. \nGroups that rely on violence and terror are not acceptable in the world \nin which we live. The FARC's time has come. It is over. It is time for \nus to clear the cobwebs of confusion about this group, to not allow \nChavez to make this group into something other than what they are, a \ngroup of terrorist killers, kidnapping and maiming people for the sake \nof their misguided political aims, which are to destabilize the \ndemocratically elected Government of Colombia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey.) The Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes as in morning business on an issue that is very important to my \nState.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       AIR FORCE TANKER CONTRACT\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for allowing me a \nfew minutes to speak about the tanker contract going to the Airbus-\nNorthrop Grumman consortium. I am still worked up about this; I am \ngoing to be worked up about this for some period of time. This is a big \nimpact contract. I want my colleagues to think for a minute about this, \nabout us subcontracting out the building of our ships, our ships to the \nlowest bidder around the world.\n  If we said: OK. We are going to start building our ships wherever we \ncan get the cheapest hulls for them, do you think we would be building \nthem in the United States?\n  OK. I think other countries or other countries' governments would \nsay: Well, now, here is a good deal. We want to be in shipbuilding, and \nso we are going to subsidize our way into this.\n  Do you not think we probably would end up building these ships in \nother places overseas? What we have taking place in this country is \nAirbus, which is subsidized with aid by European governments, is going \nto build basically these tanker planes and is going to fly them over \nhere and then they are going to be fitted or militarized in this \ncountry. That is what is going to take place.\n  They are going to fly the whole plane over here and then militarize \nit. Now, is this a European plane or is this an American plane? This is \nan Airbus plane. It is going to be Airbus components. It is going to be \nbuilt, it is going to be manufactured, it is going to be done there.\n  I ask my colleagues to think about this. Is this the right thing we \nwant to do? Do we want our tankers and then our AWACS and our ships and \nour submarines, bid them out to the lowest bidder? In this process, my \nguess is we will have a lot built in Asia and South America and Europe \nand subsidized by governments.\n  I do not think this is the way we want to go. So before we move \nforward on this issue, I think we need to ask and have answered several \nquestions. No. 1, what is the economic impact to our Treasury of \noutsourcing our military construction? These jobs are going overseas. \nThat has an impact to our Treasury of the jobs being overseas instead \nof here.\n  Let's have a real, true economic picture of this taking place. I \nthink we ought to have that. No. 1, I think we need to know the direct \nand indirect amount of the subsidization Airbus is giving to this plane \nto be able to get this contract. Because here we have a 40-percent \nbigger plane being produced by Airbus, at a substantially lower price \nthan the Boeing aircraft, and they are not beating us on labor costs. \nThey are certainly not beating us on exchange ratios, given the dollar \nto the Euro ratio.\n  There is no way to do this without heavy subsidization, either direct \nor indirect. You cannot do this without some subsidization. OK. Fine, \nlet's find out what the number is, and then let's start where I guess \nwe are going to have to compete on a subsidy, we compete on \nsubsidization. But I think we need to know that number before we go \nforward with a multidecade, $40 billion contract of made-in-Europe \ntankers.\n  No. 3, I think we need to know our security vulnerability before we \nmake those tankers overseas. I think there is a very real prospect that \nin the future, if we are involved in supporting the Israelis, and \nthe Europeans do not like it, they want to go more with the neighbors \nin the neighborhood, they say: OK, we are not going to give America \nflyover rights over Europe, and also we are not going to sell them \nspare parts on these tankers. I think we need know what the security \nvulnerability is before we go forward with this as well, and that needs \nto be appraised.\n\n  Finally, I would urge and we are starting to look at ``Buy American'' \nprovisions in our military contracts. I am a free-trade person, but I \nthink you ought to compete on an equitable playing ground, and that if \nthey are going to subsidize, then we have to subsidize if they are; \notherwise, we force them not to subsidize.\n  Also, on defense, we should not be dependent upon foreign governments \nfor our Defense bill's military construction, particularly when they \ndepend upon us for a lot of the security, and then they get the big \ncontract to build the equipment.\n  I do not think this is fair at all. I do not think it is the right \nway for us to go. I think we have several vulnerabilities. I think if \nyou look at a full economic picture of shooting these jobs overseas, of \nwhat that does to our Treasury versus buying a cheaper, subsidized \nEuropean plane versus buying an American plane, where you are having \nyour full costs, but your workers are here and they are paying taxes \nhere, my guess is to the Federal Treasury it is a net positive for us \nto build them here, even if the plane costs us a bit more because we do \nnot subsidize the price of the plane such as the Europeans are.\n  I have been in this fight previously on civil aviation, where the \nEuropeans subsidized their way into that business. Now they are doing \nit in the military contract area. I do not think we ought to do it, \nparticularly on a contract that is going to last decades.\n  So these are several questions we are going to be working on along \nwith my other colleagues. I would hope we ask these big questions and \nget them answered before this big contract is let.\n  Are we are starting to build our defense industry in Europe rather \nthan in the United States? I wish to thank my colleagues for allowing \nme to speak on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR.

Mr. President, as a member of the Commerce Committee, \nI appreciate the leadership of Senator Pryor on this bill and the work \nall of us did, as well as Senator Durbin and Senator Nelson. I believe \nthis is landmark legislation. I have been to this floor many times to \ntalk about this bill, how important it is to have that Federal \nmandatory lead standard, as well as the recall provision our office was \ninstrumental in writing.\n  I think it is a very good bill. There is one change that I think \nwould make it even better. This is an amendment Senator Menendez and I \nhave.\n  The Consumer Product Safety Commission Reform Act is not just about \nincreasing staffing, funding, and oversight of the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission, it is also about making the Commission more \naccountable to the public.\n  The Commission must make consumer safety an absolute priority. But it \nmust also perform its duty outside the influence of the people whom it \nis supposed to regulate, outside the influence of the manufacturers, \nthe retailers, the lobbyists, and the lawyers.\n  In November 2007, however, an appalling picture of the CPSC came to \nlight. What you have to understand is when we found out about this \ntravel, hundreds of trips and thousands of dollars of travel that had \nbeen paid for by the industry that this Commission was supposed to \nregulate, we were in the midst of this bill, we were in the midst of \nlooking at recalls, now up to 29 million toys that have been recalled.\n  We were in the midst of finding out about kids who went into a coma \nfrom swallowing an Aqua Dot that turned out was laced with the date \nrape drug. That is what we were doing when we found out that for years \nthe head of the Consumer Product Safety Commission had been traveling \non the consumer dime, on the dime of the industries they are supposed \nto be regulating.\n  Through an article in the Washington Post, we learned that thousands \nof dollars' worth of travel had been taken by the current Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission Chairwoman Nord and her predecessor, Hal \nStratton.\n  Since 2002, Chairwoman Nord and former Chairman Stratton took 30 \ntrips--30 trips--on the trade associations', manufacturers', lobbyists' \nor lawyers' dime, totaling nearly $60,000. So that is 30 trips \ntotalling nearly $60,000.\n  In one particularly egregious instance, the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission Chairman accepted $11,000 from the fireworks industry for a \n10-day trip to China. The claim was the industry had no pending \nregulatory requests but had a safety standard proposal before the \nCommission. Now, you try to tell this to the moms whom we were with \nyesterday, of those kids who were swallowing toys, one that was laced \nwith lead and one had morphed into the date rape drug. You tell them \nthey had the proposals before them--and they were not pending \nregulatory requests but they were proposals pending--they would see \nthrough this.\n  This kind of abusive Government practice must end. With this \namendment, the amendment that Senator Menendez and I have offered, no \nCommissioner or employee of the Consumer Product Safety Commission can \naccept payment or reimbursement for travel or lodging from any entity \nwith interests in their regulations. So it simply means people and the \ncompanies the Consumer Product Safety Commission is regulating cannot \npay for their trips to China or their trips to Florida or to \nCalifornia. It is that simple.\n  Now, what is interesting about this is that many agencies, including \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission, the Food and Drug \nAdministration, the Federal Communications Commission, and the Federal \nTrade Commission, have similar rules restricting industry-sponsored \ntravel. CPSC doesn't have that rule. As the Senate considers this \nsweeping reform in consumer product safety, we believe we should be \nfree of any appearance of impropriety or undo influence of regulated \nindustries on the CPSC.\n  Senator Menendez has a bill, a very good bill--and I am a cosponsor; \nmany people are cosponsors--that extends this to all agencies. And I \nhope very much the Senate will consider this bill very soon. I am so \npleased we are working together on this amendment, which is focused on \nthe Consumer Product Safety Commission. Leaving the Commission \nvulnerable to charges of impropriety is simply unacceptable, especially \nat a time when the public has completely lost faith in the CPSC's \nability to regulate the industries they are supposed to be watching.\n  Ethics is at the core of government and democracy. Without ethical \nleaders, our entire system fails. Ethics is woven into the very fabric \nof how government works, and ethics reform goes to the very heart of \nour democracy, to the public trust and respect that is essential to the \nhealth of our Constitution.\n  Like you, Mr. President, I came to Washington to bring ethical \ngovernment back to the city, and I am so proud that shortly after we \njoined the Senate, the most sweeping ethics reform legislation since \nWatergate passed the Senate and became law. But as seen by the actions \nof the Consumer Product Safety Commission, our job does not stop with \none law. We must be resolute that ethical government is not optional, \nit is not voluntary, and it is not limited to elected officials.\n  With this amendment, we will send a signal to the Commission that \ntheir priority is keeping consumers safe. Their priority is not going \non trips financed by the people they are supposed to regulate. Their \npriority is looking out for those two kids who almost died from those \ntoys, or the family of little Jarnell Brown, that is still watching \nwhat is happening here today--this little 4-year-old boy who died when \nhe swallowed a charm that was 99 percent lead. That is their job, not \ngoing on trips paid for by the fireworks industry.\n  It is my hope that my colleagues will support a travel ban amendment \nto the Consumer Product Safety Reform Act of 2008. I am very pleased to \nbe sponsoring this amendment with my colleague from New Jersey, Senator \nMenendez.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I am proud to stand here with the \ndistinguished Senator from Minnesota to offer an amendment that \nprohibits members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission from taking \ntrips paid for by the industries they regulate.\n  Not long ago, this body overwhelmingly voted to prohibit Members of \nCongress--Members of this body--from taking trips sponsored by \nlobbyists--\n\n[[Page S1562]]\n\nfrom taking trips sponsored by lobbyists. That is what there was an \noverwhelming bipartisan vote for. There is absolutely no reason members \nof the Consumer Product Safety Commission should not be held to the \nsame high standard, particularly given the outstanding number of \nproducts that were recalled last year because they were deemed unsafe \nfor American consumers to use after they were placed on the shelves in \nour stores, bought by our families, and used by our children.\n  Perhaps most disturbing, the most common victims of these regulatory \nfailures were children--children who played with toys and slept in \ncribs that the Consumer Product Safety Commission allowed to come to \nmarket, children who were seriously injured as a result.\n  Last year, we saw a toxic toy shipped in from China laced with lead \npaint that could cause permanent neurological damage or death. We saw \ncar seats dump out the kids who sat in them. We saw beads that \ncontained a chemical that could put children into a coma if swallowed. \nWe saw cribs that would fall apart if an infant pulled on their pieces.\n  This year is shaping up to be just as tragic. In January, there was a \nrecall of toys with magnets that could cause fatal intestinal blockages \nif swallowed. Last month, we had a scare about children's sketchbooks \ncoated with potentially fatal levels of lead paint.\n  So the question Americans are asking themselves is, isn't somebody \nsupposed to be watching to make sure this doesn't happen? And the \nanswer is, absolutely. That is the very mission of the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission, to make sure products sold in the United States are \nsafe for American consumers, safe for our families. But members of the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission were busy doing other things.\n  There are a lot of problems plaguing the Commission, and I will \nreturn to the floor to talk in detail about many of them another time. \nI certainly appreciate the work that has been done by the distinguished \nchair of the committee and the ranking member in moving a bill that I \nthink goes a very long way towards achieving the goals of knowing that \nin America our families will be safe from the products that are put on \nour shelves, and for this I commend them. However, despite the progress \nwe have made under the leadership of Senator Pryor, there are still \nissues to be resolved. Most notably, we see that officials of the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission, tasked with protecting American \nconsumers, were too busy taking trips sponsored by the very companies \nthey were supposed to keep an eye on.\n  Mr. President, we should never again have to worry that our children \nare playing with lead-filled toys while the people who should be \nlooking out for them are hopscotching around the world with corporate \nbigwigs. This is toxic travel, and we have to put an end to it. The \nAmerican people deserve to have objective, professional safety \ninspectors, not wined and dined, pampered corporate houseguests. We \nneed to make sure these product gatekeepers are looking out for one \ninterest, and one interest only: the well-being of the American people.\n  That is why Senator Klobuchar and I are offering this amendment: to \nprohibit product regulators from taking trips sponsored by the industry \nthey regulate. I think Americans listening across the landscape of our \ncountry would say that is just common sense. Regulators should never be \nindebted to those they regulate. They should never be compelled to let \na product slip by as thanks to the great golfing they shared or the \nfabulous trip they took, while children suffer as a result.\n  So let me close by thanking my colleague, Senator Klobuchar, a member \nof the committee, for taking the lead in the committee to improve the \nsafety of the products that end up in the hands of our children. It has \nbeen a privilege to work with her on this amendment. And I certainly \nhope our colleagues will join us in saying, as they did in setting the \nhigh standard for every Member of the Senate in prohibiting travel paid \nfor by lobbyists, that those who are there to protect the very essence \nof our safety and our lives and those of our families should live to no \nless a standard.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, let me begin by commending the Senators \nfrom Minnesota and New Jersey for bringing forward this amendment. Many \nof us, I think all of us, were troubled by the press reports last fall \nthat suggested that the current and previous Chairman of the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission accepted reimbursement from entities that \nthey were regulating when they were traveling. For example, trade \nassociations, manufacturers of products, and other entities paid for \ntrips that totaled nearly $60,000.\n  The Klobuchar-Menendez amendment is intended to make clear that \ntaxpayer money should be used for that travel in order to remove the \nappearance of a conflict of interest that arises when the members of \nthe Commission receive reimbursement for travel from regulated \nentities.\n  I do want to make clear that the Commission's ethics officers \nreviewed these trips and found that there was no conflict of interest. \nBut the fact is, there is an appearance of a conflict of interest. \nReceiving reimbursement from regulated entities creates the appearance \nthat the decisions that are subsequently made by the Commission members \nmay be tainted by a conflict of interest. The fact is, this kind of \nappearance of a conflict of interest shakes the consumers' confidence \nin the impartiality of decisions that are made by regulatory agencies.\n  Now, I do want to emphasize that these trips may well have been \njustified. Governmental officials cannot and should not make all of \ntheir decisions within the confines of their offices. They can learn a \nlot about the issues by taking official travel, by going out into the \nfield, by reviewing a manufacturer's procedures, by traveling to a \nport, by undertaking completely legitimate travel. But at least the \nappearance, and in some cases an actual conflict of interest, arises \nwhen this travel is subsidized or paid for totally by the regulated \nentity. So I view this as a good government amendment, an amendment \nthat will help to restore the confidence of consumers, of the public, \nin the regulatory process.\n  I also want to make clear to some of my colleagues, particularly on \nmy side of the aisle, that the amendment put forth by the two Senators \ndoes not increase the budget of the Consumer Product Safety Commission \nbeyond the amounts authorized in the underlying bill. Instead, what \ntheir amendment would say is that up to $1.2 million of the budget of \nthe amount appropriated can be used for the Commissioners' travel in \nlieu of the Commissioners' accepting payment or reimbursement for \ntravel from any person or entity that is seeking official action from, \ndoing business with, conducting activities regulated by, or whose \ninterests may be substantially affected by decisions made by the \nCommission.\n  This is a commonsense amendment. It will advance the public's \nconfidence in the decisions that are made by this important regulatory \nCommission. It is very much in keeping with the bill that we put forth, \nand I believe we will be able to work out something on this amendment \nlater in the day.\n  I do want to point out to my friends on the other side of the aisle \nthat there is also an amendment pending by the Senator from Texas, and \nI believe it is the managers' intent to try to package a series of \namendments at the same time. But for my part, I think this amendment \nmakes a great deal of sense, and I commend the two Senators for \nbringing it forward.\n  Mr. President, let me also take this opportunity to thank the manager \nand author of the bill, Senator Pryor, for his thoughtful comments \nearlier this morning about my contributions to the bill. It has been a \ngreat pleasure to work with Senator Pryor on this bill. We have worked \ntogether on a host of issues, and I commend him for his leadership in \nhelping to ensure that the toys and other consumer products that reach \nour store shelves are as safe as they can be. In particular, his \ncommitment to making sure the children of America are receiving safe \nproducts is commendable.\n  So I thank him for his kind words, and it has been an honor to work \nwith him on this bill.\n\n[[Page S1563]]\n\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Fiscal Security\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to discuss my concerns with the \nfiscal security of our country. This week we are considering the fiscal \nyear 2009 congressional budget resolution in the Budget Committee. As \nstewards of the public trust, the Congress needs to make hard choices \nnecessary to leave a fiscally and economically sound country to our \nchildren and grandchildren. Unfortunately, the easy road is where we \nhave already trod. The budget we will be working on today is another \nslip of paper in a trail leading this country to financial ruin. We \nsimply cannot sustain the current level of spending which is spiraling \nout of control. I know that crafting an annual budget is a difficult \ntask, but it is important. This document is a vital part of the \noperation of Congress. It sets a fiscal blueprint that Congress will \nfollow for the year and establishes procedural hurdles when these \nguidelines are ignored. As stewards of the public trust, we owe to it \nall American taxpayers to use the funds they provide us in the most \neffective and efficient means possible. If we do that, we provide \nfuture generations with a strong and secure U.S. economy. If we don't, \nthen the children of America's future will be waking up to something \nvery unpleasant.\n  As an accountant, I particularly enjoy this opportunity to look at \nthe overall spending priorities of our Nation. Fiscal year 2009 will be \nanother tight year for spending. It will not be good enough to have \nanother pass-the-buck Democratic budget like the one we saw last year, \nwhich I did not support. If we consider another budget this year that \nis tax and spend, more and more taxes to pay for more and more \nspending, I will vote against it again. We must begin this year's \ndebate on a fiscal year 2009 congressional budget resolution with a \nclear understanding of our responsibilities. We cannot accept a repeat \nof last year's empty promises, of reducing the debt and reforming \nentitlements.\n  What actually happened is disgraceful. Last year's budget raised \ntaxes $736 billion, the largest tax increase ever, hitting 116 million \npeople. If we follow this year's proposed budget, many of our \nconstituents will have to dig into their pockets starting in 2011 and \nfind an additional $2,000 to pay Uncle Sam on top of what they pay in \ntaxes now. That ought to be a wake-up call. I travel around Wyoming \nmost weekends. I can easily take a poll of my constituents. I am not \nrunning into anybody who thinks they are paying too little in taxes. If \nthey think their taxes are going to go up, knowing that the Federal \nGovernment is receiving more in revenues than it ever has in the \nhistory of the United States, they are upset. So looking at a $736 \nbillion tax increase will upset them. We are going to be discussing \nthis as it gets closer and closer to April 15. That is the day they are \nparticularly cognizant of what they are paying in taxes.\n  Last year's budget increased spending by $205 billion. Last year's \nbudget grew our national debt by $2.5 trillion. Last year's budget \nignored entitlement reform. There was no attempt to tackle the $66 \ntrillion in unsustainable long-term entitlement obligations that face \nus. Well, not us; it is our children and grandchildren. But we will be \nthe beneficiaries of that. That is not fair. Americans want to know \nwhat we can do to help them, not hurt them. Empty promises can no \nlonger be made.\n  I want to highlight a recent editorial from the Wall Street Journal \nthat talks about spending promises being made right now. I ask \nunanimous consent that the editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Government Showdown\n\n                       (By Kimberley A. Strassel)\n\n       Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama were midway through a \n     joint ode to big government in their last debate when a \n     disbelieving Wolf Blitzer interrupted. Were they both really \n     going into a general election proposing ``tax increases on \n     millions of Americans,'' inviting the charge of tax-and-spend \n     liberals?\n       ``I'm not bashful about it,'' said Mr. Obama. ``Absolutely, \n     absolutely,'' chimed in Mrs. Clinton.\n       In the middle of an election that is supposed to be about \n     ``change,'' the country is instead being treated to the most \n     old-fashioned of economic debates. The fun of it is that \n     neither side is being shy about where it stands, which has \n     only sharpened the old choice: higher taxes and bigger \n     government, or more economic freedom and reform. With health \n     care, entitlements and education all on the agenda, the \n     stakes are huge.\n       We don't have a Democratic nominee yet, but in terms of \n     this battle it matters little. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama \n     both dropped major economic addresses this week, and their \n     most distinguishing feature was that they were nearly \n     indistinguishable. Just ask Mrs. Clinton, whose campaign \n     complained that Mr. Obama had copied her best ideas (even as \n     it simultaneously complained he offered no ``solutions''--go \n     figure).\n       Republican frontrunner John McCain certainly sees no \n     differences, and his frontrunner status has allowed him to \n     begin training his economic guns on the Clintbama approach. \n     The battle lines are, as a result, already taking shape.\n       This is going to be an old-fashioned fight over taxes. \n     Whatever they may have said on CNN, Mr. Obama and Mrs. \n     Clinton aren't fool-hardy enough to embrace wholesale tax \n     hikes. Like John Kerry and congressional Democrats before \n     them, both are instead proposing raising taxes on only ``the \n     rich.'' Both campaigns made an early bet that the \n     Republicans'' broad tax-cutting message had gone stale, and \n     that Americans were frustrated enough with rising healthcare \n     and education costs that they'd embrace redistributionist tax \n     policies.\n       Maybe. But the economic landscape has changed from last \n     year and even frustrated Americans have grown jittery of tax-\n     hike talk. Mr. Obama has already shifted, and started placing \n     more emphasis on his promise to return some of his tax-hike \n     booty to ``middle-class'' Americans via tax credits. Both \n     Democrats are already justifying their hikes by pointing out \n     that Mr. McCain voted against the Bush tax cuts in the past.\n       Mr. McCain's challenge--which he's already embraced--is to \n     keep the tax focus on the future. His campaign is going to \n     play off polls that show the majority of Americans are still \n     convinced that political promises to soak the rich translate \n     into higher taxes for all. He will use gobs of other proposed \n     Democratic tax * * * Grand Canyon proportions. Democrats have \n     presented themselves as the party of fiscal responsibility of \n     late, a message that contrasted well with spendthrift \n     Republicans in the 2006 elections. The Democratic \n     presidential candidates will struggle to make that case, \n     given both are inching toward the $900-billion-in-proposed-\n     new-spending mark.\n       Mr. Obama's wish list for just one term? Some $260 billion \n     over four years for health care. Another $60 billion for an \n     energy plan. A further $340 billion for his tax plan. A $14 \n     billion national service plan. A $72 billion education \n     package. Also, $25 billion in foreign assistance funding, $2 \n     billion for Iraqi refugees and $1.5 billion for paid-leave \n     systems. (I surely forgot some.) Mr. Obama says he'll pay for \n     these treasures by stopping the Iraq war and taxing the rich. \n     But both Democrats have already spent the tax hikes several \n     times over, and even a Ph.D, would struggle with this math.\n       Making a message of fiscal responsibility harder is Mr. \n     McCain's reputation as a fiscal tightwad, and his role as one \n     of the fiercest critics of his own party's spending blowout. \n     Watch him also expand this debate to earmarks, as he's \n     already done with an ad ripping into Mrs. Clinton for her $1 \n     million request for a Woodstock museum. Mr. McCain's earmark \n     requests last year? $0.\n       Mr. Obama's and Mrs. Clinton's economic speeches this week \n     were noteworthy for sweeping government initiatives, straight \n     out of FDR-land. Both propose a federally backed \n     ``infrastructure bank'' that would finance projects with \n     subsidies, loan guarantees and bonds. Both are vowing to \n     ``create'' five million ``green-collar'' jobs in the \n     environmental sector. These are in addition to giving \n     government a huge new health-care role.\n       This is the area where Mr. McCain has the most work to do \n     in drawing distinctions. He is already hitting both Democrats \n     for their desire for ``bigger government.'' But the \n     Arizonan's challenge will be explaining to voters why more \n     government-run health care is bad for their pocketbook, why \n     school choice will do more than more education dollars. \n     Further, he's going to have to work through his own hit-and-\n     miss instincts, which in the past have led him toward big \n     government initiatives like a climate-change program.\n       This will be an old-fashioned debate about the role of \n     business in America, whether it will be a federal cash cow \n     and punching bag, or its tax rates lowered so it can compete \n     with the rest of the globe. This will be an old-fashioned \n     debate about trade, which will, with any luck, finally \n     explore the vagaries of\n\n[[Page S1564]]\n\n     the growing ``fair trade'' movement. This will be an old-\n     fashioned debate about the minimum wage, and its ability to \n     kill jobs.\n       None of this is to say this economic battle won't encompass \n     ``change.'' If a Democrat wins the general election, things \n     will certainly look different, starting with your tax bill. \n     And if * * *\n\n  Mr. ENZI. The majority should be held responsible for its actions. We \nneed to prepare a budget for our Nation that reduces national debt, \npromotes honest budgeting, and encourages true economic growth by \nreducing energy costs, reducing taxes, and reducing health care costs. \nI do believe that the first priority of any nation must be the health \nof its people. Every American should have access to high quality health \ncare at affordable prices, and Congress must work with State \ngovernments and the private sector to achieve that goal. One way \nCongress can curtail this rapid rise in health care costs is to use \nhealth information technology as a cost-saving measure. I hope we can \nwork across party lines to enact health IT legislation this year and to \naid in addressing the fiscal challenges associated with spiraling costs \nand unacceptable levels of medical errors.\n  I wonder if the American people realize that when the baby boomers \nare fully retired and receiving benefits, the cost of supporting that \ngeneration through Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security will be so high \nwe will have no money available for our Federal Government to do \nanything else. We will have no money for national defense, no money for \neducation, no money for transportation infrastructure, not to mention a \nwhole bunch of other things we are intricately expecting. That is \nunacceptable. Our country's future cannot sustain the cost.\n  This year, again, the President's budget proposes to reduce the rate \nof growth in one of our most expensive entitlements, which is Medicare. \nThe President has sent a legislative proposal to Congress to meet the \nrequirements laid out in the Medicare Modernization Act passed in 2003, \nthus providing more funding for the general fund that pays for other \ngovernment programs such as defense, education, and infrastructure. \nWhat reception did it get from our friends in the majority? \nUnfortunately, we have heard that the proposal sent by the \nadministration is dead on arrival and the administration has trumped up \na phony crisis in Medicare. A phony crisis? There is nothing phony \nabout it. We are standing at the edge of a tsunami as the huge baby \nboomer generation, my generation, reaches Medicare and Social Security \neligibility.\n  The President's Medicare proposal is a good starting point; $34 \ntrillion of unfunded liability is certainly not a phony crisis in \nMedicare. We must address this serious funding constraint head on.\n  Last year the majority also promised to abide by pay-go rules and \nactually pay for all the new spending to get America on the right track \neconomically. As far as I can see, this has not happened. In fact, pay-\ngo enforcement rules have been so weakened and thwarted through a \nvariety of different mechanisms and smoke and mirrors that we ended up \nwith billions and billions in new spending that is not offset. It is \ntime to bite the bullet. We need to limit increases in discretionary \nspending by Federal Government agencies. This is necessary while we are \nalso taking extreme care to keep our Nation safe and secure. I \nreiterate that we must take seriously the warnings we have heard from \nthe General Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget Office about \nFederal expenditures spiraling out of control. We need to make the \nbudget procedural and process changes to directly address this problem.\n  One of the many procedural reforms I believe would promote fiscal \nresponsibility and safeguard the Nation's economic health is a 2-year \nbudget process. In fact, in his budget for fiscal year 2009, the \nPresident once again proposed commonsense budget reforms to restrain \nspending. He has several recommendations, including earmark reforms and \nthe adoption of a 2-year budget for all executive branch agencies in \norder to give Congress more time for program review. While we may \nnegotiate on the details, we should implement these overall \nrecommendations. The budget process takes up a considerable amount of \ntime each year and is drenched in partisan politics while other \nimportant issues are put on the back burner. It should not be this way. \nThe current Federal system, frankly, is broken. No, it is smashed. It \nis in shambles. We only have to look at the mammoth spending bills that \nnobody has time to fully read or understand before they are glibly \npassed into law and the hammer comes down on another nail in the coffin \nof good budgeting.\n  Last year's omnibus appropriations bill is Exhibit A in my \nprosecution of a system that promotes fiscal recklessness. It is a \nserious problem that must be fixed. The current budget and \nappropriations system lends itself to spending indulgences this country \ncannot afford. It should be scrapped for a system that is a proven \nwinner.\n  To divert slightly and remind us of some of what happened last year \nas we were going through the process, we passed authorization bills \naround here which are supposed to set the grand parameters for what we \nare doing. One of those grand parameters involved the AIDS bill, passed \nunanimously through this body and through the other body and signed by \nthe President. We set up a formula for AIDS help. That formula said the \nmoney will follow the patient. Good concept, good enough for everybody \nto agree it was the way to go. Then last year we had to vote on a $6 \nmillion proposal for San Francisco that stole money from 42 other \ncities in large amounts and smaller amounts from many other cities. We \ndefeated that because we had set up a formula through authorization. \nBut when the final omnibus bill came out, it had that same $6 million \nwith the same theft put in it. We didn't have an opportunity then \nbecause $6 million out of $767 billion is not enough to worry about \nvoting on, I guess. And we don't vote on it. But it still wound up in \nthere.\n  We need to do something with our system of budgeting, and we need to \ndo something about earmarks as well. There is a crucial need to enact \nprocedural and process changes that will enable us to get this country \non the right budgetary track. We simply cannot risk the economic \nstability of future generations by continuing to get by with the status \nquo. The risks are far too great.\n  Make no mistake: A change to a new budget process will not be easy. \nThere are very strong feelings on both sides of this issue. But as \nresponsible legislators, we need to come together to begin the \ndifficult but necessary process of change. I, for one, intend to \ncontinue to work with my colleagues who are also committed to make the \nhard choices to safeguard our economic and fiscal future.\n\n  A nation that cannot pay its bills is a nation that is in trouble. If \nit is a repeat of last year, the fiscal year 2009 congressional budget \nresolution could mortgage the future of our children and grandchildren \nand require huge tax increases for all Americans. I welcome the \nopportunity to consider our Nation's spending priorities, keeping in \nmind we need to make tough choices and sacrifices in order to keep our \ncountry strong and healthy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I would like to talk about a provision in \nthe Consumer Product Safety Commission Reform Act that deals with a \ndatabase to make sure information about dangerous products is available \nto the public.\n  Here again, this has changed through the process. We have tried to \nbuild in safeguards. I want to talk about those. We have tried to find \nsomething that is balanced, that provides information, but also has \nsome filtering so we make sure erroneous information is not \ndisseminated. But the goal of this provision is that the public has the \nright to know when products are dangerous.\n  We have many examples--and I will go through some of these right now. \nBut I promise you, for every one example I am going to give, there are \nprobably 100 others I could talk about--we have many examples of \ndangerous products that are being sold and used while the company and \nthe CPSC know of the risks of the product. But because of the inability \nfor CPSC to get a mandatory recall or the inability of them to work out \nthe terms with the manufacturer in many cases, the public does\n\n[[Page S1565]]\n\nnot know about these dangerous products. So what happens is that the \nproduct continues to be sold and continues to be used when the \nGovernment and the manufacturer know it is a dangerous product.\n  Let me start with this one statement. This is from OMB Watch. It \nsays: ``CPSC estimates the number of toy-related injuries''--just toy-\nrelated injuries--``jumped from about 130,000 in 1996 to about 220,000 \nin 2006--more than 600 injuries every day.''\n  Now, this is over a 10-year period: to go from 130,000 injuries--we \nare not talking about incidents; we are talking about injuries--130,000 \nin 1996 to 220,000 in 2006. We are not talking about isolated incidents \nwhere there might be the occasional toy or the occasional product that \nmight cause a problem. We are talking about 600 injuries every day--600 \ninjuries, not incidents--to children. This is just in toys. This \nstatistic is just for toys. So, again, we are not talking about things \nthat are in isolation that do not matter in the real world. This bill \nmatters in the real world.\n  The next chart I wanted to show you is the recall process. This is a \nflow chart about recalls. My colleagues can see how complicated and how \nlong and how many steps there are in the recall process. Listen, it is \nnot that important about what each and every step is. But this is how \nit works. You can see, for a product to be recalled, there are a lot of \nhoops that have to be jumped through. Those hoops take time.\n  There again, as I mentioned just a moment ago, we know of many \ninstances. I will give you one right here. There was a product called \nStand & Seal, which was a product that, apparently, you spray on tile \nto seal the tile. That product was dangerous, was actually killing \npeople, and definitely injuring people. The company knew about it, the \nCPSC knew about it, but the public did not know about it.\n  What happened was, in the one incident I am most familiar with--\nagain, there are many others--in the one incident I am most familiar \nwith, Home Depot continued to sell this product not knowing that it was \na dangerous product, not knowing it was injuring people, not knowing it \nviolated U.S. safety standards. They were selling it to the public.\n  Well, at the end of the process, guess what happens. Home Depot gets \nsued. They get sued for selling a product for which they had no \nknowledge of the problem. The CPSC knew, the Government agency knew \nabout the problem, but the general public did not. The retailer did not \nknow. So part of the reason we get into that situation is because of \nthis long recall process.\n  Now, we are going to address a lot of this in the legislation. We are \ngoing to give the CPSC the ability to move through this process much \nquicker. We are going to give them the leverage they need to make \ndecisions. Right now, the manufacturers, unfortunately, in many \ninstances, have the leverage, not the CPSC. So we are going to try to \naddress some of this.\n  But that is not even what I am talking about because I want to talk \nabout the database. The database provision that is in the legislation, \nwe believe, is a very important provision. It is very balanced. We have \ntried to find that right balance.\n  Let me, if I can, talk about one specific toy which has actually \nreceived a lot of attention nationally because of some of the egregious \ninjuries and the serious problems. This is a toy made by Rose Art, \nwhich is a company that makes a lot of toys and crayons and art \nsupplies and lots of other things--a lot of craft kinds of stuff. Rose \nArt makes a toy called Magnetix. This is the ``Xtreme Combo Flashing \nLights Castle.'' Well, you can understand why this would have a lot of \nappeal to parents and children. Just look at the box. It looks like \nsomething that would be fun to play with.\n\n  If you can notice on this picture, there are these little silver \ndots, these little silver balls. Those are magnets. That is how you put \nthis together. You can see right here in the picture, in someone's \nhand, that little dot. I hope it shows up on television for the folks \nwatching around the country. That is one of those little dots.\n  The problem with these little magnets is they fall off. They can come \nloose. In 2007, over 1,500 incidents were reported before the 4 million \nunits of Magnetix were recalled. So we have 1,500 examples of these \neither falling off or, in some cases, children swallowing pieces with \nthe magnet still attached. The reported incidents included 28 injuries \nand 1 death.\n  I do not want to go into the details of this on the Senate floor, but \nthe medical issues that children have to go through when they ingest \none of these is not pretty. Again, I do not want to go through that on \nthe Senate floor and turn this debate into a gory example. But, \nnonetheless, trust me when I say these toys, this Magnetix set--there \nare many varieties--has caused a lot of hardships for parents and \nchildren.\n  But what do kids like to do? They like to put things in their mouths. \nThey eat things. They suck on things. We know how it is. But this is \nwhy we need a database so that people can know what is going on out \nthere. We have 4 million units of this toy that were eventually \nrecalled, but there were over 1,500 incidents reported before the \nrecall. That is 1,500 incidents where parents and grandparents, et \ncetera--day care centers--had no way of knowing this was a dangerous \nproduct. So the database solves that problem.\n  Again, this is just a chart to run through the timetable. We do not \nhave to spend a lot of time on the details. But in 2003, Rose Art \nintroduced these building sets. They were very popular. By the way, \nthey were on lists for a couple of holiday seasons about the best toy \nfor kids, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. The retailers loved them \nbecause they just flew off the shelves.\n  We could go through this long process, but you can see the first \nattempted recall was in March of 2006. That is almost 3 years later. \nThey later had to do another recall, a more comprehensive, clearer \nrecall. They did that in mid-2007. So these were on the shelves for a \nlong time. But I am telling you right now, the parents have no way of \nknowing these are dangerous until the CPSC does their recall.\n  One of the things I want my colleagues to understand is that, again, \nthis is not an isolated incident. We mentioned Magnetix. We are not \ntrying to pick on Rose Art. We are just reporting the facts as they \nexist. But here is Magnetix shown on the chart. There were 1,500 \nincidents before it was recalled, before the public knew of the \nproblem.\n  Again, we are not going to go through this, but you can see this next \nparticular product had 679 incidents, this one had 400, this one 278, \nand on down the line.\n  My fellow Senators, we could print 10 or 20 or 30 of these charts and \ngo down the numbers. You can see the different types of hazards we are \ntalking about. I am telling you, the evidence is overwhelming that in \nthe legislation we need to fix the CPSC.\n  So what is the best way for the public to know? Well, I would say the \nbest way for the public to know is to inform the public, give the \npublic some information, let them look at it. I must be candid right \nnow to say we have had a few people--not all. I want to be fair. Not \nall, but a few people--a few companies in the business community, a few \nassociations that have been opposed to this database idea. They think \nit will create a hardship. They think it will smear companies. They are \nconcerned about the uncontrolled nature of that.\n  Well, we keep pointing them to the NHTSA Web site. What we are \nproposing is not novel. It is not new. It is tested. We have seen it in \naction for years, and that is the NHTSA Web site, the National Highway \nTransportation Safety Administration Web site. It looks like \nsafercar.gov might be at least one of the ways to get there. But this \nis actually a copy of the NHTSA Web site.\n  When you go to safercar.gov or nhtsa.gov, I guess, you can come up \nwith this page. You can see, it has ``Defects & Recalls.'' You can \nclick on this and find out about the defects and recalls.\n  Let me walk the Senate through this, if I may, for just 1 minute. \nHere again, you click on something; you go to this page, you click on \n``Search Complaints.'' Here again, we are talking about complaints from \nconsumers and from third parties such as hospitals, day care centers, \net cetera, who can put their information on a Web site. You put your \ninformation on the Web\n\n[[Page S1566]]\n\nsite. If you are a parent or grandparent or day care center operator, \nand you are searching on a Web site, you would come to a place like \nthis one or two or three screens later--and it is probably a little bit \nhard to tell on television, but right here it says ``To use the `Drill \nDown' search method'':\n  What they do is walk you through these tabs--1, 2, 3, 4, 5 steps--and \nyou put in information about the product that you are curious about. \nWhat happens is, you go through these steps. I did it yesterday in my \noffice. I am going to tell you, you can look up a product in about 1 \nminute. It just takes that long. It is easy to use. It is very user \nfriendly.\n  NHTSA has been doing this for years and years. This is the kind of \nthing, we would hope, when this legislation passes, that the CPSC would \nset up. It could be very useful for people all over this country. But \nyou go through the tabs, and you set up what you want to set up. You \nsearch the items you want to search. You finally come to this page. \nThis is the page that is the page that most Americans would love to see \nthe Consumer Product Safety Commission offer. They would love to see \nthis type of information.\n  This is a ``Complaints'' page. This information was filed by a \nconsumer. In many cases, it is done online. It does not have to be, but \nin many cases it is done online. It is real easy, very inexpensive to \ndo--not a lot of manhours for most of this. It has a ``Report Date,'' \nwhich in this case is March of 2008. That is when we ran this. It has \nthe ``Search Type,'' and you see we typed in: ``child safety seat.'' We \ntyped in the name: ``Fisher-Price.'' And for the ``Model,'' we just put \nthe generic child safety seat model. This is all on little pop-up menus \nand little scroll-down-type menus. It is very easy to use. So we looked \nat Fisher Price. Crash: No. Fire: No. Number of injuries: One.\n\n  We come down here to this child seat: Tether, or strap.\n  Here is the summary, and this is pretty much what the consumer wrote, \nright here. It says: The consumer states that the harness strap of the \nchild seat snapped from the back, causing the child to fall out of the \nseat, and there were some minor injuries.\n  You will see it has an ID number so they can track each record.\n  Here again--this is important. Part of the compromise we reached with \nSenator Stevens and Senator Collins on this issue is that we don't \nprovide information about the complainant. In other words, some in the \nbusiness community--again, not all, but some--were concerned if we \nprovided information about who is filling these out, then they get a \nletter from a trial lawyer and all of a sudden you have a lawsuit. We \nare putting the safeguard in to make sure that doesn't happen. The CPSC \nunder our bill cannot provide that type of information.\n  Another thing we require of the CPSC is to remove any incorrect \ninformation that may be offered by the consumer, by the complaining \nperson. We also allow manufacturers the opportunity to comment on \ninformation in the database. For example, they may offer a comment \nwhich said: Be sure you follow the instructions because if you don't \nget it buckled in right, you may have a problem, or whatever; I don't \nknow what their comment may be. But these comments can actually be very \nuseful to people who are searching this. So we built in these \nsafeguards to make sure this NHTSA-type database will work with the \nCPSC. This is the goal we are trying to get to. We are trying to get to \nproviding that information. While the CPSC is going through this long \nrecall process or working through whatever they have to work through, \nat least the public has the right to know.\n  I know I have at least one colleague here who wishes to speak, so let \nme wrap up on this one final point.\n  There is a girl who was 14 months old. Her name is Abigail Hartung. \nShe is from New Jersey. When Abigail was 14 months old, she was trapped \nby a crib. The crib collapsed and her hand was trapped in it. She was \n14 months old. It turned out she didn't have a very serious injury, but \ncertainly it was upsetting to the parents and to the child. When the \nfather, Mr. Hartung, called the manufacturer to ask them about this and \nto tell them about it, the manufacturer told him on the phone: Well, \nthis is amazing. We have never heard of this before. Are you sure you \nhad it set up right? Are you sure the child wasn't somehow abusing the \ncrib, Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Come to find out, the company \ntold him they had never heard of this happening before. Come to find \nout, the company had already received 80 complaints about this \nhappening--80.\n  This database will build in the accountability for some of these \ncompanies that are going to do that. Some of these companies--again, \nnot all; I don't want to paint with a broad brush here, because many of \nthese companies are very responsive. They take these consumer \ncomplaints very seriously. They are trying to do the right thing; \nothers, not so much. So for those who are not going to respect the \nsafety and the welfare of their customers, this database will help \nlevel the playing field. It will provide information to families and \nconsumers of all sorts to know that there is another place they can go \nand check and find out if this product has a problem, so companies \nwon't treat others as the Hartungs were treated.\n  Mr. President, I see I have a wonderful colleague who wants to say a \nfew words, so I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Let me begin by thanking my friend the Senator from \nArkansas and my friend the Senator from Maine for their fine work on \nthis very important issue in trying to protect the needs of our kids. I \nthank them very much.\n  What I wish to talk about for a short period of time is the budget \nsituation. I am a member of the Budget Committee. The Budget Committee, \nI believe, will be marking up the budget in committee tomorrow. I \nbelieve it will be on the floor sometime next week. This entire process \nof determining a budget is enormously important, because it reflects \nthe priorities of the American people and it reflects our values. It is \nno different than any family budget. It has everything to do with where \nwe choose to spend our resources and how we raise our resources. So it \nis an issue of enormous importance.\n  As a member of the Budget Committee, I am going to be looking at this \nbudget within a context of four major concerns. No. 1, as I go around \nmy State of Vermont and, in fact, America and talk to a whole lot of \npeople, I think the American people understand, even as Congress and \nthe White House may not, that the middle class in this country today is \nin the midst of a collapse, and I use that word advisedly. Despite a \nhuge increase in worker productivity, great strides forward in \ntechnology, there are tens of millions of American workers today who \nare working longer hours for lower wages. Poverty in America is \nincreasing. I think of most concern is that moms and dads all over this \ncountry are worried that for the first time in the modern history of \nour country, their kids are going to have a lower standard of living \nthan they do. That is the first sense of reality I look at as we \nprepare the budget.\n\n  The second reality I look at is that while the middle class is \nshrinking and poverty is increasing, the people on top have not had it \nso good since the 1920s. I understand we are not supposed to talk about \nthose things. Not too many people talk about the fact that we have the \nmost unequal distribution of wealth and income of any major country on \nEarth. The rich are getting much richer, while everybody else virtually \nis seeing the decline in their standard of living. It is not something \nwe are supposed to talk about. I talk about it. I think it should be \ntalked about. I think it is an issue that must be addressed as we look \nat the budget, because we are going to have to ask a question about how \nwe raise more revenue in order to address many of the unmet needs in \nour country.\n  The third issue is just that. The reality is that there are enormous \nunmet needs in this country. When people say Government shouldn't be \ninvolved, I don't know to whom they are talking. Our infrastructure is \ncollapsing. The civil engineers tell us that we have over $1 trillion \nin unmet needs in terms\n\n[[Page S1567]]\n\nof our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our wastewater systems. We need \nto fund those. It isn't going to get any better if we don't improve \nthem, and we will create jobs as we do that.\n  But it is not only our physical infrastructure. We have the highest \nrate of childhood poverty of any major Nation on Earth. This is a \nnational disgrace. Eighteen percent of our kids are in poverty. We have \nother seriously unmet needs. So looking at the budget, we have to look \nat not only the general collapse of the middle class, the fact that the \nrich are getting richer and everybody else is getting poorer; we have \nto understand with regard to our children, our infrastructure, there \nare huge unmet needs.\n  The fourth issue we have to deal with is that in the midst of all \nthat, our national debt is soaring. It is now over $9 trillion.\n  So I look at those four areas as issues that must be dealt with as we \nmove into this new budget.\n  Since President Bush has been in office, median household income for \nworking-age Americans has declined by almost $2,500. That is part of \nthe collapse of the middle class. The reality is we have lost some 3 \nmillion good-paying manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania, in Ohio, and in \nthe State of Vermont. We are losing good-paying jobs, in my view, \nbecause of a disastrous trade policy which simply encourages corporate \nAmerica to throw American workers out on the street, move to China, and \nthen bring their products back into this country. So we are losing \ngood-paying jobs.\n  Since President Bush has been in office, over 8.5 million Americans \nhave lost their health insurance. We are now up to 47 million Americans \nwithout any health insurance. Meanwhile, health care premiums have \nincreased by 78 percent.\n  Under George W. Bush's watch, for the first time since the Great \nDepression, the personal savings rate has fallen below zero. This \nsimply means that because of dire economic conditions, we are actually \nas a people spending more money than we are earning. There are millions \nof people right now who, when they go to the grocery store, don't buy \ntheir Wheaties and don't buy their rice and don't buy their milk with \ncash. They buy it with a credit card. By the way, they are often \ncharged 25, 28 percent for that credit card. We are looking at a \nforeclosure crisis which is certainly the highest on record, turning \nthe American dream of home ownership into an American nightmare for \nmillions of our people.\n  So that is No. 1: The middle class is collapsing. There is tremendous \neconomic pressure. People go to the gas station to fill up their gas \ntank and pay $3.20 for a gallon of gas, while ExxonMobil makes $40 \nmillion last year.\n  People can't afford home heating oil. The price of food is going up. \nEverywhere you turn there is enormous pressure on working families and \non the middle class. That is a reality we must address as we look at \nthis budget.\n  But as I mentioned earlier, not everybody is in that boat. Let's be \nhonest about it. The wealthiest people in this country have not had it \nso good since the 1920s. According to the latest figures from the IRS, \nthe top 1 percent--1 percent--earned significantly more income in 2005 \nthan the bottom 50 percent. That means the 300,000 Americans on the top \nearn more income than do the bottom 150 million Americans. It is the \nmost unequal distribution of income and of wealth in our country of any \nmajor country on Earth. That is a reality that must be addressed as we \nlook at the budget.\n  According to Forbes Magazine, the collective net worth of the \nwealthiest 400 Americans--400--increased by $290 billion last year, to \n$1.54 trillion. Incredibly, the top 1 percent now owns more wealth than \nthe bottom 90 percent. That is an issue we have to deal with.\n  In terms of our national debt, our national debt is now at $9.2 \ntrillion. I think the history books will be pretty clear in that among \nmany other negative characteristics, President Bush will go down in \nhistory as being the most financially and fiscally irresponsible \nPresident in the history of this country. The national debt is soaring, \nand clearly, one of the reasons for that is we spend $12 billion every \nsingle month on the war in Iraq which, according to some people, is \ngoing to go on forever, I guess--$12 billion a month. And who is paying \nfor it? Our kids and our grandchildren are paying for it, because it is \neasier to pass the cost of that war on to them than tell the American \npeople today there is a cost of war, and you have to make some choices. \nTwelve billion dollars a month.\n\n  There are people here in the Senate, and the President of the United \nStates, who think we should repeal the estate tax. One trillion dollars \nworth of benefits go to the wealthiest three-tenths of 1 percent. And \nhow do they propose to make up the difference? They don't. Just pass it \non to the kids and our grandchildren and let the millionaires and \nbillionaires of this country have a huge tax break. No problem at all, \njust: That is what we will do.\n  I wish to talk about something else that also is not talked about \nvery much, and that is the terrible situation of unmet social needs \nthat exists in this country, and the President's budget. At a time when \nwe have a major health care crisis, the President wants to make major \ncuts in Medicare and Medicaid. As a member of the Budget Committee, I \nam going to do everything I can to make sure we do not make the health \ncare crisis in this country even worse. We have, as any mother or \nfather knows--it is true in Vermont and it is true virtually all over \nthis country--a horrendous crisis in terms of affordable childcare. The \nPresident has said in his budget that he wants to reduce the number of \nchildren receiving childcare assistance by 200,000. We have a major \ncrisis, and the President's response is let's make it even worse.\n  Embarrassingly, in this great country, many of our citizens are going \nhungry.\n  I know in Vermont, our emergency food shelters are running out of \nfood. This is true all over the country. We need to address that issue. \nThe President's response is to deny food stamps to 300,000 families and \nchildren, and so forth and so on. It is a crisis among low-income \nworking people. The President's response is to cut those programs so we \ncan give tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this country.\n  It seems to me that at a time when our country has so many serious \nproblems, at a time when the American people know in their souls that \nwe are moving in the wrong direction in so many areas, with fundamental \nproblems in this country, we have to have the courage to have a serious \ndebate about moving this country in a new direction.\n  There was an article in the papers recently--last week--and it \nbrought forth a fact that many of us had known, but it is important to \nrepeat: In the United States of America, we have the largest number of \npeople behind bars of any country on Earth. People say, well, China is \nmuch larger than America and is an authoritarian, Communist country, so \nsurely they have more people--I am not talking per capita, I am talking \ncollectively, in total--behind bars than we do. Wrong.\n  Is there a correlation between the fact that we have more people in \njail than any other country and the fact that we have the highest rate \nof childhood poverty of any major country on Earth? I think there is a \ndirect correlation. I think you either pay now or you pay later. Either \nyou give kids the opportunity for decent childcare, nutrition, and \neducation, and keep an eye on them so that in fourth grade they don't \nmentally drop out, and in the tenth grade they don't really drop out of \nschool and get involved in destructive activity--you either do it--and \nit costs money--or you ignore that reality.\n  When these kids go to jail and commit crimes, we spend $50,000 a year \nkeeping them behind bars. That is our choice. If people want to ignore \nthe crisis and the reality we have, which is the highest rate of \nchildhood poverty, that we are underfunding Head Start, and so on, you \ncan ignore it, but you are going to pay the price at the other end by \nlocking up many people in jail.\n  I also want to mention to my colleagues that I will be bringing \namendments to the floor during the budget process. They are simple. \nWhat they say is that at a time when the wealthiest people in this \ncountry have never had it so good, when the President has given these \nsame people huge tax breaks, the time is now that we rescind\n\n[[Page S1568]]\n\nthe tax breaks that go to millionaires and billionaires and use some of \nthat money to reduce our national debt, and use others of those sums to \nstart protecting the middle-class working families and the kids in this \ncountry.\n  A budget is about priorities, about choices. I intend to provide some \nchoices to the Members of the Senate. I hope they will support me and \nthose amendments in moving this country in a fundamentally different \ndirection.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and to call up my amendment, No. 4097.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Reserving the right to object, to make sure, we will go \nback on the pending amendment as soon as he completes his presentation.\n  Mr. VITTER. Yes. Mr. President, I wish to modify my unanimous consent \nrequest to include that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana (Mr. Vitter) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4097.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To allow the prevailing party in certain civil actions \n   related to consumer product safety rules to recover attorney fees)\n\n       On page 58, strike lines 4 through 7 and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(g) Attorney Fees.--The prevailing party in a civil \n     action under subsection (a) may recover reasonable costs and \n     attorney fees.''.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, the amendment is simple and \nstraightforward. It establishes a ``loser pays'' rule for actions by \nattorneys general under the law. It doesn't make it mandatory, it makes \nit discretionary, or up to the court. But the court would be allowed to \naward costs and attorney's fees from the losing party to be paid by the \nlosing party to the winning party. I think that is fair and reasonable. \nThat essentially is the present law. It is also essentially the sort of \nprovision that is in the House bill.\n  In the Senate bill, the availability of fees and costs and attorney's \nfees is only available to the winner, if the winner is the attorney \ngeneral. If the attorney general loses in those suits, if the private \nparty prevails, the private party cannot get those costs and attorney's \nfees. I think that is unfair. Perhaps more important than it being \nunfair, I think it creates an imbalance that might encourage clogging \nthe system, clogging the courts--perhaps most important, clogging the \nworkload of the Consumer Product Safety Commission with unnecessary \nlawsuits that are not fully thought through. I think this reasonable \nprovision--loser pays, whoever the loser is, up to the discretion of \nthe courts, not mandatory, simply allowable, if the court decides--is \nthe fair and balanced approach.\n  In offering this, let me make clear that we need to do more to \nincrease product safety. This bill does many good things in that \nregard. The House bill does many good things in that regard. I support \nthat move. But as we do that, I don't want to create an imbalance or \nactually clog up the system, whether it is the court system or the CPSC \nworkload, clog it up with unnecessary, perhaps frivolous, suits and \nlitigation, and prevent us from getting to that goal.\n  We should make sure we don't overburden the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission. One of the problems we have now that this bill and the \nHouse bill attempts to address is that of overburdening an inadequate \nstaff and resources. So we need to make sure that as we fix those \nproblems with one hand, we don't use the other hand to make them worse \nby creating incentives to increase the workload unnecessarily with \nlawsuits that are not thought through and that are frivolous.\n  Again, I look forward to supporting and promoting greater consumer \nsafety. I supported the amendment on the floor recently that embodied \nthe House bill, because I think the House bill does that in a \nsubstantial way, without having some of the shortcomings--including \nthis one--of the Senate bill. We do need to do more. One thing we don't \nneed to do is create more lawsuits than actually accomplish the \nobjective of safety or to encourage lawsuits that are not thought \nthrough, to encourage actions that can be frivolous. This is a \nreasonable, balanced way to prevent that.\n  In closing, let me be clear that this doesn't mandate ``loser pays'' \nin every case. This says to the court that you can award costs and \nattorney's fees from the loser to the winner in whatever direction that \nworks, no matter who the winners and losers are, but it is not \nmandatory. That is broadly consistent with present law and broadly \nconsistent with the House bill, which I believe is a fairer, more \nbalanced approach, which will avoid clogging up the system yet again, \neven as we try to give the system more resources.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nChuck Schumer and Barack Obama be added as cosponsors to amendment No. \n4105 to the Consumer Product Safety Commission Reform Act. This is the \namendment Senator Menendez and I have introduced to ban industry-\nsponsored travel by those who regulate them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Mental Health Parity\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise to commend the House for \nbringing today before the House a step that will bring our Nation \ncloser to achieving long overdue fairness for people suffering from \nmental illness and chemical dependency.\n  We are now one step closer as the House considers this important \nmental health parity bill today, one step closer to realizing the dream \nof my friend, the late Senator Paul Wellstone, who championed equality \nfor those with mental health needs, until his untimely death in 2002.\n  If this law passes, as it should, we can thank the persistence of \nleaders such as Representatives Jim Ramstad and Patrick Kennedy; we can \nthank Senators Pete Domenici and Ted Kennedy; and we can thank the \nWellstone sons, particularly David, who continues to carry the torch \nlit by his father.\n  While Federal law may not alleviate the stigma that surrounds mental \nillness, it can bring us closer to ending insurance discrimination and \neasing the unfair financial burden borne by patients and their \nfamilies.\n  Most health care plans currently have barriers to mental health and \nchemical dependency treatment. Individuals seeking treatment for these \nhealth problems face higher copayments and higher deductibles, as well \nas arbitrary limits on the number of office visits or inpatient days \ncovered. These people pay the same premiums as everybody else, but when \nthey get sick, their insurance doesn't cover them.\n\n  The House and Senate proposals build upon the Mental Health Parity \nAct of 1996 by mandating that if an insurer offers mental health and \nchemical dependency coverage, the treatment limitations can be no more \nrestrictive than for medical benefits.\n  Minnesota is proud to have one of the strongest mental health parity \nlaws in the country. But this law only goes so far. Federal action will \nexpand mental health parity protections to those covered by self-\ninsured plans--117 million people--and move us toward real equity for \nthose needing vital services.\n  It is appropriate that this legislation in the House is named in \nhonor of Paul Wellstone--an inspiring figure whose ceaseless motion and \ntireless pursuit of a better world was brought to a stop only by that \ntragic plane crash.\n  Many in this body, including myself, counted Paul as a friend. We all \nknow Paul was a crusader and a man with many passions. But anybody who \never met or talked with him quickly found out that he had a special \nplace in his heart for helping those with mental illness. This deep and \nabiding concern was shaped by the suffering of his own\n\n[[Page S1569]]\n\nbrother. Paul's brother Steven suffered from mental illness. As a young \nchild, Paul watched his brother's traumatic dissent into mental \nillness. As a freshman in college, he suffered a severe mental \nbreakdown and spent the next 2 years in mental hospitals. Eventually, \nhe recovered and graduated from college with honors. But it took his \nimmigrant parents years to pay off the hospital bills.\n  Writing about this, Paul recalled the years that his brother was \nhospitalized. For 2 years, he said, the house always seemed dark, even \nwhen the lights were on. It was such a sad home. Decades later, Paul \nknew there were far too many sad homes in our great Nation--too many \nfamilies devastated by the physical and financial consequences of \nmental illness.\n  Paul knew that we can and should do better. For years, he fought to \nallocate funding for better care, better services, and better \nrepresentation for the mentally ill, and for years he fought for mental \nhealth parity and insurance coverage. For Paul, this was always a \nmatter of civil rights, of justice, and of basic human decency. Of \ncourse, on this issue, as with every other issue, Paul and Sheila, his \nwife, worked together.\n  We should all care about securing mental health and chemical \ndependency treatment equity for the same reasons that Paul did. We \nshould care because of the suffering and stigma that individuals and \nfamilies endure due to mental illness and addiction. We should care \nbecause it is cruel when people with mental health or addiction \nproblems receive lesser care than those with physical health problems. \nWe should care because of the enormous financial cost of these diseases \nfor our society and because the economic research shows how cost \neffective good treatment can be.\n  I saw this firsthand as a county prosecutor. I cannot tell you the \nnumber of violent crime cases I remember where the right treatment \ncould have prevented a horrible crime, and the later costs of \nimprisonment, or maybe the right medication would have stopped someone \nfrom spiraling downward to a point where they committed a crime. This \nis not to excuse the crime, and it doesn't mean that we didn't \nprosecute them aggressively and that they didn't go to prison; it just \nmeans if we can prevent the crimes with appropriate treatment and \nmedication, then we must do it.\n  Untreated mental illness and substance abuse adds an enormous burden \nto the criminal justice system every day. That is why we created a \nmental health court in Hennepin County, where I prosecuted, which has \nhad many successes, as well as a drug court. But it would be better to \nprevent people from getting into the system in the first place. That is \nwhy this legislation is so important.\n\n  Finally, we should care because we know that people who are suffering \nneed help. Mr. President, 54 million Americans suffer from mental \nillness or substance abuse. Almost 15 million suffer from depression. \nOver 2 million suffer from schizophrenic disorders. Over 20 million \nAmericans need treatment for alcohol or drug abuse. These numbers are \nstaggering, but ultimately what convinces anyone of the importance of \nthis issue is when we see how real people close to us suffer, whether \nit is a son or a daughter, a mother or father, or, as in Paul's case, a \nbrother or a sister, a neighbor or a coworker.\n  Patrick Kennedy and Jim Ramstad have been brave enough to talk about \ntheir own struggles, and that really adds some moral compass to their \nleadership in the House. I have seen it in my own family with my dad, \nwho suffers from alcoholism, a larger-than-life dad who could climb the \nhighest mountains, whom also I have seen plunge to the lowest valleys \nwith his battle of alcoholism. My dad finally got the treatment he \nneeded, and I have never seen him so happy as in the past 10 years. \nOther families need to be, as my dad puts it, ``pursued by grace.'' \nThis legislation offers crucial support for people in need.\n  Several months ago, our Senate unanimously voted in support of mental \nhealth parity. The House is now passing its own legislation. I will say \nthat the House bill is stronger, and I prefer the House bill over the \nSenate version, but I trust these two bills will be reconciled and \nsigned into law, and I hope my Senate colleagues involved in the \nconference committee will get us and bring us back the strongest bill \npossible. This will be a victory for millions of Americans living with \nmental illness who face unfair discrimination in their access to \naffordable health care treatment.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues, Senator Kennedy and Senator Domenici, \nfor their leadership on this issue. I thank Patrick Kennedy and Jim \nRamstad for their continued leadership. But in the end, I am here today \nwith respect to Paul Wellstone, who led this fight for so many years. I \nknow he is looking down on us today and looking down at the House of \nRepresentatives that is passing this bill with his name in his honor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4094\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I realize we earlier thought we might vote \nat 12:30 p.m. That has been put off to a little later. I wish to talk \nabout the pending amendment to the Consumer Product Safety Commission \nReform Act. I am very worried about it. It would tie the hands of State \nattorneys general who seek to protect their citizens from harmful \nproducts.\n  I see the distinguished chairman on the floor. He was an attorney \ngeneral. He knows what is involved in these areas. I applaud his \nefforts for including in the legislation the power for State attorneys \ngeneral to enforce consumer product safety violations. As a former \nprosecutor and as one who watches how carefully anything such as this \nis done in my home State of Vermont, I certainly do not want us to gut \nthat important enforcement provision by immunizing corporate bad actors \nfor the reasonable costs and fees it takes State attorneys general to \nbring these actions. States are not rolling in money, but they expect \ntheir attorneys general to protect them. If wrongdoers have to pay part \nof that cost, so be it.\n  If we strike line 5, 6, and 7 of the pending bill, we immunize \ncorporate bad actors. I don't think any of us should have to go home \nand tell our legislatures: Boy, we just gutted the ability of our State \nattorney general to do something, and if he does do something, we want \nto hit you with a higher bill than you would have paid otherwise.\n  I understand Senator Cornyn's floor statement in support of his \namendment mentioned nothing about reasonable fees and costs incurred by \nthe offices of State attorneys general. Rather, he focused on \ncontingency fee agreements that some attorneys general have decided to \nmake with private lawyers to enforce laws.\n  Setting aside the contingency fee argument for a moment, I wish to \nhighlight that his amendment would do more than just micromanage the \ntypes of staffing decisions State attorneys general enter into. I am \nalways somewhat nonplused to hear Members say how we have to get the \nFederal Government off our backs and let our States make the \ndetermination, that Washington doesn't know best, that our State \ncapitals, legislatures, and Governors have a better idea how to do \nthings, and then all of a sudden bring in amendments that would just \nrun roughshod over our 50 States, would relegate our State Governors \nand legislators to the dustbin.\n  We should not strike the lines of this bipartisan legislation that \nmake corporations found liable for violating consumer laws responsible \nfor reasonable costs and fees incurred by States. We do this in private \nlitigation all the time. If you have somebody who has violated the law, \nthey ought to pay the costs and not ask the taxpayers to pay the costs \nfor the violators.\n  The purpose of Senator Cornyn's amendment is to tie the hands of \nState attorneys general by prohibiting them from entering into certain \ntypes of contracts with private lawyers. I have been here long enough \nto remember a time when principles of federalism and deferring to State \ngovernments meant something in this great Chamber. State elected \nofficials are accountable to their citizens. If the State voters do not \nlike the way a State attorney general is staffing cases, that is easy--\njust don't reelect him or her. But Senator Cornyn's amendment would \nmake the staffing decision for all State attorneys general, whether it \nis in Vermont or\n\n[[Page S1570]]\n\nNew Hampshire or Arkansas or Texas or anywhere else. What he is asking \nus to do, the 100 Members of this body, is to stand up and say we have \ngreater wisdom than all the legislatures in this country and we are \ngoing to tell individual States how they should conduct their business. \nI believe that is unwise, especially in the context of unsafe products \nthat have the potential to harm consumers. So I oppose this amendment. \nIt undermines the important enforcement role of State attorneys \ngeneral, and it runs roughshod--it runs roughshod--over any State where \ntheir legislature, their Governor, their attorney general wants to \nprotect the people of their State from unsafe consumer products.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, it looks as if we have a couple Senators \nwho are preparing to speak. I wish to follow up on the comments, very \nbriefly, that the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee made about the attorneys general.\n  This idea of allowing State attorneys general to assist Federal \nagencies with enforcement of Federal decisions is not new in this bill. \nThis has been around for a long time. I have nine examples I want to \nmention very quickly.\n  In the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Telephone Disclosure and \nDispute Resolution Act, the Children's Online Privacy Protect Act, the \nTelemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act, the Credit \nRepair Organizations Act, the Controlling the Assault of Nonsolicited \nPornography and Marketing Act, and one section of the Truth in Lending \nAct all provide for State attorneys general to have a role in \nenforcement.\n  My last point--and this is the ninth one I want to mention--a few \nyears ago, the FTC's telemarketing sales rule went into effect. They \nsaid at one point:\n\n       The commission believes that the joint Federal-State \n     enforcement model under the Telemarketing Act provides a \n     practical framework for coordinating our efforts with those \n     of States and results in an efficient and effective law \n     enforcement program.\n\n  We are utilizing a model that other Federal agencies that had this \nmodel before recognize is an effective and efficient use of resources.\n  My last point on adding the attorneys general to the enforcement of \nthe CPSC rules, regulations, and decisions is that it is a very \nefficient way to do it. If we wanted to, the Congress could add another \n$5 million, $10 million, $20 million, $50 million--whatever it may be--\nin appropriations to this Federal agency to put people out there around \nthe various States to do the very same work the State attorneys general \noffices can do without any Federal taxpayers' dollars involved.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee \nfor his comments.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4109\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so I can call up amendment No. 4109.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Casey], for himself, Mr. \n     Brown, and Ms. Landrieu, proposes an amendment numbered 4109.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require the Consumer Product Safety Commission to study \n the use of formaldehyde in the manufacturing of textiles and apparel \n   articles and to prescribe consumer product safety standards with \n                       respect to such articles)\n\n       On page 103, after line 12, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 40.

The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I wish to first of all commend the work of \nseveral colleagues on this Consumer Product Safety Commission \nlegislation, and in particular the Senator from Arkansas, Senator \nPryor, for long overdue changes of the law that pertain to how we \nprotect consumers, families, across America from unsafe products from \naround the world that come into Pennsylvania and come into America and \ncan do harm to our families. So I am grateful for the work that went \ninto this legislation.\n  Today, I wish to raise with this amendment a particular concern I \nhave, and I think it is shared by a lot of people in this body, and \nthat is the threat posed by formaldehyde. I am going to put up a \ndefinition so people have a sense of what we are talking about. \nFormaldehyde is a colorless, strong-smelling gas, and when present in \nthe air at levels above 0.1 parts per million, it can cause watery \neyes, burning sensations in the eyes, nose, and throat, nausea, \ncoughing, and all the things you see here, but it has also been shown \nto cause cancer in scientific studies using laboratory animals and may \ncause cancer in humans.\n\n[[Page S1571]]\n\nSo we are talking about something that is a threat to families across \nthis country, and it is something that this legislation should deal \nwith.\n  Our amendment is very simple. And I should note for the record this \namendment is being offered not only by me but by Senator Brown of Ohio \nand Senator Landrieu of Louisiana. It is very simple what we do. We set \nforth in this amendment to have the Consumer Product Safety Commission, \nfirst of all, study the use of formaldehyde in the manufacturing of \ntextile and apparel articles. That study would be conducted within 2 \nyears, and basically we would want that study to identify risks to \nconsumers caused by the use of formaldehyde in the manufacturing of \narticles that may be clothing articles or components of such articles.\n  So, first of all, the study. Secondly, not later than 3 years after \nthe date of the enactment of the amendment, the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission should set forth a safety standard, which is something this \nCommission can do and should do with regard to formaldehyde.\n  Thirdly, we say that the Consumer Product Safety Commission shall \nprescribe a testing program, a reasonable testing program for textile \nand apparel articles and components of such articles. Basically, what \nwe are talking about is to test for the presence of formaldehyde and \nthe threat it poses.\n  Now, what are we talking about? Some of the news articles over the \nlast couple of years point to very basic articles in the life of any \nfamily in this country--blankets. There was a problem not too long ago \nwith the presence of formaldehyde in blankets. We have seen examples \nwhere toys and other products that impact children, but especially when \nit comes to clothing in this case, there have been examples of baby \nclothing where there is a threat posed by the presence of formaldehyde.\n  Some might say: Well, why would the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission have to have a regulation such as this and to have a program \nto deal with this? Well, for some reason, it has been left off the \nlist. Because in terms of the Government agencies already that have \nregulated the use of or exposure to formaldehyde, the list is long. The \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, has it; the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, EPA, has it; the Food and Drug \nAdministration; the Housing and Urban Development agency has it. So \nthese are agencies already in the Federal Government that have \nregulated the use of and exposure to formaldehyde, and what we are \nasking in this amendment is that yet another critical agency in our \nGovernment, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, be charged with the \nresponsibility of studying, setting forth rules and regulations, and \nalso making sure we are doing everything possible to prevent this from \nbecoming an even larger threat to American families.\n  I would conclude with one chart: the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission regulations of formaldehyde. And after that, the entire \nchart is blank because that is exactly what the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission is doing right now on formaldehyde--nothing, not a single \nthing, not a single rule that deals with this, despite the threat posed \nto young children, to babies when they wear baby clothing, or the \nthreat it poses to all Americans when it comes to what we wear.\n  This is long overdue, and I hope colleagues on both sides of the \naisle would not only support, as I think they will, strongly, the \nelements of this Consumer Product Safety Commission legislation but in \nparticular that they would support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this issue of imported products from \nabroad in an increasingly globalized world is a very significant and \nserious issue. I am not one who suggests we can retreat from the global \neconomy. Clearly, the global economy exists. I would say the rules for \nthe global economy have not nearly kept pace with the galloping \nmovement of this global economy and, as a result of it, we have some \nvery serious trade issues, we have imbalances in trade, we have the \nlargest trade deficit in human history, we have the loss of American \njobs being shipped overseas, and then we have, in addition to all that, \nwe have products that are now made overseas, shipped into this country, \nthat we have discovered are dangerous products.\n  My colleague from Arkansas, Senator Pryor, under his leadership, and \nwith others, have brought a bill to the floor of the Senate. I am on \nthe Senate Commerce Committee, and I was pleased to work with them and \nplay a very small role in helping create this legislation, but I wish \nto commend my colleague and others for bringing a bill to the floor \nthat gives the Consumer Product Safety Commission some additional \nauthority.\n  Now, the Consumer Product Safety Commission is headed by somebody who \ndidn't want the authority; didn't seem to think it was necessary, \nunfortunately. We need someone at the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission who is very interested, very alert, and very engaged on \nthese issues. Because the fact is, these can be life-or-death issues. \nThat is a plain fact.\n  Now, the amendment I have offered, the second amendment, is \nrelatively simple. I wish to describe it. It is an amendment that says \nthe Consumer Product Safety Commission should have the authority to \npermanently ban imports from certain producers, foreign producers, that \nhave shown a persistent pattern of shipping unsafe products to our \nshores. Let me repeat. This simply gives the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission the authority to ban imported toys from unsafe producers.\n  Under this amendment, the Consumer Product Safety Commission would \nhave the full discretion to decide whether a particular case warrants \nsuch a ban. I think it would shock most Americans to learn that there \nis no such authority that exists at the moment. We can have a company \nthat sends us once, twice, 4 times, 5 times, 10 times or 20 times \nunsafe products into this country, and there is no authority for anyone \nto ban that company from shipping products into the U.S. marketplace. \nThat is wrong.\n  So let's say that a company, in this case let me say China--and I \ndon't mean to pick on the Chinese, but the fact is 85 percent of the \ntoys that come into this country are coming in from China--let's say a \nmanufacturer has a complete and persistent record of painting their \ntoys with lead paint. How often should we allow that company to be \ncaught sending toys into this country with lead paint; lead paint that \nhas a significant capacity to provide injury to children? How long \nshould we allow that to happen? Under current law, the answer is, there \nis no limit.\n  Hopefully, we will find the toys and prevent them from being on the \nstore shelves. But at the present time, there is no limit, and no one \nhas the capability to ban the producers from sending those products \ninto this country.\n  There are Chinese companies producing for U.S. brands that have had \nmany repeated problems. In September, Mattel, Incorporated, announced \nthe third massive recall in a 5-week period. At that point, Mattel \nfound 848,000 Chinese-made Barbie and Fisher-Price toys that had \nexcessive amounts of lead paint. Toys were pulled from the store \nshelves at that point, and that included Barbie kitchens, furniture \nitems, Fisher-Price train toys, and Bongo Band drums, among others. The \nsurface paints on these toys contained excessive levels of lead, which \nis prohibited under Federal law because, frankly, it is unsafe for \nchildren.\n  Now, in addition to those recalls, Mattel has recalled nearly 9 \nmillion Chinese-made toys coated with toxic lead paint and other safety \nproblems. The plastic preschool toys sold under the Fisher-Price brand \nin the United States include the popular Big Bird, Elmo, Dora, and the \nDiego characters.\n  In June of last year, RC2 Corporation recalled 1.5 million wooden \nrailroad toys and set parts from its Thomas & Friends. Most parents of \nyoung children will recognize Thomas & Friends, the wooden railway \nproduct line, which was made by Hansheng Wood Products factory using \nlead paint. So 1.5 million of these toys were headed to the store \nshelves in this country.\n  Now, the question: Why would a producer anywhere use lead paint? \nWell, because lead paint is bright, it is durable, it is flexible, it \nis fast drying, and most of all, it is cheap. China mass produces lead \npaint and coloring agents such as lead chromate because they are \ngenerally cheaper than organic pigments.\n  But lead is dangerous even in small quantities. We have known that \nfor a long while in this country. Going back to 1978, the U.S. Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission made it illegal to use any paint containing \nmore than 0.06 percent of lead for residential structures, hospitals, \nand children's products.\n  We have known about lead for so long that Ben Franklin wrote about \nthe dangers of lead. Ben Franklin wrote a letter about the bad effects \nof lead taken inwardly. Some 19th century paint companies advertised \ntheir paint in newspaper ads bragging it was lead free. So this isn't \nsome new discovery, that lead is a problem and a potential human health \nproblem. And it is no accident that some of these toys are containing \nexcessive levels of lead paint. Because, as I said, lead is cheap, the \ncontractors that are making these products are trying to lower costs, \nand they are not spending a lot of time wondering about human health \nissues.\n  Now, let me describe this silver chain. This is a Chinese-made charm.\n  This charm is an example of a heartbreaking case. This happened in \nMarch 2006 when a 4-year-old Minnesota boy died of lead poisoning after \nswallowing this small, heart-shaped charm that came as a gift with a \npurchase of Reebok tennis shoes. A little 4-year-old boy swallowed \nthis, and this was 99 percent lead. The fact is, these kinds of \ncircumstances can kill. Unsafe toys can kill.\n  Jarnell died because a trinket, made of 99 percent lead, was included \nwith a shoe, and that trinket was swallowed by a young child, and he is \ndead.\n  Ann Brown, who headed the Consumer Product Safety Commission from \n1994 to 2001--and by the way, I might say, she was an extraordinary \npublic servant, did a wonderful job. She said there should be an \noutright ban on any lead in any toy product. She said: If I were at the \nCPSC now, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, I would say that \ntrying to recall tainted products is like picking sand out of the \nbeach: it is just not possible. I agree with that.\n  The only way to make certain our products on our store shelves are \nsafe, and especially toy products that are going to be used by our \nchildren, is to give the officials who are supposed to be monitoring \nthis and regulating this the authority to permanently ban unsafe \nproducers. Short of that, we are going to continue to see these \nproblems. Then we are going to scratch our heads and wonder: Why do \nthese still exist? The reason they still exist is the same companies \nare shipping us tainted products and unsafe products. This is not \nrocket science. We have seen the products, we have read about the \nproducts, we have heard about the products. They include, yes, a \ntrinket with a tennis shoe; they include a small wooden toy painted \nwith lead paint; they include toothpaste; they include cat food, \ncontaminated shrimp, car tires--you name it.\n\n[[Page S1573]]\n\n  The question is, Who is going to stand up for and support the \ninterest of American consumers? I think it has been the case that when \nthese problems came to light and people lost their lives because of \nthem, many of the producers, particularly some in China, said: None of \nthis is true. These are problems that are exaggerated, and our products \nare safe.\n  Then, in June, when there was a tremendous outcry here in the United \nStates, regulators in China finally said they had closed 180 food \nplants and that inspectors had uncovered more than 23,000 food safety \nviolations. China Daily, the nation's English-language newspaper, said \nindustrial chemicals, including dyes, mineral oils, paraffin wax, and \nformaldehyde, had been found in everything from candy to pickles to \nbiscuits to seafood. China announced on July 9 of last year that it had \nactually executed the former head of its food and drug safety agency \nfor accepting bribes in excess of $800,000 in exchange for approving \nsubstandard medicines.\n  Well, we know the problem. That is why we have a bill on the floor of \nthe Senate. We know at least a part of this solution. The bill on the \nfloor of the Senate is a good bill. But I have an amendment that would \nimprove it, so that when you have a company that has a persistent and \nconsistent and relentless problem of shipping unsafe products to this \ncountry, we can say: Stop, you cannot do it anymore.\n  I read a while back about a guy in my home State who was picked up 13 \nor 14 times for drunk driving. Our State said: Stop. You cannot drive \nany more. It is over. We are not putting up with this.\n  We ought to do the same thing with companies--not only in China but \nelsewhere--that send unsafe or tainted products that are unsafe for \nAmerican consumers and especially children. We ought to do the same \nthing to companies that do that over and over again. If they are not \nwilling to abide by the regulatory processes and by the standards we \nset and adopt in this country, then they are not welcome any longer to \nship products to our store shelves. So I offer an amendment that would \nallow us at least the authority--not the requirement, the authority--to \noutright ban products from companies that have a record of persistent \nproblems in sending unsafe or tainted products to our store shelves.\n  Again, I wanted to say that as all of this has played out, this is \nall part of the global economy these days. You know, you produce \nsomewhere and ship it somewhere else, and someone consumes it. I have \nspoken extensively about this, this issue of the global economy that \nhas galloped forward, but the rules have not kept pace. This is one \nmore area where the rules have not kept pace, and this underlying piece \nof legislation is an attempt to establish better rules.\n  Now, the fact is, we cannot force this to work unless we have people \nin agencies who are hired and paid by the Federal Government who want \nto do their job. The fact is, we have had abysmal leadership at one of \nthe agencies that ought to have been involved in stopping this. It is \nunbelievable to me that someone collects a paycheck and has a sense of \nself-worth if they are not interested in standing up for what their \nagency should stand up for, but that has been the case.\n  So we bring a piece of legislation to the floor that is a good piece \nof legislation, that establishes new rules, rules that will provide for \nsafety for American consumers. But we need better management and better \nleadership as well at some of these agencies who have decided they are \ngoing to stand up for consumers too.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4122\n\n  I wish to mention the second amendment I have offered, which is one \nabout which I will not speak at great length. I wish to visit with the \nmanager of the bill at some point. That is an amendment which would \nstrike the provision that allows the Commission to certify a \nproprietary laboratory for third-party testing. I would like to see \nindependent testing. Let me hasten to say I accept the good intentions, \nthe good will of those who wish to test themselves, but in my judgment, \nwhen you have proprietary testing, it is a step or several steps away \nfrom independent testing. I wanted to talk to the manager of the bill \nabout this amendment to see if we can find a way to at least make sure \nall testing that is done represents truly independent testing.\n\n\n                      Strategic Petroleum Reserve\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to finish my comments with another point.\n  Yesterday, I came to the floor, and I was going to offer an \namendment, but there was an objection because my amendment is \nadmittedly not germane. I will not attempt to offer it today. I \nunderstand others are not offering the nongermane amendments, so I will \ncertainly not offer mine, except to say I intend to offer it every \nchance I get. I will find a crevice someplace on an authorization bill \nor I will do it on the Energy and Water appropriations bill that I \nwrite because writing the chairman's mark gives me an opportunity to \nsimply write it in.\n  It deals with this question of today, on Wednesday, we are sticking \n60,000 to 70,000 barrels of oil underground in one of our domes to save \nit for the future, at a point when the price of gasoline is at $3, \n$3.50, going to $4 a gallon and oil is rocketing up around $103 a \nbarrel and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, where we store oil \nunderground for a rainy day, is 97 percent full. We have the \nadministration taking oil from the Gulf of Mexico as royalty-in-kind \nfrom oil wells, and instead of putting it into the supply and \nconverting it to money for the Federal Government, they are sticking it \nunderground and saving it for a rainy day. This is, by the way, a \nsubset of oil called sweet light crude. What that does is put upward \npressure on oil and gas prices at exactly the wrong time.\n  This is not rocket science either. Why would you pick the highest \nprice of oil and say: By the way, the Federal Government has decided, \nin addition to all of the other issues out there with respect to energy \npolicy, we have decided to see if we cannot put some upward pressure on \ngas prices, and they have. Government witnesses testified before the \nEnergy Committee yesterday and admitted that this puts upward pressure \non gas prices. So why on Earth would we stick 60,000 or 70,000 barrels \nof oil a day underground? That is unbelievable to me. It is going to \ndouble. There are going to be 125,000 barrels a day in the second half \nof this year, sticking it in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  I now have a piece of legislation that would say: You cannot do that. \nThere has to be a 1-year pause unless the price of oil goes back below \n$75. But if it does not, there has to be a 1-year pause, that the oil \nhas to go into the supply, not underground.\n  The Federal Government ought not be making things worse for \nconsumers, you know. There are a lot of interests here that are causing \nAmerican drivers to be burned at the stake, but the Federal Government \nis carrying the wood when it is putting oil underground. That makes no \nsense at all. We have OPEC, all of these other issues. We have \nunbelievable speculation in the market, with hedge funds and investment \nbanks knee-deep in a carnival of speculation.\n  We had a witness testify that the oil futures market has become like \na 24/7 casino--never closes. The result of all of this speculation by \npeople who are trading in oil--and they will never have the oil and \nnever get oil, yet they are trading futures contracts and driving up \nthe price every time as all of that speculation goes on. I think that \ndeserves and needs an investigation.\n  Our Federal Government has decided on a policy of taking oil out of \nthe supply and sticking it underground. There is only one word for \nthat; that is, ``nuts.'' We have to stop it.\n  I was not able to offer this amendment on this bill yesterday, but I \nwill be back with this amendment. In my judgment, we will have a vote \non it in the Senate because we have the votes to pass it and say to \nthis administration: Stop it. Put an end to it. Put that oil in the \nsupply and put downward pressure on gas prices and downward pressure on \noil prices.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KOHL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S1574]]\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I have an amendment I would like to offer at \nsome point. I will not do so at this time, but I would like to make \nsome general comments on the subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, the bipartisan amendment I am talking about \naddresses the troubling use of court secrecy. Far too often, our courts \npermit vital information that is discovered in litigation, which bears \ndirectly on public health and safety, to be covered up. Our amendment \nis a narrowly targeted measure that will make sure court-endorsed \nsecrecy does not prevent the public from learning about health and \nsafety dangers.\n  This amendment is a good amendment because it is a complement to this \nbill, and we know private lawsuits are often a critical source of \ninformation about dangerous products. Court secrecy often hinders \nregulatory agencies in their efforts to protect the public.\n  Under the amendment, judges would have to consider public health and \nsafety before granting a protective order for sealing court records and \nsettlement agreements. Judges have the discretion to grant or deny \nsecrecy based on a balancing test that weighs the public's interest and \npublic health and safety hazards and legitimate interests in secrecy \nsuch as trade secrets. The amendment does not place an undue burden on \nour courts. It simply states that in a limited number of cases, judges \nwould have to take a closer look at requests for secrecy.\n  We know there are appropriate uses for these orders and we are \nconfident that our judges will protect information that truly deserves \nit.\n   We are all familiar with well-known cases where protective orders \nand secret settlements prevented the public from learning about the \ndangers of silicone breast implants, IUDs, prescription drugs, \nexploding gas tanks, dangerous playground equipment, collapsing baby \ncribs, and defective heart valves and tires. Had information about \nthese harmful products not been sealed, injuries could have been \nprevented and lives could have been saved.\n   At a December hearing, we learned that while some judges may be more \naware of the issue, this problem continues, and we have examples to \nprove it. Johnny Bradley told us the chilling details of a car accident \ncaused by tire tread separation that killed his wife and left him and \nhis son severely injured. During his lawsuit against Cooper Tire, he \nlearned that information about similar accidents had been kept secret \nfor years through court orders and secret settlements. Today, details \nabout this tire defect remain protected by court orders while Cooper \nTire continues to aggressively fight attempts to make them public.\n   We also heard from Judge Joe Anderson, a Federal district court \njudge in South Carolina. He supports the bill as a balanced approach to \naddress ``a discernable and troubling trend'' for litigants to ask for \nsecrecy in cases where public health and safety might be adversely \naffected. He told us about a local rule in South Carolina, one that \ngoes even further than our amendment, and how it has been a great \nsuccess. The number of trials has not increased and cases continue to \nsettle even though secrecy is no longer an option in that court.\n  I have heard concerns about national security and personally \nidentifiable information so I have included language to ensure that \nthis information is protected. I have also heard concerns about \nprotecting trade secrets. I would like to make it very clear that our \namendment protects trade secrets. We are confident that judges, as they \nare already required to do, will give ample consideration to them as \npart of the balancing test. However, we will not permit trade secrets \nthat pose a threat to public health and safety--such as defective tire \ndesign--to justify secrecy.\n  Some people argue that there is no evidence that protective orders or \nsealed settlements present a significant problem. Just ask the \nthousands of people who took the prescription drug Zyprexa without \nknowing the harmful side effects that were concealed by a secret \nsettlement. Or ask the parents whose children were injured or killed by \ndangerous playground equipment, collapsing baby cribs, ATVs, and over-\nthe-counter medicines.\n  If information about these products had not been sealed, we may have \nknown about the dangers and lives could have been saved. So I hope my \ncolleagues will support the efforts we are trying to bring to bear to \npass this long overdue legislation.\n\n  Thank you so much, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4096\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I want to talk a little bit about an \namendment that has been offered by Senator DeMint to remove a very \nimportant provision of this bill--a very important provision because it \ndeals with whistleblowers.\n  Now, why do we need to protect whistleblowers? Well, let's be honest \nabout this. I think Senator Pryor has done a masterful job of laying \nout the reality of the Consumer Product Safety Commission and, frankly, \nthe tawdry way it has met its responsibilities over the last 7 years. \nWe obviously need to do many of the things that are included in this \nlegislation, and I thank Senator Pryor for his work on this \nlegislation, along with Senator Inouye, Senator Stevens, and Senator \nCollins, because this is important.\n  We are talking about the lives and health and safety of people who \nthink we are on the job. They think their Government is, in fact, \nlooking out for their safety and protection in terms of consumer \nproducts, and the safety of those products.\n  So why do we need whistleblower provisions? Because frankly that is \nour best line of defense. It is, in fact, the people who work at this \nimportant agency who have been most offended at some of the practices \nof this administration in terms of undermining and gutting the work \nthat has been done by the brave, talented, and competent people who \nwork there. So I do not know why we would be reluctant to give them \nwhistleblower protection.\n  This is not a new concept. Whistleblower protection is not a new \nconcept. This Congress has enacted and this President has signed many \nwhistleblower protection laws into being over the last several years. \nLet's review them. These are the same commonsense protections that were \nalready passed by the Senate and signed into law as part of the 9/11 \nImplementation Act and Defense Authorization Act.\n  Since 2000, Congress has passed the following same kind of \ncommonsense whistleblower protections: We have done AIR-21 in 2000 for \nairline industry workers. We have done Sarbanes-Oxley in 2002 for \nemployees of publicly traded companies. We have done the Pipeline \nSafety Act in 2002 for oil pipeline employees. We have done the Energy \nPolicy Act in 2005 for nuclear workers. We have done, as I said, the \nImplementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act in 2007 for \nrailroad and public transportation workers. And, of course, we have \ndone the Defense Authorization Act in 2008 for Department of Defense \ncontractors.\n  Now, why would we want to protect the contractors' employees at the \nDefense Department and not protect the employees in the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission? That does not even make sense. Of course, we \nwant to protect them.\n  Let me give you some examples of what some of the employees have said \npublicly about some of the pressures they face and about the atmosphere \nin which they work. Then you realize the kind of protection they need.\n  One CPSC safety employee said his boss, his superior:\n\n        . . . hijacked the presentation. . . . He distorted the \n     numbers in order to benefit industry and defeat the petition. \n     It was almost like he still worked for them, not us.\n\n  And by ``them,'' he meant the industry that was supposed to be \nregulated and supposed to be made accountable.\n  Another CPSC safety employee said:\n\n       Buyer beware--that is all I have to say.\n\n  Another one:\n\n       So much damage has been done.\n\n  Another one:\n\n       It's a complete disaster.\n\n\n[[Page S1575]]\n\n\n  All of these employees were talking about what they know and what \nthey see in terms of this agency's failings to do the bare minimum, the \nbasic necessities of protecting consumers.\n  In March 2005, CPSC called together the Nation's top safety experts \nto confront an alarming statistic: 44,000 children riding ATV vehicles \nwere injured the previous year, nearly 150 of them killed. Subsequent \nto an alarming presentation by CPSC employees of the dangers and risks, \nthe agency's director of compliance then presented a public view that \nwas unsubstantiated by the research that had been done.\n  The head of the poison prevention unit resigned when the efforts to \nrequire inexpensive child-resistant caps on hair care products that had \nburned toddlers were delayed, and delayed so industry costs could be \nweighed against the potential benefit to unsuspecting children.\n  These whistleblower protections will not shield bad employees. It \ndoes not protect disgruntled employees who make false claims, and it \ndoes not prevent an employer from firing a whistleblower for unrelated \nreasons, such as poor performance.\n  Let's get to the meat of the matter. The President does not like the \nwhistleblower protections. I wish I were surprised. The claim is that \nthe administration thinks this provision of the bill extends new \nwhistleblower protections in ways that are unnecessary. This \nadministration being hostile to a provision protecting whistleblowers \nis a little bit like the Sun coming up. It has gone out of its way to \nlobby against every whistleblower law that has been enacted.\n  This is a very secretive administration, and they are simply hostile \nto the concept of whistleblowing because it sheds light--it sheds \nlight--and public scrutiny on abusive conduct that betrays the public \ntrust.\n  Another claim made by the administration: These provisions are likely \nto result in serious problems for the CPSC in carrying out its mission \nand will cause a serious increase in the number of frivolous claims \nbrought against employers.\n  Yes, the specter of frivolous claims. We always need to be worried \nabout the specter of frivolous claims and frivolous lawsuits. It is not \nreal, this worry from the administration. This provision is designed to \nhelp the dramatically understaffed CPSC enforce the law. It is a \nnecessary enforcement cornerstone for this vital reform to be realized \nmost effectively.\n  With only 400 employees, we cannot expect this agency to find every \nsingle consumer hazard or product that makes its way to consumers. We \nneed to empower the employees to help. We need to protect them if they \nwant to bring the public's attention to the work they have done.\n  There have been numerous concerns expressed about the increased \nburden to be placed on employers because of litigation. Frankly, these \nshrill predictions have been made every single time--every time we have \nconsidered one of the 35 other corporate whistleblower laws that \nCongress has passed.\n  The CPSC whistleblower language retains preexisting effective \nstructural checks against litigation abuses. And this is important; let \nme underline this. There is not one case--not one case--since 1974 \nwhere the CPSC has had to use the structural checks against litigation \nabuses. In other words, this is a complete paper tiger.\n  Let's do what is right here. We should be celebrating whistleblowers, \nwe should be thanking whistleblowers, and, by all means, we should be \nprotecting whistleblowers.\n  I urge the Senate to reject the DeMint amendment that would gut one \nof the important ways we have in this bill to actually protect the \ninnocent consumer from, in fact, having a toy with lead paint or \nanother dangerous product that could do real and irreversible harm to \nmembers of their family.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I wish to address one point related to \nthe amendment that the Presiding Officer and I have, amendment No. \n4105, which is coming up for a vote shortly.\n  I received an e-mail communication from the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission which pledged Chairman Nord's support for our amendment. I \nam pleased she is supporting our amendment which basically bans \nindustry from financing travel when it involves industries the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission regulates.\n  They also clarified in the amendment that there were, in fact, I \nthink 29 instead of 30 trips that were taken in the last 7 years but \nalso that Chairman Nord herself took only 3 of these trips and that the \nrest of the trips were her predecessor who went on trips to places such \nas China. I would point out that one of the trips she took, which they \ncall mundane in this e-mail, was to New York that was financed by the \ntoy industry itself. As my colleagues know, we are now dealing with \nthese toxic toys. Another one she took which wasn't mentioned in her e-\nmail, but I am getting out of the Washington Post article, was $2,000 \nin travel from the Defense Research Institute to attend its meetings in \nNew Orleans on product litigation trends. Her predecessor had attended \nthe same group's meeting in Barcelona.\n  My point is to clarify the record. We are pleased to have Chairman \nNord's support for our amendment. But I would note the issue that \ndoesn't seem to be grappled with in this e-mail is the consumers who \nhave to deal with this--the families with whom Senator Pryor and I met, \nincluding the mother of the little boy who swallowed the Aqua Dot that \nmorphed into the date rape drug--they were not able to finance the \ntravel. They were not able to spend 2 days with the head of the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission to make their case.\n  That is why I believe it is very important, as we look at the ethical \naccountability issues related to the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission, that this amendment pass.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4103\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 4103.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Mr. Cardin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4103.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require the Consumer Product Safety Commission to develop \n           training standards for product safety inspectors)\n\n       On page 5, between lines 21 and 22, insert the following:\n       (c) Training Standards.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Consumer Product Safety \n     Commission shall--\n       (A) develop standards for training product safety \n     inspectors and technical staff employed by the Commission; \n     and\n       (B) submit to Congress a report on such standards.\n       (2) Consultations.--The Commission shall develop the \n     training standards required under paragraph (1) in \n     consultation with a broad range of organizations with \n     expertise in consumer product safety issues.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, this amendment would require that new \nhires of the Consumer Product Safety Commission be adequately trained \nby making sure a study is done on adequate training.\n  First, I wish to take some time, if I might, for one moment to thank \nmy colleagues for bringing the Consumer Product Safety Commission \nReform Act to the floor of the Senate. It is long overdue. There are \nmany important provisions in this act, including dealing with an issue \nthat has been very dear to me, coming from Baltimore, which has been a \ncity actively involved in trying to deal with lead poisoning. I am \npleased this legislation will ban lead in our children's toys and set \nup independent testing to make sure we have an effective way to deal \nwith lead in toys, particularly those that are imported.\n\n[[Page S1576]]\n\n  There are many other important provisions of this act. The amendment \nI called up is an amendment to make sure that as the new hires come to \nthe Commission, these individuals are adequately trained so we can make \nsure they are doing their work appropriately. I believe we will have \nsupport on both sides of the aisle, and I hope that amendment can be \ncleared.\n  I also anticipate offering two additional amendments which have not \nyet been cleared for introduction, and I hope I have a chance to do \nthat on behalf of Senator Obama. One amendment would include the right \nto know for products that are recalled, so the public would know the \nexact information they need so the recall notices are effective. It \nwould include the manufacturer. It would include where the product came \ninto our market. It would include a lot more information, consumer \ninformation, as to how they can get relief. I hope I have a chance to \noffer that amendment at a later point.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to a vote immediately in relation to Klobuchar amendment No. \n4105, as modified, with 2 minutes of debate prior to the vote, equally \ndivided; further, that no second-degree amendments be in order prior to \nthe vote; that following the vote in relation to the Klobuchar \namendment, there be 1 hour of debate on Cornyn amendment No. 4094, as \nmodified, with the time equally divided between Senators Cornyn and \nPryor, or their designees; further, that a vote in relation to the \nCornyn amendment occur at a time to be determined by the two leaders; \nthat no second-degree amendments be in order prior to the vote, and \nthere be an additional 10 minutes of debate prior to the vote in \nrelation to the Cornyn amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4105\n\n  We now have 2 minutes of debate on the Klobuchar amendment. Who \nyields time?\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I will divide my time with Senator \nMenendez. We feel strongly about this amendment. This is an amendment \nthat basically says the Chairman of the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission and other employees cannot finance their travel from the \nindustry they are regulating. This was a major scandal this fall, right \nin the middle of the time that we found out that 29 million toys had \nbeen recalled, that employees of the CPSC were taking travel paid for \nby the industry they are supposed to regulate. It is not consistent \nwith what SEC and other agencies do. We believe this amendment is very \nimportant. We heard from the chairman of the Commission that she \ndoesn't oppose this amendment. Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Minnesota in \nadvocating that all Members of the Senate support the amendment. The \nSenate overwhelmingly voted to do the same as it related to this \ninstitution, this body, in terms of not taking travel from lobbyists. \nThe CPSC should have no less a standard. Consumers should feel safe \nthat, ultimately, those products are going on the market not because of \nthe influence of some trips a Commissioner took.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Klobuchar \namendment.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I have an agreement with the chairman and \nthe next speaker to bring up an amendment and then yield the floor. I \nask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment and send an \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To strike section 31, relating to garage door opener \n                               standards)\n\n       Beginning on page 85, strike line 22 and all that follows \n     through page 86, line 8.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4094\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the managers of this legislation, Senator \nPryor and Senator Stevens, have introduced what I think is, by and \nlarge, a very good bill designed to protect consumers. As a matter of \nfact, I support the expansion of enforcement authority not only to \ninclude the Department of Justice, Federal law enforcement authorities, \nbut also to deputize State attorneys general to seek injunctions for \nviolations of the act. That comes from my experience as serving as the \nattorney general of my State for 4 years.\n\n  I think the State attorneys general can provide additional resources \nin their capacity as the chief consumer protection officer of their \nState to make sure that consumers are protected. Although in talking to \nmy colleagues, the question was raised, well, if there is only an \ninjunction sought, then why do we need a prohibition against \ncontingency fees that might be paid to outside lawyers to whom this job \nwould be outsourced? And the answer to that is, lawyers can get pretty \ncreative sometimes and figure out a\n\n[[Page S1577]]\n\nway to pay an outside lawyer a contingency fee even when all the relief \nthat is granted is an injunction.\n  I want to be clear about what this amendment is and what this \namendment is not. This amendment has no bearing whatsoever on the right \nof an individual if they can't afford any other way to hire a lawyer \nthan based on a contingency fee arrangement. Historically, since the \ndays of England, or Anglo-American jurisprudence, we have recognized \nthe contingency fee as the poor person's key to the courthouse; being \nable to sign a piece of their recovery, whether it is a settlement or a \njudgment of a court, as a way to get into court, to sort of level the \nplaying field.\n  But this is not a case of a person who cannot afford to hire a lawyer \nunless they hire them using a contingency fee. We are talking about the \nFederal Government. We are talking about the State governments. And I \nthink there are important reasons to make sure the people who represent \nthe sovereign State of Texas and the other 49 States or the U.S. \nGovernment are accountable to the public and are not only in it as \nbounty hunters seeking to maximize their recovery without any sort of \npolitical accountability. That lack of political accountability happens \nwhen lawyers for the Government outsource their responsibilities, or at \nleast the job of suing, to private lawyers but without any political \naccountability associated with it.\n  I would point out there are tragic examples of what I am talking \nabout. It is not a hypothetical. Before I was elected as attorney \ngeneral of my State in 1998, my predecessor hired outside lawyers to \npursue tobacco companies in the much ballyhooed tobacco litigation. The \njustification for that was supposed to be that the money was going to \nbe used to stop underage smoking and to try to make sure the public was \nwell educated about the dangers of tobacco. Well, I am sorry to say, as \na result of that litigation, the private lawyers hired by the then-\nattorney general of Texas received more than $3 billion--billion \ndollars--in attorney's fees that I believe should have gone to the \nState of Texas to help in those targeted sorts of programs.\n  There is no accountability. There is no reason the State or the \nFederal Government should have to outsource its responsibilities to \nprivate lawyers. And my amendment is designed to make sure that does \nnot happen under the context of consumer protection.\n  We found out, though, what is being circulated by an organization \nthat used to be called the American Trial Lawyers Association, now \ncalled the American Association for Justice--interesting selection of \nnames--that is opposed to my amendment. It makes clear the concerns I \nhad that ultimately this bill, which would provide only for the \nattorneys general to seek injunctions, is perhaps to be used as a \nvehicle to expand that to allow private lawyers, acting under the \nauthority of the State attorneys general, to seek money judgments \nagainst any business they are big enough and bad enough to sue.\n  As you can see, in the fourth paragraph of this document, it says:\n\n       Proponents of the Cornyn amendment are desperate to prevent \n     an even playing field for consumers. Prohibiting the use of \n     contingency fees will result--as the proponents of the \n     amendment know it will result--in State attorneys general \n     being wholly unable to utilize private attorneys in those \n     very cases where litigation expenses and complexity make the \n     assistance of private attorneys essential.\n\n  It is ironic, that it is the very outside lawyers--the trial \nlawyers--who hope to be hired by the State attorneys general to pursue \nthat litigation who are opposing this amendment, even though they know \nthat under the consumer product safety laws that are currently on the \nbooks it provides for the computation of a reasonable attorney's fee in \nthe recovery and pursuit of a claim. As a matter of fact, it provides \nan attorney's fee based on actual time expended by the attorney in \nproviding the advice and other legal services in connection with \nrepresenting a person in an action brought under this law, such \nreasonable expenses as may be incurred by the attorney in the provision \nof such services, which is computed at the rate prevailing for the \nprovision of similar services with respect to actions brought in the \ncourt which is awarding such fee.\n  So it is, unfortunately, clear this provision, in this otherwise good \npiece of legislation, is being used as a Trojan horse not just to \nprotect consumers but to benefit outside lawyers and to have a lack of \npolitical accountability that is, I believe, required to make sure the \nlawyers who represent the United States of America in the Department of \nJustice or the State attorneys general conduct themselves in an \nappropriate and accountable sort of fashion.\n  I mentioned this before, and I will mention it again, that there are \nexamples where this very arrangement has resulted in corrupt bargains. \nMy predecessor's attorney general has just recently left a Federal \npenitentiary, having served time in prison because he used this outside \nfee arrangement basically to funnel money to a friend. So this is a \nvery real and present problem.\n  It is clear the provisions that have been negotiated between the \ndistinguished Senator from Arkansas and the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska, which would limit it to just seeking injunctions, that perhaps \nthere is a design or plan or the possibility that this will be expanded \nin conference to include authorizing private lawyers to then sue small \nbusinesses and large businesses across the country and authorize the \ndelegation or outsourcing of those responsibilities that the Department \nof Justice or these attorneys general have to outside counsel, with no \naccountability, and the very real prospect that there will be abuse \nand, in some cases perhaps, even corruption.\n  So I hope my colleagues will learn from the experience of the past, \nthe sad experience of the past, where these sorts of arrangements have \nbeen entered into in a way that has resulted in not only not \naccomplishing the goals sought by the legislation but also outright \ncorruption.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4094, as Modified\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be modified, \nwith the changes at the desk, and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is modified under the order.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 58, strike lines 4 through 7 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(g) If the attorney general of a State obtains a \n     permanent injunction in any civil action under this section, \n     that State can recover reasonable costs and a reasonable \n     attorney's fees from the manufacturer, distributor, or \n     retailer, in accordance with section 11(f).\n       ``(h)(1) An attorney general of a State may not enter into \n     a contingency fee agreement for legal or expert witness \n     services relating to a civil action under this section.\n       ``(2) For purposes of this subsection, the term \n     `contingency fee agreement' means a contract or other \n     agreement to provide services under which the amount or the \n     payment of the fee for the services is contingent in whole or \n     in part on the outcome of the matter for which the services \n     were obtained.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nask unanimous consent that the time run equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Reserving the right to object, I did not hear the \nrequest.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I suggested the absence of a quorum and that the time run \nequally on both sides.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, if I may, I will object only for the \npurpose of asking unanimous consent that the document that was depicted \nin the chart be made a part of the record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Oppose the Cornyn Contingency Fees Amendment--Don't Let Opponents of \nStronger Consumer Protections Change the Subject and Weaken Enforcement\n\n       (By the American Association for Justice (formerly ATLA))\n\n       Despite what the bill's opponents wish the Senate to \n     believe, the CPSC Reform Act is not about plaintiffs' \n     attorneys and it is not about allowing state officials to \n     reward their friends or pursue a political agenda. Those are \n     entirely spurious attacks by the bill's opponents, \n     deliberately designed to change the subject and undermine the \n     Senate's will to enact the bill's tough, new standards for \n     manufacturers.\n       Congress has no business (and no constitutional authority!) \n     telling state governments they may not enter into contracts \n     that are perfectly legal under state law. Prohibiting\n\n[[Page S1578]]\n\n     state attorney generals from entering into lawful contracts \n     with private attorneys is designed for one purpose only: to \n     discourage the use of the very enforcement tools that the \n     CPSC Reform Bill sets out to enact.\n       Opponents of the bill know that occasionally state \n     governments will lack the necessary financial resources or \n     the requisite expertise to themselves handle complicated \n     civil actions. In such cases, Congress has no constitutional \n     authority whatsoever to deny these governments their right to \n     enter into lawful contracts under state law.\n        Proponents of the Cornyn Amendment are desperate to \n     prevent an even playing field for consumers. Prohibiting the \n     use of contingency fees will result--as the proponents of the \n     amendment know it will result!--in state attorneys general \n     being wholly unable to utilize private attorneys in those \n     very cases where litigation expenses and complexity make the \n     assistance of private attorneys essential. It is ironic that \n     the defendant corporations backing the Cornyn Amendment \n     themselves employ dozens of outside counsel to protect their \n     own interests in every state. State governments need the same \n     flexibility to bring in additional resources, just as private \n     corporations do.\n        Without the availability of the contingency fee system \n     that has historically allowed state governments to utilize \n     private attorneys, many successful consumer and environmental \n     protection actions brought by state attorneys general would \n     not have been possible. In the past, these actions have led \n     to much faster removal of unsafe products from the \n     marketplace and have protected children from extended \n     exposure to lead paint and protected consumers from unsafe \n     chemicals like arsenic in food and water and formaldehyde in \n     homes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the request of the Senator \nfrom Arkansas is agreed to, and the clerk will call the roll on the \nabsence of a quorum request.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      Amendment Nos. 4094 and 4097\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I rise to oppose amendments offered \nto the Consumer Product Safety Commission bill by Senators Cornyn and \nVitter. Before speaking about these amendments, I first commend Senator \nPryor for his important work on this bill. I know he has been working \non this a long time and we are, as former State attorneys general, \nparticularly pleased to see language in this bill granting State \nattorneys general the authority to obtain injunctive relief against \nentities that violate consumer protection laws. I know Senator Pryor \nand other former attorneys general in this body understand that this \nauthority is an efficient and effective way to enforce consumer \nprotection laws. Unfortunately, the amendments offered by Senators \nCornyn and Vitter would needlessly undercut these important \nprotections.\n  The Cornyn amendment adds the following language to the bill. It \nsays:\n\n       An Attorney General of a State may not enter into a \n     contingency fee arrangement for legal or expert witness \n     services related to a civil action under this section.\n\n  I oppose inclusion of this language in the bill. As an attorney \ngeneral, I was involved in Rhode Island in a very significant piece of \nlitigation which is now successful. We have won the jury case. It was \nfiled on behalf of tens of thousands of Rhode Island children who \neither had been poisoned by lead in paint or were going to be poisoned \nby lead in paint if nothing was done. Without the ability to bring in a \nsignificant law firm to support my office's efforts, we would have been \nsimply blown out of the litigation by the blizzard of dilatory tactics, \nby the paper blizzard that defense attorneys can specialize in. I can \nrecall being forced to chase down a witness list of 100 witnesses to \ntake depositions, not one of whom was called as an actual witness. I \nbelieve it was an effort to create a wild goose chase, to stretch our \nresources, to try to make these kinds of cases painful to attorneys \ngeneral who might dare bring them. The ability of a State to authorize \nits attorney general or recognize the inherent authority of the \nattorney general to enter into these contingency fee agreements is an \nimportant part of that State's own law. Simply put, Congress has no \nbusiness telling elected State attorneys general what kind of contracts \nthey can or cannot enter into which would be perfectly legal under \nState law.\n  I am especially surprised to see what appears to be significant \nRepublican support for this amendment since it contradicts a very basic \nprinciple--federalism. Congress ought to let the States, whenever \npossible, govern themselves. As a former State attorney general who has \nhad this experience of taking on powerful corporations with essentially \nunlimited resources, I believe strongly that State attorneys general \nshould not have their hands tied by Congress so that they cannot \naggressively pursue and punish corporate wrongdoing on a level playing \nfield. That is all they ask for.\n  I will oppose the Vitter amendment for similar reasons. This \namendment requires State taxpayers to pay the legal fees and costs if a \nmanufacturer prevails in a consumer protection suit brought by a State \nattorney general. This appears to be an effort to weaken this important \nbipartisan legislation. First, it would obviously discourage State AGs \nfrom bringing consumer protection cases in the first place. If it looks \nas though something went wrong with the case, you would have to find a \nway to fund your opponent's legal fees. Second, it places an \nunreasonable burden on State taxpayers. Why, for instance, should the \ntaxpayers of Rhode Island have to cover the legal fees for an out-of-\nState, possibly even an out-of-the-United States foreign company that \nhas been charged with violating our consumer protection laws?\n  As a former State attorney general, I well understand that these \namendments will have a significant effect, diminishing the ability of \nState attorneys general to enforce consumer protection laws. If these \nare good consumer protection laws, we want to see them enforced. We \ndon't want to discourage those officials charged with their \nenforcement.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the amendments of my friends \nSenators Cornyn and Vitter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, before I make my remarks on the pending \namendment, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 4 minutes in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               911 Calls\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, 911 calls are a lifeline for those in \ndanger and essential for our public safety personnel to respond quickly \nto emergencies. Public safety communications are a priority for Senator \nInouye and myself as we work together on the Commerce Committee. In \n1967, the President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration \nof Justice recommended that a single number be established to report \nemergency situations. AT established 911 as the emergency code \nthroughout the United States.\n  I come to the Senate today to speak about one of my constituents, a \n4-year-old named Tony Sharpe. He is a preschooler in North Pole, AK. \nWhen his mother collapsed and lost consciousness during a gallbladder \nattack, Tony knew to call 911 because his grandmother had sent him a \nchildren's book called, ``It's Time To Call 911: What To Do in an \nEmergency.'' Tony called 911 and his mother received emergency medical \nhelp. Tony proves that proper education about 911 can help save lives. \nAs a matter of fact, Tony, again, in another emergency, his mother had \ncalled 911 when they lived at another location. Once again, he had the \nprivilege of helping his mother.\n  This week I had the honor of presenting the E-911 Institute's Citizen \nin Action Award to Tony. He sets a fine example for young people \nthroughout the country and Alaskans are very proud of him. Heroic \nactions such as Tony's led Senator Clinton and me to introduce S. Res. \n468. It designates April of 2008 as the National 911 Education Month to \nrecognize the need for education about 911 and make people aware of how \nthe system works with new technologies. Ensuring that 911 is compatible \nwith new communications technologies is crucial to the safety and \nsecurity of all Americans. The E-911 congressional caucus has worked to \npass legislation to improve 911 service. Last week the Senate approved \nS. 428, the IP-Enabled Voice Communications and Public Safety Act. This \nact will require communications services to provide customers with 911 \naccess and establish a framework for IP-enabled\n\n[[Page S1579]]\n\nvoice service providers to coordinate with public safety entities. It \nalso ensures that the next generation of 911 systems reach rural \nAmerica and are available to Americans with disabilities.\n  The Commerce Committee has worked on this bill for several years. I \nlook forward to working with the House to send this bill to the \nPresident as soon as possible. We want to continue to ensure that our \n911 system keeps up with changing communications technology and that \nAmericans of all ages know help is only a phone call away.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4094\n\n  If I may, I want to say I am pleased to be here when the statement \nwas made about the amendment of Senator Cornyn. I have been practicing \nlaw for a few years; as a matter of fact, for well over 50. I do \nremember several instances where we had to have counsel and expert \nwitnesses. The difference here is, what Senator Cornyn is saying is a \ncontingent fee arrangement as an attorney general enforces Federal law, \na decision of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. We want them to \ndo that. But if they need expert witnesses or they need outside \ncounsel, they should make an agreement with them. If they succeed and \nget the decision they seek, they will be entitled to recover those \ncosts under the bill we have before us. Reasonable costs will be \nrecovered. But a contingent fee to be charged by an outside counsel or \nby an expert witness means that if the attorney general is successful \nwithout regard to whether those people are used, they will get one-\nthird, whatever it is, contingent recovery from the defendant.\n  This bill does not contemplate that there is going to be an award of \ndamages in the sense of a normal damage type case. This is an action \nauthorizing the attorney general to enforce a decision and make that \ndecision applicable immediately within his or her State. We are seeking \nan outreach for enforcement, not an outreach for getting damages, \nparticularly for utilizing the services of buddy-buddy lawyers or \nbuddy-buddy expert witnesses to get money from defendants as we seek to \nenforce the decisions of the Consumer Product Safety Commission.\n  I support the Cornyn amendment because I do not like the concept of \ncontingent fees involved in expert witnesses or outside counsel when it \ncomes to this type of enforcement of a Federal decision. It is a \ndecision of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. It should not be \nthe basis for recovery based on contingent concepts in this matter. I \ndo want to make certain that everybody understands the Cornyn \namendment. If it is not properly drafted, I urge that it be changed so \nthat there be no question about the right of an attorney general to \nrecover the cost of the expert witness or recover the cost of the \noutside counsel if it is necessary for the attorney general to have \none. But I do not want to see contingency concepts entered into this \ntype of arrangement.\n\n  I was in private practice involved in plaintiffs' litigation. I \nunderstand full well the concept of contingent fees. They have been \nvery useful in the sense where an attorney takes on a case and \nrepresents a client and, in effect, will do so without any compensation \nat all if they lose. But when they win, they share in that success by \nhaving their fee based upon a contingency rather than upon an agreement \nbased on an hourly basis or a retainment basis.\n  But this is not that kind of situation. This is for an attorney \ngeneral--an official of the State--giving them, at their request, the \nauthority to enforce the Consumer Product Safety Commission's decisions \nin their State immediately rather than wait for someone to come from \nthe Consumer Product Safety Commission to their State and take action \nagainst those who should abide by the decisions of the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission.\n  I support this entirely. It broadens the concept of enforcement. That \nis what we are seeking, that for decisions of the CPSC, to have \nenforcement available in 50 States immediately, if the attorneys \ngeneral wish to do so. That will mean taking these toys and other \nthings off the shelves immediately. But it is not the kind of situation \nthat requires or should need an expert witness.\n  Beyond that, why would someone need an outside counsel on a \ncontingent fee to enforce what has already been decided by the CPSC? \nAll that is necessary is action within the State giving an order to \ngive the attorney general the authority to go take stuff off the shelf \nor to tell the manufacturer to cease and desist. That is not a \nsituation that involves a normal plaintiff litigation opportunity.\n  So I do urge particularly the lawyers in this Senate to understand \nwhat we are doing. We are not creating a contingency-type litigation \nfield. We are only creating a situation where enforcement of the CPSC's \ndecisions are capably extended to 50 States immediately upon a \ndecision, which I think is going to help children. It is going to help \nthe parents.\n  It is not a situation that requires the employment of outside counsel \nor expert witnesses. But if some situation arises where it is necessary \nbecause of a challenge to the defendant, then the attorney general can \nemploy them, can recover the amount in terms of both the attorney's \nfees and the expert witnesses on an agreement basis, not on a \ncontingency basis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I thank Senator Stevens for his comments \non the Cornyn amendment.\n  I oppose the Cornyn amendment for several reasons, although I must \nsay Senator Cornyn has been very fair in his dealings on this \namendment. We have sat down with him. I have talked to him several \ntimes on the Senate floor. But let me give you a few reasons I oppose \nthis amendment. I know some other Senators want to come and speak.\n  First, we have to remember what we are doing in the context of this \nlegislation. We have drafted a bill that contains a provision where the \nState attorneys general can enforce what CPSC says. We made it very \nclear in this statute that the State AGs must follow the CPSC. They \ncannot get out in front of the CPSC.\n  One of the concerns by some in the business community, in fairness to \nthem--not all but some in the business community--is where they have \nhad the concern that there are going to be 51 standards; that it is \ngoing to be a patchwork, a crazy quilt of AGs running around out there. \nThat is not what we are doing in this legislation. I believe we drafted \nthe legislation very clearly, where the attorneys general must follow \nthe CPSC. The CPSC remains in the driver's seat. That is very \nimportant.\n  The second limitation on the States in this legislation is that the \nState AGs can only pursue injunctive relief. In layman's terms, what \nthat means is there are no money damages. They can only pursue \ninjunctive relief. If you think about it, given the nature of what we \nare talking about, I think it is going to be the rare exception when a \nState would ever want to use outside counsel because by the nature of \nwhat we are talking about, if they found some dangerous product that is \nin circulation in their State, they--in my experience as attorney \ngeneral--probably will approach that business, and probably that \nbusiness will immediately respond by taking corrective action. That is \nprobably what happens 99 percent of the time because the company does \nnot want the bad publicity. They do not want the legal headache. Once \nyou point out to them they are in violation of some Federal law, they \nare going to pull those products off the shelves, whatever the case may \nbe. So it is going to be very seldom used.\n  But in the event the company does not do that, in every case I have \never heard of--and I used to be the attorney general of my State of \nArkansas--in every case I have ever heard of, when the attorney general \nsues--excuse me, has to hire outside counsel to do it--those are \ncomplicated and expensive and in some cases long-term cases.\n  This is not one of those kinds of cases. These kinds of cases will be \nthat when they find some violation in their State, they will want to \nact quickly. They will not want to have to go through maybe an RFP \nprocess. Or in our State, we had a statutory process we had to get \nsigned off on by the legislature, signed off on by the Governor. All \nthat takes time; you have to negotiate a contract; you have to bid it. \nI am going to tell you right now, most\n\n[[Page S1580]]\n\nStates are never ever going to use outside counsel when it comes to \ntrying to enforce CPSC rules.\n  Another reason--and this is just a practical reason, where the rubber \nmeets the road--they are not going to pursue outside counsel to help \nthem because it is injunctive relief only. In injunctive relief cases, \nthere is no money, so there is no way to pay for the litigation. I \nthink it is going to be very seldom used.\n\n  Now, I have had brought to my attention--at least one and there may \nbe more--fee agreements that have been negotiated where there is some \nsort of contingent fee based on injunctive relief. Again, I have never \nheard of that. I do not know how you enforce that. If you do a \ncontingent fee based on some value of injunctive relief, that money is \ngoing to have to come out of the State's hide. It is not going to come \nout of the defendant in the lawsuit.\n  So there, again, I think people are concerned about this, and I do \nnot doubt their sincerity but, really, I think you are going to see \nthis happen very seldom, if ever.\n  The last couple of things I want to say about the States attorneys \ngeneral before a couple of my colleagues come and talk on this bill and \nother matters are, we have to remember who the State attorneys general \nare. They are elected officials. They were elected by the same people \nwho elected us. The people in their home States trust them. They like \nthe fact that the attorney general is out there looking after the \npublic interest. They like the fact that the attorney general is \nlooking after public safety issues. I will guarantee you, they like the \nfact they are out there making sure unsafe toys are taken off the \nshelves. So the people of the States, they have elected the attorneys \ngeneral to do things such as this.\n  My experience in Arkansas and in talking to other AGs around the \ncountry is the people in those States have a high level of trust and \nconfidence in their attorney general. And they know--we may not always \nunderstand this--they know the attorney general will not abuse this \nright they will be gaining under our Senate bill.\n  This Cornyn amendment smacks of micromanagement. I understand what he \nis trying to do. I appreciate it and I respect it. Like I said, I do \nnot think you are ever going to see any contingent fee cases anyway. \nBut regardless of that--maybe you will under some circumstances--let's \nallow the States to make that decision.\n  Again, almost all these States have some sort of a legal process they \nhave to go through before they can hire outside counsel. Let's let the \nStates do it. These State AGs in most cases are elected by the people \nof the State. There are a few who are not. A few are appointed by the \nGovernor; appointed in one case by the State supreme court. But, \nnonetheless, let them make that decision. We do not need to micromanage \nthis. Let them do what they believe is in the State's best interest. \nThat is what this bill is all about anyway.\n  So I oppose the Cornyn amendment. But I certainly appreciate Senator \nCornyn reaching out in the manner he has to work with us on this \nlegislation.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be \nrecognized to speak for up to 10 minutes and ask that the time not \ncount against the Cornyn amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much, Madam President.\n  First, I congratulate the manager of the bill, the Senator from \nArkansas, Mr. Pryor, on the outstanding job he has done to develop a \nmodern framework for consumer product safety.\n  There was a time when I was the appropriator for the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission. Also, the Consumer Product Safety Commission is \nlocated in my State. I know what a consumer product safety agency does, \nI know what it should do, and I know what faithful, independent civil \nservants would want to do if they had the right leadership and the \nright authority.\n  I believe what the Senator from Arkansas has done is modernize the \nconsumer product safety framework from when it was originally invented \nin the 1970s. Technology has come a long way. Products are more \ncomplex. Imports are on the rise. We know we need to modernize if we \nare going to protect Americans.\n  I view what the Senator from Arkansas has done as an act of homeland \nsecurity because what is it homeland security does? It protects the \nAmerican people from anyone who has a predatory intent toward the \nUnited States. I believe if you put lead in children's toys, if you \nknowingly look the other way when you make the blood thinner called \nheparin--that is a lifeline to so many people with heart disease--let \nme tell you, if you know you did it, and you know it is coming to the \nUnited States, or you are making something in the United States, \nstanding up to protect the consumer is exactly an act of homeland \nsecurity, and I congratulate the Senator in doing it and the bipartisan \ncoalition he has put together. So he can count on me to support the \nbill.\n  But like any good idea, it can be improved. That is why I am here \ntoday. I have an amendment I wish to discuss that requires any food \nthat comes from a cloned animal or progeny to be labeled. In other \nwords, cloned animals have now been approved by the FDA to be safe for \nhuman consumption, even though most Americans actively oppose cloning \nand scientists say we should monitor it.\n  I have always taken the position that consumers have a right to know, \nthey have a right to be heard, and they have a right to be represented. \nYet when we talk about cloned food entering the marketplace, if it \nenters the marketplace, it has been deemed safe by the FDA, but when it \ncomes to your table, to the restaurant, to school lunch programs, it \nwill be unidentified, it will be unlabeled, and it will be unknown to \nyou. Well, I find that unacceptable.\n  Here we have a picture of Dolly. Sad, isn't it? But nevertheless, \nDolly is the first cloned animal. Dolly, or cows, or other animals, \nhave been deemed safe to enter our food supply. So you could walk into \na restaurant and you could have a ``Dolly-burger.'' You could go to a \nfast food chain or maybe that local malt shop that has so many fond \nmemories for you in Missouri and you could have a ``Dolly milkshake.'' \nYou could have ``Dolly in a glass.'' You could have ``Dolly on a bun.'' \nYou could have ``Dolly on the table.'' You could have ``ground Dolly,'' \n``pattied Dolly,'' ``roast Dolly,'' ``pot roast Dolly.'' But any way \nyou have Dolly, you would not know you were eating Dolly. I say that is \nnot acceptable.\n  What I wish to do, if appropriate, is offer an amendment to the \nconsumer product safety bill, even though it is regulated by the FDA--\nand I acknowledge that--that would label them as being from cloned \nanimals or their progeny.\n  Now, in this bill, we look out for toys, strollers, appliances and \nall of that is right and I salute my colleague, as I have said. But I \nalso wish to look out for the food we put on our table.\n  People say: Well, Senator Mikulski, hey, the FDA approved it. Well, \nthe FDA used to be the gold standard, but we have heard ``it is safe'' \nfor too long. We were told asbestos was safe, but I have men who worked \nin the Baltimore shipyards who traded in their lunch bucket to carry an \noxygen tank because of the lung disease they have. We were told DDT was \nsafe. Do you want to be sprayed with DDT? Then there were people who \nsaid thalidomide was safe. No pregnant woman would take it today. Then \nVioxx was safe. Would anyone with a heart condition or cholesterol want \nto take it?\n  So there are a lot of flashing yellow lights around FDA. Where are \nthey the weakest? In postapproval surveillance. But you can't surveil \nunless you know there is a problem with a product.\n  The National Academy of Sciences said cloned food might be safe, but \nthe science is too new. We need to monitor it. But you can't monitor it \nunless you know where it is. That is why I am for labeling. Labeling \nwould tell us where the food is and we could do that postmarket \nsurveillance.\n  I don't know why there is an urgency to do this--to have cloned food \nenter the marketplace. What labeling would do is it would give \nconsumers the right to know that it is there. It would allow scientists \nto monitor. Also, it would protect our export markets.\n\n[[Page S1581]]\n\n  I have talked about why it would be good science to have labeling so \nwe can monitor and why consumers want to know, but what about the \nexport deal? Well, you know what I worry about? I worry about our food \nbeing banned from exports because they don't know if cloned food is \ncoming into their country.\n  There are those who already called our genetically altered products \n``Frankenfood.'' They call it Frankenfood, and they don't want it to \ncome in.\n  Our European trading partners have exhibited consistent concern about \ngenetically altered products. My State exports food, particularly \nchicken. We are a big chicken State and chicken-producing State. We \nshare that with the Senator from Arkansas. It has helped save our \nagricultural interests down there. So I want us to be able to export, \nand that is why I want whatever is cloned or its progeny to be labeled.\n  While we see Dolly in this photograph, I have to wonder what cloned \nfood accomplishes. We don't have a shortage of food in our country. We \ndon't have a shortage of milk in this country. For those who want to \nproduce Dolly, we can't stop it, but we should stop the effort to put \ncloned food into the food supply without labeling and without informed \nconsent. At the appropriate time, I will offer this as an amendment.\n  At this time, I wish to again thank my colleague for the wonderful \njob he has done. I am glad to be part of the effort. We need more fresh \nand creative and affordable solutions such as the Senator has done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that during this \nquorum call, the time run equally against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4124\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I want to speak for a few moments on my \namendment No. 4124, which focuses on section 31 of the underlying bill, \nthe Consumer Product Safety Commission Reform Act. This section deals \nwith garage door openers.\n  It is important, obviously, as the bill that addresses safety, to \nlook at issues such as garage doors. I remind my colleagues that the \nwhole reason for the Consumer Product Safety Commission is to evaluate \nthe safety of various products. When we as a Senate or as a Congress as \na whole take it upon ourselves to determine what is safe and what is \nnot, we basically violate the principle of what we are trying to do--\nparticularly when we get into even more detail, where we attempt to \nprescribe the particular technology that has to be used on certain \nprojects before it is deemed safe. That totally goes around the idea of \nan expert panel on this commission, with the testing lab that we are \ngoing to fund, using their expertise and resources to determine the \nsafety of a product.\n  This particular section, I am afraid, takes one particular technology \nthat is only used in one product in one State and says that has to be \nthe technology used on all garage door openers. This is something that, \nas a Senate, we all need to stop at this point. The precedent that it \nestablishes for us to prescribe a particular technology violates \neverything we are trying to do here.\n  Let me talk specifically about it for a few minutes. Section 31 \nmandates that all garage doors in the United States include a device \nthat doesn't require contact with an item or person, using \nphotosensors, while prohibiting the sale of other technologies, namely \nthe touch technology, in the United States.\n  Most new garage doors in this country--automatic garage doors--use a \ntechnology where if it touches something on the way down, it stops. It \ngenerally uses the pressure of about 15 pounds.\n  Specifically, the section states:\n\n       Notwithstanding section 203(b) of the Consumer Product \n     Safety Improvement Act of 1990 . . . or any amendment by the \n     American National Standards Institute and Underwriters \n     Laboratories, Inc. of its Standards for Safety-UL 325, all \n     automatic garage door openers that directly drive the door in \n     the closing direction that are manufactured more than 6 \n     months after the date of enactment of this Act shall include \n     an external secondary entrapment protection device that does \n     not require contact with a person or object for the garage \n     door to reverse.\n\n  Keep in mind that it has been deemed safe to use the technology that \nis being eliminated by this bill. The language explicitly says ignore \nthe experts at the Underwriters Laboratories. This effectively requires \nall garage doors to include a photosensor at the bottom of the door \nthat reverses the door direction.\n  Why is this a problem? This provision puts Congress in the position \nof picking and choosing winners and losers in a highly technical area \nof safety regulation. No Senator has the expertise to determine what is \na safe garage door technology. Most of the Members of this body are \nlawyers or businessmen, physicians and veterinarians, and we should not \nsubstitute the judgment of Senators who, by and large, have no \ntechnical background for the expertise of the engineers at the \nUnderwriters Laboratories. By legislatively mandating that only one \ntechnology is safe, we are doing just that--requiring garage door \nmanufacturers who sell garage doors to include these devices, \nincreasing the cost to consumers, and it discourages innovation in the \nfuture. If we say this is the technology that has to be used, then the \nchances of new technology which improves safety and convenience in the \nfuture are diminished. Legislatively mandating that only one type of \ntechnology is safe enough for us in the United States will also help \ncertain companies at the expense of others and discourage innovation in \none of the areas where innovation is most important and should be \nencouraged, which is consumer product safety.\n  This will mandate away free market competition. It will boost the \nsales of companies that sell this required technology while hurting the \nsales of those that do not.\n  The Door and Access Systems Manufacturers Association, which is an \nassociation representing garage door manufacturers, recently voted on \nwhether they would support this provision. They voted 14 to 1 to oppose \nthe provision. I will let you guess who the one vote was that voted \nagainst it. It was Chamberlain, the company that makes the technology \nthat is required in this legislation.\n  The inclusion of this provision in the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission Reform Act represents why the American people do not trust \nCongress. It represents Washington politics as its very worst. After \nthe experts approved a competing technology for sale in the United \nStates, this one company, Chamberlain, retained a high-powered lobbying \nshop in Washington and paid them in excess of $140,000 to secure \ninclusion in this provision. Because of the connections to the lobbying \nfirm, it was able to secure proposed Federal legislation that would \nprotect its company from competition.\n\n  Is the technology that the bill mandates the only safe technology? \nNot at all. According to the experts at Underwriters Laboratories, the \ntechnology the bill mandates is safe, but it is not the only safe \ntechnology. The Underwriters Laboratories, through its standard product \ncertification process, has certified another technology as safe, which \ndoes not use a photosensor but uses approximately 15 pounds of \nresistance to trigger a reverse on the door.\n  For example, according to the Architect of the Capitol, the doors of \nthe Senate subway that we all ride on, which carries thousands or maybe \nmillions of people per year from the Dirksen to the Hart Senate office \nbuildings, uses touch technology. If it touches an\n\n[[Page S1582]]\n\nobject that provides more than 30 pounds of resistance, the doors will \npop back open. The Senate daycare also uses the same technology on its \ndoors, which reopen if they touch an object with 8 to 15 pounds of \nresistance. Thus, the technology that the Underwriters Laboratories \nfound safe, which this bill deems unsafe, requires less resistance than \nthe Senate subway doors and approximately the same resistance as the \nSenate daycare doors to reverse the course.\n  The fact is that touch resistance technology is being used all over \nour country today very successfully and safely. This bill prohibits its \nuse in the future. The reason it prohibits it is one of the reasons \npeople don't trust us here--because it is clearly not there to make \nAmerica and American products safer, but to do a specific favor for a \nconstituent with a lobbying firm that puts pressure here on Congress.\n  Why do my colleagues need to support striking section 31? As I have \nsaid several times, I think it represents the worst of the legislative \nprocess here, and we all know better. Congress should not use its power \nto override the opinions of congressionally designated experts, unless \nwe have proof they are wrong. We should not promote legislation that \nwould pick winners and losers in the marketplace. We should not pass \nlegislation that would discourage innovation, especially when it comes \nto ensuring we have the safest technology possible to protect our \nchildren.\n  By striking section 31 of the Consumer Product Safety Reform Act, \nthis amendment would give the experts at Underwriters Laboratories the \nfinal say in determining what technologies are safe for sale in the \nUnited States. The amendment would not give a competitive advantage to \nany company, and it does not strike any safety provisions. It simply \nrestores the law to where it is today. It would only require that the \nexperts decide what technologies are safe in the United States, which \nis the purpose of the whole bill. We give more funding to the \nCommission. We give them a more sophisticated testing lab to use. We \nare empowering the best experts in the country. It is not our job to \ncome in and try to give one company an advantage because it happens to \nbe in the State we represent.\n  Mr. President, I hope all of my colleagues will support the amendment \nto strike section 31 from the underlying bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, let me say that, again, I thank the \nSenator from South Carolina for being very constructive during this \nprocess and working on this legislation this week. We sat with him and \nhis staff on a number of occasions to try to work through language in \namendments. He has been a delight to work with on this matter. I \nappreciate that.\n  Let me talk about this garage door provision that is in the Senate \nbill. I think it is important for colleagues to understand the history \nof why, and why it is in there. You can look at existing law and, \nbasically, what the Congress did years ago was to more or less allow \nUnderwriters Laboratories to set the safety standards for garage doors. \nFor years and years, there was a two-part safety standard. One dealt \nwith pressure for a motorized garage door that, when it hit a certain \nlevel of pressure, would stop and reverse, and also some sort of \nnoncontact systems, where if someone were to pass under the garage \ndoor, such as a baby crawling or whatever it may be, it would trigger \nthese sensors and the door would never come down and touch in the first \nplace. That has been the standard in this country for a long time.\n  But what has happened over the last year or so, UL has changed their \nstandards and they have actually gone, in my view, backward by saying \nthis pressure sensor is enough. They have updated the standard--and I \nmay be overgeneralizing that a little, but they are basically saying \nyou don't need that second safety mechanism. We all probably remember \nthe years of the 1970s and 1980s when it was common for garage doors to \nkill people. It is not as common anymore, and power garage doors are \nmuch more common today than they used to be.\n  In section 31, we tried to not just restore the old law, but we tried \nto enhance it and improve it. This is what it says:\n\n       All automatic garage door openers that directly drive the \n     door in the closing direction that are manufactured more than \n     6 months after the date of enactment of this Act shall \n     include an external secondary entrapment protection device \n     that does not require contact with a person or object for the \n     garage door to reverse.\n\n  This is a technology-neutral provision. Many companies make this \nlaser technology we have all seen. I used to have one on my garage door \nwhere there is a mechanism that shoots a little beam of light. When you \ninterrupt that contact somehow--I don't know exactly how it works--it \ntriggers the door, stops it, and it opens. That is actually a fairly \ncheap piece of technology. I have heard estimates of that technology \ncosting something around $10 per door. I am sure it depends on the \nbrand, who installs it, where you buy it, et cetera. Roughly, as I \nunderstand, it is about $10 per door. It is very cheap, very \ninexpensive, very effective. That is the traditional laser technology.\n\n  As we might expect in today's world, there are all kinds of new \nemerging technologies. We do not know what the future holds. We do know \nthat this technology the automakers are putting on their bumpers now, \nthe reverse indicator, the backup warning--when you are backing up your \ncar, some cars that have this technology will beep when you get too \nclose to an object behind. Apparently, as I understand it--do not ask \nme to explain it in any detail--apparently, that is some sort of radar \ntechnology. Again, it is pretty cheap and pretty effective. Supposedly, \nthe garage door people are coming up with some sort of new radar \ntechnology that some believe may be better or may be a good \nalternative, at least, to the laser technology. Apparently, there are \nother types of motion sensors. Again, I don't know all the technology, \nand I don't know how the technology is going to emerge.\n  What we are trying to do with this provision in this act is, quite \nfrankly, have a little belt-and-suspenders here. We want to make sure \nwe have two safety mechanisms on doors. That has really been, again, \nwhat Underwriters Laboratory set as the U.S. standard for years and \nyears. Now they reversed that standard. I think they are going in the \nwrong direction. They are going back to basically one type of safety \ndevice, not having two per door. This is a stronger safety provision \nthan what is currently under U.S. law.\n  Another point I wish to mention is there has been some discussion \nthat this might set a bad precedent for us, the Congress, to set a \nsafety standard; isn't this what CPSC is supposed to do? The answer is \nyes, this is what they are supposed to do, but there are many occasions \nwhere the Congress has specifically laid out safety standards. I will \ngive a few: lawn mowers; garage door openers; bicycle helmets; a toy \nthat has been banned called Lawn Darts that was unsafe, and Congress \nactually banned it; lead-lined water coolers. There are safety \nstandards Congress has mandated on refrigerators and other products. \nCertainly, we authorize CPSC to come up with a lot of safety standards, \nand they should; they are the experts, but there have been many \noccasions in the past where Congress has laid out a safety standard for \na specific product or specific item.\n  Here, again, this approach we are utilizing in section 31 is a little \nbit redundant. With safety, it is not all bad to be redundant. It is a \nlittle bit of belt-and-suspenders. Again, it basically would \nreestablish a previous standard in the United States that when you have \na power garage door, there would be some sort of pressure mechanism \nwith the motor, that when it feels the right amount of pressure, it \nwill stop and reverse.\n  Also, there will be some, as it says, external secondary entrapment \nprotection device. In other words, it would be separate from the motor. \nThis is a very technology-neutral, very vendor-neutral phrase, and we \nwill let the industry sort out what an ``external secondary entrapment \nprotection device'' may mean because there may be technology on the \ndrawing board today we know nothing about, maybe designs of these \ngarage door systems about which we know nothing. Nonetheless, we want \nto make sure we have that double protection.\n\n[[Page S1583]]\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I appreciate the Senator's comments. I \ndo wish to make it clear that while Congress has set many safety \nstandards, it is very unusual for us to select and prescribe the \ntechnology that will be used to achieve those standards. For instance, \na bicycle helmet has to take a certain amount of impact, but we do not \nprescribe what that helmet is to be made of. We do the same with \nautomobiles and impact. We need to tell the safety labs, the \nmanufacturers, what standards they have to achieve, but when we start \npicking the technology, we get way out of bounds.\n  I have the UL standards in front of me. I just need to clarify what \nmy colleague from Arkansas said because the standard does require a \nprimary reversing system as well as a secondary reversing system. So \ncurrently, most garage doors are going to have a system in the motor, \nand if it senses resistance, it will reverse, and there needs to be a \nsecondary system. The way that is done today is either by some photo \ntype of mechanism where if something crosses the path between the door \nand the bottom, it stops and reverses. That is one way. The other way \nis pressure sensitivity along the bottom of the door itself. But what \nthe underlying bill does--the UL standard is it has to be an equivalent \nsecondary safety measure; it has to be the photo type of system or the \ntouch system. But this bill says it has to be the photo system. \nFrankly, from what we understand from talking with some consumers, \nthere is not necessarily a lot of satisfaction with just the photo \nsystem because a door that goes down can be opened by a leaf blowing \nunderneath it. But the touch system has been deemed just as safe by the \nUnderwriters Lab, but it does not have the same inconvenience.\n  What we are asking is that we stick to the standards that are here, \nthat we have a primary and a secondary reversing system but we allow \nthe industry to pick whether it is a photo type of reversing system or \na touch system, and let the UL system we have set up, the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission, determine which is safe and which is not. \nThis bill says that only one way is safe for the secondary reversing \nsystem. Actually, the industry has already proven that there are other \nsafe ways to do it which we need to continue to allow.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for the opportunity to debate. I \nappreciate the intent of this amendment, which is to make garage doors \nsafer, but I think we can leave the technology to the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise today to oppose the DeMint \namendment No. 4124 and explain why the garage door safety provision in \nthe Consumer Product Safety Reform Act is really important.\n  Garage doors inherently pose a risk to families, particularly small \nchildren who could be crushed by the doors. The doors often weigh more \nthan 300 to 400 pounds. Many families open and close them a lot of \ntimes during the course of a day. The 12 inches between closing the \ndoor and the floor, they call it the crush zone. A tremendous amount of \nforce is generated as gravity pulls this 300- or 400-pound door down \nand it starts to come to the floor of the garage. This crush zone is a \nreal risk for children, particularly small children. Small children \nlive close to the ground--we all know that--and they are always in the \ncrush zone when they are near a garage door.\n  For some time, this has been a serious risk. In the 1970s and 1980s, \n67 deaths caused by garage doors were reported to the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission, and there were even more serious injuries. Most of \nthese were caused by entrapment under the door.\n  Congress stepped in and passed legislation in 1980 that included a \ngarage door safety standard requiring that doors have what is called an \nexternal secondary entrapment device. We directed Underwriters \nLaboratory to modify its standards. We gave it the force of a product \nsafety rule.\n  The primary device most often is the drivetrain of the garage door. \nWhen there is an obstruction in the door's path, the drivetrain \nreverses. So if the door is coming down and senses something, it goes \nback up. In other words, when the door hits a person or object, the \ndrivetrain will reverse. Unfortunately, this primary device does not \nalways do the job adequately. That is why Congress required a secondary \ndevice to protect consumers.\n  The secondary device deployed by garage door installers for the past \n15 years has been an optical sensor. This is technology that anyone who \nhas owned a garage door over the last 15 years is familiar with. If you \ndo not know it, go home and take a look. When your garage door comes \nup, look down at the bottom near the guide on one of the sides of the \ngarage door, and you will see a tiny little photosensor light. It is \nlike a beam of light. It is trained on another receptor on the other \nside of the garage door opening. It creates this photosensor. If you \nwalk across that between those two devices, you trip it, and the garage \nlight usually goes on, and the garage door knows someone is there, \ndon't let the door come down.\n  We are trying to make this standard so no matter what kind of \nmechanical device you have that brings the door down, you are always \ngoing to have the secondary noncontact sensor. The door does not have \nto hit me in the head to turn around. I can trip it by walking through \nthat doorway and breaking that photosensor light.\n  Senator DeMint wants to eliminate that safety requirement. He \nbelieves it is unnecessary. First, let's put it in perspective, if we \ncan.\n  How much do you think those little light devices cost? The answer? \nFive dollars. That is what it costs to buy those two little \nphotosensors, one on each side of your garage door.\n  How much does a garage door cost? It is about $200 or $300 for the \ndevice to move it up and down. You can pay up to $1,000 for the whole \ndoor; $5 for the photosensor to save the child who is walking into the \ngarage versus the $1,000 for the door. Is it worth it? If it is my kid, \nit is worth it. If it is my grandson, it is worth it. If it is about \nthe neighbor's kid whom I dearly love, too, it is worth it.\n  Well, Senator, you didn't tell us how much it costs to install it. It \nturns out it costs $15 to install it--$20 total cost for this safety \ndevice on a $1,000 garage door, and Senator DeMint says we don't need \nit.\n  Underwriters Laboratory that he quotes, in fairness to him, has been \nin the midst of deciding whether we move away from the photosensor to \nnot requiring it. But they come out with a minimum requirement for \nsafety.\n  What I am suggesting is, it is worth 20 bucks to every garage door \nowner and installer in America and to every family to have the peace of \nmind of this safety. Is it worth one kid's life, $20? I think it is \nworth a lot more. I think it is worth a lot for us to include it, and I \nam glad it is in the bill.\n  The secondary device deployed by garage door installers, as I said, \nfor 15 years has been this optical sensor. It is not new, questionable \ntechnology. It works. I have seen it work on my own garage in \nSpringfield, IL. I wondered why the garage door wouldn't come down. \nFinally, I figured it out. The optical sensor lights were not tracking \non one side. A simple little adjustment, and everything worked fine. \nThe minute I crossed those lights, the garage door mechanism knew not \nto close. When an object breaks the beam, the garage door reverses.\n  Since this requirement has first been put into effect, during the \nlast 15 years, injury and fatality rates by garage doors have dropped \ndramatically--dramatically. An ounce of prevention, that is what we are \ntalking about here, a $20 expense to make sure a child is not injured \nor crushed by a 400-pound garage door coming down.\n  The Underwriters Laboratory standard for garage doors was modified in \nthe late 1990s to allow for a new type of technology to serve as the \nsecondary device. That technology, like the primary device, required \ndirect contact. The problem with this standard is it relies entirely on \ncontact when an effective, inexpensive system that does not require \ncontext exists.\n  Underwriters Laboratory is a fine organization. I have worked with \nthem over the years, and I really believe they do a good job. But they \ndo not provide maximum protection. They provide minimum protection. \nThis bill, asking for another $5 device and $20 total cost, is going to \nprovide even more protection for families.\n\n[[Page S1584]]\n\n  Who supports this bill? Who supports this amendment that Senator \nDeMint wants to strike? The Consumer Federation, the Consumers Union, \nU.S. PIRG, and Public Citizen. Those four are the leading groups on \nconsumer safety in America today. None of them work for any companies. \nThey work for the common good, for families across America, trying to \nmake sure safety and consumer interests are protected. They joined in a \njoint letter saying they support the language that is both appropriate \nand protective of consumer safety and that a noncontact sensor is a \nvaluable safety requirement.\n\n  I know my friend has offered this amendment in good faith, but I \nwould tell him, I believe that requiring this photosensor and \nprotecting kids who might wander into this crush zone is not too much \nto ask. I would rather vote for this and have somebody say it is belt \nand suspenders than to have on my conscience that we walked away from \nthis tiny, almost insignificant cost to the garage door, than lose a \nchild's life in the process. That would be something which would be \nhard for me to reconcile.\n  So I urge my colleagues to join the leading consumer groups across \nAmerica, join the cause of common sense, and be willing to put a $20 \ncost onto a garage door and possibly protect the life of an innocent \nchild.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I would like to clarify some of the \nfacts my colleague is talking about because there is nothing in my \namendment to strike or prohibit the use of this phototechnology. If \nthat is deemed the safest by the manufacturer, then certainly it can be \nused. But the secondary reversing device that uses touch technology has \nhad no injuries. It has been deemed safe as well. In the future there \nare likely to be even better and safer and maybe even more economical \nways to make garage doors safe.\n  The reason we need to strike this provision is because it limits \nconsumer safety to one idea--one idea that exists today. It prescribes \nfor the UL laboratories that it has to be done this particular way \ninstead of us saying, as a Congress, it has to be safe. If we want to \nprescribe those standards, that is fine, but I am afraid we are \ndistorting the information. We need to allow the opportunity for \ninnovation in safety in all areas.\n  There is nothing that says this phototechnology is any safer than the \ntouch technology we have talked about, which is another option being \nused by garage door companies today. So the argument to keep this in is \ntotally parochial. It is not about safety for children, which has been \nspoken about today.\n  We believe the current standards that have a primary and secondary \nreversing system are important and that we need to encourage \nmanufacturers to innovate on the safest ways to make that happen and \nthat the labs we have put in charge of determining safety can look at \nthese different ways to make garage doors safe and tell us which ones \nare the safest and tell consumers which ones are the safest. It makes \nabsolutely no sense, and it is a terrible precedent for us as a Senate \nto come in and say: This is the technology that always has to be used \nin order to be safe, and we have no standard associated with it. We \nsay, this is the technology.\n  Our job is to set the safety standards and say products should be \nsafe, not to act on behalf of companies that happen to be in our States \nand say you use their technology or you don't use any at all. That is \nnot what my amendment says. My amendment says: Find the very best \ntechnology, make it as safe as possible, but don't prescribe how that \nhas to be done.\n  Madam President, I yield back.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote in \nrelation to the Cornyn amendment, No. 4094, as modified, occur at 4:45 \np.m., with the provisions of the previous order remaining in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I wish to address my colleagues here for a \nminute and tell them about our status and what we are trying to \naccomplish this week. Of course we are on the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission reauthorization bill.\n  Again, I thank all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their \nspirit of cooperation that we have seen all week. It has been \nexemplary. I appreciate it. I have told several of you that privately \nand publicly. It has been great.\n  Our status is right now we are going to have a vote at 4:45 on the \nCornyn amendment. It deals with attorney's fees with regard to \nattorneys general. We are going to have a vote on that.\n  Then we would love to set up more votes tonight. We have several \namendments that have been filed that are pending. It is not a long \nlist, but we do have several. We would love for Senators, if at all \npossible during this vote, to come and talk to me or talk to Senator \nStevens or talk to our staffs about how you wish to see your amendments \nsequenced.\n  I think it is very realistic that we can finish this bill tomorrow. \nAt some point tonight, we are all going to sit down and begin to work \nvery diligently on a managers' package. We have had several amendments, \nnoncontroversial, or that we have made modifications to. There has been \na lot of progress made. I know sometimes when you watch the Senate you \nwonder if anything is going on. A lot of progress has been made. Again, \nI thank all of my colleagues for that.\n  So we are going to sit down tonight and work through a managers' \npackage. If a Senator wishes their amendment included in the managers' \npackage, please let me or Senator Stevens know. We are going to be \nworking on that very diligently tonight. That is where we stand.\n  We encourage people, if they want votes for their amendments, to \nplease let us know. We encourage people to come in and talk about their \namendments. We encourage Senators to work together and either try to \nget their language included in the managers' amendment or have a vote \non it tomorrow or tonight. We would love to have some more votes \ntonight. We think there are at least one, two, or three that we may be \nable to vote on tonight, realistically. So I wanted to alert Senators \nto that fact.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if I can engage the Senator from Arkansas \nfor a minute to clarify. I do have this amendment that is germane that \ndeals with a chemical that has shown up in microwave popcorn and has \nproved to be fairly deadly to workers; in one case at least that we \nknow about, in consumers.\n  I understand we are having a vote in 5 minutes. Would it be amenable \nif I spoke about this amendment? I believe it is at the desk. The \namendment is at the desk. If I could speak about it until it is time to \nvote. Would that be something you would encourage?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Yes. I have no objection to that. We have spoken on the \nCornyn amendment extensively.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have the time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas controls the \nbalance of the time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am confused. Can someone explain that--I had the time. \nI was recognized by the Chair--as to why I do not have the time?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There was a previous order \nallocating 10 minutes, and the majority's time has expired.\n\n[[Page S1585]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that I have 2 minutes before \nSenator Cornyn to explain this amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would add 2 minutes, if that is okay, and then I am \ndone.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I \nam happy to do that as long as I preserve my 5 minutes before the vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Of course that was my intent, Mr. President. I mean no \ndisrespect in any way.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4127\n\n  I wanted an opportunity to talk about an amendment that I have at the \ndesk. It is germane. It would ban certain uses of a chemical that poses \nvery serious health risks to the lungs of consumers and workers.\n  In recent years, scientific evidence has mounted that a chemical \ncalled diacetyl seriously harms the lungs of workers in factories \nmaking microwave popcorn. I am sure you have read about it, because \nthere is a huge list of stories that appeared in the press about \ndoctors linking illnesses to this particular chemical.\n  Also there is documentation that says that the large popcorn \nmanufacturers have banned this chemical. But we do not have a ban in \nlaw, which means it is simply not fair. We have some companies that \nhave banned it, but we have not acted to ban it. I think it is so \ndangerous. It causes the tissue inside the lungs to get clogged and \ncreates scar tissue and inflammation and it leaves the victim \nstruggling to breathe.\n  That is the reason Senator Kennedy has teamed up with me on this \namendment. The severity of the lung symptoms can range from only a mild \ncough to a severe cough, shortness of breath. These symptoms do not \nimprove when the worker goes home at the end of the day, and severe \nsymptoms can occur suddenly. The worker may experience fever, night \nsweats, and weight loss. Doctors were very puzzled, but they finally \nfound a link with this chemical.\n  I am not going to go on. I have a lot more to say on this. I hope it \nwill not be necessary for us to have an argument about this, since the \nlarge companies have already banned it. It seems to me only right that \nwe follow their lead and do so in law. My amendment simply levels the \nplaying field for all microwave popcorn makers, including importers and \nsmall manufacturers, by banning this chemical, diacetyl. I urge my \ncolleagues at the appropriate moment to please support this.\n  I will say to the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Pryor, if it is \npossible, I hope this will not be controversial. Perhaps it could be \npart of the managers' package.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4094, As Further Modified\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask that my amendment be modified with \nthe changes at the desk. My modification makes clear that the expert \nwitness fees are part of the recoverable costs and fees that the State \nattorneys general can recover. I appreciate Senator Stevens for raising \nthis concern to me and hope my modification is responsive to his \nconcerns.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment of the Senator from \nTexas has already been authorized.\n  The amendment, as further modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 58, strike lines 4 through 7 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(g) If the attorney general of a State obtains a \n     permanent injunction in any civil action under this section, \n     that State can recover reasonable costs, expert witness fees, \n     and reasonable attorney fees from the manufacturer, \n     distributor, or retailer, in accordance with section 11(f).\n       ``(h)(1) An attorney general of a State may not enter into \n     a contingency fee agreement for legal or expert witness \n     services relating to a civil action under this section.\n       ``(2) For purposes of this subsection, the term \n     `contingency fee agreement' means a contract or other \n     agreement to provide services under which the amount or the \n     payment of the fee for the services is contingent in whole or \n     in part on the outcome of the matter for which the services \n     were obtained.''.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, first we are told that the reason why \nState attorneys general need to be explicitly authorized under this \nstatute to pursue these consumer complaints is so there is no risk of \nrunaway lawsuits, because they will be confined to seeking an \ninjunction in Federal court. I actually support that provision of the \nbill.\n  Then we are told there is an objection to my amendment, which would \nprohibit State attorneys general from entering into contingency fee \narrangements in order to pursue authorized activities under this bill, \nthat there is no reason for the amendment. Next thing I know, there is \na document circulated by the American Trial Lawyers Association arguing \nthe only way consumers can get access to the court is by allowing the \noutsourcing of the responsibility of the State attorneys general under \na contingency fee arrangement which makes me mighty suspicious whether \nthis is, in fact, a Trojan horse to allow trial lawyers basically to do \nthe work elected State attorneys general should be doing and that \ncurrently the Department of Justice is doing. All my amendment is \ndesigned to do is to make sure the purpose for which the State \nattorneys general are authorized--that is, to seek an injunction only--\nis maintained and that it not be allowed to serve as a Trojan horse to \noutsource these responsibilities. There are some very important public \npolicy reasons for that. No. 1, trial lawyers hired by State attorneys \ngeneral are not accountable to the public.\n  We have seen examples. I mentioned some in the tobacco litigation, \nwhere there were serious abuses that could not be rectified by the \nelectorate when it came to holding public officials accountable. Those \npublic officials in some cases left office; some, such as my \npredecessor, as attorney general in Texas, went to Federal prison \nbecause of misconduct associated with those kinds of arrangements. This \namendment is prophylactic in nature. But I will tell you I am concerned \nit has been mischaracterized. It will not prohibit State attorneys \ngeneral from contracting with outside lawyers on an hourly rate \narrangement under the same circumstances under which lawyers can be \nreimbursed now. But it will prevent the sort of trophy hunting and the \noutlandish attorney's fees that were awarded in the tobacco litigation \nthrough these contingency fee arrangements. It is something that is \nwithin the power of this body to correct. I hope my colleagues will \njoin me in passing this commonsense amendment which is entirely \nconsistent with the underlying purposes of the bill. I worry this is \nbeing used as a Trojan horse for other purposes. But if my amendment is \npassed, I think we can all lay this matter to rest and realize \nconsumers will be protected, but it will not be used as a pretext for \nenriching private lawyers and political constituencies.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. CORNYN. My understanding is there was 10 minutes divided. If \nthere is no other response, I will yield my time back, if the majority \nyields back their time.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I yield back my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time is yielded.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I move to table the Cornyn amendment and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nByrd), the Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), and the Senator from \nIllinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Leahy).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have had a conversation with the \nRepublican leader--in fact, several of them. I have talked to the two \nmanagers of the bill, Senator Stevens and Senator Pryor. We have made \nvery good progress on this bill. As I said when we opened this morning, \nI think this is a good way to legislate. We are on this piece of \nlegislation. It is a bipartisan bill that the Commerce Committee spent \ndays of their time working on to get to the point where we are now. Is \nit a perfect bill? From my perspective, it is really good. Others who \nknow the issue better than I may not think it is perfect, but I think \nit is a pretty good piece of legislation. We have had a number of \namendments offered, and we have voted on several of them.\n  At this stage, there is nothing that I think we can vote on tonight. \nI want the managers to work during the evening to see if there is \nsomething we can do tomorrow constructively to move toward finalizing \nthis.\n  The Republican leader and I usually don't agree on issues such as \nthis, but I think it would be to the benefit of the Senate if--before \nwe go out tonight, I am going to file a cloture motion, just to protect \nus in case it appears we are not going to be able to finish. I have \ntold Senator Stevens that when I file that tonight, I will say--and I \nwill say it here--that we can go to third reading anytime tomorrow when \nthis issue is over with and we, of course, won't do the vote on \ncloture. If this doesn't work, then Friday we will have to have a \ncloture vote. So I hope everyone understands the good intentions of the \ntwo managers and everyone else who has been involved in this piece of \nlegislation.\n  So I will come out later tonight and formally file a cloture motion. \nUntil then, I hope more progress can be made on the legislation. I \nthink it is fair to say there will be no more votes tonight.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 4096 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the DeMint \namendment No. 4096 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, just to reiterate what the leader said a \nfew moments ago, we are making great progress. Again, I thank my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle. Everyone has been very \nreasonable.\n  My sense is that this body really wants to get this done tomorrow. I \ncan tell my colleagues right now that our staffs will be working, \nburning the midnight oil tonight trying to put together a managers' \npackage. We made progress during this vote, with one or two amendments \ngoing away.\n  So thank you to all of my colleagues who have been working so hard to \nget us where we are today. We will continue to work. Again, if any \nSenator's staff wants to come and talk to us about amendments or \nsomething they would like to see in the managers' package, now is the \ntime to do it because we are about to work very hard to try to get this \nbill done tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rose to address the Senate less than a \nweek ago about this present economic set of circumstances in the \ncountry. Obviously, the foreclosure issue is a major question that is \ncausing serious problems all over the country. In fact, it is now \nbecoming more of a global issue than just a domestic issue. I know \nthere have been serious efforts, and I commend the majority leader and \nothers who have tried to put together--along with those of us on the \nBanking Committee, the Finance Committee, and the Judiciary Committee--\na proposal that would offer some hope and some confidence-building \nmeasures to grapple and deal with the foreclosure issue, which is the \nepicenter, obviously, of this economic crisis we are all seeking \nanswers to.\n  I thought it might be worthwhile to take a couple of minutes this \nafternoon to again urge the minority--I have worked closely with \nSenator Shelby, and let me just report on a favorable note that I think \nwe are fairly close to having an FHA reform bill that we will be able \nto adopt very quickly. While that is not going to solve all of the \nproblems, it is yet another piece in this economic puzzle that deserves \nour attention. I am hopeful and confident we will be able to do that in \nrelatively short order.\n  I commend the chairman of the Financial Services Committee, \nCongressman Frank, Barney Frank of the other body, for his work--the \nwork they put together on a bipartisan basis in the House--and his \nwillingness to compromise on this issue so that we can achieve a \nproposal that would enjoy broad-based support both here and in the \nother body.\n  This issue we are facing today is a very serious one. I hope all of \nmy colleagues appreciate that statement. That is not hyperbole; the \nrealities are there. One cannot pick up a morning newspaper--it is no \nlonger just in the business section; these issues are now front-page \nstories with fears of growing economic dislocation, a slowdown in \nour economy that we have not seen in years, with housing values falling \nnationally at rates that one has to go back literally to the Great \nDepression to find similar national statistics. We have rising \nunemployment rates and rising inflation rates. The cost of a barrel of \noil once again is exceeding $100 a barrel. Food prices--my colleague \nfrom Rhode Island, the Presiding Officer, pointed out the other day, \njust in terms of bakeries in the country, the rising cost of wheat. The \nprice of wheat has risen dramatically in the country. These are \nexamples of what is occurring that contributes, obviously, to a \nworsening economic situation in our country.\n\n  All we are hoping for here--or I had hoped for before the Easter \nPassover break--is that we would be able to adopt a series of measures \nthat would attract broad-based support that could offer some relief, \nsome confidence, some optimism to people across the country. I am less \noptimistic that it is going to happen in a broad sense, but I am still \nhopeful that FHA reform might be adopted before we leave.\n  We are facing a very serious situation, and we are doing so in a much \nweaker position than we were just 7 years ago, the last time that our \nnation was on the brink of a recession. This is not a partisan or an \nideological statement. When the Federal Reserve Chairman, Governor \nBernanke, was before the Banking Committee last week, I asked him \nwhether he thought we were in a worse position today to respond to the \nproblems we are facing than we were when we last faced a recession in \n2001. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve agreed that we are indeed in \na worse position today than we\n\n[[Page S1587]]\n\nwere 7 years ago. He specifically said that the standard monetary and \nfiscal policy tools we have to confront economic downturns are far more \nconstrained today than they were 7 years ago. He also said the American \nconsumer is facing the brunt of this economic downturn.\n  The incoming economic data show how serious the problem is. The \nNation's economy has slowed to a near standstill in the fourth quarter, \nwith overall GDP growing by less than 1 percent and private sector GDP \ngrowing by only one-tenth of 1 percent.\n  The country had a net loss of jobs in January. That is the first time \nwe have lost jobs in over 4 years. Incoming data on retail sales has \nbeen very weak, and most projections, by the way, by private economists \nand by the Federal Reserve for economic growth this year have been \nrevised down sharply.\n  The Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, testifying before the \nBanking Committee yesterday, indicated that the next several quarters \ndo not offer much hope at all that this economy is going to strengthen. \nCredit card delinquencies are on the rise as consumers find themselves \nincreasingly unable to tap the equity in their homes to help pay down \ncredit card debt and other financial obligations.\n  Lastly, as I mentioned a minute ago, inflation has increased by 4.1 \npercent this year. That is the largest increase in 17 years, driven \nmainly by the rising cost of energy, food, and health care. Oil prices \nare above $100 a barrel, and the U.S. dollar is at the lowest point in \nmodern history since we began freely floating our currency in 1973.\n  This economic decline has been reflected in the falling stock prices, \nthe falling currency, and the increased volatility in the securities \nmarkets.\n  Our economy is in trouble, which is to state the obvious, and the \ndata clearly confirms that, but we don't necessarily help the situation \nby just acknowledging that. What are we doing? What steps are we taking \nin this body and in the other body? What steps is the administration \ntaking? What steps is the Federal Reserve taking, and others, to \nreverse these trends and to offer some hope?\n  I don't want to engage in a self-fulfilling prophecy by reciting the \ndata that is going on here without suggesting that we might not be able \nto do some things that could help.\n  As I said previously, the catalyst of the current economic crisis is \nthe housing crisis. Overall, 2007 was the first year since data has \nbeen kept that the United States had an annual decline in nationwide \nhousing prices. A recent Moody's report forecasts that home values will \ndrop in 2008 by 10 to 15 percent, and others are predicting a similar \ndecline in 2009. This would be the first time since the Great \nDepression that national home prices have dropped in consecutive years.\n  If the catalyst of the current economic crisis is the housing crisis, \nthen the catalyst of the housing crisis clearly is the foreclosure \ncrisis. I have said that over and over again over the last number of \nweeks.\n  What steps have we taken?\n  Last week, it was reported that foreclosures in the month of January \nwere up 57 percent compared to a year ago and continue to hit record \nlevels. When all is said and done, over 2 million Americans will lose \ntheir homes, it is predicted. There are already 1.4 million homes in \nforeclosure nationally, including over 14,000 in my home State of \nConnecticut, according to RealtyTrac, which publishes these figures, as \na result of what Secretary Paulson himself has called ``bad lending \npractices.'' These are lending practices that no sensible banker, no \nresponsible banker would have engaged in. Yet they did. Reckless and \ncareless, sometimes unscrupulous actors in the mortgage industry \nallowed loans to be made that they knew many people would not be able \nto afford, particularly when they reached the fully indexed value and \nprice. They engaged in practices that the Federal Reserve, under its \nprior leadership, did absolutely nothing, in my view, to effectively \nstop.\n  This crisis affects more families who will lose their homes. Property \nvalues for each home located within one-eighth of a square mile will \ndrop by $5,000. That is another specific decline. Another statistic \nwhich is not often quoted is that when you have neighborhoods that end \nup with foreclosed properties, the crime rates go up about 2 percent \nautomatically. So you get declining value with increased crime rates, \nand, of course, declining values and foreclosed properties mean less \nproperty taxes coming in to local counties or communities, which, of \ncourse, affects services, including fire, police, and emergency \nservices, not to mention social services. So you get a contagion \neffect.\n  We now know it has spilled over into student loans. The State of \nPennsylvania and the State of Michigan have indicated there may be no \nstudent loans available this year. For hard-working, middle-income \nfamilies who may be current in their mortgage obligations and who are \nmanaging their finances well, to find out that their students, their \nchildren may not qualify or find student loans available will be yet \nanother added hardship in this country.\n  So this matter is spilling out of control. I know from time to time \npeople say that is excessive language. It is not excessive at all. What \ndisturbs me deeply is that while I don't claim there is any one silver \nbullet answer to this, and I would be the last to suggest there was a \nsimple package of four or five items that might help cure all of the \nhousing problems.\n  I am not saying anything that is not known by others. The troubling \ndata on the housing market and the economic situation is readily \navailable. It is being reported on a daily basis in the national media. \nThe question is, what are we doing, if anything, to try to reverse \nthese serious trends; to offer some optimism and confidence from this \nbody, the Senate, the Congress of the U.S., the administration, and the \nregulatory bodies? What can we do to act in a responsible and \nconstructive manner to get the country back on the right track?\n  Yesterday, I chaired a hearing in the Banking Committee with \nrepresentatives of the Federal bank, thrift, and credit union \nregulators. The evidence strongly suggests that they were asleep at the \nswitch as this crisis built and when the alarm went off, they merely \nhit the snooze button. The Federal Reserve, in particular, candidly \nacknowledged--and I appreciate Don Kohn's testimony--that they failed \nto properly assess and address excessive risks that were being taken.\n  The regulators abandoned proven standards of applying good judgment \nand strong supervisory oversight. Instead, they relied on models and \nestimates that were being used to justify that there was no housing \nbubble. These models and estimates were wrong.\n  What is so troubling is that questions were raised about them some \nyears ago, before the bubble burst, by regulators people such as Ned \nGramlich who, when he sat as a Governor of the Federal Reserve, warned \nthat this problem was growing. The staff at these agencies knew this as \nwell. Yet nothing was done. The warning flare shot into the sky by him \nand others went largely ignored.\n  Now that this bubble has burst, the regulators are telling us they \nare ``studying'' what went wrong. While studying the problem has its \nplace, and I appreciate that, I must say that conducting studies of the \ncrisis in the economy and financial markets is, of course, like \nfirefighters responding to a fire by picking up a book and studying how \nto put out a fire rather than going and doing the job.\n  I think we all know we need action today, not complacency by the \nfrontline bank regulators. That is why Senator Shelby and I will \ncontinue to press the regulators for the actions they are taking to \naddress the serious problems that our country is facing. I commend \nSenator Shelby, who I thought yesterday had good and strong questions \nfor the regulators. The answer we got was that people were too \ncomplacent. Many speeches were given and informal conversations took \nplace, but the job of a regulator, the cop on the beat, is not just to \ngive speeches and have informal conversations. If the staff at these \nagencies knew this bubble could burst, that there were serious \nproblems, that Governors at the Federal Reserve Bank were warning about \nthis problem we are facing, giving speeches and having informal \nconversations was hardly the kind of action we should have been \nexpecting from very important agencies charged with the\n\n[[Page S1588]]\n\nresponsibility of seeing to it these kinds of problems would be handled \nbefore they became as significant as they are today.\n  Congress, too, I think should act. Again, I am not suggesting any one \nspecific action, but the idea that we have no role to play while we are \nwatching this wave grow of people who are going to lose their homes--by \nthe way, the estimates are we could be looking at as many as 2 million \nto 2.5 million families who could lose their homes, and the effect will \nbe as many as 44 million to 50 million homes as a result of the value \nof homes exceeding, of course, the financial obligations on the \nresidences. If that is the case, and if it goes on too long, and if \nunemployment rates continue to rise and energy costs continue to rise \nand student loans become less available, and the cost of education goes \nup, and health care continues to go up, families who would have been \nable to manage owning a home under normal circumstances will have \nserious trouble surviving these economic circumstances. If these \nproblems increase, for families that have a mortgage in excess of the \nvalue of the property, and the home value continues to decline, \nobviously, those families are going to face additional troubles. \nTherefore, the problem spreads beyond just--not as if it were just 2, \nbut 2.5 million who are losing their homes to a much larger \nconstituency in this country.\n  So this problem is serious. We are now in another week. I have great \nrespect for what is going on here and dealing with the legislation at \nhand. But as the majority leader said over and over again, this housing \nmatter is the most serious one in the country. I think the failure to \nget some agreement and understanding on a package of proposals that we \ncould go forward in a bipartisan fashion is tragic. We will be in here \nnext week on the budget and then we are gone for 2 weeks. While this \nmay seem like academic issues to some people here, if you are that \nAmerican homeowner out there who lost your job and is watching energy \ncosts go up, with kids you were planning on getting a college \neducation, and student loans may not be available, then this is not an \nacademic issue to you at all.\n  The question is, Where are the people here doing their job? The \nmajority leader offered and said this is the problem we ought to be \naddressing. Yet because of whatever reasons, we are unwilling or unable \nto come together to offer some ideas that could offer relief and \noptimism. I think it is terribly wrong and I worry about the \nconsequences of inaction.\n  I know there have been disagreements about what steps to take. That \nis legitimate. Candidly, this issue ought to be addressed in a far more \nurgent fashion than is the norm. If there are different ideas on \nbankruptcy or tax policy or even on the community development block \ngrant idea or the counseling ideas that are all part of a package we \nhad suggested, then let there be a debate about it; let alternatives be \noffered. But if we cannot spend a few hours or days talking about an \neconomic crisis that has as its center a foreclosure crisis and a \nhousing crisis, then what are we doing here?\n\n  This problem is mounting, growing, getting more serious every single \nday. The failure of this institution to respond in a more responsible \nway I, again, deeply regret. One point I hope we can all agree on is \nthat doing nothing is not an option. Yet that is what is happening at \nthis very hour.\n  We need to work out these differences and provide solutions that will \nwork. To that end, I will continue to work with my colleague from the \nBanking Committee, Senator Shelby, on several key issues. I thank him \nagain for his willingness to move forward. We are working together with \nour counterparts in the House on a final version of the FHA legislation \nthat I mentioned. That bill passed 93 to 1 just weeks ago. My hope is \nthat the House and Senate can resolve those differences and present a \nfinal product before we leave next week.\n  Modernizing the Federal Housing Administration is a critical step in \nresponding to the housing crisis. Another important step is \ncomprehensive Government-sponsored enterprise reforms, GSE reforms. I \nam committed to that issue. We have another hearing I will be holding \non that tomorrow, in fact, at the Banking Committee level. So we can \nhear views from all sides before drafting what I hope will be a \nbipartisan bill, that we can bring to the Chamber rather quickly for \nits adoption.\n  As Chairman Bernanke said several days ago in the Banking Committee, \nour country is in a worse economic situation today to face a recession \nthan we were 7 years ago. Traditional monetary and fiscal tools might \nnot be adequate to face the unprecedented challenges our economy is \nfacing, with national home prices falling, as I mentioned earlier, for \nthe first time since the Great Depression. We must hear new ideas and \nproposals to address these problems. The strength of our economy 7 \nyears ago is not there today. We don't have the strength of the dollar, \nwe don't have low inflation, and we don't have low unemployment. Our \nfiscal situation is a far cry from where it was 7 years ago. So we are \nin a very different situation to rely on traditional market forces to \nact as a cushion against a likely recession. We need to think \ncreatively about ways to avoid what is growing and, quite obviously, \ngoing to come if additional steps are not taken.\n  Unfortunately, the administration has so far been reluctant to hear \nnew ideas and take action on proposals to address these problems. At \nevery single turn of this housing crisis, the administration has been \none step behind, unfortunately: one step behind the 2.2 million \nhomeowners facing foreclosure last year; one step behind the financial \nmarkets which started tightening credit for student loans and other \nconsumer needs last summer; one step behind those of us in Congress who \nhave called for solutions to the foreclosure crisis for more than a \nyear now; one step behind the regulators at the FDIC who have urged \nbroad-based modifications for homeowners since last spring.\n  Sheila Bair, former legal counsel to Senator Bob Dole, deserves great \ncredit. Almost a year ago, the FDIC, under her leadership, was calling \nfor actions to be taken. Had we acted then, I think the problem would \nhave been a lot less severe than it is today.\n  Now the administration is again one step behind this time, behind the \nFederal Reserve who is now calling for more action before the housing \ncrisis gets worse. I commend Chairman Bernanke again for his candor and \nfor the speech he gave yesterday in Florida, calling for more creative \naction before the problem grows worse, as it does almost hourly.\n  It took some time for the Federal Reserve to acknowledge the severity \nof the housing problem, but they have come around. Days after I \nconvened the first hearing of the 110th Congress on foreclosures, \nFederal Reserve Board Governor Susan Bies said she didn't ``think there \nwill be a large impact on the prime mortgage industry.'' Last March, \nTreasury Secretary Paulson reinforced that benign and incorrect view, \nsaying that the economic fallout from the housing market would be \n``painful to some lenders, but . . . largely contained.''\n  By the time I held a second hearing on the subprime abuses on March \n22 of last year, the Federal Reserve finally acknowledged that the Fed \nhad acted too slowly to address mortgage lending abuses. The Fed \npledged then to do more to protect homeowners. Unfortunately, the \nadministration continued to deny the severity of the problem.\n  Throughout last spring and summer, the Treasury Secretary commented \nthat ``we are at or near the bottom'' of the housing correction and \nthere was no risk to the economy overall. When the Treasury sends such \nrose-colored messages to the public, it is no surprise that the \nadministration and the industry were slow to assist homeowners with \nbroad-based loan modifications.\n  I organized the first Homeownership Preservation Summit in April of \nlast year, to bring together the Nation's leading mortgage loan \nservicing companies, regulators, and community organizations to discuss \na timetable and a tangible solution to reduce foreclosures. But the \nprivate sector, acting alone, yielded minimal results. Moody's found \nthat just 1 percent of loans had been modified in the spring and summer \nof last year. Instead of taking action throughout these months to help \nhomeowners, the administration continued its happy talk about the\n\n[[Page S1589]]\n\nhousing market and the economy. The Treasury stated in July that \ntroubles in the housing market were ``largely'' over and ``contained.'' \nIt wasn't until November, just a few months ago, that the \nadministration convened its own homeownership preservation summit. \nUnfortunately, during those 7 months that passed, tens of thousands of \nnew homeowners became delinquent on their mortgages.\n  Instead of working with us in the Congress to develop solutions for \nhomeowners over the summer, the Treasury Secretary said on August 1 \nthat he did not see anything that caused him to reconsider his views, \nthat the economic damage from the housing correction was ``largely \ncontained.'' Echoing Secretary Paulson's benign assessment of the \nhousing market, just days later, President Bush said, ``It looks like \nwe are headed for a soft landing.''\n  Later that month, in August, I met with Secretary Paulson and Federal \nReserve Chairman Bernanke, urging them to use all of the tools at their \ndisposal to address the mortgage market turmoil. I wrote a letter to \nthe Treasury Department and the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment urging them to move expeditiously to make administrative \nchanges to the Federal Housing Administration single family insurance \nprogram to help borrowers escape abusive mortgages by refinancing into \nmore affordable FHA loans.\n  Throughout the fall, FDIC Chair Sheila Bair and I advocated for \nsystemic loan modifications to help homeowners facing foreclosure. \nInstead of using his authority and influence to promote such solutions, \nthe Treasury Secretary said, ``The idea of across-the-board \nmodifications is not something that this group [of large subprime \nservicers] is looking to do . . . and it's not something we in this \nadministration are advocating.'' Weeks later, however, the Treasury \nSecretary changed his view, saying they saw an ``immediate need to see \nmore loan modifications and refinancing and other flexibility'' and a \nstandardization of loss-mitigation metrics to evaluate servicers' \nperformance goals.\n  If I have learned one lesson from this housing crisis, a lesson all \nof us should have learned, it is that delayed action will cost \nfamilies, neighborhoods, the economy of our Nation, and, of course, the \ntaxpayers more and more money than timely action would have avoided. \nInstead of turning a tin ear, we must listen to the growing chorus of \nhomeowners, lenders, servicers, housing counselors, economic experts, \nand regulators who are calling for bold action to prevent this housing \ncrisis from becoming worse than it is today. I believe bold action must \ninclude financing options for homeowners through FHA, the GSEs, and a \nnew fund at FHA that I propose to use to preserve home ownership.\n  We must also do more to slow the tide of foreclosures that are \noverwhelming many of our communities. And we need to give our local \nofficials the tools and resources to cope with these increases in \nforeclosed properties. In doing so, we will help break, I believe, the \ndownward cycle that is pushing our economy toward a recession, if we \nare not already in the middle of one.\n  By acting, we can bring some certainty where today only uncertainty \nexists. We can help restore the confidence of consumers and investors \nthat is indispensable to economic progress for our Nation.\n  There are some steps we have taken in the housing sphere already. \nWorking closely, again, with Senator Shelby, ranking member of the \nBanking Committee, we have been able to pass FHA reform legislation. As \nI mentioned, we have been working with the House to resolve our \ndifferences on that legislation.\n  I am committed to working with my colleague from Alabama and the \nadministration to pass a GSE regulatory reform bill so Fannie Mae, \nFreddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks can expand their efforts \nto help people keep their homes.\n  The committee also held extensive oversight hearings on the problems \nthat plague the housing market, including a hearing on January 31 to \nlook at the foreclosure issue. We held a hearing on the state of the \neconomy and financial markets with Secretary of the Treasury Paulson, \nChairman Bernanke, and SEC Chairman Christopher Cox. We held a hearing \nwith Chairman Bernanke last week to receive the semiannual monetary \npolicy report, and we held a hearing yesterday on the state of the \nbanking industry with all the Federal bank regulators. We are holding a \nsecond hearing on GSE reform tomorrow, and there will be more hearings \nto come.\n  I also believe that S. 2636 would help address the problems we are \nfacing in the housing and mortgage markets in a number of ways by \nproviding counseling services, dealing with bankruptcy reform, \nimproving disclosures, increasing availability of mortgage revenue \nbonds, and appropriating emergency funds for local communities \nstruggling with these empty properties. Again, I commend Majority \nLeader Reid for his leadership on this issue. I emphasize those ideas I \nmentioned are, by and large, noncontroversial, but I know there are \nthose who disagree with them, as one might expect. That is not a reason \nnot to try to move forward and allow a debate to occur, amendments to \nbe offered to modify any of these ideas or additional ones people might \nbring to the table.\n  But, doing nothing at all is inexcusable. The fact that days go by, \ndespite the growing alarm bells going off about the seriousness of this \nproblem, as I said a week ago, will be indictable by history if we do \nnot to step up and offer some ideas to get this right.\n  At the end of the day, this legislation by itself is not going to \nstop foreclosures or restore our communities to economic health. In my \nview, we need to do more to bring liquidity to the mortgage markets, to \nhelp establish value for the subprime securities that are clogging up \nthe system and a way of clearing them out of the markets so capital can \nonce again flow freely. I continue to work on the details of a home \nownership preservation entity that makes use of existing platforms, \nsuch as FHA or GSEs, to help achieve this result. There are other ideas \nthat I welcome, maybe not this idea, but something similar to it will \nwork. Whatever it is, we ought to bring our practical talents to bear \non all this and do something rather than sitting around doing nothing \nabout this issue.\n  The home ownership preservation entity will facilitate the \nrefinancing of distressed mortgages. This idea was originally proposed \nby the American Enterprise Institute and the Center for American \nProgress, two organizations that do not normally come together on \neconomic ideas, but they did on this one; two organizations that \napproach economic issues from very different philosophical perspectives \nbut that agree more action is needed to stem the housing crisis.\n  In its general outline, the home ownership preservation entity would \ncapture the discount for which delinquent and near-delinquent loans are \ntrading in the marketplace through a transparent, market-based process \nand transfer the discounts to the homeowners so more families can stay \nin their homes.\n  I would hope such an entity could purchase and restructure these \nloans in bulk so we could help as many people as possible, but a case-\nby-case approach is possible as well. I would not rule that out. It \nwould require lenders and investors to recognize losses so there would \nbe no bailout. In my view, this entity should make use of existing \ninstitutions, such as FHA and the GSEs, to expedite the process and \nmaximize the process. Every day that goes by without action means more \nfamilies are going to lose their homes. Obviously, many details need to \nbe fleshed out, I know that, but I am currently drafting legislation \nfor such an idea and plan to introduce it in the coming weeks. The \nlegislation closely mirrors the approach recommended by Federal Reserve \nChairman Ben Bernanke in a speech before community lenders he gave \nyesterday morning in Florida.\n\n  Again, I encourage all my colleagues to work with us. I see the \nSenator from Iowa on the floor, the former chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, the ranking member today. I commend the Finance Committee. \nThey have offered some very sound ideas out of their committee to deal \nwith revenue mortgage bonds and other ideas. Again, those ideas will \nnot solve everything, but I commend their committee for stepping up and \nsaying: Here are a couple things that may restore confidence, increase\n\n[[Page S1590]]\n\noptimism, and may save some families from falling into the worst of all \nsituations.\n  Remember, only 10 percent of these subprime mortgages went to first-\ntime home buyers. Most of them went to people who are making a second \nmortgage to take care of financial obligations, people who have been in \ntheir homes for years building up that equity to take care of future \neconomic difficulties, student loans, health care problems or \nretirement, and to watch the wealth that accumulated for years \ndisintegrate before their very eyes. Many end up losing the only wealth \ncreator they have had, the long-term financial security for retirement \ngoes out the window, and we are sitting around doing absolutely nothing \nabout it. It is reprehensible. Again, not everyone is in that category.\n  The Senator from Iowa, Senator Grassley, to his credit, and Senator \nBaucus and their committee have stepped up, and I commend them for it. \nWe are doing our part. What I regret is we cannot find the time for a \ncouple of days to let some of these ideas at least be raised for \ndebate, discussion, and possibly action before we leave.\n  As we take off for our 2-week break and enjoy our families, travel, \nand do whatever else we do, in that time there will be people losing \ntheir homes in the country, and maybe, just maybe, if we stepped up to \nthe plate, we might have avoided that from happening.\n  I think it is sad, indeed, that we cannot find the time to do it, \nunwilling to sit down and engage in what this body was created for--for \nhealthy, responsible debate about actions we ought to be taking to \navoid this problem that grows worse by the hour.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, we are still on the underlying bill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will speak for a short period of time if anyone else \nwants the floor.\n\n\n                       Stonewalling on Oversight\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, throughout my career in the Senate, I \nhave taken very seriously our constitutional responsibility of \noversight. So I have actively conducted oversight of the executive \nbranch of Government regardless of who controls Congress or who \ncontrols the White House.\n  These issues that I do oversight on are about basic, good Government \nand accountability in Government. It does not deal with party politics \nor with ideology. The resistance from the bureaucracy is often fierce. \nIt does not matter whether we have a Republican President or a \nDemocratic President. There is an institutional bias among bureaucracy \nnot to cooperate with Congress in doing our constitutional job of \noversight.\n  Protecting itself is what the bureaucracy does best, and it works \novertime to keep embarrassing facts from congressional and public \nscrutiny. This has gone on too long. It is time for the stonewalling to \nstop. We have a duty under the Constitution to act as a check on the \nexecutive branch, and I take that duty seriously. I know other Members \nof the Senate do. But too often, we let issues in oversight slide that \nsomehow we do not let slide in legislation. So I am asking my \ncolleagues to ramp it up a little bit, to be more serious in the \npursuit of information, but not just in the pursuit, to make sure that \ninformation actually comes to us when we do not get the proper response \nfrom the administration.\n  When the agencies I am reviewing get defensive and refuse to respond \nto my requests, it makes me wonder what they are trying to hide. They \nact as if the documents in the Government files belong to them. These \nunelected officials seem to think they alone have the right to decide \nwho gets access to information--information, which, by the way, was \nprobably collected at taxpayers' expense.\n  I have news for them. I am asking my colleagues to have news for \nthem. Documents in Government files belong to the people, and the \nelected representatives of the people in our constitutional role of \noversight of the executive branch have a right to see them. That right \nis essential to carry out our oversight function.\n  Let me summarize a few examples of the kind of stonewalling I face. \nBut before I do that, I would like my colleagues to know this is the \nfirst of several trips to the floor that I intend to make about the \nexecutive branch and its stonewalling. I am tired of it, and I am going \nto talk about it until we in the Senate and this Senator gets what we \nare entitled to under the Constitution. All the kids in America study \nthe checks and balances that are a part of our system of Government, \nand this is part of the congressional check under the Constitution on \nthe executive branch of Government.\n  So let me start this evening with what is outstanding and is being \nheld up at the FBI on the one hand, the State Department on the other, \nand the Department of Homeland Security in another case. Let's look at \nthe use of the jet aircraft that is available for the FBI.\n  The Government Accountability Office is beginning an audit that I \nrequested on the use of luxury executive jets by the FBI. I asked for \nthe audit after a Washington Post article detailed evidence that the \njets were being used for travel by senior FBI officials rather than for \nthe counterterrorism purpose as Congress intended when the jets were \nprovided. However, the FBI Director has refused to commit to providing \nthe flight logs to the Government Accountability Office investigators \nwho are working on this project.\n  What is wrong with a little bit of public scrutiny about the flight \nlogs on a corporate jet, which the taxpayers have paid for, for the use \nof Government bureaucracy and Government officials?\n  Let's go to the Michael German case. For nearly 2 years, despite \nrequests from two Judiciary Committee chairmen, the FBI refused to \nprovide documents in the case of FBI whistleblower Michael German. It \ntook more than a year for the FBI to respond to questions for the \nrecord following last year's FBI oversight hearing by the Judiciary \nCommittee. Even when the responses finally came in, most of them ducked \nand evaded the questions rather than answering them very directly.\n  The FBI misled the public about the facts in the German case. Even \nfaced with the evidence, the FBI still will not admit that German was \nright about domestic and international terrorist groups meeting to \ndiscuss forming operational ties. Now they are trying to hide that \nevidence from the public. Don't you think the public ought to know \neverything there is to know about people who are planning terrorist \nactivities against Americans?\n  I would like to bring up next exigent letters. The FBI continues to \nstonewall this committee on requests for documents. For example, last \nMarch, we requested internal FBI e-mails on their issuance of exigent \nletters. These letters were criticized by the Justice Department \ninspector general as inappropriate ways to obtain phone records without \nany legal process and said the letters contained false statements, \npromising that a subpoena would be on the way even when there was no \nintent to issue such a subpoena. Here we are, then, a whole year later, \nand the FBI has provided only 15 pages. We know they have been sitting \non even more e-mails that should shed light on this controversy. It is \nenough to make you wonder what they might be trying to hide.\n\n  Let us go back to something now 5 years old--the anthrax case. Not 5 \nyears I have been working on it, but it hasn't been too far short of 5 \nyears. There is still no public indication of progress in the \ninvestigation of the anthrax attacks. Well, this involved attacks on \nindividual Senators. A former journalist is being fined for failure to \ndisclose her sources, despite press accounts stating the sources were \nunnamed FBI officials. Whether anyone in the Justice Department has \ntaken any serious steps to find out who in the bureau was leaking case \ninformation about Stephen Hatfill to the press is still a mystery. And \nwhy should it be? It shouldn't be a mystery. Have they obtained and \nsearched the phone records of their own senior officials to see who was \ncalling the reporters in question? You know, it is mysterious, but the \nFBI won't say.\n\n[[Page S1591]]\n\n  Let us go to the Cecilia Woods matter. We have been waiting 2 years \nfor documents in the case of a whistleblower named Cecilia Woods. Woods \ncame to my office to report that she was retaliated against for \nreporting that her supervisor had an inappropriate intimate \nrelationship with a paid informant and that her supervisor was \ninexplicably not fired, despite overwhelming evidence of this \nmisconduct. I asked to see the FBI internal investigation to find out \nwhy. I still have not received adequate replies.\n  Let us look at the Goose Creek defendants. It is not only the FBI we \nhave problems with. The Homeland Security and State Departments are \nstonewalling Congress as well. Last year, I wrote to Secretary Rice--\nshe is an honorable person, Secretary of State, doing well--and we \nwrote to Secretary Chertoff--he is an honorable person. We wrote about \nthe case of two Florida State University students arrested near Goose \nCreek, SC, with explosives in their trunk. They are both Egyptian \nnationals. One of them, Ahmed Mohammed, entered the United States on a \nstudent visa. However, I learned he had previously been arrested in \nEgypt and that he even declared his arrest on his visa form. I wanted a \ncopy of his visa application and other documents to investigate how our \nscreening system for visa applicants could still be so broken 7 years \nafter 9/11. Both the Department of Homeland Security and the State \nDepartment have thus far refused to comply. Why would they want to keep \ninformation such as this from a Member of the Senate, who has \nresponsibility for appropriating enough money to make sure we can keep \nterrorists from doing another attack against American citizens?\n  For today, I have given only a few examples. I am going to come to \nthe floor again to outline more examples where these agencies and other \nagencies have delayed and delayed and delayed. Months turn into years, \nand we don't get the information we need. It is time for excuses to \nstop so Congress can perform its constitutional job of check and \nbalance--in this case check the executive branch of Government--and our \nconstitutional responsibility of oversight of that branch of \nGovernment, the executive branch.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, as we prepare to consider the budget \nresolution next week, I rise today to comment on the need for fiscal \nresponsibility and reform of the very financial pillars that support \nour Government's foundation. Building on a speech I gave last October, \nand in the tradition of another Member of this body, Senator Fritz \nHollings, I hope to regularly provide my colleagues and the American \npeople with updates on our growing national debt. We need to be \nreminded of the fiscal reality which we find ourselves in. We cannot \ncontinue to live in a state of denial.\n  The Congressional Budget Office projects a $219 billion budget \ndeficit for 2008--that is the fiscal year we are in right now--which \ndoes not include the $152 billion economic stimulus package President \nBush recently signed into law. With the addition of the economic \nstimulus bill, the 2008 projected deficit can be assumed to be $371 \nbillion in 2008.\n  But even that figure hides the true degree to which our official \nsituation has deteriorated, mainly because it uses every dime of the \nSocial Security surplus. I think it is important for our colleagues to \nunderstand we are using every dime of the Social Security surplus, as \nwell as surpluses in other trust funds, to hide the true size of the \nGovernment's operating deficit.\n  If you wall off the Social Security surplus so that Congress can't \nspend it on other programs, as I believe we should, then the \nGovernment's operating deficit amounts to $566 billion, over 50 percent \nmore than the reported deficit of $371 billion. In other words, what we \ndo is we hide from the American people the fact that we are borrowing \nmoney from ourselves to run our Government, and the only thing we \nreport to them is the public debt, but we don't report to them the \nGovernment debt. So when we make these figures available, we will say, \noh, the deficit is $371 billion, but the truth of the matter is, when \nyou add in the Social Security surplus, it is $566 billion.\n  But the annual difference between revenues and outlays is not what is \ntruly threatening our future. It is the cumulative ongoing increase in \nour national debt that matters. Unfortunately, many in Washington \npretend that the debt doesn't even exist. How often do you hear anybody \ntalk about the national debt? They don't.\n  I think we all remember that in 1992 Ross Perot was out running \naround America talking about our fiscal irresponsibility and the \nnational debt. At that time, Ross Perot--and this is 1992--predicted \nthat by 2007, the national debt would be $8 trillion. Well, the fact \nis, he was wrong. It is $1 trillion more. It is $9 trillion.\n  Now, the interesting thing is that from the beginning of our country \nto 1992, it is something like 200 years. We have since 1992 increased \nthe debt--doubled it--from what it was. In other words, in the last 15 \nyears, we have increased the debt more than what it was for the first \n200 years. Think about that--200 years. And the tragedy of it is that \neach and every American--man, woman, and child--owes $30,000. That is \nwhat we all owe today.\n  Here are some additional facts: 47\\1/2\\ percent of that privately \nowned national debt is held by foreign creditors, mostly foreign \ncentral banks. That is up from 13.3 percent only 5 years ago. And who \nare the foreign creditors? The three largest creditors are Japan, \nChina, and the oil exporting countries, or the OPEC nations. Can you \nimagine how high our interest rates would soar if these countries moved \nout their investment to somewhere else? In other words, if they would \nget shaky about where we are in terms of our U.S. economy.\n  According to the S and Moody's, U.S. treasuries will lose their \ntriple-A credit in 2012. In other words, by 2012, our treasuries are \ngoing to lose their triple-A rating. That is the best rating you can \nget. In dollar purchases, I think most of us remember when we could \ntake the American dollar and buy more Canadian dollars. Today, a dollar \nbuys 98 cents of a Canadian dollar. In Europe, it takes $1.52 to buy \none Euro.\n  I have traveled overseas in the last several years, and at one time \neverybody wanted the American dollar. They called them Reagans. I want \na Reagan.\n  Well, the fact is, today they do not want Reagans, they wanted Euros. \nOur long-term fiscal situation makes short-term responsible budgeting \ntoday even more important. The adoption of a biennial budget for the \nFederal Government, as I had as Governor of Ohio, would ensure Congress \ncan get its work done on time while also conducting the oversight \nnecessary to ensure that programs and agencies are functioning \neffectively.\n  I am hoping we can convince the chairman of the House Budget \nCommittee that this is something that would be great for this country \nbecause it is a systemic change that would make a real difference.\n  I have long championed this issue. I have been a cosponsor of Senator \nDomenici's Biennial Budgeting Act since I came to the Senate in 1999. I \nhave been advocating for its passage nearly 10 years.\n  In 25 of the last 30 years, Congress has failed to enact all of the \nappropriations bills by the start of the fiscal year, instead passing \nomnibus bills and continuing resolutions. Government-by-CR has \nconsequences: Agencies cannot plan for the future, they cannot make \nhiring decisions, and they cannot sign contracts.\n  In the next several weeks, I am going to give another speech on the \nfloor of the Senate to remind people about the disruption our not being \nable to pass budgets on time and the effect continuing resolutions have \non inefficient Government and our inability to do the\n\n[[Page S1592]]\n\njob the taxpayers want us to do. As I said, we get more waste and \ninefficiency from the Government by what we are doing. We get lower \nquality services provided to the people. At the end of the day, we get \nhigher spending and less accountability and oversight of the taxpayers' \nmoney. This is irresponsible management, and it has to stop.\n  Biennial budgeting will ensure Congress does its job and actually \nlooks back to see if the money we have spent is doing what it is \nsupposed to do.\n  While biennial budgeting can restore order to the appropriations \nprocess, it will not solve our long-term entitlement problems or reform \nour Tax Code. We must enact fundamental tax reform to help make the Tax \nCode simple, fair, transparent, and economically efficient.\n  Tax reform is not just a matter of saving taxpayers time and effort; \nthis is about saving taxpayers real money. The Tax Foundation estimates \nthat comprehensive tax reform could save us much as $265 billion in \ncompliance costs associated with preparing our returns.\n  People come to my office every day, and I ask them: How many of you \ndo your own tax returns? And the answer is most of them--the hands go \nup. I am an attorney. I used to make out my own return. I used to do \nthem for my clients. I would not touch my tax return today with a 10-\nfoot pole.\n  Now, if we can straighten this out through good tax reform, fair, \neasy to understand, even if we did it halfway, it would save almost \n$160 billion for all of the taxpayers of this country. That is a real \ntax reduction, and it is something that would not cost the Treasury one \ndime.\n  In January 2005, President Bush announced the creation of an all-star \npanel led by former Senators Mack and Breaux, and that panel spent most \nof the year engaging the American public to develop proposals to make \nour Tax Code simpler, more fair, and more conducive to economic growth.\n  In November 2005, the panel issued its final report. While not \nperfect in everyone's mind, the panel's two plans provided a starting \npoint for developing tax reform legislation that will represent a huge \nimprovement over the current system. The panel's proposals belong as a \nkey part of the national discussion on fundamental tax reform.\n  Last January, I introduced the Securing America's Future Economy--or \nSAFE--Commission Act, legislation that would create a bipartisan \ncommission to look at our Nation's tax and entitlement systems and \nrecommend reforms to put us back on a fiscally sustainable course and \nensure the solvency of entitlement programs for future generations. My \ncolleague, Senator Isakson, has joined me as a cosponsor.\n  Democratic Congressman Jim Cooper of Tennessee and Republican Frank \nWolf of Virginia introduced a bipartisan version of the SAFE Commission \nin the House, where they have 73 cosponsors from both parties. This \nbipartisan, bicameral group has support from corporate executives, \nreligious leaders, think tanks across the political spectrum, from the \nHeritage Foundation to the Brookings Institution, and former members \nfrom both parties.\n  On the heels of this, two of my colleagues, the Budget Committee \nchairman from North Dakota and the ranking member from New Hampshire, \nrecently introduced a bipartisan bill that would create a tax and \nentitlement reform commission entitled the ``Bipartisan Task Force for \nResponsible Fiscal Action.'' I signed on as a cosponsor of the Conrad-\nGregg proposal. I look forward to working with them to restore fiscal \nsanity to the U.S. Government.\n  I would like to comment on the efforts of Divided We Fail, a \ncoalition comprised of the AARP, Business Roundtable, Service Employees \nUnion, and the National Federation of Independent Businesses, for \nencouraging bipartisan congressional action on this legislation. I want \nto repeat that. Here is a group. They call themselves Divided We Fail. \nIt is made up of the AARP, the Business Roundtable, and the National \nFederation of Independent Businesses, which are supporting this. What \nan interesting array of individuals who think it is time for us to do \nentitlement and tax reform.\n\n  I am encouraged that the Senate Budget Committee is planning to mark \nup the Bipartisan Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action, and I urge \nmy colleagues to pass this critical legislation before the close of \n2008.\n  The next President, whoever that may be, should be ready in January \n2009 to work with the task force in addressing these critical reform \nissues. What we are doing now is not working for us. We know that \noversight is an important part of our job. But oversight takes time. We \nmust identify programs that are mired in waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  Another piece of legislation I have introduced, along with Senator \nCornyn, is the United States Authorization and Sunset Commission Act. \nThis legislation would create a bipartisan commission to make \nrecommendations to Congress on whether to reauthorize, reorganize, or \nterminate Federal programs. It would establish a systemic process to \nreview unauthorized programs and agencies and, if applicable, programs \nthat are rated as ``ineffective'' or ``results not demonstrated'' under \nthe program assessment rating tool, which is called PART. Hopefully, \nthe next administration will adopt the criteria the Bush administration \nhas set for PART.\n  Now, this legislation does not take away from our obligations to make \ndifficult decisions about which programs to continue and those that we \ncan no longer afford to support. What it does is provide an opportunity \nto work harder and smarter and do more with less.\n  I believe by establishing this commission to do a thorough \nexamination of programs and agencies using the established criteria, \nand a transparent reporting process, we can carry out our oversight \nresponsibility more efficiently and effectively.\n  The legislation will help us distinguish between worthwhile programs \nand those that have outlived their purpose, are poorly targeted, \noperate inefficiently, or simply are not producing results taxpayers \nexpect. I used such a commission as Governor of Ohio, and it has helped \nus work harder and smarter and do more with less.\n  As we near the end of the Presidential primary season and move into \nthe nominating conventions, the Presidential candidates of both parties \nshould address the critical issue of tax reform, entitlement spending, \nand budget process reform.\n  All of the leading Presidential candidates are Members of the Senate. \nThe American electorate should demand that they take a stand on the \nSAFE Commission and on the Bipartisan Task Force for Responsible Fiscal \nAction. Voters should demand that Congress pass this bill this year and \ninsist Presidential candidates pledge that upon being elected, they \nwill guarantee that one of their first actions they take as President \nis to make their appointments to this task force. The Presidential \ncandidates should have recommendations on tax reform, entitlement \nreform, and biennial budgeting.\n  But I am afraid that the candidates, whether Democratic or \nRepublican, will avoid these topics, because these challenges require \ntough choices. Where is Ross Perot? Where is Ross Perot? Voters must \nask candidates if they are willing to discuss our country's financial \nfuture. If a candidate avoids this topic of responsibility in the \ncampaign, how can voters trust them to be forthright after they are \nelected?\n  The former Comptroller General, David Walker, has said:\n\n       The greatest threat to our future is our fiscal \n     irresponsibility.\n\n  He added:\n\n       America suffers from a serious case of myopia, or \n     nearsightedness, both in the public sector and in the private \n     sector. We need to start focusing more on the future. We need \n     to start recognizing the realities that we are on an \n     imprudent and unsustainable fiscal path and we need to get \n     started now.\n\n  I have three children and seven grandchildren. My wife Janet and I \nare wondering whether they are going to have the same opportunities we \nhave had, as well as the same standard of living or our quality of \nlife. I question what kind of legacy we are going to leave them as a \nnation.\n  The time to act is now. When you look at the numbers, it is self-\nevident that we must confront our swelling national debt, and we must \nmake a considered bipartisan effort to reform our tax system, slow the \ngrowth of entitlement spending, and halt this freight\n\n[[Page S1593]]\n\ntrain that is threatening to crush our kids' and grandkids' future. We \nowe it to our children and grandchildren to take care of it now. All of \nus--all of us--should think about them. We have a moral responsibility \nto the future of this country, our children and our grandchildren, to \nmake sure our legacy is one that we can be proud of, that they will \nhave the same opportunities we had during our lifetime.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I support Senator Kohl's amendment to the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission, CPSC, Reform Act. This legislation \nwould make it more difficult to prevent public disclosure of \ninformation in lawsuits involving a product that poses a serious public \nheath or safety risk.\n  Senator Kohl's amendment would promote transparency in court \nproceedings by prohibiting courts from restricting access to \ninformation in civil cases that could affect public health or safety. \nThe amendment would prohibit judges from sealing court records, \ninformation obtained through discovery, and certain details of a \nsettlement unless the public health or safety interest is outweighed by \na specific and substantial interest in maintaining confidentiality. \nWhen issued, protective orders could be no broader than necessary to \nprotect the privacy interest asserted.\n  The Judiciary Committee heard compelling testimony in a recent \nhearing about the tragic consequences of court secrecy in cases \nconcerning defective products. We heard from Johnny Bradley, a Navy \nrecruiter who tragically lost his wife in a car wreck that resulted \nfrom tread separation on a Cooper tire on his Ford Explorer. Mr. \nBradley chose to buy Cooper tires in the wake of the Bridgestone/\nFirestone recall, believing that they would be safer. It was not until \nafter the tragic death of his wife that he found out during litigation \nthat Cooper had faced numerous similar incidents and had thousands of \ndocuments detailing design flaws and defects in the company's tires. \nThe details from as many as 200 lawsuits against Cooper remained \ncovered up through various protective orders, demanded by the tire \ncompany. As a result, vital information that could have saved Mr. \nBradley's wife was not disclosed to the public. Mr. Bradley's story is \njust one example of the terrible consequences of court secrecy in cases \ninvolving products that pose health and safety risks.\n  Last December, Senator Kohl introduced the language contained in this \namendment as the Sunshine in Litigation Act. I am a cosponsor of \nSenator Kohl's bill, and I support this amendment. In an environment \nwhere the administration is clearly not enforcing product safety \nregulations, we need to make sure that consumers have better access to \ninformation that affects their health and safety.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, Representative Aldo Vagnozzi is a beloved \nfigure in Michigan. He is one of those people who talks the talk, walks \nthe walk, and does both to the great benefit of all of those who are \nfortunate enough to cross his path.\n  Aldo served in the U.S. Army during World War II as an interpreter in \nItaly, talking in English and Italian and rising to the rank of \nsergeant. He took advantage of the GI bill to finish his education at \nWayne State University, graduating with a degree in journalism in 1948.\n  That same year, he married Lois Carl, beginning a 50-year marriage. \nThey would raise two daughters and two sons, seven grandchildren, and \ntwo great-grandchildren.\n  As editor of several publications, including numerous labor \nnewspapers, Aldo reported on and learned about Michigan's social and \npolitical environment and the workings of government. This \nunderstanding, along with his knack for making friends, would serve him \nand the State of Michigan well.\n  Aldo would later serve on the Farmington Hills City Council, the \nFarmington District School Board, the Farmington Area Parent-Teacher \nAssociation, and as the mayor of Farmington Hills. He has been actively \ninvolved in numerous community organizations.\n  In 2002, Aldo ran for election to the Michigan House of \nRepresentatives. He personally went door-to-door to 15,000 houses, \nwalking over 900 miles including a 5-day, 70-mile walk from Farmington \nHills to Lansing.\n  Term limits will keep Aldo from continuing his service in the House \nof Representatives after his current term ends this year, and he will \nbe deeply missed by his colleagues and his constituents.\n  I salute my friend Aldo Vagnozzi for his years and years of service \nto Michigan, his indomitable spirit, and his remarkable ability to \nwalk, talk, and sometimes do both while working for the people of \nMichigan.\n  I have lost track of the retirement parties I have been to for Aldo \nVagnozzi. I am confident his next one won't be his last as he moves on \nto other endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/05/senate-section/article/S1593-3", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1593]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL PEACE CORPS WEEK\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, last week marked the 47th anniversary of \nthe founding of the U.S. Peace Corps. Since its inception in 1961, \n190,000 Americans have served in 139 countries around the globe. \nCurrently, 126 Arizonans are Peace Corps volunteers, dedicating their \ntime and hard work to projects in 51 countries.\n  The Peace Corps is an organization through which many Americans have \nmade meaningful service and have contributed to the well-being of \npeoples in other lands. A spirit of generosity and volunteerism helped \nbuild our Nation; in that same spirit, these Peace Corps volunteers are \nhelping others to build theirs.\n  Peace Corps volunteers are also ambassadors of American culture--\nexchanging ideas and bridging cultural divides are critical to helping \npeople understand America's values and message of freedom.\n  I would like to pass on my thanks and congratulations to those who \nhave served in the Peace Corps, and I applaud their contributions to \nour Nation and nations abroad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/05/senate-section/article/S1593-4", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1593-S1594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO CHRISTOPHER K. BRADISH\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I pay tribute to a very distinguished \nstaffer in my office, Christopher K. Bradish, who serves as my \nlegislative assistant for defense and foreign affairs issues.\n  Recently, the National Guard Association of the United States \nrecognized Christopher's extraordinary work by presenting him with the \nPatrick Henry Award--the civilian counterpart to the National Guard \nAssociation of the United States Distinguished Service Medal. Created \nin 1989, the Patrick Henry Award provides recognition to local \nofficials and civic leaders, who in\n\n[[Page S1594]]\n\na position of great responsibility distinguished themselves with \noutstanding and exceptional service to the Armed Forces of the United \nStates, the National Guard, or the National Guard Association of the \nUnited States.\n  To fully comprehend the magnitude of this honor, it is important to \nnote the criteria for the selection of the Patrick Henry Award. \nSuperior performance of normal duty alone does not justify award of \nthis honor. An individual must have provided exceptionally strong \nsupport for the National Guard such that the readiness and the future \nof the National Guard must have been positively impacted.\n  Christopher has provided a tremendous service to our Nation's \nmilitary, as the United States continues to wage a war on terrorism in \nthis post-9/11 era. Additionally, he has demonstrated a remarkable \namount of enthusiasm for ensuring that the Armed Forces and National \nGuard have the readiness capabilities to defend our country. The \nassistance he has provided the National Guard will not be easily \nmatched; however, for Christopher this level of dedication is par for \nthe course.\n  I applaud the National Guard Association of the United States for \nrecognizing Christopher's behind-the-scenes work to increase National \nGuard funding and champion projects of special interest to the Guard. \nChristopher also strives to provide the legislative tools necessary to \ngive soldiers and airmen the best support available. He has worked hard \non these issues--each time jumping in feet first, soaking up knowledge, \nand moving legislation forward in this often complicated process.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me today in commending Christopher K. \nBradish for his receipt of the Patrick Henry Award and his leadership \non behalf of the Armed Forces of the United States, the National Guard, \nand the National Guard Association of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/05/senate-section/article/S1594-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL SANCTIONS ON IRAN\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I wish to speak on the latest round of \nUnited Nations Security Council sanctions on Iran.\n  This past Monday, the Security Council voted 14 to 0 to increase \nsanctions on Iran in response to its continued enrichment of uranium. I \napplaud the United Nations for pursuing the diplomacy necessary to \navoid hostilities. The vote was another step on the long diplomatic \npath toward increasing stability in the Middle East, but more remains \nto be done. Among other measures, these sanctions are important in \nrestricting the travel and freezing the assets of certain Iranian \nofficials and banks. The U.N. is now following the American lead in \ntaking action against banks like Bank Melli which are deeply involved \nfinancially with the Iranian Government and its nuclear program.\n  The near unanimity shown by members of the Security Council, \nincluding the five veto-holding countries, was a strong and \nunmistakable signal of the international community's condemnation of \nIranian policies. That signal would be even stronger if the Security \nCouncil members--and Russia and China in particular--would take further \neconomic measures, including against Iran's energy sector. These \ncountries need to realize that a nuclear-armed Iran does not just \nthreaten the United States or the West but indeed the entire Middle \nEast, the nuclear nonproliferation regime, and potentially the world. \nThe very idea of a nuclear Iran is chilling.\n  In March of last year, Senator Durbin and I introduced the Iran \nCounter-Proliferation Act, a bill outlining steps the United States and \nits allies should take to prevent Iran from continuing its nuclear \nprogram. I am pleased that this legislation currently has 69 \ncosponsors, and the Bush administration has taken many of the measures \nI suggested. Other nations, particularly our European allies, should \nfollow the United States in using additional sanctions to supplement \nthe actions of the Security Council. The international community \nparticularly needs the cooperation of states which actively do business \nwith Iran to draw down that business, in addition to holding key \nIranian leaders personally responsible.\n  Some of the foreign countries which engage Iran economically have \nbeen cooperative in reducing the extent of that cooperation, like \nGermany, which is steadily decreasing the export credits granted to \ninvestments in Iran. Others have been far more recalcitrant, especially \nRussia, which continues to provide nuclear and military assistance to \nTehran. This cooperation, under the circumstances, is unacceptable.\n  The diplomacy of the United States and the United Nations must \ncontinue to intensify until Iran verifiably agrees to forego its \nnuclear ambitions. Until that day, and until Iran's political leaders \ndecide they have more to gain from cooperation than from conflict, the \nsanctions enacted today and others like them will continue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/05/senate-section/article/S1594-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EQUAL CARE FOR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to an important piece \nof legislation to secure equal care for members of the armed services \nwho suffer from a mental illness. I am pleased to have my colleagues \nSenators Evan Bayh and Bill Nelson joining me in this cause by serving \nas original cosponsors of this bill, the Travel Assistance for Family \nMembers of our Troops Act of 2008.\n  There is no greater obligation than caring for those who have served \nthis country through their military service. We would be remiss if we \ndid not ensure that the health care of our heroes in arms is the finest \nmedicine has to offer.\n  What we now refer to as post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, was \nonce described as ``soldier's heart'' in the Civil War, ``shell shock'' \nin World War I, and ``combat fatigue'' in World War II. Whatever the \nname, they are serious mental illnesses and deserve equal attention and \ncare as a physical wound.\n  In recent reports, we have heard that 20 to 40 service men and women \nare evacuated each month from Iraq due to mental health problems. In \naddition to those who are identified, there are many more who will \nreturn home after their service to face readjustment challenges. Some \nwill need appropriate mental heath care to help them adjust back to \n``normal'' life, while others will need medical assistance to heal more \nserious PTSD issues. Yet others will need help to mentally cope with \ntheir physical wounds.\n  So many of our veterans from previous conflicts, such as World War II \nand the Korean and Vietnam wars, needed similar programs once they \nreturned home. Yet I fear that we didn't do enough to help them. With \nproper and early support systems in place, including support of their \nfamilies, we can work to prevent the more serious and chronic mental \nhealth issues that come from a lack of intervention.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will provide support for \nfamily members of our uniformed service men and women receiving \ninpatient treatment for serious psychiatric conditions. Right now, the \nDepartment of Defense does not classify Active-Duty servicemembers \nreceiving treatment for mental illnesses as ``Very Seriously Ill'' or \n``Seriously Ill.''\n  Therefore, under current policy, family members are not eligible to \nreceive the same travel allowances as patients being treated for \nphysical injuries.\n  This bill will eliminate the current disparity in treatment against \nour country's men and woman who are bravely serving in the armed \nservices. We have already taken legislative steps through the Defense \nreauthorization bill to begin to address needed improvements in the \nquality of health care, both from mental and physical injuries. This \nbill is another important piece in that process.\n  Travel Assistance for Family Members of our Troops Act of 2008 \nensures that patients with serious mental impairments can spend time \nwith their family--the same treatment we currently are providing to \npatients with physical injuries requiring inpatient care.\n  We urge our colleagues to support this important piece of \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/05/senate-section/article/S1594-3", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1594-S1595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      RECOGNIZING THE MINNEAPOLIS EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS CENTER\n\n Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I wish to recognize the \nMinneapolis Emergency Communications Center, which is being honored \ntoday as the Nation's Outstanding Call Center.\n\n[[Page S1595]]\n\n  Too often, the exceptional work and service that 9-1-1 call centers \nand workers perform every day across America goes unrecognized.\n  Before I came to Washington, I served as the chief prosecutor for \nHennepin County, Minnesota's largest county, for 8 years. During that \ntime, I saw firsthand the critical contributions 9-1-1 call centers \nmake to public safety on a daily basis--helping to save lives and bring \ncriminals to justice--and gained an unending appreciation for their \nwork.\n  Today, I wish to thank all 9-1-1 operators for all they do to keep \nour communities safe--for coordinating the response to each and every \nemergency, and for doing it all with composure and compassion, and \nnever with complaint.\n  But today is a special honor for the Minneapolis Emergency \nCommunications Center, now recognized as the Outstanding Call Center of \n2007 for its response to the tragic I-35W bridge collapse in August of \n2007.\n  I would like to congratulate and thank director John Dejung, deputy \ndirector Heather Hunt, and each of the 77 call center agents involved \nin the response.\n  In the minutes and hours following the bridge collapse, the response \nof Minnesota's fire fighters, police, and other emergency personnel was \nextraordinary. One of the most enduring images of the response is that \nof brave young firefighter Shanna Hansen who, with a rope tied around \nher waist, kept diving down into the depths of the Mississippi to \nsearch for any survivors.\n  What wasn't seen was how the Minneapolis Emergency Communications \nCenter directed the response. Under the most difficult of circumstance, \ncenter personnel produced the very best of results and no doubt saved \nlives. The entire Nation saw Minnesota's finest on display in those \nfirst few hours after the collapse, and it was made possible by the 9-\n1-1 responders we are honoring today and their colleagues in \nMinneapolis.\n  So it is with great pride that I congratulate the Minneapolis \nEmergency Communications Center for this well-deserved award of \nOutstanding Call Center of 2007.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/05/senate-section/article/S1595-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/05/senate-section/article/S1595-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/05/senate-section/article/S1595-3", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:21 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 816.

A bill to authorize the National Guard to provide support \nfor the border control activities of the United States Customs and \nBorder Protection of the Department of Homeland Security, and for other \npurposes; read the first time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nbuilds upon border security successes achieved as part of Operation \nJump Start by continuing that effort and allowing Governors to use \ntheir respective State's National Guard units for border activities in \nsupport of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP.\n  As a border State Senator, I know firsthand the need to secure our \ninternational borders because every day I hear from constituents who \nmust deal with illegal entries into our country. We have a crisis on \nour borders, and the status quo is not acceptable.\n  I also know firsthand the improvements in border security we have \nmade over the past few years. One of those successes has come in the \nform of Operation Jumpstart, which was an initiative begun in the \nsummer of 2006 to allow National Guardsmen from across America to \ndeploy to the southwest border in support of CBP. This program proved \nsuccessful almost immediately. During the summer of 2006, Border Patrol \nagents apprehended more than 2,500 illegal immigrants in about 6 weeks \nwith the support of National Guardsmen. Tens of thousands of pounds of \nillegal drugs were seized during the same time period.\n  The program is also beneficial to the National Guard. Deploying as \npart of Operation Jumpstart has allowed these men and women to gain \nvaluable training in areas including construction, vehicle maintenance, \ntechnology support, aviation support, intelligence support, \nsurveillance and reconnaissance support, and intelligence analysis.\n  Despite these successes, Operation Jumpstart is being phased out; \nthere are fewer National Guardsmen on the border today than there were \na year ago. I believe to phase out this mutually beneficial work \nbetween CBP and the National Guard is a mistake, and National Guardsmen \nshould be able to continue helping to secure our border.\n  For that reason, I am introducing legislation that addresses this \nneed in two ways. First, the bill calls for the continuation of \nOperation Jumpstart at its initial level of 6,000 guardsmen on the \nsouthwest border until we have control of that border. Second, the bill \nexpands existing Federal law that allows Governors to utilize their \nState's guardsmen for drug interdiction and counterdrug activities to \nallow Governors to also utilize their State's guardsmen for border \ncontrol activities, including constructing roads, fences, and vehicle \nbarriers, conducting search and rescue missions, gathering \nintelligence, repairing infrastructure, and otherwise supporting CBP. \nThe legislation provides that in order to utilize guardsmen for border \nactivities, Governors must submit plans to the Secretary of Defense \nregarding the use of the Guard, and the plans must be approved by the \nSecretary of Defense in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity. Additionally, the Secretary of Defense would be required to \nsubmit an annual report to Congress regarding the activities carried \nout as part of this work under my bill.\n  Mr. President, I believe our National Guardsmen are an invaluable \nasset in securing our borders, and I believe guardsmen should be able \nto continue working on the border.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/05/senate-section/article/S1599-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 473--DESIGNATING MARCH 26, 2008, AS ``NATIONAL \nSUPPORT THE TROOPS AND THEIR FAMILIES DAY'' AND ENCOURAGING THE PEOPLE \n OF THE UNITED STATES TO PARTICIPATE IN A MOMENT OF SILENCE TO REFLECT \n UPON THE SERVICE AND SACRIFICE OF MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES BOTH AT \n      HOME AND ABROAD, AS WELL AS THE SACRIFICES OF THEIR FAMILIES\n\n  Ms. STABENOW (for herself, Mr. Levin, and Mr. Voinovich) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 474\n\n       Whereas participants in the National School Breakfast \n     Program established under section 4 of the Child Nutrition \n     Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1773) include public, private, \n     elementary, middle, and high schools, as well as schools in \n     rural, suburban, and urban areas;\n       Whereas access to nutrition programs such as the National \n     School Lunch Program and the National School Breakfast \n     Program helps to create a stronger learning environment for \n     children and improves children's concentration in the \n     classroom;\n       Whereas missing breakfast and the resulting hunger has been \n     shown to harm the ability of children to learn and hinders \n     academic performance;\n       Whereas students who eat a complete breakfast have been \n     shown to make fewer mistakes and to work faster in math \n     exercises than those who eat a partial breakfast;\n       Whereas implementing or improving classroom breakfast \n     programs has been shown to increase breakfast consumption \n     among eligible students dramatically, doubling and in some \n     cases tripling numbers of participants in school breakfast \n     programs, as evidenced by research in Minnesota, New York, \n     and Wisconsin;\n       Whereas providing breakfast in the classroom has been shown \n     in several instances to improve attentiveness and academic \n     performance, while reducing absences, tardiness, and \n     disciplinary referrals;\n       Whereas studies suggest that eating breakfast closer to the \n     time students arrive in the classroom and take tests improves \n     the students' performance on standardized tests;\n       Whereas studies show that students who skip breakfast are \n     more likely to have difficulty distinguishing among similar \n     images, show increased errors, and have slower memory recall;\n       Whereas children who live in families that experience \n     hunger are likely to have lower math scores, receive more \n     special education services, and face an increased likelihood \n     of repeating a grade;\n       Whereas making breakfast widely available in different \n     venues or in a combination of venues, such as by providing \n     breakfast in the classroom, in the hallways outside \n     classrooms, or to students as they exit their school buses, \n     has been shown to lessen the stigma of receiving free or \n     reduced-price school breakfasts, which sometimes prevents \n     eligible students from obtaining traditional breakfast in the \n     cafeteria;\n       Whereas, in fiscal year 2006, 7,700,000 students in the \n     United States consumed free or reduced-price school \n     breakfasts provided under the National School Breakfast \n     Program;\n\n[[Page S1600]]\n\n       Whereas less than half of the low-income students who \n     participate in the National School Lunch Program also \n     participate in the National School Breakfast Program;\n       Whereas almost 17,000 schools that participate in the \n     National School Lunch Program do not participate in the \n     National School Breakfast Program;\n       Whereas studies suggest that children who eat breakfast \n     take in more nutrients, such as calcium, fiber, protein, and \n     vitamins A, E, D, and B-6;\n       Whereas studies show that children who participate in \n     school breakfast programs eat more fruits, drink more milk, \n     and consume less saturated fat than those who do not eat \n     breakfast; and\n       Whereas children who do not eat breakfast, either in school \n     or at home, are more likely to be overweight than children \n     who eat a healthy breakfast on a daily basis: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the importance of the National School \n     Breakfast Program established under section 4 of the Child \n     Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1773) and the positive \n     impact of the Program on the lives of low-income children and \n     families and on children's overall classroom performance;\n       (2) expresses strong support for States that have \n     successfully implemented school breakfast programs in order \n     to alleviate hunger and improve the test scores and grades of \n     participating students;\n       (3) encourages all States to strengthen their school \n     breakfast programs, provide incentives for the expansion of \n     school breakfast programs, and promote improvements in the \n     nutritional quality of breakfasts served;

PERCHLORATE MONITORING AND RIGHT-TO-KNOW.\n\n       (a) Findings and Purpose.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (A) perchlorate--\n       (i) is a chemical used as the primary ingredient of solid \n     rocket propellant; and\n       (ii) is also used in fireworks, road flares, and other \n     applications;\n       (B) waste from the manufacture and improper disposal of \n     chemicals containing perchlorate is increasingly being \n     discovered in soil and water;\n       (C) according to the Government Accountability Office, \n     perchlorate contamination has been detected in water and soil \n     at almost 400 sites in the United States, with concentration \n     levels ranging from 4 parts per billion to millions of parts \n     per billion;\n       (D) the Government Accountability Office has determined \n     that the Environmental Protection Agency does not centrally \n     track or monitor perchlorate detections or the status of \n     perchlorate cleanup, so a greater number of contaminated \n     sites may already exist;\n       (E) according to the Government Accountability Office, \n     limited Environmental Protection Agency data show that \n     perchlorate has been found in 35 States and the District of \n     Columbia and is known to have contaminated 153 public water \n     systems in 26 States;\n       (F) those data are likely underestimates of total drinking \n     water exposure, as illustrated by the finding of the \n     California Department of Health Services that perchlorate \n     contamination sites have affected approximately 276 drinking \n     water sources and 77 drinking water systems in the State of \n     California alone;\n       (G) Food and Drug Administration scientists and other \n     scientific researchers have detected perchlorate in the \n     United States food supply, including in lettuce, milk, \n     cucumbers, tomatoes, carrots, cantaloupe, wheat, and spinach, \n     and in human breast milk;\n       (H)(i) perchlorate can harm human health, especially in \n     pregnant women and children, by interfering with uptake of \n     iodide by the thyroid gland, which is necessary to produce \n     important hormones that help control human health and \n     development;\n       (ii) in adults, the thyroid helps to regulate metabolism;\n       (iii) in children, the thyroid helps to ensure proper \n     mental and physical development; and\n       (iv) impairment of thyroid function in expectant mothers or \n     infants may result in effects including delayed development \n     and decreased learning capability;\n       (I)(i) in October 2006, researchers from the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention published the largest, most \n     comprehensive study to date on the effects of low levels of \n     perchlorate exposure in women, finding that--\n       (I) significant changes existed in thyroid hormones in \n     women with low iodine levels who were exposed to perchlorate; \n     and\n       (II) even low-level perchlorate exposure may affect the \n     production of hormones by the thyroid in iodine-deficient \n     women; and\n       (ii) in the United States, about 36 percent of women have \n     iodine levels equivalent to or below the levels of the women \n     in the study described in clause (i);\n       (J) the Environmental Protection Agency has not established \n     a health advisory or national primary drinking water \n     regulation for perchlorate, but instead established a \n     ``Drinking Water Equivalent Level'' of 24.5 parts per billion \n     for perchlorate, which--\n       (i) does not take into consideration all routes of exposure \n     to perchlorate;\n       (ii) has been criticized by experts as failing to \n     sufficiently consider the body weight, unique exposure, and \n     vulnerabilities of certain pregnant women and fetuses, \n     infants, and children; and\n       (iii) is based primarily on a small study and does not take \n     into account new, larger studies of the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention or other data indicating potential \n     effects at lower perchlorate levels than previously found;\n       (K) on August 22, 2005 (70 Fed. Reg. 49094), the \n     Administrator proposed to extend the requirement that \n     perchlorate be monitored in drinking water under the final \n     rule entitled ``Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Regulation \n     (UCMR) for Public Water Systems Revisions'' promulgated \n     pursuant to section\n\n[[Page S1605]]\n\n     1445(a)(2) of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300j-\n     4(a)(2)); and\n       (L) on December 20, 2006, the Administrator signed a final \n     rule removing perchlorate from the list of contaminants for \n     which monitoring is required under the final rule entitled \n     ``Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Regulation (UCMR) for \n     Public Water Systems Revisions'' (72 Fed.

RESOLUTION OF APOLOGY TO NATIVE PEOPLES OF UNITED \n                   STATES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the ancestors of today's Native Peoples inhabited the \n     land of the present-day United States since time immemorial \n     and for thousands of years before the arrival of people of \n     European descent;\n       (2) for millennia, Native Peoples have honored, protected, \n     and stewarded this land we cherish;\n       (3) Native Peoples are spiritual people with a deep and \n     abiding belief in the Creator, and for millennia Native \n     Peoples have maintained a powerful spiritual connection to \n     this land, as evidenced by their customs and legends;\n       (4) the arrival of Europeans in North America opened a new \n     chapter in the history of Native Peoples;\n       (5) while establishment of permanent European settlements \n     in North America did stir conflict with nearby Indian tribes, \n     peaceful and mutually beneficial interactions also took \n     place;\n       (6) the foundational English settlements in Jamestown, \n     Virginia, and Plymouth, Massachusetts, owed their survival in \n     large measure to the compassion and aid of Native Peoples in \n     the vicinities of the settlements;\n       (7) in the infancy of the United States, the founders of \n     the Republic expressed their desire for a just relationship \n     with the Indian tribes, as evidenced by the Northwest \n     Ordinance enacted by Congress in 1787, which begins with the \n     phrase, ``The utmost good faith shall always be observed \n     toward the Indians'';\n       (8) Indian tribes provided great assistance to the \n     fledgling Republic as it strengthened\n\n[[Page S1653]]\n\n     and grew, including invaluable help to Meriwether Lewis and \n     William Clark on their epic journey from St. Louis, Missouri, \n     to the Pacific Coast;\n       (9) Native Peoples and non-Native settlers engaged in \n     numerous armed conflicts in which unfortunately, both took \n     innocent lives, including those of women and children;\n       (10) the Federal Government violated many of the treaties \n     ratified by Congress and other diplomatic agreements with \n     Indian tribes;\n       (11) the United States forced Indian tribes and their \n     citizens to move away from their traditional homelands and \n     onto federally established and controlled reservations, in \n     accordance with such Acts as the Act of May 28, 1830 (4 Stat. \n     411, chapter 148) (commonly known as the ``Indian Removal \n     Act'');\n       (12) many Native Peoples suffered and perished--\n       (A) during the execution of the official Federal Government \n     policy of forced removal, including the infamous Trail of \n     Tears and Long Walk;\n       (B) during bloody armed confrontations and massacres, such \n     as the Sand Creek Massacre in 1864 and the Wounded Knee \n     Massacre in 1890; and\n       (C) on numerous Indian reservations;\n       (13) the Federal Government condemned the traditions, \n     beliefs, and customs of Native Peoples and endeavored to \n     assimilate them by such policies as the redistribution of \n     land under the Act of February 8, 1887 (25 U.S.C. 331; 24 \n     Stat. 388, chapter 119) (commonly known as the ``General \n     Allotment Act''), and the forcible removal of Native children \n     from their families to faraway boarding schools where their \n     Native practices and languages were degraded and forbidden;\n       (14) officials of the Federal Government and private United \n     States citizens harmed Native Peoples by the unlawful \n     acquisition of recognized tribal land and the theft of tribal \n     resources and assets from recognized tribal land;\n       (15) the policies of the Federal Government toward Indian \n     tribes and the breaking of covenants with Indian tribes have \n     contributed to the severe social ills and economic troubles \n     in many Native communities today;\n       (16) despite the wrongs committed against Native Peoples by \n     the United States, Native Peoples have remained committed to \n     the protection of this great land, as evidenced by the fact \n     that, on a per capita basis, more Native Peoples have served \n     in the United States Armed Forces and placed themselves in \n     harm's way in defense of the United States in every major \n     military conflict than any other ethnic group;\n       (17) Indian tribes have actively influenced the public life \n     of the United States by continued cooperation with Congress \n     and the Department of the Interior, through the involvement \n     of Native individuals in official Federal Government \n     positions, and by leadership of their own sovereign Indian \n     tribes;\n       (18) Indian tribes are resilient and determined to \n     preserve, develop, and transmit to future generations their \n     unique cultural identities;\n       (19) the National Museum of the American Indian was \n     established within the Smithsonian Institution as a living \n     memorial to Native Peoples and their traditions; and\n       (20) Native Peoples are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable rights, and among those are life, \n     liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n       (b) Acknowledgment and Apology.--The United States, acting \n     through Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the special legal and political relationship \n     Indian tribes have with the United States and the solemn \n     covenant with the land we share;\n       (2) commends and honors Native Peoples for the thousands of \n     years that they have stewarded and protected this land;\n       (3) recognizes that there have been years of official \n     depredations, ill-conceived policies, and the breaking of \n     covenants by the Federal Government regarding Indian tribes;\n       (4) apologizes on behalf of the people of the United States \n     to all Native Peoples for the many instances of violence, \n     maltreatment, and neglect inflicted on Native Peoples by \n     citizens of the United States;\n       (5) expresses its regret for the ramifications of former \n     wrongs and its commitment to build on the positive \n     relationships of the past and present to move toward a \n     brighter future where all the people of this land live \n     reconciled as brothers and sisters, and harmoniously steward \n     and protect this land together;\n       (6) urges the President to acknowledge the wrongs of the \n     United States against Indian tribes in the history of the \n     United States in order to bring healing to this land; and\n       (7) commends the State governments that have begun \n     reconciliation efforts with recognized Indian tribes located \n     in their boundaries and encourages all State governments \n     similarly to work toward reconciling relationships with \n     Indian tribes within their boundaries.\n       (c) Disclaimer.--Nothing in this section--\n       (1) authorizes or supports any claim against the United \n     States; or\n       (2) serves as a settlement of any claim against the United \n     States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/05/senate-section/article/S1653-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CALLING FOR PEACE IN DARFUR\n\n  Mr. PRYOR.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 474, submitted \nearlier today by Senator Feingold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 474) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate that providing breakfast in schools through the \n     National School Breakfast Program has a positive impact on \n     the lives and classroom performance of low-income children.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise today in support of a Senate \nresolution that expresses the Senate's esteem for and commitment to the \nNational School Breakfast Program. I am pleased to be joining Senator \nFeingold in both recognizing the good that this program accomplishes \nfor low-income children and encouraging more States to participate.\n  The United States is experiencing a hunger crisis. In 2006 alone, the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, reported that 35.5 million \nAmericans did not have the money or resources needed to provide food \nfor themselves or their families, and this number is sadly on the rise. \nBetween 2005 and 2006, the number of hungry people in the United States \nincreased by over 400,000. As we continue through hard economic times, \nwe can only assume the number of hungry people in America will continue \nto increase.\n  Hunger is not just a problem that plagues adults. Of the 35.5 million \npeople who go hungry each year in America, 12.6 million of them are \nchildren. This means that 17.2 percent of all children are unsure where \ntheir next meal will come from--which poses a real problem. Hunger \nhinders growth and development and negatively affects\n\n[[Page S1655]]\n\nhealth, leading to increased illness, fatigue, and even \nhospitalizations. Studies have also shown that hunger impairs cognitive \nfunction; hungry children are more likely to perform poorly on tests \nand repeat grades.\n  Recognizing the relationship between good nutrition and the ability \nto learn and be healthy, Congress established a pilot National School \nBreakfast Program in 1966. Because of its success in raising the \nnutrition level of needy children, Congress permanently authorized the \nprogram in 1975. Since its inception, the School Breakfast Program has \nexperienced tremendous growth. According to the USDA, the number of \nparticipating students has increased from 0.5 million children in 1970 \nto 9.7 million in 2006. This means that each day, more and more \nchildren receive a breakfast that provides them with one-fourth of the \nrecommended dietary allowance for protein, calcium, iron, Vitamin A, \nVitamin C, and calories. And because of improvements in implementation, \nincluding initiatives that provide breakfasts both in classrooms, in \nhallways, and as students exit buses, the number of students \nparticipating in the programs has doubled and in some cases tripled. \nYet the number of students participating in the Breakfast Program is \nstill much less than half of the number participating in the National \nLunch Program. It is vitally important that we keep up the National \nBreakfast Program's momentum and provide the States with the tools they \nneed to encourage as many needy children to take part as can.\n  Appreciating the importance of the program, Pennsylvania has helped \nincrease the number of schools that take advantage of this important \nprogram. Each year, Pennsylvania invests nearly $35.5 million in school \nbreakfast and lunch, paying school districts 10 cents for each \nbreakfast served and 10 cents for each lunch served. To increase the \nnumber of students receiving both breakfast and lunch, Pennsylvania \npays an additional 2 cents per lunch if breakfast is offered in the \nschool and an additional 4 cents per lunch if the school serves \nbreakfast to at least 20 percent of enrolled students. As with national \nparticipation, Pennsylvania's participation is on the rise; over 100 \nmore schools participated in the program between 2005 and 2006 than the \nprevious year. Through this resolution, we hope to encourage States, \nlike Pennsylvania, to continue to work toward our common goal of \nreducing child hunger.\n  This Senate resolution recognizes the positive impact the National \nSchool Breakfast Program has on needy children. The program not only \ngives students a balanced breakfast, it provides a solid foundation on \nwhich they can start their day. Eating breakfast alone increases \nstudent attentiveness and improves overall performance and wellness. \nThe National School Breakfast Program is making great inroads into \nchild hunger. This resolution recognizes the efforts of the States in \nimplementing the program and encourages them to expand their efforts.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate, and any statements related to the resolution be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 474) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 474\n\n       Whereas participants in the National School Breakfast \n     Program established under section 4 of the Child Nutrition \n     Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1773) include public, private, \n     elementary, middle, and high schools, as well as schools in \n     rural, suburban, and urban areas;\n       Whereas access to nutrition programs such as the National \n     School Lunch Program and the National School Breakfast \n     Program helps to create a stronger learning environment for \n     children and improves children's concentration in the \n     classroom;\n       Whereas missing breakfast and the resulting hunger has been \n     shown to harm the ability of children to learn and hinders \n     academic performance;\n       Whereas students who eat a complete breakfast have been \n     shown to make fewer mistakes and to work faster in math \n     exercises than those who eat a partial breakfast;\n       Whereas implementing or improving classroom breakfast \n     programs has been shown to increase breakfast consumption \n     among eligible students dramatically, doubling and in some \n     cases tripling numbers of participants in school breakfast \n     programs, as evidenced by research in Minnesota, New York, \n     and Wisconsin;\n       Whereas providing breakfast in the classroom has been shown \n     in several instances to improve attentiveness and academic \n     performance, while reducing absences, tardiness, and \n     disciplinary referrals;\n       Whereas studies suggest that eating breakfast closer to the \n     time students arrive in the classroom and take tests improves \n     the students' performance on standardized tests;\n       Whereas studies show that students who skip breakfast are \n     more likely to have difficulty distinguishing among similar \n     images, show increased errors, and have slower memory recall;\n       Whereas children who live in families that experience \n     hunger are likely to have lower math scores, receive more \n     special education services, and face an increased likelihood \n     of repeating a grade;\n       Whereas making breakfast widely available in different \n     venues or in a combination of venues, such as by providing \n     breakfast in the classroom, in the hallways outside \n     classrooms, or to students as they exit their school buses, \n     has been shown to lessen the stigma of receiving free or \n     reduced-price school breakfasts, which sometimes prevents \n     eligible students from obtaining traditional breakfast in the \n     cafeteria;\n       Whereas, in fiscal year 2006, 7,700,000 students in the \n     United States consumed free or reduced-price school \n     breakfasts provided under the National School Breakfast \n     Program;\n       Whereas less than half of the low-income students who \n     participate in the National School Lunch Program also \n     participate in the National School Breakfast Program;\n       Whereas almost 17,000 schools that participate in the \n     National School Lunch Program do not participate in the \n     National School Breakfast Program;\n       Whereas studies suggest that children who eat breakfast \n     take in more nutrients, such as calcium, fiber, protein, and \n     vitamins A, E, D, and B-6;\n       Whereas studies show that children who participate in \n     school breakfast programs eat more fruits, drink more milk, \n     and consume less saturated fat than those who do not eat \n     breakfast; and\n       Whereas children who do not eat breakfast, either in school \n     or at home, are more likely to be overweight than children \n     who eat a healthy breakfast on a daily basis: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the importance of the National School \n     Breakfast Program established under section 4 of the Child \n     Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1773) and the positive \n     impact of the Program on the lives of low-income children and \n     families and on children's overall classroom performance;\n       (2) expresses strong support for States that have \n     successfully implemented school breakfast programs in order \n     to alleviate hunger and improve the test scores and grades of \n     participating students;\n       (3) encourages all States to strengthen their school \n     breakfast programs, provide incentives for the expansion of \n     school breakfast programs, and promote improvements in the \n     nutritional quality of breakfasts served; and\n       (4) recognizes the need to provide States with resources to \n     improve the availability of adequate and nutritious \n     breakfasts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/05/senate-section/article/S1655-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1655-S1656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 2709, S. 2710, S. 2711, S. 2712, S. \n2713, S. 2714, S. 2715, S. 2716, S. 2717, S. 2718, S. 2719, S. 2720, S. \n                           2721, and S. 2722\n\n  Mr. PRYOR.

Mr. President, this last year, Americans sent almost half \na trillion dollars, almost $500 billion, overseas to purchase imported \noil from other countries around the world. Think about that massive \ntransfer of wealth and what that means for our national security \nbecause, in many respects, a lot of those dollars being used to \npurchase imported fuels are going to countries that are not favorable \ntoward the United States. Of course, some say it is a world market, let \nthe market work.\n  The difference is that most of our trading partners around the world \nare people we consider to be at least friends, allies, folks we do \nbusiness with. They are not countries that are funding organizations \nthat are trying to kill Americans. Regrettably, what we end up doing is \nfunding both sides of the war on terror, because we send almost half a \ntrillion dollars annually to foreign countries, petro dictators around \nthe world who use those dollars to fund terrorist organizations that \nare designed to kill Americans, and then we end up having, of course, \nto fund our military to go fight the very same terrorists. It seems \nlike a very misguided policy.\n  I make that point because I think we have a dangerous dependence on \nforeign energy. Today, 65 percent of our petroleum comes from outside \nof the United States. As most of us know, the fuels in this country are \nmostly petroleum based. The reason I say all that is I think we have an \nimportant decision to make in this country about whether we are going \nto continue to subsidize foreign governments, petro dictators who use \nthose dollars that transfer wealth out of this country to fund \nterrorist organizations that attack Americans, or whether we are going \nto make an investment in the United States that provides benefits to \nthe economy in America and provides jobs for Americans. I think that is \nan important decision we have to make.\n  For the past several years, this Congress as a matter of policy has \ntried to put into place incentives to increase the production of \nrenewable energy, and with some degree of success. If you look at last \nyear and this year, by the end of this year, we will be at about 7.5 \nbillion gallons of ethanol produced in the United States. There are \nsome 160, I think, ethanol biorefineries in this country. If you look \nat it, 22 States are home to some of those, with a collective capacity \nof over 7.5 billion gallons. There are sixty biorefineries under \nconstruction and several plants are in the process of expansion. That \nis a great story for America and for our agricultural economy. It is \nalso a great story for our national security, in my view.\n  Lately, we have had a lot of attacks launched on the ethanol \nindustry, and on renewable fuels generally. Many of them have been, \nagain in my view, very misguided and misleading in terms of the \nreporting that has been done regarding food prices. If you look at \nseveral editorials recently, the New York Times went out of their way \nto discount the impact of high energy prices and worldwide demand for \nprotein as reasons for food price increases. Rather, they decided to \nblame ethanol by\n\n[[Page S1657]]\n\nstating, ``The most important reason for the price shock is the rich \nworld's subsidized appetite for biofuels.'' The editorial board claims, \n``The benefits of this strategy are dubious.''\n  A February Washington Post article, entitled ``The Problem With \nBiofuels,'' leads the public to believe that biofuels will only serve \nto starve people. The article quotes a university study and states, \n``By putting pressure on global supplies of edible groups, the surge in \nethanol production will translate into higher prices for both processed \nand staple foods around the world.''\n  The food versus fuel debate is an important debate to have. However, \nit has to be based upon facts and not anti-\nrenewable fuel rhetoric.\n  It is a fact that energy prices have a 2-to-1 greater impact on food \nprices relative to the price of inputs such as corn.\n  Last year, John Uranchuck of LECG issued a report detailing the \nimpact of rising energy prices on the price of food. According to that \nstudy,\n\n       Increasing petroleum prices have about twice the impact on \n     consumer food prices as equivalent increases in corn prices. \n     A 33 percent increase in crude oil prices--the equivalent of \n     $1 per gallon over current levels of retail gasoline prices--\n     would increase retail food prices measured by the CPI for \n     food by 0.6 to 0.9 percent. An equivalent increase in corn \n     prices--about $1 per bushel over current levels--would \n     increase consumer food prices only 0.3 percent.\n\n  In December 2007, Informa Economics issued a report called \n``Marketing Costs and Surging Global Demand for Commodities Are Key \nDrivers of Food Price Inflation.'' This report also concluded that the \nprice of raw commodities is not the leading component of the Consumer \nPrice Index for food. Rather, this report correctly identified rising \nenergy and transportation costs as leading causes of food inflation.\n  To place the blame for food inflation on biofuels and the rising \nprices of certain commodities is simply misguided. According to the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture, costs of food inputs only account for a \nfraction of food prices. Specifically, labor, packaging, \ntransportation, advertising, and profits account for 68 cents of every \ndollar a consumer spends on food.\n  The long-term outlook for corn prices under the expanded renewable \nfuels standard is somewhere in the $3.25 to $3.50 per bushel range. To \nput that into perspective, so the average person around the country can \nunderstand what I am talking about, the average box of corn flakes \ncontains about 10 ounces or one ninetieth of a bushel of corn. Even at \n$4 corn--$4 a bushel corn--that amounts to 5 cents of corn in a box of \ncorn flakes. Think about that. A box of corn flakes. Everybody assumes \nthe farmer, because of high corn prices, is cutting a fat hog, but 5 \ncents of that goes back into the farmer's pocket. Attributing food \ninflation to biofuels and corn-based ethanol is simply untrue.\n  Now, with respect to climate change, because we have heard a lot of \ndiscussion as well and criticism of the ethanol industry with regard to \nhow it impacts that debate, critics of renewable fuels have also \nstarted blaming climate change on renewable energy. I find that hard to \nbelieve, as well, because the purpose of biofuels is to replace \npetroleum as a fuel source. For years, environmentalists have decried \npetroleum as a major emitter of harmful carbon emissions. Today, we \nhave a homegrown alternative that is displacing more and more petroleum \nby the day. Some are claiming now that ethanol is creating more global \nwarming. If our national policy is to manage climate change, falsely \nblaming ethanol for global warming is not helpful to the cause.\n  According to the Argonne National Laboratory, regular blends of \nethanol, gasoline containing 10 percent ethanol, reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions by 18 to 29 percent relative to regular gasoline.\n  As more ethanol is produced and consumed, our Nation's carbon \nfootprint will continue to shrink. In 2006, ethanol use in the United \nStates reduced carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 8 million \ntons. Such a reduction is the equivalent of removing 1.21 million cars \nfrom the road.\n  As Congress continues to debate climate change legislation and the \ncauses of global warming, it is important to set the record straight. \nEthanol production is a carbon sink, not a net producer of carbon \nemissions. Furthermore, as new types of cellulosic ethanol come online, \nthe carbon-reducing benefits of ethanol are only going to increase.\n  Ethanol may be able to be blamed for some other transformations in \nour economy. For one, increased ethanol production is allowing our \ndemand for gasoline to go down and displacing foreign imports of oil. \nAgain, I point to some of the statistics that bear that out. If you \nlook at the amount of ethanol that is being produced in America today--\nand this is based on a 2007 number--in 2007, the ethanol that was \nproduced, 6.5 billion, in this country displaced the need for 228 \nmillion barrels of oil, saving American consumers more than $16 billion \nor $45 million a day from going to countries, as I said earlier, \noutside the United States and enriching petrodictators who would do us \nill will.\n  If we look at the impact on tax revenues coming into the Treasury, \nthe ethanol industry generated an estimated $4.6 billion in Federal tax \nrevenue and $3.6 billion in additional tax revenue for State and local \ngovernments. So if you couple that with the fact that according to the \nUSDA--and I think this is an important point to make, too, by those who \nwould criticize ethanol--according to the USDA, the increased demand \nfor grain use in ethanol production reduced Federal farm program costs \nby more than $8 billion last year, meaning that even with the cost of \nthe tax incentive that we use to encourage more production of ethanol, \nethanol saved U.S. taxpayers, when you couple that with the additional \ntax revenue coming into the Treasury and the $8 billion that was saved \nbecause the Federal Government was not making farm program payments to \nfarmers in this country, U.S. taxpayers saved more than $9.2 billion as \na result of this industry.\n  Right now, about 50 percent of the gasoline in this country is \nblended with ethanol, and before very long, we hope that from coast to \ncoast we will have every single gallon of gasoline in this country \nblended with ethanol.\n  But my point very simply is: This has been a great success story, one \nwhich has benefited and enriched our country, our farmers, people in \nthis country who are working hard making a living contributing to a \nbetter quality of life for all Americans, as opposed to shipping all \nthat wealth outside the United States to other countries.\n  Let me restate what I started by saying at the very beginning, and \nthat is that last year, we spent almost half a trillion dollars, almost \n$500 billion, in purchasing imported oil. That, again, makes absolutely \nno sense to me in light of these statistics that I shared. I think as \nwe look at the future of this industry and the promise it holds and the \nbenefit it holds, not only for the economy in this country but also as \nwe get away from this dangerous dependence on foreign sources of \nenergy, renewable fuels, biofuels, have a great future for America, and \nI believe we ought to be continuing to invest in making sure that those \nwho are involved with that industry--our farmers, those who are \nconstructing ethanol plants around this country, that we provide not \nfewer incentives but more incentives for this kind of biofuel \nproduction that, again, gets rid of the carbon in our atmosphere, \ncleans up our environment, lessens our dependence on foreign sources of \nenergy, and puts dollars back into the pockets of hard-working \nAmericans, farmers, the rural economy, creating jobs, helping grow the \neconomy right here at home in the United States rather than shipping \nthose dollars to some foreign country where, again, many of these \ndollars are used to turn around and fund organizations that are \ndesigned to undermine America's interests around the world.\n  This debate will continue to percolate around this country, but when \nwe get into this debate about food versus fuel, it is important we have \nthe facts in front of us because this industry has undergone a lot of \ncriticism of late. As I said before, I think much of it is misguided \nbecause it is based on misinformation and wrong facts. We need to have \nthe facts in front of us, and then we can have a meaningful debate. \nUntil that happens, we are going to hear more of these false attacks \nagainst an industry that is creating American jobs, helping reduce our \ndependence on foreign energy, and I hope, in the very near future, we \nwill be able\n\n[[Page S1658]]\n\nto increase the amount not only of production in this country but the \namount of consumption because I believe in the very near future we will \nstart seeing more and more momentum for increasing the blend rate.\n  Right now, we blend 10 percent ethanol, as I said, in 50 percent of \nthe gasoline in the country. I hope in the future we can increase that \nto 20 percent. The University of Minnesota completed a study where they \ncompared effects of 10 percent and 20 percent on materials \ncompatibility, driveability--all those types of issues. The result of \nthe data that came from that study was that you can move to a 20-\npercent blend, a higher blend, an intermediate blend right now and have \nno impact on any of those issues.\n  The issue of emissions is still being studied. The renewable energy \nlaboratory in Golden, CO, and the Department of Energy and EPA are \nundertaking some studies. When that data comes in, I believe it will \nshow what the University of Minnesota study has shown and that is you \ncan go to a higher blend with minimal impact and, in fact, in many \ncases with a better result; that we should move very quickly. I am \ngoing to encourage the administration and continue to try to influence \nthat decisionmaking process in a way that will increase the amount of \nethanol that is used in this country so, again, we can achieve the many \nbenefits that I think dependence on American agriculture creates for us \nas opposed to our dependence upon foreign energy.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/05/senate-section/article/S1658-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
