I understand that has been \noffered by Senator DeMint. The proposal is for the amendment to be \nvoted on at 2:30 on Tuesday. We hope that can be accomplished sometime \nearly this afternoon as to whether we will be able to lock in this \nagreement. I will be in a position at that time to announce our vote \nschedule, which is at 5:30 today. However, Members are alerted that a \nvote or votes could occur at 5:30 today. I will provide more \ninformation as the day proceeds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/05/senate-section/article/S2567-7", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I received a call yesterday that Tom \nEagleton died. Tom Eagleton was a wonderful man. He served in the \nSenate representing the State of Missouri from 1968 to 1987.\n  I got to know Senator Eagleton. I met him when I was in the House of \nRepresentatives. He had previously, prior to coming to the Senate, been \nelected Missouri's attorney general and Lieutenant Governor.\n  One thing I wish to mention very briefly today: He was selected by \nSenator McGovern to be his Vice President. As some will recall, that \nlasted only 2 or 3 weeks because it came out he had received some \nattention for a\n\n[[Page S2568]]\n\nmedical problem that was related to an emotional problem, mental \nproblem.\n  If that same thing occurred today, it would not have mattered. We \nhave made progress in accepting people who have emotional problems for \nwhatever reason, that they are just as sick as someone who has other \nkinds of problems. It is too bad there will always be this asterisk \nwith Tom Eagleton. However, he was selected to be Senator McGovern's \nVice President but was not able to continue in that position because of \na medical condition.\n  He was a wonderful man who served in the Navy. He graduated from \nHarvard Law School. His father was a lawyer who loved politics and ran \nfor public office in Missouri. He served on the St. Louis Police Board \nand the Board of Education.\n  Tom is survived by his wife, the former Barbara Ann Smith. They \nmarried in 1956. He has two children. He left the Senate 20 years ago, \nas I indicated earlier. He was a tremendously good Senator. As the \nChaplain indicated today, our prayers go out to his family. Senator \nEagleton will be missed. He has made his mark on our country and the \nworld. He fought for clean water and clean air. He had strong beliefs \non the conflict in Vietnam. He showed, over a lifetime, that one man \ncan make a difference.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope all Senators will pause to reflect on the \nservice this great man made to our country. I am sure we should all \nunderstand if we patterned our political career after Tom Eagleton, we \ncould not go wrong.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/05/senate-section/article/S2568-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last week, my majority colleagues and I on \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs submitted the required views and \nestimates on the administration's fiscal year 2008 budget for the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs.\n  In summary, we are recommending a $2.9 billion increase over the \nadministration's request for veterans medical care. We believe this is \nthe total amount necessary to treat all eligible veterans from World \nWar II until the present time and to maintain the quality of VA medical \nservices through the upcoming fiscal year.\n  This amount would also provide the VA with resources to absorb the \nthousands of service members presently on medical hold at Walter Reed \nand in other military facilities. There is no question we must ensure \nthese brave men and women are provided the best care possible.\n  Today's Washington Post leads with a story titled, ``It Is Just Not \nWalter Reed.'' The story focuses on the various Federal facilities \nacross the system, including VA facilities. I urge my colleagues to \nunderstand that at the heart of any solution to improve care is \nincreasing resources to match demand and to ensure the facilities \nthemselves are up to par.\n  I intend to hold a hearing later this month on cooperation between VA \nand the Department of Defense on the treatment of injured service \nmembers, and I will pursue the situation at Walter Reed and other \nmilitary treatment facilities that are handling the bulk of returning \nIraq and Afghanistan war veterans to ensure the Government is helping \nthose who have been injured in service to our country and their \nfamilies.\n  I wish to highlight a few of the accounts for which we are seeking \nsubstantial increases.\n  In our estimate, we recommended an additional $300 million for \ntreatment of traumatic brain injuries. These funds will support the \nexpansion of VA's capacity and will help to resolve case management \nproblems identified in an IG investigation last summer. Traumatic brain \ninjuries are turning out to be the hallmark of this war. We simply must \nensure that VA has the resources to do more than just keep up but to \nbecome a leader in brain injury care.\n  The recent televised account of ABC newsman Bob Woodruff's long \nrecovery from a brain injury endured in Iraq has highlighted the \nsuffering of new veterans and their families. Looking at these young \nsoldiers with such devastating injuries reminds us of the true costs of \nwar.\n  We know the transition from DOD to VA can be a tough one. This is \neven more true for those veterans suffering with TBI. At the start of \nthis war, VA was unprepared to deal with returning service members with \ninjuries of all kinds. The budgets in the early years underestimated \nthese costs, and many VA facilities were caught flatfooted.\n  Over the last year, VA has made strides in improving the lead brain \ninjury centers. Yet VA still has miles to go in caring for service \nmembers when they return home to their communities. Many of these men \nand women are quite young and will live with brain injuries for the \nrest of their lives. VA must do more than simply send them back to \ntheir communities.\n  I am also concerned that veterans with less severe forms of TBI may \nnot be receiving appropriate compensation for their injuries. We need \nto make sure VA has the resources necessary to provide for specialist \nexaminations and appropriate testing so that veterans who file claims \nfor headaches, memory loss, and other effects of TBI may be properly \ncompensated and rehabilitated.\n  We also recommended an increase of $693 million over the \nadministration's request for VA mental health programs. These funds are \nessential to guarantee timely access to mental health services for \nveterans of the global war on terror and prior conflicts, including the \nVietnam war. We have heard too many stories already of veterans in \ncrisis who were unable to see a mental health professional because of a \nlack of staff or beds at VA facilities. It is about time we fully fund \nVA's mental health programs so that not one more troubled veteran finds \nhimself or herself on the street for lack of therapy, counseling or, \nfar worse, takes his or her own life.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I am deeply \ncommitted to having all in Congress recognize the reality that meeting \nthe needs of veterans is truly part of the ongoing costs of war. I urge \nmy fellow Senators to join us as we work to uphold our end of the \nbargain by giving our Nation's veterans accessible first-rate medical \ncare. We owe it to them and they deserve it.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for up to 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.

Madam President, this morning in the Washington Post \nnewspaper, there is a story that is headlined:\n\n       It Is Just Not Walter Reed. Soldiers Share Trouble Stories \n     of Military Health Care Across the U.S.\n\n  I read that story and have read the previous stories in the \nWashington Post about the issue of outpatient health care at Walter \nReed. I have visited Walter Reed many times, and I have visited \nBethesda many times, and I have visited with wounded soldiers. I have \nspoken to doctors and nurses, health care professionals, people who \nwork at Walter Reed and Bethesda. I\n\n[[Page S2569]]\n\nhave to tell my colleagues that I come away from those experiences \nthinking how unbelievably dedicated the people who are working in those \nhospitals are to save lives. There are a lot of them. I hope the \nefforts and the work they do tirelessly 24 hours a day are not in any \nway diminished by these stories.\n  The stories the Post has published are accurate. The stories about \nthe outpatient buildings at Walter Reed needing repair and not being \nrepaired are accurate. The stories about the system well beyond \nWashington, DC, are accurate stories. But I would say there are a lot \nof dedicated people working in that system who are trying to do the \nbest they can to work as hard as they can work to save lives and help \nour veterans. Their role needs to be understood and applauded as well.\n  Even as I say that, let me describe something else. As the headline \nsays: ``It Is Just Not Walter Reed.'' It was over a month ago I was on \nthe floor of the Senate, and what brought me to the floor of the Senate \nto talk about these issues was this story in the Minneapolis Star \nTribune. The story says in the headline:\n\n       This Marine's Death Came After He Served in Iraq. When \n     Jonathan Schulze came home from Iraq, he tried to live a \n     normal life, but the war kept that from happening.\n\n  The story talks about this young man who went to Iraq when America \nasked him to go fight for his country, was engaged in some bitter, \ndifficult fighting, and when he came back from Iraq, he had very \nserious problems; very significant, serious difficulties, and he \ncouldn't deal with them. As they buried this young man who committed \nsuicide, on his casket was recognition of his two Purple Hearts earned \nfrom his service in Iraq. He was a real soldier in some of the \nbloodiest battles of Iraq. I have spoken to his family and they told me \nof this young man seeing the head of one of his best friends being \nblown off, some of the most unbelievable things a person can see in \nbattle. He came back from Iraq with very serious problems. He tried \nvery hard to get those problems resolved. He was in and out of the VA \nsystem. This story describes his circumstances.\n  I happened to be in Minneapolis the day this story was published in \nthe Minneapolis Star Tribune. It was on a Saturday. When I came back to \nWashington, DC, the following week, I came to the floor of the Senate \nand said I was going to write the inspector general with a request: \nWould you investigate what has happened here? This is a man, according \nto this story and according to his family with whom I have spoken, who \nwent to the VA system and said: I am suicidal. I have been thinking \nabout committing suicide. I need help.\n  In fact, the second time he went to the VA system asking to be \nadmitted to the hospital, he had packed his bags and brought them with \nhim, hoping to be admitted. His family, standing behind him during the \ninterview at the hospital, heard him tell them he was suicidal. They \nsaid: We can't do a prescreening for you today. You will have to come \nback. The family had driven some 70, 75 miles to get there that day. \nThe next day he called and was told he is No. 26 on the list to be \nadmitted. Three days later he hung himself.\n  This young man fought for his country, came back seeking help, and he \ndidn't get the help. So they had a funeral for this young man, Jonathan \nSchulze, who cried out for help and didn't get it. At the funeral was a \npicture of this young marine with his two Purple Hearts, a proud young \nman who served his country with great valor and great distinction. But \nhis country didn't serve him very well when he came back with very \nserious problems.\n  I came to the floor of the Senate and said I was sending the \ninspector general a request that he investigate what has happened here. \nWhat happened when this young man goes to a hospital and says: I am \nthinking of committing suicide, I need to be admitted to your hospital, \nand is turned away? How does that happen? Is it an isolated instance?\n  Last week a mother called me. She told me her son had come back from \nIraq and he had very serious problems. They went to the VA hospital. \nThis is a young man coming back from soldiering in Iraq with very \nserious emotional problems, a substance abuse addiction, he couldn't \nsleep, and at night would pull the covers over his head and scream, \nwake up from nightmares. So they went to the VA system and his mother \nsaid: We really didn't get much help. They had very limited capability \nto help; not enough staff. So she said: We worked through the private \nsector with some psychiatrists and others for a year, and my son \nfinally improved and got much, much better, after a long year. She \ncalled me last week because she said her son had received an alert \nnotice that his unit was to be activated in June, likely to go back to \nIraq. That is why that mother was calling me. But her message was in \nmany ways about the issue of care in the VA system. Let me say again, I \nhave great admiration for a lot of men and women who work in that \nsystem. I think there are a lot of soldiers who get some good help. But \nI do think the VA is understaffed. I don't think there is much question \nabout that. I think very significant mistakes are made when there are \nnot the resources to help.\n\n  When this young man comes back from Iraq, Jonathan Schulze, who earns \ntwo Purple Hearts and cries out for help and this country doesn't help \nbecause somehow he falls through the cracks--he goes to the hospital \nand says: I need to be admitted, I am thinking of committing suicide--\nand they send him home, there is something dreadfully wrong. Yes, the \nWashington Post was right this morning; this is not just about Iraq; \nthis is not just about Walter Reed. This is also about the VA system, \nand whether this President is asking for enough funding for that \nsystem.\n  I was reading the transcript this morning of a hearing that Senator \nAkaka, who just spoke, recently chaired. He asked about the President's \nbudget that proposes a cut to inpatient care for mental health in the \nVA system. That is exactly the wrong thing to do. It is precisely the \nwrong direction to go.\n  I received a letter from the inspector general 3 days after I had \nwritten to him, on February 9. He writes this:\n\n       In response to your letter, my office has opened an inquiry \n     and will provide you with the results upon completion.\n\n  So the inspector general is now investigating.\n  Let me also say I worry about the leadership there. I don't know what \ncauses this, but here is what the head of the VA said at the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee hearing on February 13. He says:\n\n       There is no veteran who is in need of, as I say, emergent \n     or emergency care that doesn't get it immediately.\n\n  Let me say that again. This is a quote from Mr. Nicholson, who runs \nthe VA system:\n\n       There is no veteran who is in need of, as I say, emergent \n     or emergency care that doesn't get it immediately.\n\n  Well, Jonathan Schulze didn't get it. He showed up with his bags \npacked and told the VA he was thinking of committing suicide and needed \nto be admitted, and he was sent home. He didn't get the help. That was \nemergency help that was needed. I don't understand how the Secretary \ncan say this. Clearly there are soldiers around the country who are \nreleased from inpatient care at Walter Reed and Bethesda, who transfer \nout of the active-duty system and become a veteran, and all of a sudden \nthe standard of care, the standard of rehabilitation is different. That \nis quite clear. That is not in dispute. That shouldn't be the case. We \nspend hundreds of billions of dollars going to war. There is no \ndifference between a soldier on active duty and a wounded soldier who \ncomes back home and leaves the acute care facility of Walter Reed or \nBethesda. There is no difference, and they ought not be treated \ndifferently. Their standard of care ought to be identical. I don't \nunderstand a circumstance where the head of the VA says:\n\n       There is no one in need of, as I say, emergent or emergency \n     care that doesn't get it immediately.\n\n  That is clearly not accurate. He is the Secretary and should know it \nis not accurate. I do not understand it. As I have indicated, I asked \nthe inspector general to investigate the Jonathan Schulze situation, \nthis young man who committed suicide, took his life when he showed up \nwith his bags packed, asking to be admitted to the hospital. I hope \nwhat has happened recently will persuade the President, the Secretary, \nthe Congress to get this right. We owe\n\n[[Page S2570]]\n\nit to those young men and women. The number of people coming back--\n24,900 American servicemen have been wounded, 11,200 seriously. \nVirtually all of us here have seen those soldiers lying seriously \nwounded. Does anyone think they don't have the highest claim on this \ncountry's resources to reach out and help them with everything that is \navailable to us? Does anyone believe there is something more important \nthan that? If so, I want to know what it is. I hope very much, whether \nit is the Jonathan Schulze case or any of the other cases, this \ninvestigation is thorough, complete, urgent, and is completed in a way \nthat says to this President: You can't seriously continue to consider \ncutting inpatient care for mental health in the VA system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/05/senate-section/article/S2570-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2570-S2571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       AMENDMENT NO. 313 TO S. 4\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I want to talk briefly about an \namendment I have offered to the underlying piece of legislation.\n  I would like to ask it be considered in morning business as a \nseparate subject.\n  I have offered an amendment that is very simple. It calls for a \nreport every 6 months by this administration on the subject of what is \nhappening with respect to the search for Osama bin Laden and the \nleadership of al-Qaida. I hope I will get a vote on that amendment \nperhaps this afternoon, and if not, I hope by tomorrow. That amendment \nwas one I offered last week. I want to show a couple of charts that \ndescribe why I have offered such an amendment.\n  Mr. Negroponte was the Director of National Intelligence until about \ntwo weeks ago. He and the current leader of the intelligence service \nhave said the same thing in open testimony before the Congress:\n\n       Al-Qaida is the terrorist organization that poses the \n     greatest threat to U.S. interests, including to the homeland.\n\n  He also said this:\n\n       Al-Qaida continues to plot attacks against our homeland and \n     other targets with the objective of inflicting mass \n     casualties. And they continue to maintain active connections \n     and relationships that radiate outward from their leaders \n     from a secure hideout in Pakistan.\n\n  Again, it says from their secure hideout in Pakistan. On September \n15, 2001, 4 days after 9/11, recognizing it was al-Qaida and Osama bin \nLaden and the al-Qaida leadership that attacked this country and \nboasted about it, the President said this:\n\n       We will not only deal with those who dare attack Americans; \n     we will deal with those who harbor them and feed them and \n     house them.\n\n  Two months later he said:\n\n       As a part of our offensive against terror, we are also \n     confronting the regimes that harbor and support terrorists.\n\n  Two months following that he said:\n\n       Osama bin Laden has no place to train his al-Qaida killers \n     anymore. And if we find a training camp, we will take care of \n     it.\n\n  Well, the head of intelligence for this country says he knows where \nthe al-Qaida leadership is. We saw last week film clips on television \nof al-Qaida training camps. Yet somehow there is a giant yawn about all \nof this. In fact, the President later said, in 2003:\n\n       I don't know where bin Laden is. I have no idea and really \n     don't care. It is not important, and it is not our priority.\n\n  He also said:\n\n       I am not truly that concerned about him.\n\n  If the head of intelligence for this country says the greatest threat \nposed to this country by a terrorist organization is a threat that \ncomes from al-Qaida, a threat to our homeland to inflict mass \ncasualties, and they are in a secure hideout in Pakistan, and if, in \nfact, the President previously said as a part of our offensive against \nterror we are also confronting the regimes that harbor and support \nterrorists, and if Pakistan is our ally and al-Qaida is located there \nto train new terrorists, why on Earth are we not going after the \nleadership of al-Qaida? What explains that? It, frankly, escapes me.\n  I have introduced a piece of legislation that does three things: \nFirst, every 6 months, there will be a report from this administration \nto the Congress--a classified report--telling us where is the al-Qaida \nleadership. If they now say they are in a secure hideout in Pakistan, \nthey can reaffirm that; and, if not, where are they?\n  Second, tell us each country where bin Laden, Zawahiri, and other \nleadership may be and whether the government of each country is \ncooperating with our attempts to capture them. If these countries are \nallies, are they harboring these terrorists, preventing us from the \nopportunity to go and eliminate the leadership of this terrorist \norganization?\n  Third, this report will require the heads of our intelligence and of \nour Defense Department to tell us what additional resources they need \nto capture the leadership of al-Qaida.\n  Today, it is 2,001 days--let me mark that--since the terrorist attack \nagainst our country which murdered thousands of innocent Americans. \nOsama bin Laden, Zawahiri, and others in al-Qaida boasted about being \nthe perpetrators of that terrorist attack. That was 9/11/2001.\n  Coincidentally, today is 2,001 days later. The perpetrators who \nboasted that they committed the terrorist acts against our country that \nmurdered so many thousands of Americans remain, apparently, in a secure \nhideout in Pakistan and still taunt us. They send the television and \nthe radio stations their videos and their voice tracks telling us their \nviews of world events.\n  I have said before on the floor of the Senate in recent weeks, if we \nhave 21,000 soldiers to surge somewhere, I would much prefer those \n21,000 soldiers be surged to find the leadership and eliminate the \nleadership of al-Qaida. I don't understand why this administration \nsays: We don't know where he is. I have no idea and really don't care. \nIt is not that important. It is not our priority.\n  That comes from the President. But his top intelligence chief says \nthey are in a secure hideout in Pakistan. Even more important, I don't \nunderstand when the President says he is not concerned about him. The \ntop intelligence chief said this is the greatest threat to our country. \nWe better be concerned about him--the President and the Congress and \nthe American people. We ought to be concerned enough to decide this is \na priority; it is a priority for us to bring to justice those who are \nthe greatest threat to our country, the greatest terrorist threat.\n  That doesn't come from me. That comes from Mr. Negroponte and his \nsuccessor who, in the last 2 months, both said the greatest terrorist \nthreat to our country is al-Qaida. They continue to plot attacks \nagainst our homeland with the objective of inflicting mass casualties, \nand they radiate outward from their leaders from a secure hideout in \nPakistan. It is unbelievable to me that 2,001 days later that we saw, \naccording to the New York Times 2 weeks ago, ``Terror Officials See \nQaeda Chiefs Regaining Power.''\n\n       Senior leaders of al-Qaeda operating from Pakistan over the \n     last year have set up a band of training camps in the tribal \n     regions near the Afghan border, according to American \n     intelligence and counterterrorism officials. American \n     officials said there was mounting evidence that Osama bin \n     Laden and his deputy, al-Zawahiri, have been steadily \n     building an operations hub in the mountainous Pakistani \n     tribal area of north Waziristan.\n\n  I don't have the foggiest idea how this is allowed to continue or to \nhappen. In fact, my colleague and I--Senator Conrad and I--offered an \namendment similar to this some months ago. It was dropped in \nconference. Senator Conrad joins me as a cosponsor of this amendment \nthis time as well. Both of us believe there is something missing. When \nwe offered it the last time, there was this enormous concern about our \noffering it. It seems to me that this just makes common sense--find out \nwhat is the most significant threat to our country and take steps to \neliminate that threat.\n  This country took its eye off the issue of Afghanistan. All of us \nunderstand that, regrettably. I worry about what might happen in \nAfghanistan this year. We took our eye off this issue. Osama bin \nLaden--you haven't heard his name around here for a long while. It was \nOsama ``been forgotten.'' Nobody talked about him. Even the President \nsaid: I don't know where he is. I don't care. It is not important, and \nit is not our priority.\n  What on Earth is that? I don't understand it. This amendment is \nsimple. We are asking for three steps. Every 6 months we would like a \nreport. What are you doing? What is the progress in dealing with the \ngreatest terrorist threat to this country? Don't tell us that we don't \nhave time or resources to\n\n[[Page S2571]]\n\ndeal with the greatest terrorist threat to our country. We must deal \nwith that threat, and we must deal with it on an urgent basis.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Madam President, I want to speak briefly on four \ndifferent amendments that are pending to the 9/11 bill that is on the \nSenate floor. First of all, I want to talk about the issue of homeland \nsecurity grant funding. Today, I will join with my colleague, Senator \nDianne Feinstein of California, and several other colleagues and ask \nthat this amendment be accepted. It stands on the principle that the \nlimited funds that are available from the taxpayers' pockets to pay for \nhomeland security be prioritized based on security concerns and not \ndivvied up based on porkbarrel politics.\n  I realize the first instinct, perhaps, of a body that represents as \ndiverse a nation as ours, with 50 States, is to take whatever amount of \nmoney there might be for any particular project and figure a way to \ndivide it up 50 ways.\n  We know our security risks are not based on that sort of structure or \napproach, and it is important that we do try to take the limited \nresources we have available for homeland security grant funding and \nallocate them on a risk-based approach.\n  This approach is pretty simple. It is so simple and so commonsense, \nit strikes me as unusual that it has not already been embraced by the \nCongress. It is simply a system that will protect our most vulnerable \nassets and populations, one that recognizes the need to protect the \ncritical infrastructure and vital components of our national economy. \nIt is vital that we better allocate our limited resources to the most \nvulnerable places in the country that we need to protect, and that \nthese funds be distributed in an efficient and timely manner.\n  The principle upon which this risk-based funding is premised has \nthree main criteria: threat, vulnerability, and consequence. That is, \nwhat is the greatest threat to our country? What is the greatest \nvulnerability in terms of if there was a successful attack against our \nNation's infrastructure, what infrastructure would be the most \nvulnerable and have the greatest negative consequence on our country?\n  It requires States to quickly pass on Federal funds to areas where \nthey are most needed as well and provides greater flexibility using \nthese funds and that they be done consistent with federally established \ncapability standards.\n  This amendment would allow States to retain authority to administer \ngrant programs, but there are penalties to States that do not pass \nfunds on to local governments within 45 days. If a State fails to pass \nthe funds through, local governments may, under this amendment, \npetition the Department of Homeland Security to receive those funds \ndirectly.\n  This is an attempt to respond to one of the concerns I hear in my \nState from local governments and local authorities that are dependent \non the State government to actually pass the funds through. In fact, \ndespite the good work this body did on issues such as Hurricane Katrina \nand Hurricane Rita relief, we find that a lot of the funds that have \nbeen appropriated by Congress are simply bogged down in the \nbureaucratic structure when it moves from the Federal Government to the \nState government on to local governments.\n  So this amendment, which I hope our colleagues will support and which \nwill actually result in a net increase in funds to 70 percent of the \nStates, is based on two fundamental premises. One is that we ought to \nallocate those limited funds based on risk, vulnerability, and \nconsequence, and that we ought to then try to get the money to the \nlocal officials and the local persons who need it most and to break it \nout of this bureaucratic structure that too often delays funds getting \nto the people who need it most quickly.\n  I also have offered an amendment separately, amendment No. 312, about \nwhich I wish to speak briefly. This is a terrorism recruiting \nprohibition and penalty that is lacking under our current law. We know \nit has been more than 5 years since we were attacked on September 11. \nIt is important, as time works to ease the pain on that terrible day, \nthat we in Congress ensure we are providing every possible tool to \nprevent another terrorist attack on American soil. We have made \nsignificant progress in updating our law enforcement and intelligence \nagencies, enabling them to better protect us at home and abroad, but \nthere is still a lot we need to do.\n  One area we must address and is addressed by this amendment is the \nissue of terrorist recruiting.\n  The FBI and other agencies of the Federal Government have made it \nclear that al-Qaida and other terrorists are intent on striking us \nagain. We know from the 9/11 report that al-Qaida is patient and \nwilling to wait years to take advantage of an opportunity to attack us, \nand in the meanwhile, they carefully formulate how they will carry out \ntheir plan. According to congressional testimony, terrorists and \nterrorist sympathizers are seeking to recruit people within the United \nStates. Of course, their goal is to find individuals who do not fit the \ntraditional terrorist model who are willing to engage in terrorism. \nRecruiting these individuals who blend easily into our society provides \nal-Qaida and other terrorists an operational advantage.\n  This is not, however, an academic discussion. Let me use one example \nof why I believe this amendment should be adopted.\n  Intelligence documents regarding Khalid Shaikh Mohammed--the so-\ncalled mastermind behind 9/11--reveal that he was running terrorist \ncells in the United States. These documents also show that it was al-\nQaida's goal to recruit U.S. citizens and other westerners who could \nmove freely in the United States. They targeted mosques, prisons, and \nuniversities throughout the United States where they could identify and \nrecruit people who they thought might be sympathetic to their cause and \nthen persuade these individuals to join their terrorist organization.\n  Currently--and this is a shocking fact--we have no statutes \nspecifically designed to punish those who recruit people to commit \nterrorist acts. The amendment I am offering would remedy this serious \ngap in our law. My amendment simply provides that it is against the law \nto recruit or, in the words of the amendment, ``to employ, solicit, \ninduce, command, or cause'' any person to commit an act of domestic \nterrorism, international terrorism, or Federal crime of terrorism, and \nany person convicted of doing so would face severe punishment. This \namendment would also provide that anyone committing this crime would be \npunished for up to 10 years in Federal prison. If death of an \nindividual results, he or she would be punished, on a finding and \nconviction of guilt, to death or any term of years or for life. If \nserious bodily injury to any individual results, the punishment would \nbe no less than 10 years or for no more than 25 years.\n  I believe this is a commonsense amendment designed to fill a serious \ngap in our Criminal Code that should not exist any longer, certainly \nnot this long after 9/11. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  I have also offered amendment No. 311, which is one that is not \nunfamiliar to Members of this body. I offered this amendment during our \nimmigration debates last year. It is one supported by the Department of \nHomeland Security because this amendment, which received bipartisan \nsupport last year, will remove current litigation barriers impeding the \nability of the Secretary of Homeland Security to do his job;\n\n[[Page S2572]]\n\nthat is, enforce the immigration laws, especially as they are related \nto apprehension, detention, and expedited removals of illegal aliens.\n\n  We know one of the most obvious symbols of the Federal Government's \nfailure to deal with our immigration problem and our broken borders is \nthe now repudiated catch-and-release program where, because of lack of \nadequate facilities to detain individuals, particularly coming from \ncountries other than Mexico, they were often caught and then simply \nreleased on their own recognizance and asked to return for a \ndeportation hearing at a later time. Unsurprisingly, the vast majority \nof these individuals did not appear for their deportation hearing but \nmerely melted into the landscape.\n  In this particular instance, this amendment is designed to address a \nparticular court-ordered permanent injunction issued in an immigration \ncase 19 years ago. This is the Orantes case. This Orantes injunction \nhas hindered the Department of Homeland Security to promptly remove, \nimmediately after apprehension, Salvadoran illegal aliens.\n  While Secretary Chertoff has made great strides in increasing the \nnumber of illegal aliens from countries other than Mexico detained for \nremoval along the southwest border and recently ended catch-and-release \nat the border, the limitations contained in this injunction still \nimpede the enforcement efforts of the Department of Homeland Security.\n  Similarly, other longstanding injunctions have not only impeded the \nability of the Department of Homeland Security to enforce our \nimmigration laws but have also consumed vast amounts of resources and, \nin some cases, are now inconsistent with intervening changes in the \nlaw.\n  This amendment does not eliminate injunctive relief but only requires \nthat injunctions be drawn narrowly and not unnecessarily impede the \nenforcement of our immigration laws. Congress enacted comparable \nlegislation narrowing the basis for injunctive relief in the Prison \nLitigation Reform Act of 1995, and that legislation has been upheld by \nthe Supreme Court.\n  This amendment would simply require that courts narrowly tailor \ninjunctive relief orders against the Government in immigration cases. \nCourts must limit relief to the minimum necessary to remedy the \nviolation; adopt the least intrusive means to remedy violations; \nminimize the adverse impact on national security, border security, \nimmigration administration and enforcement, and public safety; and \nfinally, provide an expiration date for injunctive relief.\n  This amendment would provide that preliminary injunctive relief would \nexpire in 90 days from issuance of an order unless the court makes \nfindings that permanent relief is required or makes the order final \nbefore the 90-day period.\n  This amendment would also require courts to rule promptly on all \nGovernment motions to eliminate injunctions in immigration cases.\n  If we are serious about creating an immigration law that will \nactually work, then we have to eliminate 19-year-old impediments, such \nas the Orantes injunction, to our ability to end once and for all the \nfailed policy of catch-and-release when it comes to illegal \nimmigration. I hope my colleagues will vote favorably for amendment No. \n311, which will end this particular impediment, now 19 years old in the \nOrantes case.\n  The last amendment I have is amendment No. 310, known as the Zadvydas \namendment because this amendment will strengthen the Government's \nability to detain criminal aliens, including murderers, rapists, and \nchild molesters, until they can actually be removed. This amendment \narises out of a decision handed down by the U.S. Supreme Court--it is \nnot a constitutional decision; it is merely based upon a statute, one \nwhich Congress can fix and which my amendment will fix. But this \ndecision in June of 2001 simply provided that unless there is a \nreasonable likelihood that a criminal alien who is being held by the \nGovernment will actually be repatriated to their government within a \ngiven period of time, failing that, they must be simply released and \ncannot be held any longer by the U.S. Government. Although the \nGovernment has authority to detain suspected terrorists, under this \ndecision, it has only limited authority to detain criminal aliens who \nhave been ordered removed.\n  Under the Zadvydas decision, the Federal Government has had to \nrelease hundreds of dangerous illegal aliens into the American \npopulation. Among them is Carlos Rojas Fritze, who sodomized, raped, \nbeat, and robbed a stranger in a public restroom and called it ``an act \nof love.'' Tuan Thai, who repeatedly raped, tortured, and terrorized \nwomen and vowed to repeat his crimes and who also threatened to kill \nhis immigration judge and prosecutor, was likewise released because \nunder this decision he could not be held pending repatriation to his \ncountry of origin.\n  Guillermo Perez Aguilar, who repeatedly committed sex crimes against \nchildren and was arrested for possession of a controlled substance, is \nalso an example of an individual who had to be released into the \nAmerican population because he could no longer be held under our \nimmigration laws pending repatriation because of the Zadvydas decision.\n  The list of criminal offenders such as these is long, and it is \nsimply unacceptable that these individuals can roam freely in American \nsociety because of the way our current laws are interpreted.\n  Zadvydas and Suarez Martinez, which is another case following the \nZadvydas case, were simply statutory holdings, not constitutional \nholdings. As I mentioned a moment ago, Congress has the power--and, I \nwould argue, the duty--to address these perils to our security by \namending the Immigration and Naturalization Act. Indeed, in the \nZadvydas opinion, the Court invited Congress to revisit the statute.\n  Another anomaly created by a recent decision out of the Ninth Circuit \nis a view that the Department of Homeland Security cannot even detain \naliens during removal proceedings. Neither the Zadvydas nor the Suarez \nMartinez decision made any pronouncements on the Department of Homeland \nSecurity's authority to detain an alien prior to removal proceedings \nbeing completed and a removal order issued.\n  My amendment, which will essentially cure the defect found by the \nSupreme Court in the Zadvydas case, will clarify that an illegal \ncriminal alien can be detained while removal proceedings are ongoing. \nFinally, it will provide that judicial review of ongoing detention, as \nwith post-order detention, remains available in the U.S. District Court \nfor the District of Columbia via habeas corpus proceedings. In other \nwords, there will be periodic administrative review of the detentions \nand an opportunity for judicial review via habeas corpus in the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia, which should address any \nconstitutional concerns about indefinite detentions.\n  It is simply unacceptable that we should stand by and fail to act on \nthis serious threat to public safety in this country, and this sort of \ninaction, when it comes to immigration, I think seriously undermines \nAmerican confidence in their Government. What government would stand by \nand allow these dangerous criminal aliens to simply be released into \nthe American heartland when their country of origin has refused or \nperhaps only delayed the repatriation of these individuals back to \ntheir country of origin?\n\n  We can fix this mistake and this great danger to America's national \nsecurity by adopting this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n15 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we return now to S. 4, Improving \nAmerica's Security Act. This is the legislation that emerged from the \nHomeland Security Committee in response to the appeals of the members \nof the 9/11 Commission, and others, to finish the job we began with the \nprevious 9/11 legislation we adopted. We made some progress last week \nin the first two days of consideration of the bill. We will have a vote \nsometime tomorrow on the motion to strike the provision of the bill \nthat would give equal rights to transportation security officers at the \nTSA. We will begin debate sometime this afternoon on alternative \nproposals to those presented in S. 4 for distributing homeland security \ngrant funds. We have important matters to debate and vote on in the \nnext few days.\n  I know Senator Reid and, I hope, Senator McConnell want to finish \nthis bill--that is, to bring it to passage--by the end of this week. I \nremind colleagues that S. 4 was reported out of the Homeland Security \nCommittee on a strong nonpartisan vote, 16 to 0, with one member \nabstaining.\n  I thought, as we return to the consideration of S. 4, I might go back \nto a hearing our committee held on January 9 to consider this \nlegislation, particularly to draw from the testimony of three of the \nwitnesses before the committee that day, three women who lost loved \nones on September 11, 2001. This is a way, before we get into the \ndetails of the bill, to remind ourselves why this legislation is before \nus and what it is all about. Those three women who testified before our \ncommittee on that day, shortly after the 110th session of Congress \nconvened, were Mary Fetchet, Carol Ashley, and Carie Lemack.\n  These three women, as many Members know because we have come to know \nthem, have worked tirelessly in the last five and a half years to take \ntheir grief, their loss, and bring it into the public square, to the \nCongress, to the place where laws are made, to do everything in their \npower to ensure that the tragic losses they suffered on that day would \nnot have to be suffered by any other American in the future.\n  Their work produced the 9/11 Commission itself. It was a tough battle \nto actually create the 9/11 Commission. People were defensive. They \ndidn't want it to be done by an independent commission. They wondered \nwhy it was necessary. But with the help of these women, we won that \nbattle. Then when the Commission reported in 2004, we worked very hard \nwith their help to adopt most of the recommendations of the Commission \nby the end of that year. This included the creation of the Director of \nNational Intelligence to coordinate all of our intelligence, so we can \nnow connect the dots to stop a terrorist act before it occurs; and the \nNational Counterterrorism Center, which is now up and running and doing \nthe same.\n  The statements of Mary Fetchet, Carol Ashley, and Carie Lemack at our \nCommittee's hearing explain the importance of the legislation, S. 4, \nthat is now before the Senate, and particularly the responsibility we \nin Congress have to continue the unfinished work of implementing the \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission and of fixing the inadequate \nimplementation of some of those recommendations or other gaps we have \ndiscovered since in our homeland security.\n  I want to talk about these three brave, patriotic women one by one, \ndescribe briefly who they are, and then quote from their testimony.\n  Mary Fetchet lost her son Brad, age 24, in Tower 2 of the World Trade \nCenter on September 11. She is the founding director of the group \ncalled Voices of September 11th. At our hearing on January 9, Mary \ntestified as follows:\n\n       I have made a personal commitment to advocate for the full \n     implementation of the 9/11 Commission recommendations driven \n     by the ``wake-up'' call when my son was senselessly murdered \n     by terrorists on 9/11. It is my personal belief that almost \n     six years later our country remains vulnerable, and although \n     some progress has been made, much work remains ahead. We \n     collectively--the administration, Congress, government \n     agencies and interested individuals--have a\n\n[[Page S2574]]\n\n     moral obligation and responsibility to work together to \n     ensure our government is taking the necessary steps to make \n     our country safer.\n\n  ``A moral obligation and responsibility,'' as we debate the details \nof this legislation and consider the parliamentary tactics related to \nit this week on the floor of the Senate, that is, after all, what binds \nall of us together, certainly across party lines, in this body and \naround America--``a moral obligation and responsibility.'' Those were \nthe words of Mary Fetchet.\n  Carol Ashley lost her daughter Janice, age 25, in Tower 1 of the \nWorld Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Carol has served on the \nFamily Steering Committee for the 9/11 Independent Commission, which \nworked to help pass the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention \nAct of 2004. At our January committee hearing, Carol Ashley also \ndiscussed the importance of the legislation the Senate is considering \ntoday. I quote again:\n\n       Along with other members of the Family Steering Committee, \n     I worked for passage of intelligence reform legislation in \n     2004 based on the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. Our \n     goal was to make our nation as secure as possible to reduce \n     the chances that any other American families would lose a \n     loved one to terrorism. Unfortunately, that bill did not \n     fully implement the 9/11 Commission recommendations. Some \n     that were included were not as strong as they should have \n     been. The result is that more than five years after 9/11, \n     there are still gaps in our security.\n\n  I continue to quote from Carol Ashley, mother of Janice, age 25, who \nwas killed by the terrorists on 9/11 in the World Trade Center:\n\n       Tightening our security and upgrading preparedness is \n     urgent. Although five years have passed with no terrorist \n     attack on our soil, there is no way to know when, where or \n     how the terrorists will strike again. To fulfill its foremost \n     obligation to protect the American people, Congress must \n     ensure through legislation and oversight that comprehensive \n     security safeguards are in place; and if the terrorists \n     succeed in breaching our security, that our federal, state \n     and local agencies are fully trained, equipped and prepared \n     to respond cohesively.\n\n  What we do here today is ``urgent,'' to use Carol's word. In the last \nweek, there have been reports that al-Qaida and the Taliban are gaining \nstrength in the lawless regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan, \nestablishing training bases once again, planning to attack the United \nStates again. We know we face growing threats from citizens living in \ncountries that are our allies, as we saw last August when British \nofficials disrupted a plot to blow up airliners on their way from the \nUnited Kingdom to the United States.\n  For these reasons and others, our task today is, in Carol Ashley's \nword, ``urgent.'' I hope we can--I am confident we will--overcome \nwhatever divides us and work together to pass this legislation that \nwill fulfill the powerful and relevant mandate of the 9/11 Commission.\n  Finally, of these three women whose voices we should hear as we go \nthrough this debate this week, Carie Lemack's mother, Judy Larocque, \nwas a passenger on American Airlines Flight 11 on September 11, 2001, \nwhich crashed into the World Trade Center. Like Mary and Carol, Carie \nhas worked tirelessly in support of efforts to improve America's \nability to prevent and respond to acts of terrorism. She is a cofounder \nof the group known as Families of September 11. At our hearing in \nJanuary, Carie also discussed the importance of fully implementing the \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission report. I now quote from Carie \nLemack at our hearing:\n\n       The 9/11 Commission made 41 recommendations. Roughly half \n     of these recommendations have already been implemented, \n     thanks in no small part to the efforts of this committee. The \n     fall of 2004 was an extraordinary time. Many of us were \n     inspired by your willingness to spend weeks and months making \n     sure the Commission's recommendations did not fall on deaf \n     ears. The passage of the 2004 Intelligence Reform and \n     Terrorism Prevention Act was an historic moment, of which we \n     can all be proud.\n       So much to be proud of, and yet so much more to do. More \n     than five years after 9/11, the terrorist threat has \n     inevitably grown a little more distant. Some experts are now \n     telling us that it isn't as serious as we had thought. If al \n     Qaeda is such a threat, why haven't we been attacked again? \n     To answer that question, just ask the people of London, or \n     Madrid, or Bali, or the other places where the terrorists \n     have struck since 9/11.\n  Then Carie Lemack said to our committee:\n\n       The United States has not been attacked again. But we will \n     be.\n       Thanks to the work of so many dedicated public servants we \n     are safer than we were. But in the words of 9/11 Commission \n     Chairman Thomas Kean, we are still not as safe as we need to \n     be.\n\n  Carie said:\n\n       On the morning of September 11, 2001, my mother, Judy \n     Larocque, left home to go on a business trip. She woke up \n     early that day, at 5:30 a.m., in order to make her 8 o'clock \n     flight to the West Coast. Oddly enough, even though I am not \n     a morning person, I was up even before her that day, serving \n     as a coxswain for the MIT graduate school crew team. As I \n     glided on the Charles River that morning, I realized I could \n     have called Mom before my 6 a.m. practice, just for a kick, \n     since it was not often we were both up so early. But I \n     didn't, thinking she might be running late (a trait she \n     passed down to me and my sister) and knowing it would be \n     easier to talk later in the day, once her cross-country \n     flight landed.\n       I never did get to talk to Mom that morning, though I left \n     many messages on her cell phone. To this day, I still find \n     myself looking at my caller ID whenever the phone rings, \n     waiting for it to say ``Mom's cell,'' waiting for the call \n     from her that I never got that gorgeous fall morning.\n       I often think about what I would tell Mom if she called. I \n     dream about it all the time. She was founder and CEO of a \n     company, so I sometimes think I might tell her about founding \n     the non-profit organization Families of September 11, which \n     represents more than 2,500 individuals who chose to join our \n     group and support the terrorism prevention work we do. I \n     might tell her about the opportunities I have had in the past \n     five years that she could never have predicted, like \n     testifying before this esteemed committee today.\n       But the most important thing I could possibly tell her is \n     that I love her, and that I am doing everything in my power \n     to make sure what happened to her never happens again. That \n     would come as no surprise to Mom. She brought my sister and \n     me up to fix wrongs and make them rights.\n\n  Carie Lemack concluded, before our committee:\n\n       Today I am asking you to fix a small number of important \n     wrongs, and make them right. Some of the important \n     recommendations of the 9/11 Commission report have still not \n     been implemented. I raise them not in the spirit of placing \n     blame or making accusations, but rather in the hope that \n     together we can own up to gaps, failures and mistakes in the \n     past, so that we are not condemned to repeat them in the \n     future.\n\n  End of a very deeply personal, compelling quote. It moved everybody \nin the room that day, as it moves me to read those words on the floor \nhere today.\n  So much more to do, my colleagues. As Carie Lemack said, ``so much \nmore to do.'' That is why we are here: to work together, and continue \nto improve upon the critical tasks that we have left undone and \nunfinished. That is our responsibility to Mary, Carol, Carie, and the \ntens of thousands of other Americans and citizens of nearly every \nnation on this globe who lost loved ones on September 11. We must work \nhard and never grow complacent as we face these challenges, in the same \nway that the generations who fought in World War II and the Cold War \nnever grew complacent in the face of the threats to their freedom as \nAmericans from fascism and communism.\n  That is what we are debating today. That is the significance of S. 4, \nthe Improving America's Security Act of 2007. That is why I thank my \ncolleagues for their attention, for their dedication to getting this \nright, and for the debates and votes we will conduct in the days ahead, \nleading, I am confident, by the end of this week, to the passage of \nthis critically important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 335 to Amendment No. 275\n\n       (Purpose: To improve the allocation of grants through the \n     Department of Homeland Security, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 335, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. FEINSTEIN] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 335.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n\n[[Page S2575]]\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment \nwhich ensures that critical homeland security resources are allocated \npredominantly on the basis of risk, threat, and vulnerability. I am \npleased to be joined by my colleague from Texas, Senator John Cornyn, \nas well as Senators Lautenberg, Hutchison, Boxer, Schumer, Clinton, \nObama, Menendez, Kerry, Coburn, and Casey. I understand that Senator \nCoburn and at least three of the other cosponsors will be coming to the \nfloor, and I certainly welcome them. Our amendment provides an \nalternative that is consistent with the recommendations of the 9/11 \nCommission.\n  Let me refresh the Members' view of the 9/11 Commission. This is the \nrecommendation:\n\n       Homeland security assistance should be based strictly--\n\n  Strictly is underlined--\n\n       on an assessment of risks and vulnerabilities.\n\n  And:\n\n       Federal homeland security assistance should not remain a \n     program for general revenue sharing.\n\n  Now, I know that is difficult for smaller States, but I also know \nthis is a bill that is aimed to comply with the recommendations of this \nCommission. So I hope it will be given some attention.\n  The amendment we are offering today would allocate homeland security \ngrant funds based on risk and threat analysis. This covers most grants \nfor interoperable communications, seaport and airport security, as well \nas the State Homeland Security Grant Program, the Law Enforcement \nTerrorist Prevention Program, the Urban Area Security Initiative, and \nthe Citizen Corps Program. We accomplish this by reducing the State \nminimum formula. Currently, each State receives .75 percent of the \nState terrorism preparedness grant money appropriated to the Department \nof Homeland Security. Now, what does this mean? This means that nearly \n40 percent of the grant funds must be allocated regardless of risk \nanalysis. This amendment will reduce that State minimum to .25 percent; \nin other words, from .75 to .25. Lowering this minimum ensures that \nonly 12.5 percent of the grant funds are set aside for all States, \nregardless. Even if they have no threat, they can get that amount of \nmoney.\n  Also, 87.5 percent would be allocated based purely on risk and threat \nassessment. This would give the Department of Homeland Security the \nflexibility necessary to put money where it is most needed. This means \nthat more dollars will go to the places that face serious threats and \nwhere dollars can do the most good and, as I say, it is consistent with \nthe 9/11 Commission.\n  So what does that mean in real dollar terms? Last year roughly $912 \nmillion in grant funds were distributed to homeland security-related \nplanning, equipment, training, and law enforcement support needs \nrelated to terrorism prevention. It broke down like this: Only 60 \npercent of the money, or $547 million, was allocated based on risk. \nForty percent, or $365 million, went to satisfy the guaranteed minimum \nfor all States--exactly what the 9/11 Commission said we should not do.\n  If the Feinstein-Cornyn amendment were in place, an additional $426 \nmillion would have been distributed strictly on risk, threat, and \nvulnerability. That would have brought the total to $791 million--\nnearly 90 percent of the funds. I believe this would have been the \nright thing to do. Instead, the places where the most funding is \nrequired are being shortchanged. Let me give my colleagues an example.\n  Last year the breakdown of funds distributed through the State \nHomeland Security Grant Program and the Law Enforcement Terrorist \nPrevention Program meant that some States with relatively low risk were \nreceiving more funds per person than States with higher risk. We have \nall heard this. Now my State, California's share of this grant funding \namounted to $2.50 per person. Texas, another large State, received \n$2.25 per person. Yet Wyoming received $14.75 per person. California is \nthe most populous State in the Union. We have about 37 million \nresidents. We have the Nation's largest ports, iconic bridges, towering \nskyscrapers, enormous infrastructure, and the busiest border crossing \nin the world. Texas, with 23.5 million residents, has great cities, \ntowering skyscrapers, vital industries, and a vast international \nborder. Wyoming--I don't want to pick on Wyoming. Love it. But as a \nState it is like a national park. Wyoming, with 515,000 residents, is a \nlargely rural State.\n  As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I pay close attention to \nthe classified intelligence on terrorist threats. Regrettably, for \nthose living in States with higher threat profiles, there is reason for \nconcern. Major cities such as Los Angeles have been an elusive al-Qaida \ntarget for years. A public example outlining the severity of this post-\n9/11 threat was acknowledged by President Bush in his State of the \nUnion Address earlier this year. The President said:\n\n       We stopped an al-Qaida plot to fly a hijacked airplane into \n     the tallest building on the West Coast.\n\n  This is the tallest building on the west coast. It is the Library \nTower Building--it has a new name now--the old Library Tower Building \nin Los Angeles, the tallest office building west of the Mississippi. It \nis home to more than 3,000 people during a typical workday.\n  Al-Qaida and its allies do not attack based on an obscure formula to \nspend money evenly. They attack by prominence, number of people they \ncan kill, and the psychological value of taking out America's great \nlandmarks. Homeland security money must correlate with this threat and \nrisk; otherwise, it is quite simply wasted. This is the reality of the \nworld in which we live. We can never predict when or where the next \nmajor attack may occur, but we can apply tough-minded discipline to use \nour finite financial resources effectively.\n  Allocating our critical resources effectively is built on a three-\npronged approach: One, risks of potential terrorist attacks must be \naccurately assessed; two, the vulnerability of critical infrastructure \nand potential targets must be measured; and, three, resources must be \ndistributed based on these assessments.\n  The Department of Homeland Security was created to accomplish these \ngoals. This amendment provides the flexibility and resources for the \nprofessionals to do so.\n  Let me make no secret. I would prefer to allocate 100 percent of \nhomeland security grants based on risk and threat and believe that \neliminating mandatory outlays to States is good public policy. It is \nsafe public policy. But I understand the realities of the Senate. So \nthis amendment is a compromise which makes us all safer and benefits in \nsome way all 50 States.\n  There are some who say that small States would be put at a \ndisadvantage by this amendment. This is simply not true. Thirty-five \nStates--70 percent of the Nation--would actually receive increased \ngrant money for terrorism preparedness under this amendment. States as \ndiverse as Connecticut, South Carolina, and Colorado will benefit. \nRisk-based funding will bring more Federal dollars to smaller States \nwith high-threat profiles.\n  Here are 35 States that benefit from risk-based appropriations, and \nyou can see them on the chart. They are in the green: California, \nWashington, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, North Dakota, Nebraska, \nKansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Iowa, Missouri, Louisiana, Wisconsin, \nIllinois, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, \nSouth Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, \nOhio, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New \nJersey, Delaware, and Maryland.\n  This bill does not impact the primary all-hazards grant programs, \nsuch as the emergency management performance grants and the Assistance \nto Firefighters Program. In fact, under current law, nearly 40 percent \nof these funds are set aside for small State all-hazards preparedness. \nThis adds up to at least $7 million per State based upon the \nauthorization for emergency management performance grants in the \nunderlying bill.\n  There are those who will also make the argument that recipients of \nhomeland security grant funds are not held accountable, as money is \noften wasted. Our amendment increases the efficiency of Federal dollars \nby ensuring that these critical funds actually go toward programs and \nefforts that prevent\n\n[[Page S2576]]\n\nacts of terror. It requires entities receiving these funds to undergo \nperiodic audits conducted by the Department, and it mandates that the \nappropriate performance standards are met.\n  Finally, the amendment ensures that States quickly distribute Federal \ndollars to localities where they are needed and not hold them back. \nFour years ago, the President signed Homeland Security Presidential \nDirective 8, requiring the Department of Homeland Security to allocate \ngrant money ``based on national priorities.'' Four years later, despite \nthis Presidential directive, this remains unmet, an elusive target.\n  The 9/11 Commission report makes clear that there are imbalances. It \noffers sensible advice. We should take that advice. In our amendment, \nwe have tried to do that. Among the Commission's observations and \nconclusions, ``Homeland security assistance should be based strictly on \nassessment of risk and vulnerability and, finally, Congress should not \nuse this money as pork barrel.'' I could not agree more. In a free-for-\nall over money, it is understandable that Representatives will work to \nprotect the interests of their home States or districts. But this issue \nis too important, they say, for ``politics as usual'' to prevail.\n  Well, I think the 9/11 Commission got it right. The national \ninterests must trump geographical interests when it comes to national \nsecurity. I thank Senators Lieberman and Collins for their dedication \nand leadership. I am encouraged that their approach has been modified. \nI clearly would like to modify it more. That is what this amendment is \nall about. They have acknowledged that funds should be allocated more \nalong the lines of risk and threat.\n  Nevertheless, their proposal to set aside 25 percent of funds for all \nStates, I believe, in the world we live in, with the intelligence that \ncrosses my desk, indicates it is too high an amount.\n  This amendment offers a reasonable alternative that takes a \nsignificant step toward improving our Nation's homeland security. So I \nthank my cosponsors. I see that one is on the floor. I would like to \nyield, if I may, to the Senator from Texas, Senator Kay Bailey \nHutchison.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I appreciate so much the leadership of \nthe Senator from California. We have talked about this many times, ever \nsince 9/11, the Department of Homeland Security being created by \nCongress and requested by the President. But the fact is, I think the \ndistinguished Senator from California has laid out the case very well. \nWe have certain areas that, with our intelligence and with the \nactivities that have been uncovered, we know are high-risk areas.\n  It is in the interest of all Americans, of every State, that we allow \nthe Department of Homeland Security, with its intelligence grid, to \ndetermine where the needs are greatest from a risk perspective. That is \nexactly what the Feinstein amendment does. I am very pleased to be a \ncosponsor with my colleague from Texas, Senator Cornyn; Senator \nFeinstein; Senator Boxer. Many States that have the problems that we \nsee are understanding of the need for this amendment.\n  I will give you one example. Texas is, as Senator Feinstein said, the \nsecond largest State in population, the second largest State in area as \nwell. We are second behind Alaska in area and second behind California \nin population. But more important than that is we have many areas that \ncould be terrorist targets. In particular, I point out the ports, and \nthe Port of Houston especially. Texas has 29 ports. Four of these are \namong the 10 busiest in the Nation. The Port of Houston is one of the \nmost important ports in the world. It ranks first in the United States \nin foreign waterborne tonnage, second in total tonnage. It is the sixth \nlargest in the world. It is also home to one of the biggest \npetrochemical complexes in the world. It is also part of our Nation's \nU.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the world's largest oil stockpile.\n  Due to the volume of hazardous materials, a terrorist attack in the \nPort of Houston would be an enormous disaster. An attack in the Port of \nHouston could disrupt our Nation's energy supply, delivering a blow to \nour economy at a time when we cannot afford such a disruption. It has \nbeen estimated that as much as 18 percent of our Nation's refined \npetroleum products come through the Port of Houston chemical complex.\n  We saw what happened after Katrina and Rita came ashore in 2005, \nwhere America's energy coast was heavily damaged. Imagine the impact to \nthe economy if 18 percent of our refining capacity was disrupted. It \nwould be a huge economic and financial and, of course, human loss.\n  The amendment I am cosponsoring with Senator Feinstein would require \nthat Federal homeland security funds be allocated to States according \nto a risk-based assessment. Of course, that is the way these funds \nshould be allocated. It would cover the major first responder grant \nprogram administered by the Homeland Security Department. It is only by \ndoing this that all of our country and the people of our country will \nbe the most safe. It is also consistent with the 9/11 Commission's \nrecommendations to distribute homeland security assistance based upon \nthreat and vulnerability assessment.\n  This amendment is aligned with the Department of Homeland Security's \ngoals for the increased allocation of grant funding based on protecting \nnational priorities. I hope that all of our colleagues will see that \nprotecting our Nation's highest priority areas will be in the interest \nof every American, rather than getting into the State-by-State \nsquabbles, when, frankly, the big States usually lose because there are \nfewer big State votes in the Senate than small States. So if we go to \nthe parochial interests of people from their States wanting more \nsecurity grants, it is going to be hard to do the right thing.\n  I submit to my colleagues that we should be looking at where the \nterrorists might strike and hurt all of our citizens, and that should \nbe the basis upon which these risk-based grants would be awarded to the \nStates.\n  I thank my colleague from California for taking this initiative \nbecause it is so important for our country that this amendment be \npassed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nTexas for her support on this. I think we are both alike in that we say \nwherever there is threat and risk and vulnerability, that is where the \nmoney should go. If it is the State of Texas, that is fine with me. If \nit is the State of California, that is fine. If it is New York, \nFlorida, Connecticut or Maine--wherever the threat and risk is--that is \nwhere the money should go. It is clear to me that the big States have \nfelt very aggrieved. Big States with big landmarks, big ports, big oil \nand petroleum reserves and that kind of thing, feel definitely that \nthey don't get the money they need to provide the protection they need. \nTo that end, on March 5, I received and Senator Cornyn received a \nletter signed by Governor Schwarzenegger of California, Governor \nSpitzer of New York, Governor Crist of Florida, and Governor Perry of \nTexas.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    March 5, 2007.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein and Senator Cornyn: We are writing \n     to thank you for your leadership in working to assure that \n     Department of Homeland Security (DHS) counterterrorism grant \n     programs recognize the homeland security needs of the United \n     States. Any effective strategy to secure our nation must \n     apply risk-based analyses to manage the threat from \n     terrorism. We believe that the Homeland Security FORWARD \n     Funding Act of 2007 will provide much needed changes to these \n     programs by better recognizing the risks and vulnerabilities \n     faced by larger states such as California, New York, Florida, \n     and Texas.\n       We support the efforts of your bill to build a coordinated \n     and comprehensive system to maximize the use of federal \n     resources and to provide clear lines of authority and \n     communication. Your bill will further the efforts of DHS, \n     cities, counties and state agencies as they continue to work \n     together to detect, deter and respond to terrorism. \n     Specifically, we appreciate the following provisions of the \n     bill:\n       Follows the 9/11 Commission Report recommendation to better \n     allocate federal resources based on vulnerabilities;\n\n[[Page S2577]]\n\n       Analyzes risks, threats, vulnerability, and consequences \n     related to potential terrorist attacks; current programs do \n     not give full consideration to our states' urban population \n     centers, numerous critical infrastructure assets, hundreds of \n     miles ofcoastland, maritime ports, and large international \n     borders;\n       Reduces the ``small state'' minimum from 0.75% to 0.25%, \n     providing each state a baseline award while allocating an \n     increased level of funds based on risk; the current base + \n     per capita method allocates a disproportionate share of funds \n     to states with small populations;\n       Continues the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program \n     and exempts the program from the base percentage, allocating \n     all funds based on risk;\n       Maintains the Emergency Management Performance Grant \n     program as a separate program focused on capacity building \n     for all-hazards preparedness, response, recovery and \n     mitigation;\n       Continues the central role of states, building on existing \n     systems that effectively coordinate planning efforts and \n     ensure accountability;\n       Allows for limited regional applications from previously-\n     designated UASI cities or other urban areas with at least a \n     population of at least 500,000;\n       Retains the central role of states as the administrative \n     agent for the grants to ensure regional applications are \n     consistent with statewide plans; and\n       Recognizes the importance of national standards for \n     evaluating the ``essential capabilities'' needed by state and \n     local governments to respond to threats.\n       Your continued support for improving the nation's ability \n     to detect and deter and coordinate responses to terrorist \n     events is appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n     Charlie Crist.\n     Eliot Spitzer.\n     Rick Perry.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by my friend from California and my friend from Texas.\n  Let me first start by telling my colleagues that this is virtually \nidentical to the same proposal the Senate voted on last July during \nconsideration of the Homeland Security appropriations bill. In fact, \nthe Senate has repeatedly voted on this formula issue throughout the \npast few years. The Senate has also repeatedly rejected the approach \nput forth by my colleagues from California and Texas. The last time \nthis amendment was voted on, it was defeated by a vote of 36 to 64.\n  This map says it all. The amendment offered by the Senator from \nCalifornia would cut homeland security grant dollars for 34 States and \nthe District of Columbia. I emphasize that because I think by any \nreasonable analysis, the District of Columbia is a high-risk area. I am \nnot stressing the District of Columbia just because the Presiding \nOfficer is from Virginia but, rather, because it is an area that has \nbeen the subject of a terrorist attack.\n  What the Feinstein-Cornyn amendment would do is reallocate the \nfunding to turn it over to 16 States that already receive 60 percent of \nthe funding. I think we have a basic philosophical disagreement in \ndiscussing how the homeland security money should be allocated. I \ncertainly agree that risk should be a factor, but I also believe--and \nthe testimony before our Homeland Security Committee confirms--that all \nStates need to receive a predictable, reasonable base allocation of \nhomeland security funding. States need that predictable multiyear \nfunding in order to fund complex multiyear projects, such as creating \ninteroperable communications networks or first responder training \nprograms. Risk-based funding, even if it is distributed properly, is \nimportant, but it is likely to fluctuate dramatically from year to \nyear.\n  Furthermore, the minimums in this amendment are simply too low. Under \nthis amendment, each State would only be assured of $2.28 million under \nthe authorized levels for the Homeland Security Grant Program. That is \njust about half of the proposed Homeland Security Grant Program minimum \nin S. 4. I encourage Senators to talk to the first responders in their \nStates--the police officers, the firefighters, the emergency managers--\nto find out what gaps in homeland security would be left unfilled if \nthey faced such a reduction.\n  As one can see from this chart, there would be a substantial \nreduction under all of the homeland security programs. Let's take the \ninteroperability program. We know States have not made nearly the \nprogress that needs to be made in having compatible communications \nequipment. That was certainly one of the lessons from 9/11, where so \nmany first responders lost their lives because they simply could not \ntalk to one another. When the Homeland Security Committee did its in-\ndepth investigation into the failed response to Hurricane Katrina, we \nfound exactly the same kinds of interoperability problems. In fact, we \nfound there were parishes within Louisiana where, within the same \nparish or county, the firefighters could not talk to the police \nofficers, who in turn could not talk to the emergency medical \npersonnel.\n  The only way to ensure a base level of security and preparedness in \neach and every State is to require that there be a reasonable minimum \namount of homeland security grant funding awarded to each State.\n  The National Governors Association has said it well. The NGA has \nwritten to me that:\n\n       To effectively protect our States and territories from \n     potential terrorist events, all sectors of government must be \n     part of an integrated plan to prevent, detect, and respond to \n     and recover from a terrorist act. For the plan to work, it is \n     essential that it be funded through a predictable and \n     sustainable mechanism both during its development and in its \n     implementation.\n\n  It is important to note that the law requires States to develop 3-\nyear homeland security plans, and we are requiring any homeland \nsecurity funding be used to accomplish those plans and to meet minimum \nlevels of preparedness.\n  I am surprised that many who are offering this amendment, which would \ngive the Department even more latitude than it has now, are the same \npeople who are expressing outrage at the way the Department used its \nauthority last year to allocate the funding. I note that I joined in \nthat outrage. As I told Secretary Chertoff at a hearing before our \nHomeland Security Committee, I would not have guessed he could have \nmade both the State of Maine and New York City equally unhappy in how \nhe allocated homeland security funds, but he managed to do just that.\n  The Department is moving away from the methodology it used last year \nto allocate funding based on risk. New York Senators were very eloquent \nin describing the risk analysis DHS had used. For example, my \ncolleague, Senator Schumer, said:\n\n       The way that the Department of Homeland Security has given \n     out high-threat funding defies logic, and it is dangerous.\n\n  That was typical of the comments that were made.\n  I agree with my colleagues, and that is why we were so careful to \ncome up with a different approach and one that includes strong \naccountability measures to address concerns, that requires the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to provide Congress with its risk \nallocation methodology in advance, and that also provides a \npredictable, stable level of funding which will allow States to meet \ntheir diverse needs.\n  One of the important parts of the funding formula the Senator from \nConnecticut and I have labored so hard to put forth is providing \nassistance to law enforcement to try to detect and prevent attacks from \nhappening in the first place.\n  I must remind my colleagues that the leader of the attacks on our \ncountry on 9/11 started his journey of death\n\n[[Page S2578]]\n\nand destruction not from a large urban area but from Portland, ME. Just \nthink if we could have detected that plot and arrested Mohamed Atta in \nPortland, ME, before he launched his attack.\n  Risk is not an easy calculation. We saw that last year when the \nDepartment brought forth its very flawed methodology that made so many \nof us unhappy. But, unfortunately, we are seeing that approach used \nagain by the Feinstein-Cornyn amendment because that flawed methodology \nwhich the sponsors of this amendment have embraced results in cuts to \nthe District of Columbia--clearly a high-risk jurisdiction--and yet it \nwould reduce funding for the District of Columbia. I think it \njeopardizes the funding for 34 States--34 States, many of them border \nStates that have obvious vulnerabilities, many of them coastal States \nthat have obvious vulnerabilities. Then there is Kansas, with the \nthreat of agraterrorism, about which I know the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kansas has been very concerned. Think of an attack on our food \nsupply. That is much more likely to occur in a rural area. Think of an \nattack on a nuclear powerplant in a rural area.\n  The point is, we have a lot of critical infrastructure in this \ncountry that is located outside our large urban centers. So we have to \navoid embracing a flawed methodology, and we have to recognize that \nevery State has risks and vulnerabilities and every State needs to \nachieve minimal levels of preparedness, and we clearly are not there \nyet.\n  I hope we will, once again, turn down the well-intentioned but \nmisguided amendment offered by the Senators from California and Texas. \nI believe it would really cause problems for our country as we try to \nstrengthen our homeland security.\n  I end this segment of my comments by noting a report by the RAND \nCorporation that was prepared for the National Memorial Institute for \nthe Prevention of Terrorism in Oklahoma City, another place where there \nwas a terrorist attack that would not generally be considered a high-\nrisk area. It says:\n\n       Homeland security experts and first responders have \n     cautioned against an overemphasis on improving the \n     preparedness of large cities to the exclusion of small \n     communities or rural areas, and it recognizes that much of \n     the Nation's infrastructure and potential high-value targets \n     are located in rural areas.\n\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks of \nthe distinguished Senator from Maine, who does such an outstanding job, \nalong with the distinguished chairman of the Homeland Security \nCommittee. I, too, rise in strong opposition to the amendment that is \nproposed by Senator Feinstein. Senator Collins pretty well summed it \nup, and my remarks might be somewhat repetitive, and I think they need \nto be.\n  I know the Senator from California, no doubt, has the best of \nintentions. She has been an excellent member of the Intelligence \nCommittee, when I had the privilege of being the chairman of that \ncommittee. She is working simply to increase the grant funding--which \non the surface of it makes some sense--to high-population areas. I just \ndon't think that reducing funding for the majority of our States and \nour great Nation, as the distinguished Senator has pointed out with her \nchart, is a viable way to protect against terrorism.\n  If we as a country are going to be adequately prepared for another \nterrorist attack, we must not forget that we are vulnerable on all \nfronts. The States that would be negatively impacted by this proposal \ncontain some of our Nation's most valuable assets.\n  If we are going to reduce funds to States such as Kansas, this \namendment tosses aside the risk to agriculture, as the Senator has \npointed out, agraterrorism, although we don't use that term anymore \nbecause it used to scare a lot of people. We just call it ``food \nsecurity,'' and it is a big-ticket item. Basically, that is the ability \nof our Nation's intelligence community, 19 different agencies, to \nprotect our Nation's food supply, not to mention the oil and petroleum \nfacilities that provide invaluable energy in this time of need to many \nFederal buildings and places of national significance that are \nscattered throughout our great Nation.\n\n  So we cannot let ourselves believe if we only protect large cities \nand high-population States, we will be safe from the devious and the \ncalculating minds of those who wish to do us harm. You only need to \nlook at the Oklahoma City tragedy to understand this. Rather, preparing \nfor what we expect in the densely populated area is a sure-fire way to \nbe shocked and horrified should the unthinkable happen again.\n  This legislation has been considered before. It was defeated soundly. \nTo add it now as an amendment disregards the hard work many have done \nto negotiate a funding formula that most benefits our entire economy \nand our entire country. We cannot afford to compromise the security of \nan entire Nation for the benefit of a few areas. It is not where the \npeople are, it is where the terrorists will attack and how and when.\n  Let me say when I was the chairman of the Emerging Threats \nSubcommittee on the Armed Services Committee, I went to a secret city \nin Russia--there are approximately 11 of them--and they let us into a \nfew because we had the Nunn-Lugar program that paid the scientists the \nRussians used to have making various armaments and bioweapons and \nviruses and all sorts of things. It certainly gives you pause to think \nabout the fact that when Ronald Reagan called the former Soviet Union \nthe ``evil empire,'' he was correct, if you looked at the stockpile of \nthis weaponry. We were granted access to this research center, which is \nlocated outside of Moscow, about 60 miles. It is called Obninsk. We \nwent in and saw what was being manufactured. I can assure you when they \nopened up the refrigerator doors, we stepped back a little bit.\n  I will not go into everything in terms of what was being manufactured \nthere, some of which is classified, but we thought under the Nunn-Lugar \nprogram the best thing we could do was to provide security. Yet how \neasy would it be for a terrorist group or somebody within the organized \nmafia of Russia today to latch on to any part of this stockpile, of \nwhich there are a great many, and transfer that to the United States \nand attack our food supply?\n  We have had exercises. I have taken part in exercises. There was an \nexercise in regard to hoof and mouth disease. What happened was we got \ninto a situation where the infestation period was 6 days, and we got \npast that, and then utter chaos developed. We lost in the process a \nlarge number of our livestock herd, all of our export stock, and when \npeople finally figured out their food doesn't come from grocery stores, \nthere was panic in our cities. We basically endangered our food supply \nnot only for 1 year but for several years running.\n  This is a very real threat. I can tell you as a former chairman of \nthe Intelligence Committee, we worked very hard to get the intelligence \ncommunity to first assess this and then to assess it in terms of a \npriority risk and a threat. That is exactly what we have done. This \namendment does great harm to that effort and to adequate funding for \nall States and to assess the threats that certainly face all Americans. \nI am very hopeful we will oppose this amendment.\n  Let's repeat what we have done in the past and safeguard all \nAmericans as opposed to the individual, or the individual many, if that \nis the proper way to put it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, what a pleasure to see you as the \noccupant of the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is a pleasure to have the Senator address \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I first thank the Senator from Kansas \nfor his very compelling statement in which he speaks not so much on \nbehalf of Kansas as based on his experience as the immediate past chair \nof the Intelligence Committee. He speaks to the threat of agro-\nterrorism. We ought to start talking about it in that way again because \nit makes it so real.\n  Like so many of the vulnerabilities we have in this terrorist age, \nwhere we have to worry about things we could not have imagined before, \nthese are things we have to now both imagine and defend against. That \nis part of the\n\n[[Page S2579]]\n\ncapacity that will be preserved in the funding formula that is fair and \nbalanced found in the underlying bill, S. 4.\n  I rise to oppose the Feinstein amendment. Senator Feinstein's \namendment is actually one of three that will be introduced to change \nthe funding formula for homeland security and natural disasters \nsecurity that is in this underlying bill. Senator Obama has one which \nhe will introduce tomorrow, Senator Feinstein has introduced this \ntoday, both of which would reduce the minimum first aid share. Senator \nObama's would reduce the guaranteed funding share for 32 of the States \nin the country as compared to S. 4, the bill under consideration; and \nSenator Feinstein's would actually reduce the funding, as the chart \nSenator Collins held up indicates, for 34 of the States of our Union. \nSenator Leahy of Vermont will introduce an amendment that will increase \nthe minimum per State to .75 percent of the total.\n  In some sense, with two amendments trying to cut back the minimum per \nState and one intending to increase it, I hope that it suggests that \nSenator Collins and I and our committee have found a reasonable middle \nground that gives most of the money to the States based on risk but \nrecognizes that the risk to homeland security is national and not \nconfined to the larger cities or the most prominent targets, as Senator \nCollins and Senator Roberts have made clear. We know, tragically from \nterrorist acts across the world, that terrorists have struck \ndiscotheques, schools in smaller town areas, and obviously metros and \nsubways in other areas.\n\n  Our proposal gives out most of the money based both on risk and a \nminimum per State so they can deal with their own local \nvulnerabilities. The members of the committee chose, I believe in our \ngood judgment in this case, to establish the Homeland Security \nDepartment as an all-hazards protection department, not just protection \nagainst the terrorism we fear after 9/11, which we have, as I said \nearlier, a moral responsibility to protect the American people from. At \nthe same time, because there is overlap, we can enable the States and \nlocalities and the Federal Government to protect their citizens against \nthe impact and harm caused by natural disasters.\n  In that sense, the funding formula in the underlying bill, S. 4, not \nonly embraces and implements the lessons learned from 9/11 but also the \nlessons learned from Hurricane Katrina. It accurately reflects the \nworld we live in today, a world where we know we have to protect the \nAmerican people from acts of humans while also being able to respond to \nacts of nature.\n  The second point I want to make is that these fights over funding \nformulas--and this is what we are in now--are well-intentioned, they \nare spirited, and they are important, but we must not be distracted \nfrom the larger point here, if I may say so respectfully, which is that \nit is not only who gets how much of the pie that is important, but \nequally important, perhaps ultimately more important, is the question \nof: How big is the pie? How much money is our country, our Federal \nGovernment, prepared to invest in protecting the security of the \nAmerican people from another terrorist attack or from a natural \ndisaster?\n  I am very proud that this bill, S. 4, authorizes significant \nadditional funds for homeland security grants and related grants, \nrestoring, in the case of homeland security grants, overall funding to \nthe fiscal year 2004 level of $3.1 billion for each of the next 3 \nyears. The fact is, shockingly, if we stop to think about it, that the \nadministration has recommended cuts in homeland security grant funding \nsince 2004.\n  The threat has not gone down. We know, in fact, of publicly reported \nintelligence that al-Qaida and the Taliban are again amassing in the \narea of the mountains between Pakistan and Afghanistan, that training \ncamps are being established there again, and that people are coming to \ntrain not just to fight in Afghanistan but with the heightened \nprobability that they will plan terrorist attacks against the rest of \nthe world, including American targets. Nonetheless, the funding for \nthese homeland security grants has gone down over the last 3 years.\n  What is our goal? It is not a lavish or radical one in terms of \nfunding. This bill proposes to take us back to the level at which we \nwere funding one category of grants, homeland security grants, to where \nit was in fiscal year 2004, $3.1 billion, and to continue that at that \nsame level for the next 3 years. If we do that, this legislation will \nsend a strong signal that this trend of cutting homeland security \nfunding is over. It will send a message that we are not disarming our \nfirst responders, or squeezing them as they attempt to protect us and \nprevent terrorist attacks.\n  This increase in funding will also send another message. Just as we \nsupport our troops fighting in the war on terrorism throughout the \nworld, we need to adequately support our troops, I would call them, our \nfirst responders, our firefighters, our police, and our emergency \nresponse personnel. We need to support those who are on the front lines \nfighting for us, protecting us when disaster strikes right here at home \nin the United States.\n  While we go on with this debate on these three amendments that seek \nto alter the funding formula in the underlying bill, S. 4, I hope we \nwill all keep in mind that this legislation authorizes, and if \nadequately funded by our colleagues on the Appropriations Committee, a \nsignificant expansion in the size of America's homeland security grant \nfunding pie.\n  I also will talk briefly about the specific programs this legislation \nwill authorize that the three amendments, Senator Feinstein's, Senator \nObama's, and Senator Leahy's, would alter, two cutting and one adding \nto our allocation to each State in the country. Two of the four funding \nprograms dealt with in this underlying bill are devoted specifically to \ndealing with the risk of terrorism, to improving the capacity of State \nand local responders to do exactly that.\n  Two others are also designed to address all hazards; in some sense to \nmaximize what we get for our investment. When I say ``all hazards,'' I \nam speaking of natural disasters. As we saw in Katrina, that can cause \nas much or, in some cases, more damage to our country and our people \nthan a terrorist attack.\n  Let me go first to risk-based funding for urban areas, one of the \nfour programs. S. 4 authorizes in law the Urban Area Security \nInitiative, known in the field as UASI, to assist high-risk urban areas \nin preventing, preparing for, and responding to acts of terrorism. All \nUASI funds would be given to the urban area based on risk--totally \nbased on risk--from a terrorist attack and the effectiveness of the \nproposed uses in addressing that risk. There is no minimum funding per \nstate or locality. It is totally up to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity's assessment of risk.\n  The 100 largest metropolitan areas in the United States would be \neligible to apply for funding. I am pleased to say here, too, we \nincreased the funding; $1.279 billion would be authorized for UASI for \neach of the next three years, which is significantly more than the $770 \nmillion provided this year or the $800 million proposed in the \nadministration's fiscal year 2008 budget.\n  The second risk-based funding for states, the other program designed \nspecifically to help state and local officials cope with the risk of \nterrorism, is the State Homeland Security Grant Program. S. 4 \nauthorizes this program to be funded at $913 million for each of the \nnext three years to assist state, local and tribal governments in \npreventing, preparing for, and responding to acts of terrorism. This is \na significant increase over the $550 million that would go to this \nState Homeland Security Grant Program this year, not to mention the \n$250 million cut of the $300 million of the President's proposed budget \nin this program for fiscal year 2008. Most important--and I think it is \nvery significant with all that will be said about the formulas--as we \ncalculated under the approach of S. 4, an estimated 95 percent of these \nso-called SHSGP funds, State Homeland Security Grant Program funds, \nwould be given out based on risk to the state from a terrorist attack, \nand on effectiveness of the proposed uses in addressing that risk.\n  While each state would be assured of receiving a minimum of .45 \npercent of the overall funds of this program, the Department will \ncalculate distributions based on risk first and then only make any \nadjustments necessary to bring all the states up to the guaranteed \nminimum.\n\n[[Page S2580]]\n\n  As we apply the formula of risk allocation that the Department \napplied this year, we come to the conclusion that 95 percent of these \nfunds would actually be distributed based on risk.\n  The third program: All-Hazards Emergency Management Funding. This is \na reorganized, refocused, and greatly increased program that will have \ntremendous effect in protecting the American people from all hazards, \nman-made and natural. S. 4 authorizes what we call the Emergency \nManagement Performance Grants Program, EMPG, to assist states in \npreparing for and responding to all hazards, including natural \ndisasters, other manmade disasters, and terrorism. The legislation \nsignificantly increases the authorization amount for this critically \nimportant program from about $200 million to $913 million for each of \nthe next three years. That is obviously a significant increase, four \nand a half times what it is now. Each state would receive a base amount \nof .75 percent of the overall funds, with the remaining funds \ndistributed in proportion to a state's population, which continues the \ncurrent allocation practice. This program, as I have said, is an all-\nhazards program. Every state in the country is vulnerable or subject to \nbe the target of some kind of hazard, whether it is terrorism or a \nnatural disaster that is different depending on which part of the \ncountry you are in, which is a hurricane, a tornado--as we have seen \noccur last week with devastating effect on our fellow Americans, \nearthquake--of which we have seen too many taking precious lives and \ndestroying property all across our country. I speak of these natural \ndisasters. These are risks that all States face so we think it \nappropriate to ensure that each State receives .75 percent of the \noverall funding.\n  Finally, the fourth program is Dedicated Grants for Communications \nInteroperability. In our committee, Senator Collins and I worked very \nhard on this, and I must say we are very proud to establish this grant \nprogram. It is dedicated to improving communications operability and \ninteroperability at local, regional, state and federal levels. We have \nbeen through this on the floor before. We saw both on 9/11 and in \nHurricane Katrina, when first responders cannot talk to one another \nbecause they have different radio systems or they can't talk at all \nbecause the systems have broken down, response to the disaster is \ngreatly compromised and lives are lost. That is exactly what we are \naiming to prevent with this.\n  Incidentally, this is a problem that is not new with 9/11 or with \nHurricane Katrina. The truth is, it has gone on unsolved for years, \neven though we had evidence of it from 1982, when Air Florida crashed \nin Washington, to the 1995 attack on the Alfred E. Murrah Federal \nBuilding in Oklahoma City, to the 1999 shootings at Columbine High \nSchool near Little, Colorado. In each of those cases, there were \ncommunication breakdowns, not as well known as those on 9/11, that \ncompromised the response and compromised the safety of our fellow \nAmericans. This is a national problem. It affects all states. That is \nwhy we propose that each state would receive a minimum of .75 percent \nof the total funds. This legislation authorizes a total of $3.3 billion \nspread out over five years for this communications interoperability \ngrant program.\n  I wish to stress here about this and about the Homeland Security \nGrant Programs, that we are mindful of the few cases--but too often \ncited by critics--in which local governments have used grant money \nunder these programs in ways that do not, to any of us, seem like they \nrelate. In the case of interoperability communications, we state very \nclearly in the bill that to qualify for these programs you have to make \na proposal that is not just something the local law enforcement chief \nthinks would be a nice thing to have, it has to be consistent with a \nstate's emergency communications plan in the National Emergency \nCommunications Plan. Otherwise, states are simply not going to receive \nfunding.\n\n  The same is true in the Homeland Security Grant Fund Program. One of \nthe bases of the judgments of the use of the funds is clearly stated: \n``The effectiveness of the proposed use in addressing that risk.''\n  In the few cases where sadly, infuriatingly, Homeland Security grant \nmoney has been spent on things that don't seem at all to be related to \nhomeland security, in the language under S. 4, we are going to stop \nthat from happening and guarantee that this money is spent in a way \nthat will increase the American people's sense of security from \nterrorists and natural disasters.\n  I believe these four programs together, if enacted and properly \nfunded, will make our country much safer. They will provide the men and \nwomen on the front lines here at home with the essential tools they \nneed to protect the American people and save lives. They will make sure \nthat funds targeted for building terrorism-specific capability go out \noverwhelmingly to those states and urban areas that our intelligence \nand our common sense tells us are most at risk from terrorist attack. \nBut they will also provide funds that are adequate in the post-\n9/11, post-Katrina world, to make sure that all states can prepare for \nand be ready to respond to disasters.\n  This is going to be an important debate. I look forward to \nparticipating in it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask to set aside the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 336 to Amendment No. 275\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to offer two amendments to the 9/\n11 Commission recommendations bill. After I have an opportunity to \naddress these amendments, I ask they be set aside so we may proceed \nwith further proceedings on the bill.\n  I hope we can reach agreement, I say to my friend from Connecticut. I \nhope we can reach agreement on these amendments, as they are critical \nto making sure our homeland security dollars are spent wisely in the \nway that will do the most to protect our Nation.\n  Nearly 6 years since the tragedy of September 11, Congress finally \nhas the opportunity to implement the recommendations of the 9/11 \nCommission. The 9/11 Commission has done a tremendous job providing our \nNation with the tools to make our Nation safer and now is the time for \nCongress to act and to get it right.\n  I thank Senators Lieberman and Collins for their hard work and \ndedication to this bill and thank my colleague from New York, Senator \nClinton, for joining me on these two important amendments.\n  We are here today to talk about one of the most important pieces of \nthe 9/11 Commission's recommendations, funding the Homeland Security \nGrant Program, administered under the Department of Homeland Security. \nUnfortunately, DHS has not always approached the allocation of vital \nhomeland security dollars the way the 9/11 Commission intended. The 9/\n11 Commission intended that homeland security funds, including the \nhigh-threat Urban Area Security Initiative, UASI, and the State \nHomeland Security Grant Program, SHSGP, be allocated based on risk. In \nfiscal year 2006, the most high-risk and high-threat cities in the \nNation, New York City and Washington DC, two cities which suffered \ntremendously from the horror of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, received a \n40-percent cut in high-threat UASI funding from DHS. Using a peer \nreview process, DHS made funding decisions based on including popcorn \nfactories and petting zoos, while cities such as New York were forced \nto cut key security initiatives such as staff patrols on the Brooklyn \nBridge and NYPD inspection of backpacks within the New York City subway \nsystem.\n  DHS relied on an untested system of peer review in 2006 to allocate \nhigh-threat security funding, and it failed miserably. A 40-percent cut \nin high-threat funds for our highest risk cities is unacceptable and \nexactly the opposite of what the 9/11 Commission recommended. Despite \nthe firestorm of criticism that the Homeland Security Department faced \nfor its UASI allocation of funding in 2006, DHS decided once again to \nuse the peer review process when allocating high-threat funding in \n2007. That makes one doubt the thinking that is going on in DHS, not \nonly on this issue.\n  So I ask amendment No. 336 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n[[Page S2581]]\n\n  The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer], for himself and Mrs. \nClinton, proposes an amendment numbered 336 to amendment No. 275.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the use of the peer review process in determining \n the allocation of funds among metropolitan areas applying for grants \n               under the Urban Area Security Initiative)\n\n       On page 64, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       ``(e) Prohibition of Peer Review Process.--The peer review \n     process may not be used in determining the allocation of \n     funds among metropolitan areas applying for grants under this \n     section.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. This amendment will bar DHS from using the peer review \nprocess when making allocations for high-threat UASI funding. Our most \ntargeted cities should not be subject to the arbitrary whims of an \nuntested bureaucratic process that clearly does not have the best \ninterests of our high-risk cities as its No. 1 priority.\n  DHS was wrong about the effectiveness of the peer review process, and \nit has also been off the mark on the amount of homeland security funds \nthat can be used to cover personnel and overtime.\n  This bill makes clear that different cities under very different \nlevels of risk have very different security needs. We should not be \npunishing cities such as New York that must rely on personnel to make \nour cities safer.\n  One example is our bridges because they have been targeted. The \nBrooklyn Bridge near my home, which I take back and forth all the time, \nhas two police officers at each end 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. That \nis 20 police officers. If one looks at policeman hours, four times \nfive, five shifts is what it takes to cover 24/7. That kind of funding \nis essential to the safety of New York, yet it is limited by the \nprocess. Our amendment would change that.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 337 to Amendment No. 275\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be set aside so that I may \ncall up amendment No. 337.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer] proposes amendment \n     numbered 337 to amendment No. 275.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide for the use of funds in any grant under the \n  Homeland Security Grant Program for personnel costs, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n       On page 59, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n       ``(f) Use of Grant Funds for Personnel Costs.--The \n     Secretary may not provide for any limitation on the \n     percentage or amount of any grant awarded under the Homeland \n     Security Grant Program which may be used for personnel costs, \n     including overtime or backfill costs.\n       On page 86, strike lines 6 through 20.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. This amendment also addresses a critical shortfall in \nprevious allocations for homeland security funding: the payment of \novertime for first responders such as police officers. High-threat \ncities such as New York can't rely on equipment and technology alone to \nget the job done. New York City, with its vast population and national \nlandmarks, needs trained, expert personnel guarding its tunnels, \nbridges, and landmarks to keep New Yorkers and the huge amount of \nvisitors it has every year safe.\n  Having trained security personnel available at all times to protect \nour citizens is not an issue unique to New York City. In this difficult \nbudget climate, cities across the country are faced with hard choices \nwhen it comes to keeping our citizens safe from terrorists. The \nDepartment of Homeland Security should allow our cities and States the \nability to fund the activities necessary to protect our citizens.\n  The potential for terror is not limited to 8-to-5 shifts. We need to \ngive our cities and States the resources they need to do their job. If \nthey should choose to use overtime in funding in their UASI allocation, \nthey should be allowed to do it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 335\n\n  I also would like to take a moment to talk about Senator Feinstein's \namendment that I am cosponsoring along with several of my colleagues. \nThe Feinstein amendment will lower the minimum grant for the State \nHomeland Security Grant Program to .25, lower than the .45 proposed in \nthe Senate version of the bill. The amendment will also lower the \nminimum for interoperable communications to .25, down from .75 in the \nbill. While I appreciate the committee raising the amount of funding \nfor SHSGP funds to $913 million, well above the amount included in the \nPresident's 2008 budget, the formula minimums included in the Senate \nbill provided less funding for New York.\n  New York is not alone. Other States, such as California and Texas, \nwill also face cuts in funding unless we lower the minimum in the \nSenate bill. We can't allow our larger cities and most vulnerable \ntargets to be left relatively unprepared for a major attack relative to \nother cities because they are not given the Federal resources they \ndeserve.\n  Some in the Senate will make the argument that States across the \ncountry have needs that must be addressed, and we need to be prepared \nin all communities. While I understand their concern, the Senate has \nrecognized that need by authorizing the emergency management \nperformance grants in the same amount as the SHSGP grants and by \nproviding EMPG grants with a .75 minimum to address all-hazard needs \nacross the country.\n  In addition to EMPG grants, the Senate has also provided a minimum \namount of funding for interoperability communications grants, something \nthe city of New York has spent millions on since 9/11 so the rest of \nthe country might implement this valuable technology.\n  Now is the time for the Senate to do the right thing. While I applaud \nthe overall work of Senators Lieberman and Collins on this important \nbill, one area we have strayed is in the area of grant funding. I know \nthey come from smaller States. Obviously, they are defending their \nStates. But if we are allocating money on the basis of need, on the \nbasis of where the greatest threat of terrorism is, the funding formula \nhere does not really do the job.\n  The 9/11 Commission, for instance, neither from a smaller State or \nbigger State perspective and looking at things objectively, recommends \nthat funding be allocated on risk alone. The minimums allocated in this \nbill do not do that. One need look only as far as the tragedy of 9/11 \nto answer the question of why funding for the most targeted cities is \nthe most important.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Feinstein amendment. We have the \nopportunity to fix the past mistakes at DHS and ensure that the \nappropriate amount of funding is distributed in a way that will benefit \nall and ensure that highest risk areas are adequately protected. Now is \nthat time.\n  I look forward to working with the committee on these important \namendments to the way the bill addresses the grant program. I know the \ncommittee shares my commitment to ensuring our first responders and all \ncritical homeland security needs have the funding needed to protect our \ncitizens. The committee has done important work to authorize for the \nfirst time funding for the grant programs. I look forward to working \nwith Senators Lieberman and Collins on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Feinstein-Cornyn \namendment. I am proud to serve as a cosponsor. As my colleagues know, \nwe have spent the past week debating legislation to once and for all \nfully implement the recommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission \ndelivered in July 2004. This bill before us, along with its counterpart \nalready passed in the House, would largely do just that by making it \nmore difficult for terrorists to gain access into our country by \nenhancing information sharing in our intelligence community and \nhomeland security apparatus so that we can truly connect the dots in \nfuture plots against our Nation, and by providing genuine\n\n[[Page S2582]]\n\nincentives to the private sector to do their part in order to \nstrengthen their preparedness to prevent and respond to acts of \nterrorism.\n  The bill would also provide much needed funding to enhance the \nsecurity of our rail and transit systems, including Amtrak's northeast \ncorridor, a rail system that carries tens of thousands of passengers \nevery day along the east coast, including my home State of \nPennsylvania, and which remains unacceptably vulnerable to terrorist \nattack.\n  However, we must be honest. The bill does not fully implement every \nrecommendation of the 9/11 Commission. Chapter 12 in the Commission's \nfinal report addresses the difficult challenge of allocating limited \nfunds across the Nation to address an array of homeland security \nvulnerabilities and gaps. The report recognizes that we as a nation \ncannot protect every vulnerable port, every vulnerable icon, and every \nvulnerable spot where Americans congregate every day. A universal \napproach would turn our Nation into an armed fortress, too restrictive \nof the liberties we cherish and love as Americans. That would be a \nvictory for the terrorists.\n\n  Let me quote directly from the bipartisan Commission report which \nlays out in plain and clear language why it is so important that we \nallocate homeland security dollars on the basis of risk:\n\n       Homeland security assistance should be based strictly on an \n     assessment of risks and vulnerabilities. Now, in 2004, \n     Washington, D.C., and New York are certainly at the top of \n     any such list. We understand the contention that every state \n     and city needs to have some minimum infrastructure for \n     emergency response. But federal homeland security assistance \n     should not remain a program for general revenue sharing. It \n     should supplement state and local resources based on the \n     risks and vulnerabilities that merit additional support. \n     Congress should not use this money as a pork barrel.\n\n  So says the 9/11 Commission Report. The Commission calls for a strict \nprioritization of national needs based upon a strict risk-based \nassessment. Those potential targets that are most attractive to \nterrorist groups, that contain the most deep-seated vulnerabilities to \nan attack, and that, if successfully attacked, would produce the most \ndrastic consequences in terms of lives lost, people injured, and \neconomic damage should be given priority in terms of allocating our \nlimited homeland security dollars.\n  This definition of risk, which successfully incorporates the three \nvariables of threat, vulnerability, and consequence, has been \nrecommended by countless academic experts and is now incorporated into \nthe Department of Homeland Security's framework for assessing how to \nrank various targets in our Nation in terms of their likelihood for a \nfuture attack. Unfortunately, the Congress has not kept pace with the \nrecommendation of the 9/11 Commission, and the bill before us this week \nstill does not get it right, even though it purports to fully implement \nthe recommendations of the 9/11 Commission.\n  This bill, while superb in almost every other respect, would still \nretain the misguided approach first established by the PATRIOT Act that \nwould mandate that each State receive a minimum of .75 percent of \noverall funding for most of the homeland security grant programs, \nincluding the State Homeland Security Grant Program, the Law \nEnforcement Terrorist Prevention Program, and the Citizen Corps \nProgram. In other words, 38 percent of the funding dollars for our \nmajor homeland security grant initiatives is allocated on an arbitrary \nbasis, wholly unrelated to risk. Thirty-eight percent of these funding \ndollars is distributed in such a fashion that every State receives the \nexact same share, with equal dollars flowing to large States such as \nPennsylvania and New York, as well as much smaller States.\n  This makes no sense. Every State is not equally at risk from the \nthreat of terrorism and is thus eligible for equal dollar amounts. I \nrecognize that the remaining 62 percent of funds under these homeland \nsecurity grants are now based on risk, but it is wrong and harmful to \ndeny almost half of all funds to those areas that are at greatest risk.\n  That is why I am so pleased to cosponsor the Feinstein amendment \nwhich would reduce those per-State minimums from .75 percent of overall \ngrant funding to .25 percent. In other words, instead of 62 percent of \nfunding allocated on the basis of risk, 87 percent of all grant funds \nwould be allocated on a risk basis.\n  Is that a perfect solution? No, it is not. In a perfect world, 100 \npercent of funds in every homeland security program would be allocated \non the basis of risk, and State-by-State minimums would become a \nhistoric relic. But I understand political realities, and I recognize \nthis amendment by itself will face a real challenge in achieving \npassage. The Feinstein-Cornyn amendment, by replicating a provision in \nthe 9/11 bill that passed the House in January, nevertheless would \nsignificantly improve the quality of our homeland security funding by \nrequiring a greater share of it be allocated on the basis of risk.\n  This issue is often unfairly characterized as a large State versus \nsmall State battle. Those States with large populations would \nsupposedly automatically benefit under any funding formula that is \nbased to a greater degree on risk while small States would lose or so \nthe argument goes. That would be true only if we use population levels \nas a proxy for risk, which this amendment does not do.\n  Instead, the Feinstein amendment defines risk as a function of \nthreat, vulnerability, and consequence. So a small State with several \ntargets that are uniquely at risk due to a combination of these three \nvariables would profit from this amendment just as a State as large as \nNew York or New Jersey or Pennsylvania.\n  This amendment, to the greatest extent possible, takes individual \nStates out of the formula. It focuses on where and what our Nation's \ntargets of terrorism are and where the greatest risks lie and focuses \nour homeland security dollars on those targets. Those who hail from \nsmall States should not reflexively oppose this amendment. The fact \nremains, their States can benefit--small States can benefit--from \ngreater funding under this new formula.\n\n  Will there be losers under this new formula? Sure. Of course. Those \nStates with a minimum level of potential targets at great risk would \nreceive potentially less funding. But I am confident the people of \nthose States will recognize the enormity of the stakes involved: how to \nbest protect our Nation in a long struggle against terrorism. I have \nfaith the American people will put aside parochial concerns in favor of \nthose strategies that protect all of us.\n  I hail from a State that sits at the higher end of the range of \nvulnerability to attacks of terrorism. Under the Urban Areas Security \nInitiative, or UASI, two urban regions in Pennsylvania have been \nconsistently designated as high risk in this program since its \ninception in fiscal year 2003: Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.\n  Philadelphia is home to such historic sites as Independence Hall and \nthe Liberty Bell. It is also a major hub for Amtrak's Northeast \ncorridor, a vital transportation artery that links Washington to Boston \nand points further beyond. We have seen what the terrorists have done \nin Madrid and London and other places. If they seek to export their \ntactics to our Nation, the Northeast corridor, including Philadelphia's \n30th Street Station, would be a prime target.\n  Also, the city of Pittsburgh includes world-class universities, major \nsports stadiums, and other icons of national significance.\n  There is a reason why both cities have been included in the 15 most \nat-risk urban regions in the United States and are eligible for grants \nunder the UASI program. The UASI program is the only homeland security \nprogram that operates fully--fully--on the basis of risk. For that \nreason, it is the most effective program, as it allocates dollars \nwithout regard to State by State minimums or political guidelines.\n  Future terrorist acts endanger the people of Pennsylvania, and I will \ncontinue to stand up for them to assure our homeland security programs \nare appropriately focused on the threats where they are. I understand \nno State or its representative Members want to lose out on additional \nFederal dollars. But I would once again quote from the 9/11 Commission \nreport which has served as the inspiration behind our entire debate on \nthis important bill. In concluding that risk-based funding is the only \nway for our Nation to apportion homeland security dollars, the \nCommission declared that:\n\n\n[[Page S2583]]\n\n\n       In a free-for-all over money, it is understandable that \n     representatives will work to protect the interests of their \n     home states or districts. But this issue is too important for \n     politics as usual to prevail.\n\n  ``Too important for politics as usual to prevail.'' After the horrors \nof 9/11, we cannot ignore the significance of that call to duty.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in support of the Feinstein-\nCornyn amendment so we can ensure our precious homeland security \nresources are allocated in a fair and efficient manner.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The junior Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the \nFeinstein-Cornyn amendment. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this \neffort. This amendment would enact one of the key recommendations of \nthe 9/11 Commission that has gone ignored time and time again by the \nCongress, and that is ensuring homeland security funding is based on \nrisk.\n  We have heard a lot during the course of the debate on this bill. \nOften we have had references to the 9/11 Commission when it was \npropitious, when it served to support the argument someone was making \nat a given time. Then, at other times, it has been forgotten. I have \nbeen one of those who believes we should have all of the 9/11 \nrecommendations implemented. So I do not pick and choose.\n  I am certainly tonight wanting to make sure we recognize as a body \nwhat the Commission said. It was not ambivalent. The Commission was not \nambivalent about its recommendation. The Commission said, in its \nreport, very clearly:\n\n       Homeland security assistance should be based strictly on an \n     assessment of risks and vulnerabilities.\n\n  `` . . . strictly on an assessment of risks and vulnerabilities.'' \n``Strictly''--not mostly, not partially, but based strictly on the \nrisks our States and communities face. Yet, 2\\1/2\\ years after the \nrelease of the 9/11 Commission report, homeland security funding \ncontinues to be based on a formula that allocates nearly 40 percent of \nfunding with no regard--no regard--to risk or vulnerability.\n  What else did the Commission say:\n       We understand the contention that every State and city \n     needs to have some minimum infrastructure for emergency \n     response. But Federal homeland security assistance should not \n     remain a program for general revenue sharing. It should \n     supplement State and local resources based on the risks or \n     vulnerabilities that merit additional support.\n       Congress should not use this money as pork barrel.\n\n  It is past time to correct these flawed formulas.\n  I know many believe that, in fact, everyone should have some of these \nmoneys. Actually, this amendment does that. This amendment recognizes \nthat. It does not encompass the full essence of the Commission's \nreport. It recognizes that. So, ultimately, I would say to our friends, \nnotwithstanding that, there are times when we have legislation on this \nfloor that benefits some States greater than others, but we look at it \nas we are from one country. There are times in which there is a lot \nmore money for flood protection, and those of us who do not receive \nthat type of money say: We understand that. That is the nature of the \nchallenges of those fellow States in our Nation. In the agriculture \nbill there will be a lot of money going to other States that certainly \nwill not be coming to States such as New Jersey, but we understand \nthat. We are one nation.\n  Today, I hope the Members of the Senate will come to understand in \nthis issue, as well, we are one nation and the greatest risks--the \ngreatest risks--flow to those who have the greatest challenges. If we \nhad unlimited money, I would be the first to say we could use it all as \npart of revenue sharing to make sure the allocation for each State \nwould be such that they could decide to use it to meet their homeland \nsecurity objectives. But we do not. If there is one part of all of the \nlargess of the Federal Government that I think has to be based on the \nquestion of necessity, has to be based on the question of risk, it \nclearly is in homeland security funding.\n  Now, I believe, as do many of my colleagues who support this \namendment, we should follow the recommendation of the 9/11 Commission \nin its entirety and base 100 percent of the homeland security funding \non risk. But this amendment recognizes the need to compromise. We \nrecognize every State should be prepared for and be able to respond to \nterrorism. Under this amendment, each State would receive a base \namount. The difference is, we ensure the vast majority of the funds \nwill be based on risk. In fact, under this amendment, 99 percent of all \nof the funds would be allocated based on risk.\n  Senators Lieberman and Collins clearly recognize we should be basing \nfunding more on risk. In this bill they have clearly worked to reduce \nthe base amount for States, moving us toward a more risk-based \napproach. I sincerely appreciate their efforts to make more funding \nallocated on risk, and I certainly commend them for taking a very \nimportant step forward in the right direction. But that formula is \nstill a detriment to States facing the most risk.\n  Under the bill's language, money would be diverted from States with \nthe highest risk to States that do not even have enough risk to receive \nthe minimum base amount. What does that mean? It means after the \ncalculation is done, there will be some States with a risk equation \nthat will not rise to the level of receiving even the minimum base \namount. Yet, under the bill, even though their risk calculation is not \nas great, they will receive the minimum base amount. This would cause \nStates such as New Jersey to lose a full 6 percent of the funding they \nshould receive based on risk. That means under the formula in this \nbill, New Jersey could lose three-quarters of a million dollars because \nthat money would be redistributed to States with relatively low risk.\n  Like many other States represented by the supporters of this \namendment, New Jersey has a wide range of targets. More than a dozen \nsites in the State are on the FBI's National Critical Infrastructure \nList. The 2-mile stretch between Port Newark, Port Elizabeth and Newark \nInternational Airport has been deemed the ``most dangerous two miles in \nthe United States when it comes to terrorism.'' The port of New York \nand New Jersey, which largely resides in New Jersey, is the largest \ncontainer port on the east coast, the third largest in the country.\n  Not only does our State face significant threats because of its \ncritical infrastructure, but some of the most densely populated \ncommunities are in close proximity to these targets. In South Kearny, \nfor instance, 12 million people live in close proximity to a chlorine \nchemical plant. Close to 19 million people live in the New Jersey-New \nYork metro area who could be affected by an attack on such a plant. The \nloss of life due to an attack at one of New Jersey's most vulnerable \ntargets would not only devastate New Jersey but the region and the \nNation.\n  We have to be realistic about where the greatest threats lie. Our \nNation has many targets. No one would argue we should not aim to \nprotect each of them. But we cannot pretend every community in the \ncountry faces the same risks and the same threats of terrorist attack. \nThe fact is, terrorists want to strike where they can inflict \nthe greatest damage. That is why our major urban areas are consistently \nat the top of the threat list.\n\n  We cannot afford to shortchange our most at-risk targets because of \nrevenue sharing. Each State should receive its fair share based on its \nrisks--no more, no less. That is what this amendment is all about. \nUltimately, I see our colleagues, who are the prime sponsors of this \namendment, put out a statement that 70 percent of the States receive \nadditional funding under this risk-based approach--70 percent of the \nStates. So we, in fact, move closer and closer to the right policy \ndetermination that the 9/11 Commission called for, unequivocally, and, \nat the same time, by doing the right thing, 70 percent of the States \nget more money.\n  The 9/11 Commission has repeatedly called on Congress to implement \nthis key provision, and it has urged Congress not to make homeland \nsecurity funds into pork barrel. The 9/11 families pleaded with this \nbody to end the senseless formulas that leave our most at-risk targets \nvulnerable. Countless homeland security experts have called to end the \nminimum amounts to States and move to a true risk-based system.\n\n[[Page S2584]]\n\n  I hope my colleagues this one time will put aside their adherence to \na formula that is not in the security interests of our nation as a \nwhole--as a whole--and will now allocate funding in a way that will \nprotect not just my State or other States similarly situated but will \ntruly work to protect the Nation as a whole.\n  When we had those attacks on that fateful day on September 11, yes, \nmost of the lives lost were from New York and New Jersey, as well as \nother States, but the consequences to the Nation were much greater--\nmuch greater.\n  So I hope again, where the greatest threats lie, where the greatest \nrisks lie, where we have seen time after time where the terrorists have \nchosen to try to focus their attacks, we understand this is one element \nof our domestic policy where we cannot afford simply to have revenue \nsharing. I have taken agricultural votes on behalf of our friends, \nunderstanding that a lot of that money is not coming to New Jersey. I \nhave done the same thing with flood protection and done it on so many \nother issues because we are one Nation. This is one in which we are \nunder one Nation as well, and it is one in which risk has to drive our \nfunding. I hope that when 70 percent of other States receive additional \nsupport under this amendment, we will find a majority vote on its \nbehalf and move us pretty close to what the 9/11 Commission called for.\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I first wish to say that my \ncolleague delivered a message that was clear and specific. It was a \nvery valuable reminder of what we are discussing today, including his \ncommentary about the fact that we are as a nation looking at the \nproblem we see in front of us now.\n  On September 11, 2001, 700 of our fellow New Jerseyans never came \nhome. One of my daughter's closest friends with whom she worked on Wall \nStreet perished, and her husband searched for more than 2 weeks. After \nthe obvious was apparent--that she was gone--refusing to believe it, he \nwent from hospital to hospital, wherever one was within any reasonable \ndistance, hoping against hope that maybe his wife would be alive and \nthe mother of his three children would be there to encourage them on in \ntheir lives.\n  The stories about all kinds of friends and all kinds of neighbors are \nendless. In the area we are talking about in New Jersey that was \ndirectly hit, who didn't know someone or who didn't know someone who \nknew someone--even though we are a densely populated State, still, in \nall, the names touched so many lives and so many people. We saw the \nsmoke rise and debris fall on that fateful day. It was just across the \nriver from us and from where I live and I think close to where my \ncolleague lives. When one looks at the skyline of New York now, there \nis an empty space where these proud buildings stood. I was a \ncommissioner for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and \nthusly had offices in the Trade Center building. I remember seeing \npeople come to work in the morning, over 50,000 people in just a few \nbuildings--more than the population of many cities in our country. It \nwas devastating.\n  We shouldn't forget that attack brought aviation to a standstill, \nthat it had an effect felt way beyond New York and New Jersey and \nhighlighted the fact that you can't just take areas, important areas \naround the country, and say: Well, that is kind of a local situation. \nIt is not true. It is not true. As Senator Menendez pointed out, when \nit comes to other needs of other States, it has to be understood that \nwhen they are in peril, they are entitled to get as much help from the \nFederal Government as they can.\n  So why are we protesting at this time? This discussion has taken \nplace over the last couple of years. Now we are seeing another attempt \nto reduce the maximum amount of funding available to those places which \nare most at risk.\n  I support most of the legislation before us now. I am concerned with \nthe one part of this bill that does not follow the 9/11 Commission \nrecommendations, the one that is being reviewed right now. \nRecommendation 25 of the 9/11 Commission Report said that homeland \nsecurity grants should be distributed based solely on risk. This bill \ndoesn't go sufficiently far enough to a full risk-based approach. \nSecretary Chertoff, whom we have seen here at many hearings, confirmed \nthat. We looked at what he said. He said we should look not at the \nquestion of political jurisdiction but at where the consequences would \nbe catastrophic, where the vulnerabilities would be, where the threats \nare. Clear statements. Despite that, this legislation directs the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to give a minimum amount of money to \nevery State regardless of the risks or threats it faces.\n  When I served on the Homeland Security Committee--and I commend the \nformer chairman and the current chairman for a lot of the work that was \ndone there--we had a disagreement, and I tried in a committee hearing \nto move the committee at least to endorse the fact that these funds \nshould be distributed solely on a risk basis. I was the only one who \nvoted aye for it out of I think 16 people in attendance.\n  So at some point, I don't know why the call doesn't go out that says: \nLook, do this on a sensible basis. Do this on an as-needed basis. Give \nthe opportunity to the places most at risk to protect themselves. It is \nmore than good policy; it just makes common sense. Our military doesn't \nmove troops evenly around the globe. You place your resources \nstrategically. Why should homeland security be different? If you want \nto protect the most people in our country from risk, why not do that? \nWe do that constantly in all kinds of projects, whether they be flood \nprojects or otherwise in places that are prone to natural disasters. It \nmakes sense that we spend more on homeland security in America's at-\nrisk areas.\n  Senator Feinstein and Senator Cornyn and I and others have an \namendment to give at-risk States the money they need to protect their \nresidents and their communities and sensitive places where an attack \ncould severely damage the national viability.\n  We have seen something recently that highlights the situation in New \nJersey where chlorine is manufactured and stored in large quantities, \nand we learned from the change in the tactics now in Iraq that chlorine \nis being used as a brandnew weapon there. The use of chlorine was \ndevastating. It killed a few people but made many more deathly ill, \nrequiring hospitalization and severe treatment to try to protect their \nlives.\n\n  We are talking about the most dangerous 2 miles in the country as \ncertified by the FBI. Why not take advantage of the fact that we would \nbe protecting not only the well-being of people in the surrounding \narea, but we would protect the functioning of our society. So we ought \nto move closer to the 9/11 Commission's recommendation that homeland \nsecurity be distributed on risk and threat and cut the minimum amount \nof money that will be distributed to each State.\n  Secondly, it will result in more homeland security for 35 States that \nare more at risk. We are not just talking about New Jersey and New \nYork; they are most prominent because we felt it and we have lost \nfriends and neighbors as a result of that attack. But that was not the \nfirst time. It was the second time the World Trade Center was attacked. \nHow many times must it happen before somebody who is leaning on one \nside or the other says: You know what, we don't want those people to be \nharmed further or that area to be damaged further. And the invitation \nis certainly there to do just that.\n  We must consider the large States such as Ohio. If something happens \nin some of the Western States, the way the winds blow in our country, \nthey will deliver toxic emissions all the way across the country--\nGeorgia, for instance, and Nevada, Maryland, and Massachusetts. The \narray is impressive because it deals primarily with the largest \npopulation centers in the country and the money that could be brought \nto protect these centers should not just be dealt out on a traditional \npork-like basis. We still haven't reached 100 percent risk-based \nfunding. This amendment, however, is an improvement over current law, \nan improvement over the bill before us today.\n  I would like to be able to report to the 9/11 Commission that we as a \nSenate did more than simply debate the\n\n[[Page S2585]]\n\nCommission's findings. We ought to be able to tell them we voted to \ngive more resources to the people, cities, and States that need more \nprotection. They worked very hard to hammer out the Commission report, \nand I believe it is fair to say that the Feinstein-Cornyn-Lautenberg \namendment will do just that. I encourage my colleagues to support it.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 342 to Amendment No. 275\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside, and I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins], for herself, Mr. \n     Stevens, Mr. Voinovich, and Mr. Warner, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 342 to amendment No. 275.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, because I know the Senator from South \nCarolina is waiting to speak, I will not go into any detail about this \namendment, but I did want to file it so that my colleagues have a \nchance to look it over, overnight.\n  This amendment is an attempt to reach a middle ground on the issue of \nrights for TSA employees. It provides that TSA employees may join a \nunion; may have a pay-for-performance system; will have the right to \nappeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board any adverse employment \nactions, such as demotions or firings, so they would have the same \nrights in that regard as other Federal employees; and it would give \nthem explicit protections under the Whistleblowers Protection Act. It \nalso calls for a review in 1 year's time of the personnel system to see \nif further changes are needed, and it asks GAG to evaluate the system.\n  This amendment is cosponsored by Senator Stevens, Senator Voinovich, \nand Senator Warner at this point.\n  Again, this is an attempt to find a middle ground on the TSA issue. \nThe TSA employees do a terrific job working very hard to protect us. I \nbelieve the current law does not afford them the kind of workplace \nprotections they deserve. Yet we want to preserve the flexibility of \nthe TSA to be able to move people, to deploy them, to respond to \nimminent threats, new intelligence, or any sort of emergency situation. \nI believe this amendment would achieve that goal.\n  I will be talking about the amendment in more depth tomorrow.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I ask that the Senator from \nSouth Carolina be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 316\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I know Senator Collins wants to put \nsecurity first in this bill, and I am looking forward to seeing her \ncompromise amendment, but I am standing today to speak on the ongoing \nefforts by my Democratic colleagues to force the Transportation \nSecurity Administration--these are the folks who guard our airports \ntoday--to collectively bargain with labor unions on the decisions they \nmake.\n  The Senator from Missouri, Senator McCaskill, is offering an \namendment that I consider very dangerous. I wish to make sure my \ncolleagues understand all that is at stake.\n  First, this debate is about one thing and one thing only: whether \nCongress believes that our airport security agency--what we refer to as \nTSA--should have to negotiate with unions before it can carry out \ndecisions that will save American lives. That is what this debate is \nabout. The McCaskill amendment will change current law to force our \nairport security agency to negotiate with unions. The DeMint amendment \nwill protect current law, which makes security TSA's top priority.\n  The security implications of this policy are becoming clear, and that \nis why there is an effort by my Democratic colleagues to cloud the \nissue. Rather than admitting that collective bargaining is a labor \nunion initiative, not a 9/11 Commission recommendation, my Democratic \ncolleagues are now trying to paint it as proworker and prosecurity. \nThis is extremely disappointing because the truth is that the McCaskill \namendment is prounion and it weakens security.\n  When you boil it down, the McCaskill amendment will force airport \nsecurity workers or the airport security agency, TSA, to bargain with \nlabor unions before they make security decisions. Let me say that \nagain. The Transportation Security Agency will have to bargain with \nlabor unions before they make security decisions.\n  This is an earmark for big labor that comes at the expense of \nhomeland security. I wish to go through the arguments offered by the \nother side and make sure everybody understands why they are misguided.\n  First, my colleagues say their collective bargaining amendment will \nprevent TSA screeners from going on strike and bargaining for higher \npay. But the truth is that screeners could not strike anyway because \nthe law prohibits Federal employees from striking. In addition, \nprohibiting bargaining for pay is also meaningless, since the \nDepartment of Homeland Security pay system does not allow bargaining \nnow. So on this point, the other side is simply trying to cloud the \nissue and mask their union earmark with meaningless rhetoric.\n  Second, my colleagues say their collective bargaining amendment will \ncreate new workforce protections for security screeners. But the truth \nis, these\n\n[[Page S2586]]\n\nbenefits already exist. Workers already have whistleblower protection \nthrough a memorandum of understanding with the Office of Special \nCounsel. Workers already have protection against discrimination through \nthe alternative resolution of conflict program. Workers already have \ndue process protections against disciplinary actions that are more \nefficient than the protections offered to other Federal employees.\n  Madam President, again, we are talking about the collective \nbargaining amendment. I was pointing out the protections that current \nTSA workers have. They have whistleblower protection, protection \nagainst discrimination, and they already have due process protections \nagainst disciplinary action that is more efficient than the protections \noffered by Federal workers.\n  Security screeners already have the right to appeal adverse actions \nto TSA's Disciplinary Review Board, which provides due process \nequivalent to that available to other Federal employees.\n  Workers already enjoy access to the Rehabilitation Act, except where \nCongress has specified that security job functions require certain \naptitudes and physical abilities.\n  So all of these proworker provisions are redundant and meaningless in \nany amendment to current law. They are only being offered to mask the \ntrue goal of the amendment, which is to force TSA to bargain with \nunions on their security decisions.\n  The other side also likes to say there are high attrition rates at \nTSA and that collective bargaining would stabilize the workforce. I am \nafraid this is also false. Before 9/11, when airport security was under \ncollective bargaining, attrition rates were as high as 400 percent at \nsome airports. Now the voluntary attrition rate for full-time employees \nis down to 12.6 percent, and it is falling. This is not only \nsignificantly lower than pre-9/11 levels, but it is also lower than the \nattrition rates for the private sector as a whole and lower than the \nFederal Government as a whole. So my colleagues must understand that \nthese are good jobs, attrition is low and falling, and attrition is not \na valid reason to create collective bargaining.\n  It is also important that my colleagues understand how the collective \nbargaining amendment will weaken our homeland security, which is the \npriority of the 9/11 Commission bill.\n  First, the amendment creates a security trigger that will allow TSA \nto turn collective bargain on and off. This acknowledges that \ncollective bargaining weakens security. I wish to repeat so my \ncolleagues understand my Democratic colleagues agree that collective \nbargaining reduces security, and they feel obligated to offer a way to \nbypass it.\n  But this so-called trigger for emergencies only makes the problem of \ncollective bargaining worse. The language defining emergencies and \nnewly imminent threats is so vague it will take an army of lawyers to \ndetermine whether each circumstance meets the definition. This will \nhurt our security and force TSA to be reactive and slow in its efforts \nto prevent future attacks.\n  If my colleagues need proof that there will be wide disagreement as \nto when the security trigger can be used, they only need to hear the \ncomments made by the sponsor of this amendment. When I asked if the \ncurrent ongoing global war on terror would be considered an emergency \nunder the amendment, the Senator from Missouri said it would not. If \nTSA cannot use the war on terror as a reason to protect Americans from \nal-Qaida and other terrorists on a daily basis, under what circumstance \ncan it use this flexibility?\n  This underscores the issue that lies at the heart of this debate. On \none side, there are those who believe we should always be on alert and \nthat we must treat every person and every bag going through our \nairports as a potential threat. On the other side, there are those who \nbelieve we are not under constant threat and we can simply turn on and \noff our ability to prevent future attacks. That is the real \ndisagreement because we all seem to agree collective bargaining weakens \nsecurity.\n\n  In addition to allowing our security to be switched on and off by \nunions, the McCaskill amendment creates all the same problems as full-\nblown collective bargaining.\n  First, it still forces TSA to sign huge collective bargaining \ncontracts, such as Customs and Border Patrol have now, and it could \nmean hundreds of separate contracts at airports across the country. \nInstead of streamlining security, it will create complex guidelines \nthat make it harder to share and shift resources between airports as \nthreats emerge.\n  Second, it still forces TSA to set up a huge new bureaucracy for \ncollective bargaining, putting new layers of redtape ahead of security \nand redirecting resources away from security and toward labor \nmanagement. This new bureaucracy will cost TSA at least $160 million \nover the next year, forcing it to take 3,500 screeners off security \ncheckpoints and doubling the wait time for passengers.\n  Third, it still forces TSA to terminate its pay-for-performance \nsystem that currently rewards screeners for their proficiency rather \nthan their seniority. This will only reduce TSA's ability to maintain a \nqualified workforce.\n  Fourth, it still forces TSA to share sensitive security information \nwith unions, compromising air travel security. The amendment claims to \nprotect ``properly classified'' information, but it doesn't address \nother types of sensitive information, such as the emergency plans for \nour airports.\n  This brings me back to my original point. This debate is about \ncollective bargaining and whether it makes us more or less secure. All \nthe talk about worker benefits and workplace protections and security \ntriggers is meant to cloud the issue and prevent Senators from being \naccountable for their votes. This collective bargaining proposal has \nnothing to do with preventing another 9/11. In fact, it could increase \nthe chance of another such attack, and my colleagues should consider \nthat before they vote.\n  There are only two reasons to vote for the McCaskill amendment: \neither political payback or out of political fear. I hope my colleagues \nwill not act on either. Democrats should not pay back unions at the \nexpense of our security, and we should not be afraid to stand up \nagainst union bosses so we can keep America safe.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the McCaskill amendment.\n  It will not only weaken our security, it will also kill this bill. \nThe President will veto it and the Senate will sustain his veto. So \nthat leaves the other side of the aisle with a clear choice. They can \neither have a political showdown with the President over an earmark for \nlabor unions or they can take this provision out of the bill and make \nsome progress on our security agenda.\n  The DeMint amendment protects American security. The McCaskill \namendment protects unions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n\n[[Page S2587]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I am pleased to speak on this nomination \nwith my colleague from Wyoming, Senator Thomas. I chair the Indian \nAffairs Committee. Senator Thomas is vice chair of that committee.\n  This is the nomination of Carl Artman to be Assistant Secretary for \nIndian Affairs. Mr. Artman is an American Indian from the Oneida Tribe \nof Wisconsin. He is highly qualified. He was nominated twice--once last \nyear by President Bush. Last year, I supported his nomination, which \nwas held up in the Senate. He has been nominated recently again by the \nPresident. I held an immediate hearing with Senator Thomas on his \nnomination. We passed it out of the committee the same day, and we have \nbeen waiting to get it to the floor.\n  There has been a hold on the nomination, regrettably. With some \nirritation, I say it has been 2 full years last month that this \nposition has been vacant. The position of Assistant Secretary for \nIndian affairs--a position that has existed in this Government since \n1806--is one that is responsible for the trust responsibilities and all \nof the other issues that relate to treaties with Indian tribes. It has \nalways been considered a very important position. For 2 years it has \nbeen vacant. That is unbelievable. Nowhere in this country are there \nmore significant and enduring problems than those that exist on many \nIndian reservations. Many live in Third World conditions. I have told \nstories of people freezing in their homes in the winter. There are \nhousing crises that exist on Indian reservations. There are health care \ncrises and education crises. It is unbelievable. We need to have this \nposition filled. Finally, at long last, today we will have a chance to \nvote on the nomination.\n  I am sure there will be an overwhelming vote in support of a well-\nqualified candidate sent to us by President Bush first last year, then \nheld up, unfortunately, in the Senate, and now this year, held up until \nnow. Finally, perhaps, at long last we will do what we should have done \nlong ago on behalf of American Indians, and that is to put someone in \nthe position of the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs to be \ninvolved in managing and reacting to all of these responsibilities that \nhave been long ignored--too long ignored, in my judgment.\n  I come today to support this nomination. My colleague, Senator \nThomas, will speak for himself, but we have worked together in support \nof trying to get this nomination to the floor of the Senate. American \nIndians and Native Alaskans--my colleagues know the information--have \nhigher rates of tuberculosis, 600 percent higher than other American \ncitizens; substance abuse, alcohol abuse, 500 percent higher; diabetes, \nin some cases up to 10 times the rate; Indian youth suicide, 10 times \nthe rate of the rest of the country.\n  These are unbelievable circumstances. We have to begin to deal with \nthese issues. That is what we are trying to do on the Indian Affairs \nCommittee. But it is absolutely shameful this position has been open \nfor 2 full years. It has been vacant 2 years. This is a well-qualified \nperson. I have met with him a couple of times. I was proud to move his \nnomination through the committee. This is a well-qualified person, an \nAmerican Indian from the Oneida Tribe in Wisconsin.\n  At long last, I hope today we will decide to give Senate approval to \nPresident Bush's nomination and give Mr. Carl Artman the opportunity to \nassume this role of Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I join my friend, the chairman of the \nIndian Affairs Committee, in supporting Carl Joseph Artman for \nAssistant Secretary for Indian Affairs. We have waited a good long time \nto get to this point.\n  Mr. Artman is an excellent candidate with diversity of experience in \nboth the private and public sectors. He has the leadership and academic \ncredentials needed for this necessary and extraordinarily demanding \nposition.\n  The Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs implements the Federal \nIndian policy set by Congress and facilitates the government-to-\ngovernment relationship with 561 Indian tribal governments.\n  The Assistant Secretary, as you might imagine, is responsible for a \nvariety of activities, including economic development, law enforcement, \ntrust asset management, social services, and education.\n  I will not take a long time, but I just want to say the Assistant \nSecretary must be balanced in meeting these needs. I think this \ngentleman will be. He has pledged to facilitate a more vibrant \ncommunication between Indian tribes and their neighbors.\n  The job of Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs has been \nexponentially more difficult because of the methamphetamine plague that \nis ravaging this Nation's Indian communities, and he is committed to \nfighting this terrible epidemic. We can certainly support that effort.\n  Madam President, you know how important it is to have leadership in \nthis area, and we haven't had it for a very long time. There are many \nother challenges confronting Indian country that cannot be met without \nstrong leadership within the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and yet the \nposition has been vacant for 2 years.\n  Mr. Artman will serve the country well.

The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, by our estimates, this bill is about $17-\nplus billion. As I said, it has not been scored. The House bill that \nwill be merged with this in conference is over $20 billion. That is a \nlarge chunk of change for the American taxpayer. What we know is a lot \nof the grants which make up about $3-plus billion a year over the next \n5 years of the vast majority of this bill will be homeland security \ngrants of one type or another. What we know is the Department of \nHomeland Security has not followed the law when it comes to improper \npayments.\n  What the Improper Payments Act of 2002 required of every agency of \nthe Federal Government was that they perform a risk assessment of every \nprogram they have, that they develop a statistically valid estimate of \nimproper payments, that they develop a corrective action plan, and they \nreport the results of those activities to us.\n  This is not an optional plan for the agencies. Yet this plan has been \nignored since its inception and since the creation of the Department of \nHomeland Security. We are getting ready to send another $17- to $18 \nbillion-plus out the door for homeland security grants--that is the \nmajority of this--and we know the Department of Homeland Security is \nnot in compliance with the Federal law.\n  The reason the law exists is to make sure we get good value for the \ntaxpayers' money. The year 2004 was the first year the agencies were \nrequired to respond to this act. It is worth noting again that there is \nnot an agency of the Federal Government, not one agency, that is exempt \nfrom this law. This is not a request. This is a statutory requirement \nof every agency.\n  The Department of Homeland Security has not even complied with the \nfirst step of this law. They have not performed risk assessments for \nthe programs to be of significant risk of making improper payments. \nThey are an at-risk program according to the analysis, yet they have \nnot even looked to do a risk assessment. The Government Accountability \nOffice has found at least six major programs at this Department are out \nof compliance with the Improper Payments Act. The Department of \nHomeland Security's independent auditor has repeatedly cited \nnoncompliance, and the Department of Homeland Security continues to \nface significant challenges with FEMA and the Individual and Households \nProgram.\n  Based upon the Department's performance and accountability report and \ntheir independent auditor assessment, the following programs are out of \ncompliance with the improper payments act: Customs and Border \nProtection; Office of Grants and Training; Federal Air Marshals--the \nCoast Guard was supposed to have done a performance evaluation and risk \nassessment but it has not been done; FEMA; the Transportation Security \nAgency; and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Not one of them has \nperformed the first risk assessment as to improper payments.\n  In case you think that is not a lot of money, we have already spent \nover $25 billion in grants through the years for these programs, of \nwhich we have not looked at the problem accounts. The press is replete \nwith problems in terms of these grants: $9 billion on State and local \npreparedness grants--that is what we get from DHS. Secretary Chertoff \nat the most recent hearing said $5 billion of the money, another $5 \nbillion--part of which has been obligated but has not gone out the door \nyet.\n  I think we owe it to the American people, if there is a law on the \nbooks, before we send more money out the door the agency ought to \ncomply with the law. They ought to at least do a risk assessment. If \nthere is no risk, that is fine. Then they will have complied with the \nlaw. But if there is risk, we ought to be identifying the risk. Every \ndollar we spend wastefully is a dollar we don't use to protect \nourselves in terms of our security.\n  KPMG was the independent auditor for 2004, 2005, and 2006 for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. In each one of those years they were \nout of compliance with this act. Specifically, the Department is cited \nfor not instituting a systematic method of reviewing all practices and \nidentifying those believed to be susceptible to erroneous, improper \npayments. The most important part of the Improper Payments Act is to \ncreate the process of good, strong oversight within the Department to \nmake assessments about whether they are making improper payments. What \nthis assessment does is it identifies where those improper payments \ncould have been made, and that is essential to find out where the \nproblems exist.\n  This amendment does not debate any of the merits of the Department's \nprograms. It simply demands compliance with the transparency and \naccountability measurements that already exist under current law. If we \nwant the American people and the executive branch to take us seriously, \nCongress must demand compliance with the laws that are laws. We cannot \nback off.\n\n[[Page S2589]]\n\n  This amendment is not a surprise to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. They know they are failing and they need to respond to it. \nThis amendment in no way jeopardizes State funding. Let me tell you \nwhy. It is because there is a pipeline of 9 to 12 months in the works \nalready on grants that are going there. For this to have any impact \nwould mean they would have to not respond for another year before those \ngrants would be in jeopardy. Some of my colleagues say, You can't do \nthis. You can't put these grants at the risk of noncompliance of an \nagency in terms of meeting the law. The question ought to be, Why not? \nWhy shouldn't we put the agency at risk with their grants for being \nnoncompliant?\n  The other point I make is most of these grants go to States and \nlocalities. The problem with the grants is there is some culpability on \nthe part of the States and the localities in terms of these grants. The \nStates are not totally innocent. There is $2.5 billion that has not \neven been awarded yet that still can be awarded before this takes \neffect. So there is still another $5 billion, which is greater than the \namount we spend in any one year on these grants. What this amendment \nsays is they cannot go past that unless they have complied with the \nlaw.\n  If we are not going to agree to this amendment, then we need to trash \nthe Improper Payments Act. If we are not going to say the Department of \nHomeland Security has an obligation to follow the law, then we ought to \ntake the law off the books. We know for sure in the other areas of the \nFederal Government we have somewhere between $40- and $80 billion worth \nof improper payments. We know we have $40 billion of improper payments, \noverpayments, in Medicare; somewhere close to $30 billion in Medicaid. \nWe have a third of the Earned Income Tax Credit that we know were \nimproper payments and we have only looked at 40 percent of the \nGovernment; 60 percent of the Government still isn't complying.\n\n  We ought to say right now if we are going to put more money through \nthe door, the American taxpayer ought to have value for the money they \nsend through that door. What we are saying is we want them to be \naccountable, to be accountable as an agency of the Federal Government. \nThere ought to be transparency. We ought to be able to see where they \nare making mistakes and where they are not. The question of not even \nasking the question is what we are debating with this amendment; they \nare in absolute noncompliance with the Federal law that requires them \nto be compliant about whether their grants are improperly paid or \nfunding other than what they expected to fund.\n  Investigation showed FEMA spent millions on puppet shows, bingo, and \nyoga in south Florida. There is an article in the National Review, 7/\n19/05, on homeland pork. Baltimore Sun, 5/29/05, chasing security with \ndollars. The only transparency we have here is that there is a total \nlack of transparency in the Department of Homeland Security.\n  Needless to say, this is a bill that goes far outside 9/11 \nrecommendations. The 9/11 recommendations said all money should be risk \nbased. What we have turned around with the 9/11 bill, this one and what \nhad passed in the previous Congresses, is a way to dole out money to \nStates and not hold them accountable.\n  What this amendment says is you are going to have to start being \naccountable. If we are going to send out another almost $20 billion in \nterms of grants, Homeland Security ought to have to follow the law in \nterms of improper payments.\n  Remember, these grants are not competitively awarded--which is very \ndifferent than the grants we have in almost every other Federal \nprogram. The fact they are not competitive is another reason, a much \ngreater reason, for us to demand accountability and transparency at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. These grants are also not let on the \nbasis of risk. Some are. In some of these it will be down to .45 \npercent, others at .75, and a few at .25. Most of them have no local \nmatch so there is no risk on the side of the States or the \nmunicipalities that get these grants.\n  Just a note: The best way for Congress to practice spending \ndiscipline is to demand that the agencies comply with the laws assuring \nappropriated dollars are spent adequately, appropriately, and lawfully. \nWe have yet to do that with many agencies.\n  DHS is a good place to start. FEMA awarded $22.6 million for crisis \ncounseling for victims of Hurricanes Rita and Katrina--$22.6 million. \nKatrina did not even hit Florida. Yet a large portion of that was spent \nin Florida. There is no accountability. There was no risk assessment. \nWas there a risk? They have not done the work we demand by the law and \nwhat is being demanded of other agencies.\n  There was an article in the Florida Sun. I cannot vouch for its \naccuracy, but where there is a little smoke there is some fire. Of the \n$1.2 billion in aid that FEMA granted to individuals--not \nmunicipalities or contractors but to individuals--affected by the \nweather disasters between 1999 and 2004, the Florida Sun-Sentinel found \nof $1.2 billion, at least $330 million of that went to people who did \nnot personally suffer any damage or disruption from the storms. That is \na fourth of the money out of that $1.2 billion. No wonder we have a \ndeficit. No wonder. Because we are not willing to take the time to \nforce an agency to do what they should be doing under the law.\n  I want to talk for a minute about this bill. The 9/11 Commission was \nvery succinct and direct, noting that we have tremendous \nvulnerabilities and risks and exposures throughout this country. They \nwere very clear to state that money that comes out of Congress to \naddress those ought to be absolutely risk based. The House bill at \nleast is down to 0.25 percent for every State. What that gives us is \nabout 15 percent of the money is going to go to the States regardless \nof their risk. So that is about $3.5 billion or $4 billion--no risk, \nyou are going to get Homeland Security grants even though you have no \nrisk.\n  Think about what we are going to ask ourselves if we have another \nterrorist attack and it is in one of the high-risk areas and we have \nsent, year after year after year, $4 billion to areas that do not have \na high risk and that money could have prevented that action.\n  With good fiscal discipline, we will best protect the people of this \ncountry. I know the tendency of this body is to make sure you get \nenough for you and to make sure you can go home and say we got this for \nyou. You pat yourself on the back. But I wonder how many of us will be \npatting ourselves on the back when we buy things that are not \nabsolutely necessary with these grants that are going to States and we \nignore the very high-risk east coast, west coast, gulf coast, and the \nlarge metropolitan areas in this country that need more money while we \nare playing politics with 15 to 20 percent of the money. We will be \njudged on that, and that judgment will not be a pretty picture.\n  This amendment simply says no funds can go for any of these grants \nuntil FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security start complying with \nthe Federal statute, which is called the Improper Payments Act of 2002. \nIt is very straightforward.\n  What we will have raised is the fear that my State may not get some \nmoney. They have a year to comply. They have plenty of time to do what \nthey have been asked to do. Senator Obama and I, this last year, over 8 \nmonths ago, sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security asking \nwhy.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print that letter in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 16, 2006.\n     Hon. Michael Chertoff,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Secretary Chertoff: We are writing with regard to a \n     recent Government Accountability Office (GAO) report \n     concerning improper payments at the Department of Homeland \n     Security (DHS). The persistent pattern of improper payments \n     limits the Department's ability to respond to our nation's \n     most dire threats and hazards, and we seek assurances that \n     you are taking adequate steps to address this problem.\n       As you may know, the GAO released a report on November 14, \n     2006 assessing the compliance of government agencies with the \n     Improper Payments Information Act (IPIA) of 2002 (P.L. 107-\n     300). Congress passed and the President signed the IPIA with \n     the belief that the Federal government, as a steward of\n\n[[Page S2590]]\n\n     taxpayer dollars, should safeguard these funds from improper \n     payments and make timely and accurate reports on the improper \n     payments that do occur, so that erroneous payments are not \n     repeated in the future.\n       Based on the recently-released GAO report, it appears that \n     DHS is not fulfilling its duty to address improper payments. \n     Specifically, the Department appears to have failed to \n     adequately perform the first step in reducing improper \n     payments--assessing which of its programs are at risk for \n     these payments. If an accurate risk assessment does not \n     occur, the Department's ability to reduce improper payments \n     is seriously compromised.\n       We understand that in the period evaluated by the GAO (in \n     DHS' Fiscal Year 2005 Performance and Accountability Report), \n     DHS identified no programs in the entire agency with a high \n     risk for improper payments. However, the GAO analysis of \n     certain DHS programs indicates that the Department has not \n     ``institute[ed] a systematic method of reviewing all programs \n     and identifying those it believed were susceptible to \n     significant erroneous payments.''\n       For example, GAO points to the Individuals and Households \n     Program (IHP) within the Federal Emergency Management Agency. \n     Despite warnings of reported financial management weaknesses \n     in the IHP program from the DHS Office of Inspector General \n     and the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government \n     Affairs, DHS concluded that the program did not meet the OMB \n     standard for identifying programs susceptible to significant \n     improper payments--exceeding $10 million and 2.5 percent of \n     program payments. However, the GAO analysis of the IHP \n     program reveals improper payments of approximately $1 \n     billion. In GAO's words, this ``dramatically different'' \n     result--a difference of at least $990 million--far exceeds \n     the OMB requirement for a high-risk program.\n       In fact, this was the third year in a row that your \n     independent auditor reported IPIA noncompliance for DHS. If \n     DHS cannot accurately determine which of its programs are at \n     risk for improper payments, it cannot take further steps to \n     root out these payments. And if steps are not taken to root \n     out improper payments in an agency with an annual budget of \n     over $34 billion, American taxpayer dollars will be left \n     vulnerable to waste, fraud and abuse with funds that should \n     have been used to protect them.\n       Please provide us with an explanation of how the Department \n     failed to identify the IHP as a risk susceptible program \n     during the risk assessment process for fiscal year 2005, \n     potentially failing to account for as much as $990 million in \n     improper payments. We further ask that you provide details on \n     how the Department plans to institute an improved method of \n     reviewing all of its programs and identifying those programs \n     that are susceptible to improper payments, in accordance with \n     the letter and spirit of the law.\n       Please provide a response by December 15, 2006. Thank you \n     in advance for your consideration of this important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Barack Obama,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n                                                       Tom Coburn,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. This letter was sent to Secretary Chertoff. The Federal \nFinancial Management Subcommittee of the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs had four hearings on improper payments. We \nknow what is required. We know they can do it. What the Congress has to \ndo is make them do it, if they want to spend the money. It is only \nright for our children and grandchildren to get fair value for the \ntaxpaying public, as we send out this money.\n  I am a skeptic when it comes to this body, when it gets away from the \npolitical porking that goes on. I am not sure this amendment will pass. \nBut if it doesn't pass, I will offer an amendment to get rid of the \nImproper Payments Act because there is no reason to have a law that we \nare not going to enforce. If we are not going to enforce it, why is it \non the books? It is similar to enforcing the borders. The law is there, \nbut we don't do it.\n  We have to be accountable to the American public to make sure that \nagencies follow the law. This is a simple amendment that requires \nHomeland Security to follow that.\n  By the way, we have not had an answer to this letter. It was dated \nNovember 16. I spoke in error.\n\n\n                         United Nations Funding\n\n  I want to correct something I said last week on the United Nations. \nMy numbers were wrong. We, in fact, do pay for about 22 percent of the \nunified budget at the United Nations, and our total contribution is in \nexcess of $5 billion. I had the ratios right, I had the numbers wrong. \nI want to correct that for the Record today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 305\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 305. I believe \nit is already pending, having been offered by Senator McConnell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nCraig, Inhofe, Isakson, and Coburn be made cosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, it is critically important that we \nclarify the role of State and local law enforcement officers in the \nenforcement and apprehension of those who violate our immigration laws \nand that we expand the National Crime Information Center interest. It \nis critical that we have them participate because with expanded NCIC \ncapability, which I am surprised is not already being done, they can be \npartners in Federal law enforcement efforts.\n  It would be in compliance with what the 9/11 Commission and other \nreports have asked us to do. It is a loophole in the system today that \nneeds to be fixed.\n  The amendment I offer is a slimmed down version of the bill I offered \nin the last Congress, the Homeland Security Enforcement Enhancement \nAct. That was cosponsored by Senators Craig, Inhofe, and Isakson. The \nideas contained in the amendment have also been supported by Senators \nKyl and Cornyn. They included it in their immigration bill last \nCongress. Senators Ben Nelson and Coburn included those provisions in \nthe Nelson-Sessions immigration enforcement bill in the last Congress.\n  Additionally, my amendment is almost word for word the provision that \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee included when it marked up the Senate \nimmigration bill last year and the provision that the full Senate voted \nfor when it passed S. 2611.\n  The first section of the amendment reaffirms what I believe to be the \nexisting inherent authority of State and local law enforcement to \nassist the Federal Government in enforcing the immigration laws of the \nUnited States during the normal course of carrying out their law \nenforcement duties. The amendment specifically states that the \nparticipation of State and local law enforcement personnel is not \nrequired, not mandated by this legislation. It is 100 percent \nvoluntary.\n  Section 2 of the amendment deals with the listing of immigration \nviolators in the National Crime Information Center database. State and \nlocal officers need easily accessible roadside access to critical \nimmigration information, just as they would do for citizens of the \nUnited States who violate our laws. Officers routinely, when they stop \npeople on the road, run National Crime Information Center database \nchecks when they pull over suspects, speeders, or people they are \ninvestigating for other crimes. The NCIC is their bread-and-butter \ndatabase. Today the immigration violators file of the National Crime \nInformation Center database contains information on deported felons, \nalien absconders, and wanted persons, aliens with outstanding criminal \nwarrants. That is in the National Crime Information Center database. \nBut my amendment would direct that the Department of Homeland Security \nwork with the FBI to place additional information on certain \nimmigration violators into the already existing immigration violators \nfile.\n  The four categories of immigration violators whose information would \nbe entered are, one, aliens who have final orders of removal. That is \nsomeone who has been apprehended, gone through a hearing, and a judge \nhas ordered finally that they be removed from the country for whatever \nviolation; two, it would cover aliens under voluntary departure \nagreements who for one reason or another have signed an order that they \nwould voluntarily deport themselves or leave the country; No. 3, it \nwould cover aliens who are known to have overstayed their authorized \nperiod of stay, the visa overstays; and No. 4, it would cover aliens \nwhose visas have been revoked. Sometimes people misbehave seriously. \nTwenty-seven percent of our Federal penitentiary bed spaces today are \nfilled by noncitizens.\n\n  For some reason in recent years we are seeing a substantial number of\n\n[[Page S2591]]\n\ncriminal aliens coming into the country. These are not bed spaces for \nimmigration law violations, not people waiting to be deported. These \nare people who have been arrested, tried, or convicted of Federal \ncriminal laws such as drug dealing and assaults or smuggling, things of \nthat nature.\n  When State and local police officers encounter individuals during \ntheir regular law enforcement duties, it is important that they know if \nthe individual in front of them falls into one of these violator \ncategories. Importantly, my amendment includes a new procedure for \nremoval of erroneous information from NCIC. If there is something \nentered incorrectly, under the new procedures an alien may petition the \nSecretary of the Department of Homeland Security or the head of NCIC to \nremove any erroneous information that may have been placed in that file \nto protect them from any unfair treatment.\n  These are recommendations that should already be law, but they are \nrecommendations made in the 9/11 Commission Report. We are all familiar \nwith those recommendations, and they have been included in the Hart-\nRudman report.\n  On page 384 of the 9/11 Commission Report, the Commission says:\n\n       Our investigations showed that two systemic weaknesses came \n     together in our border system's inability to contribute to an \n     effective defense against the 9/11 attacks: a lack of well-\n     developed counterterrorism measures as a part of border \n     security and an immigration system not able to deliver on its \n     basic commitments, much less support counterterrorism. These \n     weaknesses have been reduced but are far from being overcome.\n\n  On page 390, the report says:\n\n       There is a growing role for State and local law enforcement \n     agencies. They need more training and work with Federal \n     agencies so that they can cooperate more effectively with \n     those Federal authorities in identifying terror suspects.\n\n  In the fall of 2002, a year after the \n9/11 attacks, the Council on Foreign Relations published the Hart-\nRudman report entitled ``America Still Unprepared, America Still in \nDanger.'' That report found that one problem America still confronts is \nthat 700,000 local and State police officials continue to operate in a \nvirtual intelligence vacuum. The first recommendation of the Hart-\nRudman report was to ``tap the eyes and ears of local and State law \nenforcement officers in preventing attacks.'' That is their first \nrecommendation, to ``tap the eyes and ears of local and State law \nenforcement officers in preventing attacks.''\n  On page 19 the report specifically cited the burden of finding \nhundreds of thousands of illegal fugitive aliens living among the \npopulation of more than 8.5 million illegal aliens and suggested that \nthe burden could and should be shared with the 700,000 local, county, \nand State law enforcement officers, if they could be brought out of the \ninformation void.\n  So this amendment I am offering tightly targets 9/11 Commission and \nHart-Rudman report recommendations that we look at the growing role for \nState and local law enforcement, that we move toward an immigration \nsystem that can ``deliver on its basic commitments'' as a way to fight \nterrorism, and that we ``tap the eyes and ears of local and State law \nenforcement officers'' in an effort to find the hundreds of thousands \nof fugitive aliens in the United States.\n  Most Americans would probably be amazed that is not occurring today. \nIn fact, a recent poll of 3 years ago was done on this very subject. It \nfound that a large majority of Americans believe that State and local \ngovernments should be aiding the Federal Government in finding alien \nfugitives. That is pretty commonsensical. In fact, a Roper poll found \nthat 85 percent of Americans agree and 65 percent strongly agree--those \nare powerful numbers--that Congress should pass a law requiring State \nand local governments and law enforcement agencies to apprehend and \nturn over to INS, now ICE, illegal immigrants with whom they come in \ncontact. That is pretty strong data.\n  It is important to note that those responses were collected in answer \nto questions about requiring State and local immigration enforcement \naction. So it is very likely that a poll on this subject, one about \nvoluntary State and local assistance, would be even stronger.\n  Let me tell my colleagues about the problem that started my interest \nin this area and prompted me to offer this amendment, as well as 3 \nyears ago to push for a hearing, which was held on April 22, 2004, in \nthe Judiciary Committee entitled ``State and Local Authority to Enforce \nImmigration Law, Evaluating a Unified Approach for Stopping \nTerrorists'' and for me to author a Law Review article in April of \n2005, along with my chief counsel on Judiciary, Cindy Hayden, that was \npublished in the Stanford Law and Policy Review, entitled ``The Growing \nRole for State and Local Law Enforcement in the Realm of Immigration \nLaw.''\n  This is the reality. This is the problem we are dealing with. Police \nchiefs and sheriffs in Alabama have begun to tell me, as I have \ntraveled the State and met with them frequently, and as I continue to \ndo so, that they have been shut out of immigration enforcement and that \nthey felt powerless to do anything about Alabama's growing illegal \nimmigrant population. I heard the same story wherever I went:\n\n       When we come across illegal aliens in our normal course of \n     duty, we have given up calling the INS, because they tell us \n     we have to have 15 or more illegals in custody or they will \n     not even bother to come and pick them up.\n\n  Even worse, Alabama police were routinely told that aliens could not \nbe detained until INS could manage to send someone. They were told they \njust had to let them go. This is basically the policy all over America \ntoday, I kid you not. If a local officer in virtually any State in \nAmerica stops someone for speeding or DUI and finds out they are here \nillegally, they basically take no steps to even contact INS because \nthey only have 2,000 agents in the entire United States and they are \nnot going to come out there and get them. In fact, for other legal \nreasons, they may have some doubt--although, frankly, not much--but \nthere is some doubt about what their authority might be.\n  Now, we have done some research into this and believe the legal \nauthority of State and local officers to voluntarily act on violations \nof immigration law is pretty clear. If there is any doubt that State \nand local law enforcement officers have any authority--and if there is \nany, and there certainly is some today--Congress needs to remove that \ndoubt, which is what this amendment will do.\n  Basically, there is a split in the circuits. I will take just a \nmoment to explain. The Tenth Circuit on more than one occasion \nconcluded squarely that a ``state trooper has general investigatory \nauthority to inquire into possible immigration violations.'' As the \nTenth Circuit went on to say, there is a ``preexisting general \nauthority of state or local police officers to investigate and make \narrests for violations of federal law, including immigration laws.''\n  The Tenth Circuit went on to say, in 2001:\n\n       [S]tate and local police officers [have] implicit authority \n     within their respective jurisdictions ``to investigate and \n     make arrests for violations of federal law, including \n     immigration laws.''\n\n  Now, these Tenth Circuit cases made no distinction between criminal \nviolations and visa overstays, which are not criminal in nature but \ncivil. But the Ninth Circuit did. They concluded the civil violations \nof a visa overstay did not amount to an offense of law that the local \nlaw enforcement officer could arrest and detain for. It was in dictum, \nnot part of the central holding of that case. But that one piece of \ndicta has created an impression throughout the country that has \nimpacted lawyers and police departments and sheriffs' departments all \nover America.\n  They are telling their officers: Well, it might be that the person \nyou stop and is here illegally is a visa overstay and not someone who \ncame across the border illegally, and if you arrest them and detain \nthem, they might sue us, they might sue the city, they might sue the \npolice department. So they have established policies based on this \nambiguity that have effectively reduced the participation of local law \nenforcement officers to a dramatic degree in the enforcement of \nimmigration laws. That is not appropriate. We can fix that. This \namendment would fix that.\n  The second problem the amendment deals with is the inadequate way we \nshare information on immigration matters with State and local police. \nWe have databases full of information on\n\n[[Page S2592]]\n\ncriminal aliens and aliens with final deportation orders, but that \ninformation is not directly available to the State and local police \nthrough their base system, the NCIC. Instead, officers are required to \nmake a special second inquiry to the Law Enforcement Support Center, \nwhich is headquartered in Vermont, to see if the person they pulled \nover is an illegal alien wanted by DHS.\n  Now, I have to tell you, they are not just carrying around in their \npocket those phone numbers anyway. They do not know how to do it. They \nare not comfortable with it. It is not what they do every day. They are \nnot doing it. Besides, if they do and find out the person is illegal, \nthere is nothing much they can do but let them go anyway. So the \nability of the bread-and-butter NCIC database to convey to local police \nwho stop someone out on the highway information that this may be a \nwanted person, maybe even a terrorist, has been severely impacted or \nreally is not effective in many different areas.\n  I have complained about this for some time, and some progress has \nbeen made but not enough. To date, the Immigration Violators File of \nthe NCIC contains about 200,000 entries, and only about 107,000 of the \napproximately 600,000 alien absconders are in the NCIC. I want you to \nhear that. Only about 100,000 of the 600,000 alien absconders have been \nentered into the NCIC.\n  So what does that mean? That means if a local police officer \nsomewhere stops a person who has been previously arrested for an \nimmigration violation and that person has been released on bail, as \noften is the case, and ordered to return to court or to be deported--\nand they frequently do not do so; they abscond; and there are 600,000 \nof those absconders out there, but only 107,000 of those records are in \nNCIC, so a local police officer is not likely to find a hit for the \nperson before him--there will be a 1-in-5 chance of them getting that \nhit.\n  That really needs to be fixed. For the life of me, I cannot see why \nmore progress has not been made. We have been talking about this for 4 \nor 5 years in the Senate Judiciary Committee with the Department of \nJustice officials and ICE officials and FBI people who run the NCIC.\n  At the very least, NCIC should contain four types of immigration \ninformation.\n  The first group: aliens with final orders of removal. If someone has \nbeen ordered removed, they should not be in this country. They \nsometimes leave the country and come back into the country and you get \na hit on that person. In other words, they have been ordered removed. \nWhy are they back in the country?\n  The second group that should be in there: aliens under voluntary \ndeparture agreements. Some agree to leave voluntarily and sign an \nagreement to that effect. They ought to be in there because they should \nnot have stayed in the country or, if they left, they should not have \nreturned.\n  The third group: aliens who are known to have overstayed their \nauthorized period of stay should be entered.\n  The fourth group: aliens whose visas have been revoked, for heaven's \nsakes, ought to be in there.\n  If somebody is here improperly--maybe they have been associated with \nsome criminal enterprise; the ICE people have revoked their visa for \nsome reason; it would have to be significant, usually, for that to \noccur--they ought to go in there because if they are stopped somewhere, \nthey should be detained and turned over to ICE; otherwise, the system \nis not working.\n  Let me tell my colleagues--I know how this system works--if someone \nhad their visa revoked and had been ordered to be removed, trust me, \nthe ICE agents do not go out and walk the streets of Philadelphia or \nAtlanta or Birmingham and look for them so they can deport them. They \ndo not do it. They are not even close to having the ability to do that. \nOnly the people for whom they have evidence who are extremely dangerous \nis that done. That is very few. The way most people are caught is just \nlike everybody else in America who is caught who has absconded or run \noff on bail. They get caught by getting picked up by police on a \ntraffic stop somewhere. The police officer runs their name and ID in \nNCIC and a hit comes back; there is a warrant for his arrest in \nMontgomery, AL, for armed robbery, and he locks him up.\n  If you are an American citizen and you get a reckless driving ticket \nand you are ordered to appear in court at a given time and place and \nyou do not appear in court, they issue a warrant for your arrest. \nNormally, the police officers do not go out and chase you down all over \nand find you to arrest you. Normally, they put it in the NCIC \nimmediately on the assumption you will soon be stopped somewhere else \nalong the way and they will get a hit on you and somebody will put you \nin jail because you have a warrant for flight out there or for jumping \nbail. But we do not do that for noncitizens. A citizen, that will \nhappen to; a U.S. Senator, that will happen to but not somebody who is \ncoming to the country illegally. We do not do the same thing when they \njump bail on their charges.\n  So there are a lot of stories we can tell. I will just summarize a \nnumber of them. It really caught the attention of the 9/11 Commission. \nFor example, Mohamed Atta, who is believed to have piloted American \nAirlines Flight 11, which flew into the World Trade Center's North \nTower, and played a leading role in more than 3,000 deaths that \noccurred that day, in July, just 2 months before the attacks, was \nstopped by police in Tamarac, FL, and was ticketed for having an \ninvalid license. He ignored the ticket and a bench warrant was issued \nfor his arrest. When he was stopped for speeding a few weeks later in a \nnearby town, the officer did not check, did not discover this warrant \nhad been issued and let him go with only a warning.\n\n  Now, OK, Atta had not yet become illegal. I believe at that time he \nstill was on a legal status. However, it was about to expire. I doubt \nhe would have returned to the immigration office to get it extended. He \nwould soon have been here illegally as a visa overstay. He could well \nhave been apprehended and identified before 9/11 had he done so.\n  That is the example I am trying to make. It could very well have been \ndecisive.\n  Also Hani Hanjour was, just 1 month before 9/11, stopped by police in \nArlington, VA, for driving 50 miles an hour in a 35-mile-per-hour zone. \nHe was in a Chevy van with New Jersey plates. He produced a Florida \ndriver's license. But he was the pilot of the American Airlines Flight \n77 which crashed into the Pentagon.\n  A third hijacker was stopped by State police just 2 days before \nSeptember 11, also for speeding. Maryland State police stopped Ziad \nJarrah on Interstate 95 for driving 90 miles an hour in a 60-mile-per-\nhour zone.\n  Well, we are not talking about academic matters; we are talking about \nthe fact that the alien database needs to be accessible to local \npolice. It might as well, for all practical purposes, be locked up in \nsome vault somewhere in secrecy, the way it is being done today. It is \nnot available to the people out there who need it.\n  The Hart-Rudman Commission raised that point, as did the 9/11 \nCommission. I have been told at hearings by the appropriate officials \nthat the NCIC system can handle the additional data. It will not \noverburden the system. It will make this information readily and \nimmediately available to a police officer. He or she may have stumbled \nonto a person such as Mohamed Atta on his way to commit a horrible, \nunspeakable act of terrorism against the people of the United States. \nThat opportunity to make that arrest and to identify that criminal is \nmost important.\n  So that is the purpose of the amendment. I believe as people think \nabout it we will see the need for it. I have tried to get this done in \nany number of different ways, but we have not quite gotten there yet. I \nthink there is a majority in the Senate, probably on both sides of the \naisle, who would support this when it is clearly raised. But as so \noften tends to happen, matters that actually work to a significant \ndegree and will actually substantially increase the ability of our law \nenforcement system to be effective are the things that do not become \nlaw. It is almost like if it works, it will not pass. If you come up \nwith something that sounds good but will not work, that will get \npassed.\n\n[[Page S2593]]\n\n  This needs to be done. In many ways, it will be a test of the Members \nof this body.\n  Are we serious about enforcement of immigration laws? I think we are \nbecoming that way. I believe there is a growing understanding that \nlawfulness needs to be returned to immigration. Without it, we are \ngoing to continue to have an erosion of public confidence in our \nsystem. We can do all of that. I ask that my colleagues consider this \namendment. I hope we will be able to move it forward as part of this \nsecurity legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I rise to \nshare the passing of a real Nevadan, Dr. Hal Rothman. After a struggle \nwith Lou Gehrig's disease, Hal passed away on February 25, 2007. He was \na loving husband to Lauralee, a father to Talia and Brent, and a friend \nto many who were privileged to know him, including me.\n  Hal's professional life and community involvement were remarkable. \nHal was a history professor at UNLV, a Las Vegas Sun columnist, and a \nrespected author on Western and environmental history. Whenever anyone \nneeded a quick quote or quip about Las Vegas, they often called Hal. \nFrom syndicated news shows to historians, Hal was often seen as the go-\nto-man for anything related to the city.\n  Hal's love of Las Vegas was clearly apparent last October when he was \nhonored as the Chin's Humanitarian of the Year by the southern Nevada \nchapter of the Muscular Dystrophy Association. In his prepared remarks \nHal wrote:\n\n       I have sought to explain our wacky city and State to an \n     often skeptical and sometimes incredulous national and \n     international audience.

Mr. President, on Friday, my colleague Mr. Schumer and \nI introduced the Diabetes Screening and Medicaid Savings Act of 2007. \nThis bill will provide a diabetes screening benefit for adults within \nthe Medicaid program. Only Medicaid eligible individuals who are \nenrolled in the program and who meet certain qualifications will be \ncovered. If you test positive for diabetes, then there is mandated \ncoverage of treatment, supplies, and education.\n  According to the American Diabetes Association, diabetes affects \nnearly 21 million Americans, about 7 percent of the total population. \nThe number of U.S. adults with diagnosed diabetes has\n\n[[Page S2594]]\n\nincreased by more than 60 percent since 1991 and is projected to more \nthan double by 2050. It ranks as the sixth leading cause of death in \nAmerica. People who have diabetes are much more likely to suffer from \nblindness, kidney failure, heart disease, stroke, and nerve damage. \nThese complications result in significant costs to the health care \nsystem as a whole as well as to the individual suffering from this \ndisease.\n  Diabetes health care specialists say that many patients who are \ndiagnosed with diabetes initially visit their doctor not for symptoms \nrelated to the diabetes but because they are already suffering from the \nsecondary complications. If diabetes complications are the first \nindication that you have diabetes, you are starting your fight at an \nincredible disadvantage.\n  Although the increasing burden of diabetes and its complications is \nfrightening, much of this burden could be prevented with early \ndetection. Methods for controlling diabetes and minimizing its impact \non health and health care costs are well documented. Yet access to \nthese services, including screening and early interventions, varies by \nState.\n  The bill we are introducing today will provide a uniform benefit \nwithin the Medicaid Program. This bill recognizes that diabetes has \nbeen found to be most prevalent in low-income and certain ethnic \npopulations. This bill makes sure that the needs of these populations, \nsuch as Native Americans and Hispanics are addressed.\n  Complications of diabetes can be prevented and the costs of this \ndisease to our society can be contained. Early detection and treatment \nis the key. I know that the chairman and ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee have been working very hard to reform the Medicaid Program so \nthat it will better serve those who need it most. I appreciate their \nefforts and hope they will consider making the changes I am \nrecommending.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/05/senate-section/article/S2594-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        CONGRATULATING HAWAI`I'S NATIONAL CHEERLEADING CHAMPIONS\n\n Mr. AKAKA.

LAWRENCE THOMAS GERATY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing the lifetime contributions of Dr. Lawrence Thomas Geraty as \nhe retires as president of La Sierra University in southern California. \nDr. Geraty's strengths as a churchman, educator, academic, and \nadministrator provide an example for us all.\n  Dr. Geraty has been a college and university president for the past \n22 years, first taking on this role at Union College in South \nLancaster, MA, in 1985. For the past 14 years he has served as \npresident of La Sierra University in Riverside, CA.\n  Growing up as a member of a Seventh-Day Adventist missionary family, \nLawrence Geraty gained a broad perspective of the world, living abroad \nor attending educational institutions in China including Hong Kong, \nBurma, Lebanon, England, Germany, France, and Israel. He earned his \nbachelor's degree from Pacific Union College, then graduated from the \nTheological Seminary at Andrews University. Following his graduation, \nhe served as a pastor in Santa Ana, CA, for a brief period of time. \nThereafter, he joined Andrews Theological Seminary as a faculty member. \nAfter serving at Andrews, he went to Harvard University to study Hebrew \nBible and Biblical archaeology, earning his Ph.D. with distinction and \ncompleting examinations in 10 languages.\n  After receiving his Ph.D. Dr. Geraty returned to Andrews Theological \nSeminary to work as Professor of Archaeology and History of Antiquity. \nFor the next 13 years, Dr. Geraty served as an educator and scholar in \nJamaica, Jordan, Costa Rica, Trinidad, Europe, and Australia. During \nthis period, he was a founding director of the Institute of Archaeology \nat Andrews University, led a series of major archaeological expeditions \nin the Middle East, and worked as the curator of the Horn \nArchaeological Museum.\n  Dr. Geraty has had led a prominent career in academia. He was the \nrecipient of a Fulbright fellowship. He served as an adviser on \narchaeology to former Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan. He served as vice \npresident of the American Center of Oriental Research in Amman, Jordan \nfrom 1982 to 2002. He represented the U.S. Office of Education in a \ndelegation of administrators to study minority education in China. He \nhas published roughly 50 scholarly journal articles, edited 8 books and \nprovided contributions to over 30 books.\n  During his tenure as president of La Sierra University, the \nuniversity has seen tremendous growth and has played an integral role \nin the growth of inland southern California and our Nation. Between \n1993 and 2006 university enrollment nearly doubled. In 2002, a \nbiotechnology laboratory opened. In 2004, U.S. News and World Report \ndistinguished La Sierra University for its successes in student \ndiversity. And this year, Dr. Geraty had the great distinction of being \nnamed ``Citizen of the Year'' by the Greater Riverside Chamber of \nCommerce.\n  In his time as president of La Sierra University, Dr. Lawrence Geraty \nhas provided our Nation with a role model of leadership and \ncitizenship. His commitment continues to leave a legacy of service to \nacademia, scholarship, education, his community and our Nation, and I \napplaud his lifetime of service as he retires.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/05/senate-section/article/S2594-3", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2594-S2597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO WALTER SONDHEIM, JR.\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to one of \nBaltimore's great civic leaders, Walter Sondheim, Jr. If ever there was \na statesman from Baltimore, it was Walter Sondheim. From the time I \nentered public life in 1971, his name was synonymous with integrity, \npublic purpose and civic leadership, and he was the most self-effacing \npublic figure I ever met.\n  Perhaps Walter Sondheim's most unique talent was his ability to \nmanage transitions. Whether in business, in the community or in his own \npersonal life, Walter knew when to hold them and when to fold them. In \nthe late 1950s and early 1960s, Walter recognized the evolution in \nBaltimore's economic base from heavy industry and manufacturing to \ntourism, service and technology. He championed a new vision of public \nland use and architectural excellence when he shepherded the \nRenaissance of Baltimore and the creation of the present day Inner \nHarbor. He challenged the business community to look forward and \nprepare for the service economy and the explosion of technology related \nbusinesses that was being driven by our major universities and federal \nscientific facilities.\n  In the larger community, Walter Sondheim led us from the darkness of\n\n[[Page S2595]]\n\nsegregation and into the vision illuminated by the U.S. Supreme Court's \ndecision in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954. Where other \ncommunities hesitated or procrastinated, as president of the Board of \nSchool Commissioners for Baltimore City, he forged ahead to implement \nthis milestone ruling long before other cities around the Nation. The \nresult was a speedy, thoughtful, considered integration of the public \nschools.\n  In his own personal life, Walter Sondheim transitioned from his early \nlife as a businessman with one of Baltimore's premiere department \nstores to the leader of a number of influential civic and business \norganizations. With grace and purpose, he carefully released himself \nfrom old roles and embraced new opportunities. He never looked \nbackward, only forward. He did not fear new ideas. Whatever challenge \nhe chose to address, he was always the right man in the right place at \nthe right time.\n  Finally, Walter Sondheim was never threatened by other talented \npeople. Indeed, he encouraged young leadership and new faces in the \ncrowd. For this young protestor, who found herself in an elected \nposition inside City Hall, he had nothing but words of encouragement \nand offers of assistance. He knew that civic leadership was comprised \nnot only of traditional groups, but also of the sweat equity crowd that \ndesired change. He always welcomed new energy and new points of view. \nWalter remained unburdened by convention and the status quo his entire \nlife long.\n  I ask that a Baltimore Sun article on the life and contributions of \nWalter Sondheim be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, Feb. 15, 2007]\n\n  Walter Sondheim Jr.: 1908-2007--He Was Sage Adviser, Key Figure in \n                             City's Growth\n\n       Through 6 decades, they called upon Walter Sondheim Jr. \n     When Baltimore mayors, Maryland governors and other civic \n     leaders needed sage advice, inevitably they sought it from a \n     man widely admired for integrity and uncommon warmth and \n     graciousness.\n       Mr. Sondheim died at 10 a.m. Thursday of pneumonia at Mercy \n     Medical Center. He was 98, and until last week he worked \n     every day at his office at the Greater Baltimore Committee.\n       Mr. Sondheim had a gift for nudging people toward grand \n     accomplishments, often to the surpassing benefit of Baltimore \n     and the state beyond. He earned his livelihood as a \n     department store executive, but his legacy can be found in \n     sweeping civic movements.\n       As president of the Baltimore school board in 1954, Mr. \n     Sondheim insisted--though other cities stalled--on the speedy \n     desegregation of Baltimore schools after the U.S. Supreme \n     Court's ruling in Brown v. Board of Education. As a leader of \n     the city's downtown development agency, he coaxed his \n     colleagues into carefully controlled planning of the Inner \n     Harbor. He headed the state panel that promoted regular \n     testing of students. He disdained anything but the highest \n     ethical standards in business and government.\n       ``It's hard to imagine God having created a better person \n     than Walter Sondheim,'' said Robert C. Embry Jr., the city's \n     former housing commissioner and now president of the Abell \n     Foundation.\n       Accolades poured in from the many leaders Mr. Sondheim \n     counseled throughout the decades.\n       Gov. Martin O'Malley, who ordered state flags to be flown \n     at half-staff, said Mr. Sondheim ``wasn't shy about reaching \n     out'' to him with advice when Mr. O'Malley was mayor.\n       ``If there was one enduring quality about Walter Sondheim, \n     it was he had an unrelenting optimism about human nature,'' \n     Mr. O'Malley said Thursday night.\n       Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin said, ``Whether it was integration \n     of the city schools or the redevelopment of Baltimore, he was \n     certainly well ahead of his time.''\n       William Donald Schaefer, the former governor and mayor who \n     worked closely with Mr. Sondheim on many civic improvement \n     efforts, called his death ``a tremendous loss,'' describing \n     Mr. Sondheim as one of the smartest and kindest men he knew.\n       ``Integrity. I've never known a man with so much integrity \n     in my life,'' Mr. Schaefer said. ``He would not sanction \n     anything that was not right.''\n       During nearly a century of life, Mr. Sondheim crossed paths \n     with many celebrated personages of his day. His favorite \n     portrait of his late wife, Janet, was taken by the famed \n     photographer Dorothea Lange. His children were delivered by \n     Dr. Alan Guttmacher, a Johns Hopkins obstetrician-\n     gynecologist who was one of the pioneers in the field of \n     reproductive health. His brother-in-law was Richard Neustadt, \n     a Harvard political scientist and the founder of the \n     university's John F. Kennedy School of Government.\n\n\n                           Linked to history\n\n       His life was also intimately entwined with the history of \n     Baltimore. He knew H.L. Mencken, who was a friend of Mr. \n     Sondheim's father. His parents were married a week before the \n     Great Baltimore Fire of 1904, which destroyed much of the \n     downtown business district.\n       A droll and charming raconteur, Mr. Sondheim would recount \n     for friends that when his parents returned from their \n     honeymoon to the still-smoking Baltimore, his father told his \n     mother that the fire of their love had engulfed the city.\n       But beyond the stories was a remarkable record of \n     achievement in reshaping the city. Mr. Schaefer said the \n     Science Center, Harborplace and Charles Center--among other \n     projects--are ``all monuments to Walter.''\n       Through it all, Mr. Sondheim was self-effacing, often \n     protesting his aversion to the spotlight. ``I'm not sure how \n     I've gotten involved in the variety of things referred to \n     here today,'' he said in 1975 when the Advertising Club of \n     Baltimore gave him its Man of the Year Award. ``One \n     factor, of course, is just being around for so many years. \n     My good, long-suffering, strangely faithful wife is clear \n     about the fact that I'm just weak-kneed and haven't the \n     courage to say `no.'\n       ``Personally, I lean to the theory, expressed by a friend \n     of mine, that there are some jobs only a damned fool will do, \n     and if you're one, you have an obligation to accept such an \n     assignment when it's offered to you.''\n       People who knew Mr. Sondheim dismissed such talk.\n       He was a man of great affability who, until the end, \n     delighted in juicy gossip and laughter.''\n       Everybody wanted him at their parties,'' Mr. Cardin said. \n     ``You don't get many people in their late 90s that everybody \n     wants to be around. He was one of a kind.''\n       Freeman A. Hrabowski III, president of the University of \n     Maryland, Baltimore County and a longtime close friend, said \n     he was thinking back Thursday to something Mr. Sondheim told \n     him 20 years ago.\n       ``He said, `Freeman , live life seriously, but don't take \n     it seriously. You do your best, and then you laugh,' and that \n     was Walter,'' Mr. Hrabowski said.\n       Mr. Sondheim performed a vital role as a link between the \n     region's businessmen and William Donald Schaefer when he was \n     a city councilman, mayor, governor and later state \n     comptroller.\n       The two men met when a young Mr. Schaefer chaired a City \n     Council committee on urban renewal.\n       ``He would walk into the City Council, and it was like the \n     Lord walked in,'' Mr. Schaefer said. ``You would never think \n     of challenging Walter.''\n       State Treasurer Nancy K. Kopp said that while Mr. Sondheim \n     deeply admired Mr. Schaefer, he never hesitated to speak his \n     mind to the mercurial politician.\n       ``He was never reluctant to tell Schaefer he was making \n     mistakes,'' Ms. Kopp said.\n       C. Fraser Smith, a former Sun reporter who wrote a \n     biography of Mr. Schaefer, described an incident in which the \n     two men were flying to Germany to receive an honor on behalf \n     of the city.\n       Mr. Sondheim, the story goes, took advantage of the \n     opportunity to admonish the mayor over his gruff treatment of \n     people. Why are you so mean to people? Mr. Sondheim asked. \n     After stewing a long time, Mr. Schaefer demanded to know whom \n     he had treated badly.\n       ``Why don't you look in the phone book?'' Mr. Sondheim \n     replied.\n       Once pressed to explain his skills in dealing with people, \n     Mr. Sondheim allowed that he possessed an ability to listen \n     to others, the patience to find a workable compromise when \n     confronted with controversial points of view, and the gift of \n     being able to put himself in someone else's position.\n       He then added: ``Liking people is not as important as \n     understanding people. This is a skill that is not born; it's \n     trained. You can't be judgmental about somebody with whom you \n     don't agree.''\n       Mr. Sondheim was born in his father's house on Bolton \n     Street on July 25, 1908, an era of gaslights and streetcars. \n     He recalled for a 2003 Sun article that the family passed \n     summers in the cooler climate of a rented home in Pikesville. \n     One summer, his father said he couldn't join the family; when \n     they returned to Bolton Hill, they found that the elder Mr. \n     Sondheim had spent the time having electric power installed.\n       Barred from some of the city's elite schools because he was \n     Jewish, Mr. Sondheim attended Park School, becoming a member \n     of one of its first classes. He went on to Haverford College \n     in Pennsylvania, from which he graduated in 1929, and went to \n     work for the Hochschild, Kohn department store, where his \n     father worked. Mr. Sondheim would later chalk up his job to \n     ``nepotism.''\n       In 1934, he married Janet Blum of Berkeley, Calif., who had \n     been a dancer with the Denishawn Company. He had proposed to \n     her in a speakeasy. They had two children, John W. Sondheim \n     and Ellen Dankert, both of Baltimore.\n       Mrs. Sondheim, who later became a teacher, died in 1992. \n     Mr. Sondheim's death came on what would have been their 73rd \n     wedding anniversary.\n       Even at a young age, Mr. Sondheim was interested in race \n     relations at a time when few white Baltimoreans questioned \n     segregation as a bedrock principle. He served on the board of \n     the Baltimore Urban League during the 1930s.\n       ``It was really a segregated city,'' Mr. Sondheim recalled \n     in a 1995 interview. ``I\n\n[[Page S2596]]\n\n     worked at Hochschild, Kohn's. We waited on African-Americans \n     but on an all-sales-final basis. People couldn't return \n     things, they couldn't eat in the restaurants, and they were \n     only employed in menial capacities. The fact that blacks were \n     not treated as full citizens as customers was a major issue \n     with both the Urban League and the NAACP.''\n       Mr. Sondheim said he worked within the company to change \n     the practice. ``I was terribly unhappy and embarrassed,'' he \n     said during a 2003 trial in which he testified about the \n     history of discrimination in Baltimore.\n       Nevertheless, Mr. Sondheim rose to the position of store \n     manager at Hochschild's and held that post for five years \n     until, in 1942, he was appointed director of the United \n     States Employment Service for Maryland, an agency \n     responsible for transferring people from nonessential jobs \n     to war work.\n       The following year, he joined the Navy and was commissioned \n     a lieutenant. He was stationed in Cleveland and, when asked \n     about his war service, loved to say he had protected the \n     Great Lakes from Axis invasion. He served until 1946. With \n     the war over, he returned to Hochschild, Kohn.\n       Mr. Sondheim's name and reputation came to the attention of \n     Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro Jr. in 1948 when he was looking for \n     someone to fill a vacancy in what was then considered ``the \n     Jewish seat'' on the school board. Mr. Sondheim accepted the \n     job and served on the board for the next nine years.\n       Though Mr. Sondheim seldom dwelled on the discrimination he \n     personally encountered, he took the appointment at a time \n     when anti-Semitism was pervasive in the United States in \n     general and Baltimore in particular.\n       In the 2003 discrimination trial at which he testified, Mr. \n     Sondheim recounted that his family was once blocked from \n     buying a house in Roland Park when the seller found out the \n     Sondheims were Jewish. He also testified that the elite \n     downtown clubs that served the business establishment also \n     barred Jews--a barrier that led to the formation of the \n     Center Club. But when some organizers of that club proposed \n     that it exclude blacks, Mr. Sondheim and several others \n     withdrew their applications. The rule was dropped.\n\n\n                            Fateful decision\n\n       It was while Mr. Sondheim was president of the school board \n     that the city decided in May 1954 to desegregate its schools \n     in response to the Supreme Court's decision.\n       Baltimore became the first school district south of the \n     Mason-Dixon line to respond to the Supreme Court's unanimous, \n     landmark ruling outlawing ``separate but equal'' education \n     for blacks and whites.\n       Integration here was accomplished with relatively little \n     tension compared with events in other cities, and the process \n     was hailed as a signal achievement at the time.\n       But it did not come entirely without resistance. On one \n     occasion, an opponent of desegregation burned a cross on Mr. \n     Sondheim's Windsor Hills lawn. But Mr. Sondheim would play \n     down the incident, telling friends that the cross was puny \n     and the fire hardly got started.\n       ``He wouldn't back off,'' Mr. Schaefer said. ``He wouldn't \n     step aside. He wouldn't do anything except what was right.''\n       In 1958, Morgan State awarded Mr. Sondheim an honorary \n     degree. He accepted his honor alongside the Rev. Martin \n     Luther King Jr., who received the same honor from the school \n     that day, according to state archivist Edward C. Papenfuse \n     Jr.\n       Nevertheless, Mr. Sondheim declined to count school \n     desegregation as one of his achievements--noting that 50 \n     years later most African-American students attend schools \n     that are almost entirely black. He would tell listeners that \n     while he and others desegregated the schools, they didn't \n     succeed in integrating them.\n       Mr. Sondheim's next major task in the life of the city came \n     in 1957 when he was named head of the newly created Baltimore \n     Urban Renewal and Housing Authority, which brought together a \n     number of agencies charged with handling the city's public \n     housing program.\n       He said he had no advanced knowledge of public housing--\n     other than having lived with Mrs. Sondheim and their children \n     in a Cleveland public housing project when he was in the \n     Navy--but he started to learn.\n       The learning process coincided with the city's initial \n     commitment to downtown renewal, spurred by the GBC, an \n     organization of prominent citizens determined to prevent the \n     area from deteriorating. In his role as housing authority \n     chief and as a member of the GBC, he helped launch the first \n     renewal project, Charles Center.\n       The year was 1963. His civic responsibilities, added to his \n     work at the department store, overwhelmed him. He resigned as \n     head of the housing authority to devote more time to \n     retailing but remained involved in less demanding civic \n     enterprises.\n       In 1970, Mr. Sondheim decided to take early retirement from \n     the department store, where he had risen to the post of \n     senior vice president and treasurer, and started a second \n     career with the quasi-public Charles Center-Inner Harbor \n     Management organization that was transforming the city's \n     skyline and attracting national attention from urban \n     planners.\n       The new post became a full-time job, but he also was called \n     upon to serve as director of the Baltimore Urban Coalition, \n     chairman of the board of Goucher College and a member, \n     trustee or director of such organizations as Mercy and Sinai \n     hospitals, the Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. and the \n     Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Co.\n       However, Mr. Sondheim decided in May 1989 to shed some of \n     these responsibilities.\n       After 15 years as chairman of Charles Center-Inner Harbor \n     Management, where he worked for $1 a year, he announced his \n     resignation. At the same time, he stepped down as president \n     of Charles Street Management Corp. and Market Center \n     Development Corp., two agencies that helped direct \n     development of other parts of downtown.\n       ``I think that people can stay too long on some jobs,'' he \n     said when announcing his retirement.\n       Soon he settled into an office at the GBC, where he took \n     the title of senior adviser. His work ethic never flagged. \n     When snow prompted other staff members to leave the office \n     early, Mr. Sondheim, who lived nearby in a condominium at \n     Harbor View, would take over the job of answering phones.\n       Asked once why he never joined in the white flight out of \n     the city, Mr. Sondheim replied: ``What I learned early on is \n     cutting grass is not as good as walking pavement.''\n       Two years after taking senior status at the GBC, Mr. \n     Sondheim was appointed by Mr. Schaefer to chair a \n     gubernatorial panel on school performance--a group that would \n     become known as the Sondheim Commission. The group produced a \n     report that became the blueprint for what would become known \n     as the Maryland School Performance Assessment Program, or \n     MSPAP.\n       The controversial test, with its heavy emphasis on writing \n     skills, would be the state's chief educational measurement \n     tool for a decade.\n\n\n                            A feeling of awe\n\n       While on senior status, Mr. Sondheim would continue to be \n     sought out for advice by aspiring political leaders.\n       Former Gov. Parris N. Glendening said Mr. Sondheim was one \n     of the first people he turned to for advice before launching \n     his campaign for the State House. Then the Prince George's \n     County executive, Mr. Glendening said he and Mr. Sondheim \n     spoke for well over an hour about education and the condition \n     of Baltimore. After his election as governor in 1994, Mr. \n     Glendening said he frequently solicited Mr. Sondheim's views \n     on ``big picture'' issues such as the city-state partnership \n     in running Baltimore schools.\n       ``I would talk with him and always come away with a feeling \n     of awe,'' Mr. Glendening said.\n       In 1997, when he was 89, Mr. Sondheim was the central \n     figure in a Wall Street Journal article about people who \n     delayed retirement far beyond the age of Social Security \n     eligibility.\n       The Page 1 article recounted how Mr. Sondheim sent a letter \n     to his closest friends asking them to let him know--by \n     anonymous note if they preferred--if he ever reached the \n     point where it was time to stop coming to work.\n       Lainy Lebow-Sachs, former chief of staff to Mr. Schaefer \n     and a longtime friend of Mr. Sondheim's, said none of his \n     friends wrote such a reply. ``Everybody ripped it up,'' she \n     said.\n       Mr. O'Malley said Mr. Sondheim played a behind-the-scenes \n     role in his 2004 standoff with Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. and \n     state Superintendent Nancy S. Grasmick over the control of \n     the city school system. The governor described Mr. Sondheim \n     as performing ``shuttle diplomacy'' between City Hall and \n     Mrs. Grasmick, a close friend of Mr. Sondheim who had aligned \n     herself with Mr. Ehrlich in favor of increased state control.\n       ``He tried very much to be a conciliator on that score and \n     felt that it was very unhealthy for the progress of our kids \n     that the school system wound up as a political football,'' \n     Mr. O'Malley said. He added that Mr. Sondheim privately urged \n     him to stick by his guns on the issue of local control.\n       Mr. Sondheim cut back on some activities in his final \n     years. In 2001, he stepped down as president of the state \n     school board, a post he had held since 1998. Two years later, \n     he left the board after serving two terms as a member. Last \n     year, he stepped down from the board of the Abell Foundation.\n       But he remained active in business and political activities \n     well into his late 90s. In 2006, he recruited a group of \n     prominent Baltimoreans who were interested in buying The Sun \n     from Tribune Co. Until his death, he served on one board that \n     ensures compliance with the state's open-meetings laws and \n     another that runs the American Visionary Arts Museum.\n       As he advanced in years, Mr. Sondheim frequently joked \n     about his age. Once, asked how he was doing, he replied: \n     ``OK, considering my antiquity.''\n       Ms. Lebow-Sachs said Mr. Sondheim's longevity and vigor \n     could not be attributed to a health regimen. ``He ate \n     anything he wanted, and he didn't exercise since 1921,'' she \n     said.\n       Mr. Sondheim would continue to drive--but only during the \n     day--until the week before his death, when he broke his ankle \n     in an accident. It was after that injury that he would check \n     into Mercy, where his final illness was diagnosed.\n       Ms. Lebow-Sachs and Mr. Schaefer recalled that every time \n     Mr. Sondheim received an honor--and there were dozens--he \n     would go on and on about how he didn't deserve it.\n       Mr. Schaefer said his friends' reaction was always: ``For \n     God's sake, Walter, cut that out!''\n       In 2005, when the University of Maryland, Baltimore County \n     named its social sciences building after Mr. Sondheim and his \n     late wife, he admonished school officials.\n\n[[Page S2597]]\n\n       ``You shouldn't name a building for people who are still \n     alive,'' Mr. Sondheim--then 96--said at the dedication \n     ceremony. ``You never know what they'll do tomorrow.''\n       In addition to his son and daughter, Mr. Sondheim is \n     survived by two granddaughters and a great-granddaughter. He \n     is also survived by a sister-in-law, Shirley Williams, a \n     former member of Britain's Parliament and Mr. Neustadt's \n     widow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/05/senate-section/article/S2597-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING GARY M.

He was first \nelected sheriff of Caldwell County in 2002 and reelected to a second \nterm in November 2007.\n  Sheriff Clark loved serving the citizens of Caldwell County and \ndedicated his life to law enforcement. Additionally, he loved his \nfamily and was a dedicated husband and father. He was also a man of \ngreat faith.\n  Sheriff Clark is survived by his wife Kim Clark; two daughters, Megan \nElaine Clark, 14, and Staci Michelle Clark, 11; his parents Stanley and \nNorma Clark; and a brother, Alan Clark.\n  I know my colleagues in the Senate join me in honoring the life of \nSheriff Gary M.

Mr. President, I offer my congratulations to the \nSouth River Ruritan Club in Edgewater, MD, on their 50th anniversary.\n  The South River Ruritan Club, a community service organization, was \nchartered on March 13, 1957, and for 50 years has been providing much \nneeded services to the citizens of Edgewater, Annapolis, and southern \nMaryland.\n  The Club, whose members are all volunteers, have contributed well in \nexcess of half a million dollars in direct financial aid and countless \nhours of time, to numerous community service projects.\n  The club awards local students scholastic and vocational scholarships \nand provides assistance to local Scout troops, youth athletics, and \nother youth-related programs. They conduct an annual essay contest for \nfifth grade students and have sponsored students to the National \nAssociation of Student Council Conference and Exchange Student \nprograms.\n  They contribute annually to the local fire and rescue departments, \nthe Maryland and Anne Arundel County police departments, and support \nenvironmental programs, including efforts to protect the Chesapeake \nBay.\n  Our Active Duty military, retired and disabled military, and veterans \norganizations also benefit from the volunteer efforts of the club. They \nhave sent direct aid to our troops in Iraq and provide additional \nfinancial assistance through their military's morale and welfare \nassistance programs.\n  Their work also includes assistance in such areas as financial aid to \nneedy families, victims of violent crimes, families displaced by \ncatastrophes such as fires, and hurricanes, and assistance through \nHabitat for Humanity. They contribute annually to St. Jude Children's \nResearch Hospital and Johns Hopkins Hospital Children's Center and they \nloan wheelchairs, walkers, and other medical assistance equipment to \nmembers of the community.\n  I congratulate the South River Ruritan Club on their wonderful record \nof community service over the last 50 years and wish them enormous \nsuccess as they continue their commitment to improving their \ncommunities and supporting the families who live in and around them. \nThis club and their membership, both past and present, have every \nreason to be proud of what they have accomplished.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/05/senate-section/article/S2597-3", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/05/senate-section/article/S2597-4", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/05/senate-section/article/S2597-5", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bill was read the first time:\n\n       S. 761.

A bill to authorize appropriations for the Department of \nDefense to address the equipment reset and other equipment needs of the \nNational Guard, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, no one has worked harder or sacrificed more \nin the war on terrorism than our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and \nMarines.\n  Regrettably, they have been tested in unprecedented ways--with too \nfew troops in our overall forces, our soldiers are rotating in and out \nof Iraq for year-long stretches. By the beginning of next year, members \nof the 3rd Infantry Division will have spent more time in Iraq than at \nhome in a span of five years.\n  On top of the physical and psychological strains caused by these \ndeployments, our troops are contending with grave equipment shortfalls \nand sparse resources to restock their supplies.\n  Congress and the American public were already informed that two-\nthirds of the Army's forces in the United States are ``not ready'' for \ncombat duty, largely due to these equipment shortfalls.\n  But the situation for our National Guard is far worse. In a report \nsubmitted to Congress last Thursday by the Commission on the National \nGuard and Reserves, we learned that 88 percent of the National Guard \nhas been classified as ``not ready'' for duty. Such a statistic seems \nearth-shattering to me--it should drive all of us in Congress to action \nimmediately.\n  As my colleagues know, the National Guard operates under dual \nauthorities: overseas, they become fully integrated into the U.S. Armed \nForces, serving under the President in a variety of combat missions; at \nhome, the National Guard serves under our States' governors, performing \nhomeland security functions during local or statewide emergencies, such \nas storms, fires, earthquakes or civil disturbances.\n  For years now, however, the administration's foreign policies have \nactually endangered the Guard's abilities to perform either of these \nfunctions. Under orders by the administration, National Guard troops \nhave been forced to leave their State's equipment in Iraq and \nAfghanistan for other troops rotating into combat theaters. Many of \ntheir military vehicles and aircraft are being worn down and destroyed \nin battle. But any critical equipment that may have survived is simply \nbeing transferred to other units coming into Iraq or Afghanistan.\n  This means that when the National Guard comes home, they are finding \ntheir stocks of equipment--ranging from humvees to night-vision \ngoggles, generators and radios--cleaned out. So today, we face a \nfrightening series of questions--what happens when the next Hurricane \nKatrina strikes? Who will help restore order? Who will help provide \ncritical emergency response services? And what equipment will they use?\n  The National Guard Commission, led by former Senate Armed Services \nCommittee Staff Director retired Marine General Arnold Punaro, lays out \nthe problems in stark terms. Unless we address this situation \nimmediately, we will jeopardize not only our troops' safety but our \nvery nation's security.\n  That is why today I am introducing legislation to rebuild our \nNational Guard and ensure that it can fully perform both its homeland \nsecurity and national defense missions. According to the National Guard \nBureau at the Pentagon, the President's budget is short $38 billion \nover the next five years. My bill would allocate funding according to \nthe needs projected by National Guard Bureau Chief Lieutenant General \nH. Steven Blum.\n  Some may suggest that this is not an issue that can simply be fixed \nwith more money. As in prior years, the Department of Defense may say \nthat the defense industry simply just does not have adequate capacity \nto manufacture all of these new product orders. If that is the case, we \nwill need to find ways to expand our nation's defense production. For \nthat reason, my bill will also require the Defense Department to \nprovide a plan for investing in industry to expand their manufacturing \ncapacity.\n  This legislation will complement the Leahy-Bond Guard Empowerment Act \nof 2007, legislation that I have proudly cosponsored to elevate \nNational Guard leadership at the Department of Defense so that it may \nbetter contribute to the formulation of key defense policies. But \nwithout the necessary resources, the National Guard will be unable to \ndo its job. That is why my legislation is so important today.\n  These conclusions were further confirmed by a January 2007 Government \nAccountability Office (GAO) report which found that our National \nGuard's equipment inventories in the United States have decreased \nlargely because of overseas operations. The GAO further found that as \nof November 2006, nondeployed Army National Guard forces nationwide \nonly have 64 percent of the total amount of equipment they need.\n  Let me be clear about the reasons why my legislation is needed to lay \nout our budget for the next five years. While the administration's \nrecent five-year budget projections have sought large increases for \nNational Guard equipment, according to the National Guard Commission \nReport data, the administration and Republican-led Congresses have \nrepeatedly failed to follow through on such requirements.\n  According to the Commission, funding from 1999-2005 has been reduced \nsignificantly from the amounts identified several years earlier. For \nexample, when the administration's first five-year budget was submitted \nto Congress, it showed that the Army planned to fund $1.346 billion in \nFiscal Year 2004\n\n[[Page S2601]]\n\nfor Army National Guard procurement. But in reality, the Army Guard \nactually had only $578.4 million to spend that year. Similarly, the \nFiscal Year 2005 budget was initially projected to be $1.625 billion \nfor the Army National Guard. But when it came time to allocate the \nfunding, the Administration and their Congressional allies could only \ncome up with $660.9 million for Army National Guard procurement.\n  Indeed, while our troops have given their all on the battlefield, the \nadministration and United States Congress have not held up their end of \nthe bargain. We owe it to our troops to do all that we can to promote \ntheir wellbeing--whether providing appropriate care at our military and \nVA hospitals or providing the military equipment they need to complete \ntheir missions safely and effectively.\n  Regrettably, the sad and simple fact is that the administration has \nrepeatedly come up short in this regard. And these failures are having \ndevastating consequences, not only for our troops but for our Nation's \nvery defense and homeland security.\n  This situation is not new. I have come to the floor to try to address \nlacking resources for our military's essential equipment needs from the \nvery first year of the Iraq war. In 2003, the Army identified $322 \nmillion in shortfalls in critical health and safety gear--ranging from \nbody armor, camelback hydration systems, and combat helmets to \nequipment for deactivating high-explosives--all priorities that the \nRumsfeld Pentagon and Bush administration failed to provide for in \ntheir initial budgets. I offered an amendment to the Emergency \nAppropriations bill to resolve these problems. Unfortunately, the Bush \nadministration opposed this legislation, and the amendment was defeated \nalong party lines.\n  In 2004, we tried a different approach--requiring the Department of \nDefense to reimburse military personnel who bought equipment for \nmilitary service in Iraq and Afghanistan that the Rumsfeld Pentagon had \nfailed to provide. This time, despite ardent objections of Secretary \nRumsfeld's Pentagon, Congress approved the legislation. And in October \n2004, President Bush signed the bill into law. We approved similar \nlegislation in 2005 to further extend this benefit as troops, their \nfamilies, and their communities continued to dig into their own pockets \nto buy needed lifesaving equipment for use on the battlefield.\n  But last year, the difficulties associated with equipment shortfalls \nposed a far more serious problem. Working with Senators Inouye, Reed \nand Stevens, I offered an amendment to address a $17 billion budget \nshortfall to replace and repair thousands of war battered tanks, \naircraft, and vehicles. Without these additional resources, the Army \nChief of Staff claimed that U.S. Army readiness would deteriorate even \nfurther. This provision was approved unanimously and enacted in law. \nBut much more remains to be done.\n  If Congress and the administration do not finally heed the warnings \nof the U.S. military's top generals, and fully fund our equipment \nneeds, the Armed Forces' ability to respond to future challenges to \nAmerica's national security--whether on the Korean Peninsula, the \nMiddle East, or elsewhere in the world--could be harmed.\n  Moreover, if we do not take the findings of the independent National \nGuard Commission seriously, and fully address the equipment shortfalls \nof our Citizen Soldiers here at home, I am afraid we will further erode \nour states' most pressing emergency response capabilities.\n  For the last six years, our troops have unconditionally served in \nAfghanistan, battling Al Qaeda and Taliban forces. And for four years, \nthey have bravely followed orders into Iraq, despite the \nadministration's ill-defined objectives and faulty intelligence.\n  Our troops have served with characteristic honor, dedication, and \nskill. It is high time that we meet our commitments to them--and give \nthem the mission-critical gear they need to get their jobs done. I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to support my legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON:\n  S. 757. A bill to create a national set of effective voluntary \nnational expectations for mathematics and science education in \nkindergarten through grade 12, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce legislation \nto help ensure that American students are competitive in today's global \neconomy. If approved, The National Mathematics and Science Consistency \nAct would ensure that America's children have access to a rigorous math \nand science education.\n  The reality is that modern technology makes it increasingly possible \nfor employers to hire the most skilled workers wherever they live. \nAdditionally, too many American students--even some graduates of high \nschool and college--are not equipped with the skills they need to \ncompete successfully in the global economy. That is why I am \nreintroducing the Mathematics and Science Consistency Act.\n  This legislation calls for the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to \nconvene a national panel of experts to collect proven effective K-12 \nscience and mathematics teaching standards and materials to serve as \npromising practices. Under this bill, it is entirely up to states \nwhether to adopt these promising practices. States that do so, however, \nwould be eligible for grants to acquire instructional materials, to \nmake those materials available online to teachers and staff for free, \nand to train teachers to effectively use these materials. These \npromising practices would provide effective standards for K-12 \neducation.\n  Regrettably, many States have set standards for math and science \neducation at an abysmally low level. A Fordham Institute report \nentitled ``The State of State Science Standards 2006'' deemed the \naverage grade for State standards across all subjects as a ``C-minus,'' \nwhile two-thirds of our K-12 students attend schools in States with C-, \nD-, or F-rated standards. The result of low State standards is that \nStates think their students are demonstrating proficiency in math and \nscience when in fact they are not.\n  For example, a recent Trends in International Mathematics and Science \nStudy, the largest and most comprehensive comparative international \nstudy of education, found that 12th graders in the U.S. ranked 21st out \nof 40 industrialized nations on general math and science knowledge. In \naddition, just one in three of America's college graduates earn degrees \nin math, science, and engineering while two in three college graduates \nof other countries do so. We must act now to improve education and \nresearch in math and science if America is to retain leadership of the \nglobal economy in the 21st century.\n  The Mathematics and Science Consistency Act will help States to raise \ntheir standards, invest in high-quality teaching through the collection \nof best practices, and ensure that a world-class curriculum is \navailable to all students. I am hopeful that my Senate colleagues from \nboth sides of the aisle will join me today to move this legislation to \nthe floor without delay.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WEBB:\n  S. 759. A bill to prohibit the use of funds for military operations \nin Iran; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwill prohibit the use of funds for military operations in Iran without \ncongressional authorization. The purpose of this legislation is to \nrestore a proper balance between the executive and legislative branches \nwhen it comes to the commencement of military activities.\n  I have taken great care in the preparation of this bill to ensure it \nwill not in any way prevent our military forces from carrying out their \ntactical responsibilities in places such as Iraq and in the \ninternational waters off of Iran's coast.\n  I want to put up a chart. These are the exceptions that are clearly \noutlined in this bill: The legislation allows American forces to \ndirectly respond to attacks or possible attacks that might be initiated \nfrom Iran as well as those that might be begun elsewhere and then carry \nover into Iranian territory; the so-called hot pursuit exception. I \nhave also excluded operations relating to intelligence gathering.\n  The major function of this legislation is to prevent this \nadministration from commencing unprovoked military activities against \nIran without the approval of the Congress. The legislation accomplishes \nthis goal through the\n\n[[Page S2602]]\n\nproper constitutional process of prohibiting all funding for such an \nendeavor.\n  Unlike the current situation in Iraq, where cutting off funds might \nimpede or interrupt ongoing operations, this legislation denies funding \nthat would be necessary to begin such operations against Iran in the \nfirst place.\n  In the past 2 weeks, we have seen a fresh willingness on the part of \nthis administration to pursue new approaches for a regional settlement \nthat will eventually allow the United States to withdraw our forces \nfrom Iraq and also increase stability in the Middle East. I commend \nSecretary of State Rice and Secretary of Defense Gates for their \nefforts in bringing about what seems to be the beginning of a clear and \nmuch needed course correction.\n  It is particularly significant that Iran and Syria have been invited \nto participate and that the United States will join in the upcoming \nregional meetings regarding Iraq. These upcoming meetings will offer \nmany different countries the opportunity to address legitimate concerns \nand to emphasize mutual interests. I am hopeful it will open the door \nfor a different kind of dialogue with Iran.\n  Despite its newfound level of influence in Iraq, it is not in Iran's \nbest interest to see Iraq disintegrate into anarchy. Iran also has \nchallenges with its own sectarian groups, not the least of which are \nthe Kurds. Al-Qaida represents a threat to Iran as well, and it is not \nin Iran's interest to see this terrorist movement gain even more power. \nFree and open access to the Strait of Hormuz also is vital to Iran's \neconomy given its overwhelming reliance on oil exports.\n  As this regional conference approaches, the rhetoric with respect to \npossible Iranian activities inside Iraq continues, and the increases to \nour naval and missile defense presence in the gulf remain. The \nadministration's past failure to engage with Iran diplomatically in a \nmeaningful way, coupled with what Iran could perceive as preparations \nfor a military strike, creates a potent brew that easily could lead to \nmiscalculation on both sides.\n  The 1988 incident with the USS Vincennes comes to mind, when an \noverly aggressive commanding officer, operating inside Iranian \nterritorial waters, according to a subsequent admission by Joint Chiefs \nof Staff Chairman Admiral Crowe, shot down commercial passenger \naircraft Iran Air Flight 655.\n  These circumstances--the stated desire of many connected to this \nadministration to invade Iran, the saber-rattling rhetoric, the \nstrategic miscalculations in Iraq--call for this Congress to formalize \nan historic mandate that in recent years seems to have been lost to the \npublic's understanding. Quite simply, it is the constitutional \nobligation of the administration to obtain congressional approval in \norder to commence military action against another country, except under \nvery limited circumstances. This is the very process our Founding \nFathers envisioned.\n  In fact, the records from the Constitutional Convention in August \n1787 make this abundantly clear. There was much debate during this \nconvention regarding how much authority should be in the hands of the \nPresident with respect to actually initiating military action. The \nConvention's participants carefully decided the President should not be \ngiven the power to decide with whom this Nation should go to war or to \nundertake aggressive actions without the consent of Congress. The \nPresident's powers to initiate military action were to be for the \npurpose of repelling sudden attacks--and this is the language I have \nused in this legislation.\n  As Constitutional Convention delegate James Wilson explained to the \nPennsylvania ratifying convention:\n\n       This system will not hurry us into war, it is calculated to \n     guard against it. It will not be in the power of a single \n     man, or a single body of men, to involve us in such distress.\n\n  To state the obvious, Iran is not Iraq. The President has no \nauthority to begin unilateral military operations against Iran. In this \nregard, I strongly urge my colleagues to consider that the issue before \nus is not simply policies with respect to Iran but the proper \nprocedures with respect to how we as a government lead the United \nStates.\n  This is far less a matter of possible differences between Republicans \nand Democrats than it is our mutual concern for protecting the rightful \nplace of the legislative branch in determining the interests of the \ncountry and the possible consequences of further military action. In \nthis regard, I point out that the principal sponsor of similar \nlegislation in the other body is Congressman Walter Jones, a \nRepublican, from North Carolina.\n  On the one hand, the administration assures us it has no intention of \nlaunching military operations against Iran. On the other, the \nadministration tells us all options remain on the table, at a time when \nour military buildup in the region continues to grow rapidly. While we \nsee encouraging diplomatic initiatives with respect to Iraq, it is \nimportant that we clarify formally the perimeter of our immediate \nmilitary interests in the Middle East.\n  It is time we move forward to end our military involvement in Iraq, \nand the path to doing so is not to widen the war into Iran. Proper \nrobust diplomacy will enable us to bring greater stability to the \nregion, to remove the American military from Iraq, to increase our \nability to defeat the forces of international terrorism, and, finally, \nto focus on the true strategic challenges that face us around the \nworld.\n\n  I hope my colleagues will take note of the news articles today in the \nmedia around the world that show China again has increased its defense \nbudget by double digits last year to the tune of 18 percent. These are \nstrategic challenges the United States is ignoring at its peril as it \nremains paralyzed in the Middle East.\n  I believe the American people will welcome this legislation. This \nadministration has used force recklessly, choosing the military option \nagain and again, while never matching the quality of our military's \nperformance with robust, creative diplomacy. Furthermore, the \nPresident's signing statement accompanying the 2002 congressional \nresolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq indicates that this \nadministration believes it possesses the broadest imaginable authority \nto commence military action without the consent of the Congress.\n  In signing that 2002 Iraq resolution, the President denied that the \nCongress has the power to affect his decisions when it comes to the use \nof our military. He shrugged off this resolution, stating that on the \nquestion of a threat posed by Iraq, his views and those of the Congress \nmerely happen to be the same. He characterized the resolution as simply \na gesture of additional support rather than as having any legitimate \nauthority. He stated, and I think it is worth noting:\n\n       My signing this resolution does not constitute any change \n     in the President's constitutional authority to use force to \n     deter, prevent, or respond to aggression or other threats to \n     the United States interests.\n\n  This is a sweeping assertion of powers that leaves out virtually \nnothing. It is a far different matter than repelling an immediate \nattack or conducting a war that has been authorized by the Congress. \nLet us match up a couple of those words. The President is saying, for \ninstance, he possesses the authority to use force to deter threats to \nU.S. interests. How does one use force to deter a threat rather than \nresponding to it? What kind of U.S. interest is worthy of the use of \nforce? Most importantly, how do these vague terms fit into the \nhistorically accepted notions of a Commander in Chief's power to repel \nattacks or to conduct military operations once they have been approved \nby the Congress?\n  During our recent hearings in the Senate Committee on Foreign \nRelations, I asked both the Secretary of State, and the Deputy \nSecretary of State during his confirmation hearings, for a \nclarification of this paragraph. My question was whether this \nadministration believes it has the authority to conduct unilateral \nmilitary operations against Iran in the absence of a direct attack or a \ncompelling immediate threat, without the consent of the Congress. Both \nwrote me lengthy letters in reply but neither could give me a clear \nresponse.\n  The situation we now face is that the administration repeatedly \nstates it seeks no war with Iran at the same time it claims the \nauthority to begin one, and at the same time it continues a military \nbuildup in the region. The legislation I introduce today is intended to \nclarify this ambiguity. In so doing, the Congress will be properly \nrestating its constitutional relationship\n\n[[Page S2603]]\n\nwith the executive branch, the Congress will be reinstituting its \nhistorical role as it relates to the conduct of foreign policy, and the \nCongress will be reassuring the American people that there will be no \nmore shooting from the hip when it comes to the gravely serious \nquestion of when we send our military people into harm's way.\n  I emphasize that this bill will not take any military operations off \nthe table nor will it tie the hands of the administration if our \nmilitary forces are actually attacked from Iranian soil or its \nterritorial waters or by forces that retreat into Iranian territory. \nNor does this legislation let Iran off the hook in terms of our \ninsistence that Iran become a more responsible nation, including our \npositions regarding Iran's nuclear program and Iran's recognition of \nIsrael's right to exist.\n  I was one of the early voices warning that in terms of national \nsecurity Iran was a far greater threat than Iraq. This was one of the \nreasons I opposed the invasion of Iraq in the first place. All of the \noptions regarding Iran remain on the table. The question is in what \ncontext these options should be debated, alongside other options \ndesigned to eventually open Iran and bring it responsibly into the \nworld community. In my view, and in terms of the constitutional \nprocess, absent a direct attack or a clearly imminent threat, the place \nfor that debate is here in the open forum of the Congress and not in \nsome closed-door meeting at the White House.\n  It is my hope we can take up this necessary legislation either in the \nformat in which I have introduced it today or as an amendment to the \n2007 supplemental appropriations bill, which we will consider in the \nnext few weeks. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle, and I would welcome their support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n        Domenici, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Kennedy.

Mr. President, innovation and economic competitiveness \nhave emerged as top priorities for this country. A number of reports \nhave detailed the Nation's need to address our investment in education \nand science. The Augustine Commission's ``Rising Above the Gathering \nStorm'' is often citied as the clarion call to action.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, I am proud to join my colleagues from the Energy and \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committees in introducing the \nAmerica COMPETES Act. This bill was produced in a bipartisan manner \nthat brought together these three Senate committees.\n  The Commerce Committee plays a critical role in ensuring this \ncountry's economic and commercial health. We have expertise that \ntouches industries ranging from telecommunications to transportation; \nfrom the safety of the home to the security of the homeland; and from \nmarine containers to marine mammals. We have brought this broad \nperspective in our efforts to improve the country's investment in the \nvital components that make us successful.\n  At the heart of this investment is education. Education is the \nfoundation upon which scientific research and discoveries are made. \nThis bill uses educational programs to inspire students from \nkindergarten through graduate school to pursue math and science. It \nalso ensures that the Nation's enterprise research is well funded and \nfocused on the needs of the Nation.\n  This bill would double funding for the National Science Foundation \n(NSF) and significantly increase funding for the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology (NIST). We were also able to include several \nprovisions related to ocean and atmospheric research and education. The \nocean truly is the last frontier on Earth, and ocean research and \ntechnology may have broad implications for improving health and \nunderstanding our environment.\n  It is vital that we recognize the importance of our oceans. The U.S. \nCommission on Ocean Policy recommended\n\n[[Page S2625]]\n\na number of ways to improve ocean education, basic research, and \ntechnological innovation. We need to follow through on these \nrecommendations in order to provide young people with the opportunity \nto use a readily available resource for learning and inspiration.\n  This bill is a critical first step in this country's journey to \nanswering the challenges that lay ahead. We must make the necessary \ninvestments today to realize the returns in the near future. I support \nthis legislation and look forward to its thorough consideration before \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, families across America are facing \nserious challenges in today's global economy. The value of their wages \nis declining, the cost of living is going up, and many of their jobs \nare being shipped overseas.\n  We must respond to this challenge to ensure that our citizens can \nstill achieve the American dream. We have the best workers in the \nworld, and we must prepare them to compete and succeed in the global \neconomy.\n  America has long been at the forefront in innovation, invention, and \neducation. But other countries are catching up and surpassing us.\n  America's 15 year olds scored below average in math and science \nliteracy compared to the youth of other developed nations on the most \nrecent international assessment by the Programme for International \nStudent Assessment.\n  We are losing ground in overall high school and college graduation \nrates. The U.S. has dropped below the average graduation rate for OECD \ncountries. Out of 24 nations, the U.S. ranks 14th, just ahead of \nPortugal.\n  Since 1975, the U.S. has dropped from 3rd to 15th place in the \nproduction of scientists and engineers.\n  Federal investment in research and development is essential to keep \nus competitive, but federal dollars have been shrinking as a share of \nthe economy. Funding for government research programs has fallen in \nreal terms and is less than in 2004.\n  At the same time, fast-growing economies such as China, Ireland, and \nSouth Korea are realizing the potential for economic growth that comes \nwith investing in innovation. China's investment in research and \ndevelopment rose from $12.4 billion in 1991 to $84.6 billion in 2003, \nan average increase of 17 percent a year. Over the same period, the \nincrease in U.S. investment averaged only 4 to 5 percent annually.\n  Study after study tells us that we need major new investments in \neducation and in research and development to stay ahead. We cannot just \ntinker at the margins and expect to retain our leadership in the global \neconomy. We have a responsibility to make the investments that are \nnecessary to our progress--a responsibility to our people, our economy, \nour nation, and our national security.\n  Last year, the Council on Competitiveness urged a focus on lifelong \nskill development--through elementary, secondary and higher education, \nand workforce training and support, as essential to keeping America on \nthe cutting edge of innovation.\n  The recent report by the National Academy of Sciences, ``Rising Above \nthe Gathering Storm,'' emphasized these recommendations. Two of the \nreport's four major recommendations involved education as the solution \nto meeting the global challenge. The report set out a broad roadmap for \nkeeping America competitive, but it prioritized investment in education \nover all other recommendations.\n  The National Association of Manufacturers has also issued a report \nurging renewed focus on education and training to keep American \nbusinesses competitive.\n  Last week, the National Governors Association released its \n``Innovation America'' plan, which outlines opportunities for Federal \ninvestment to help spur innovation in the states. Here again, improving \neducation and access to high quality job training take center stage.\n  It is clear that we must act, and today we are taking a step toward \nputting America back on the right track.\n  I am pleased to join a number of my colleagues today in reintroducing \nthe ``America COMPETES Act,'' or the ``America Creating Opportunities \nto Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and \nScience Act.'' The bill is identical to legislation we introduced last \nyear, but the need for action is even more important today to keep \nAmerica competitive in the years to come.\n  The legislation responds to many of the recommendations in the \n``Gathering Storm'' and other recent reports; it takes important steps \nto encourage innovation in America as a way to create jobs and move our \neconomy forward. Often, as we know, it is federally funded research \nthat primes the pump for technological, medical and scientific \nbreakthroughs. The bill will double basic research funding by the \nNational Science Foundation by 2011. It also puts us on a strong course \nto doubling basic research funding by the Department of Energy.\n  In addition, the legislation creates a President's Council on \nInnovation and Competitiveness, based on successful models being used \nin established and emerging economies in Europe and Asia. The Council \nwill bring together the heads of federal agencies with leaders in \nbusiness and academia to develop a comprehensive agenda to promote \ninnovation. Japan for some time has had a similar council, and \nIreland--the Celtic Tiger--has already had extraordinary success in \nexpanding its R strength since it established its council two years \nago.\n  The bill also strengthens programs at college and universities to \nencourage renewed interest in nuclear science. Massachusetts has long \nbeen a leader in nuclear research. There are fewer than three dozen \nlicensed research reactors in the United States, and three of them are \nlocated at Massachusetts universities--University of Massachusetts \nLowell, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and MIT. These colleges will \nhave a vital role as nuclear science expands, and this bill will help \nexpand their programs and establish new ones to meet the growing \ndemand.\n  We must also make the research and development tax credit permanent. \nThe incentive provided by the credit has led to quality jobs, better \nand safer products, greater productivity and a stronger and more robust \nnational economy. A growing number of countries recognize the \nimportance of research and development spending to future economic \ngrowth, and they now offer more generous R tax incentives than the \nUnited States. The top 6 pharmaceutical companies, and American high \ntech companies like Microsoft, Intel and GE have all opened advanced \nR facilities in India. We must give American companies the certainty \nthat our tax incentives will continue year after year and will not \nexpire, so that they can choose to maintain these high-skilled jobs \nhere at home, to keep America at the cutting edge as a leader in \ninnovation in the global economy.\n  R investments also depend on a talented pool of well-trained \nindividuals who can make discoveries and scientific breakthroughs. Jobs \nin science and engineering are expected to increase 70 percent faster \nthan those in other fields over the next 6 years.\n  To ensure that Americans are well-trained for these jobs, we must \nimprove education at all levels--from the very early years in a child's \nlife all the way through doctoral study and beyond--especially in math, \nscience, engineering and technology.\n  International comparisons of student achievement show that the United \nStates is slipping behind other countries, but detailed analysis shows \nthat the picture is more complex. The real problem lies in the serious \nand pervasive achievement gap in this country between higher income \nstudents and lower income students and between white students and \nstudents of color.\n  On the most recent test comparing student achievement in industrial \nnations, white students in the United States performed better than the \naverage for all countries in both math literacy and problem-solving, \nwhile their Hispanic and African American peers did worse. Low-income \nstudents in the U.S. performed worse than their high-income peers, and \nalso performed worse than other low-income students in over half of the \ndeveloped countries surveyed.\n  If we can close this achievement gap, and guarantee all children in \nthis country a world-class education, we can put America back at the \ntop of the list. To do so, we need to renew and improve upon the \nimportant reforms in the No Child Left Behind Act this year. As we\n\n[[Page S2626]]\n\ndo so, we must make a strong commitment to adequately fund those \nreforms.\n  We must also invest in teachers. Research shows that having a high \nquality teacher for five years in a row can overcome the average 7th \ngrade mathematics achievement gap between lower income and higher \nincome children.\n  But almost half of math classes taught in high poverty and high \nminority schools are taught by teachers without a college major or \nminor in math or a related field. The problem is even more serious in \nmiddle schools--70 percent of math classes in these schools are taught \nby a teacher who doesn't even have a minor in math.\n  Our bill recognizes and responds to the critical need to recruit and \ntrain high quality math, science, technology and engineering teachers \nto teach in schools with the greatest need, so that we can begin to \nclose the achievement gap and ensure that all American students can \ncompete on a level playing field with their peers in other nations.\n  The bill provides a 10-fold increase in the Robert Noyce Teacher \nScholarship Program at the National Science Foundation to recruit math, \nscience, engineering and technology students and professionals to \nbecome teachers in high-need school districts.\n  It provides grants to institutions of higher education to create \nundergraduate programs that integrate the study of math, science, \nengineering, or critical need foreign language with teacher education, \nmodeled on the successful U-Teach program at the University of Texas. \nIt also helps institutions create part-time master's degree programs to \nimprove the content knowledge and teaching skills of current teachers. \nIn both of these programs, universities would partner with high-need \nschool districts to ensure that these resources go where they are \nneeded most.\n  The bill expands the Teacher Institutes for the 21st Century Program \nat the National Science Foundation to provide cutting-edge summer \nprofessional development programs for teachers who teach in high-need \nschools. It also creates a summer institute program in the Department \nof Energy to strengthen the math and science teaching skills of \nelementary and secondary school teachers.\n  Recruitment and training of good teachers are important, but so is \nretention of good teachers. Each year, over 200,000 teachers leave the \nprofession--6 percent of the teaching workforce. High attrition rates \nmean that one of every two teachers hired will completely drop out of \nteaching within 5 years-just when they have gained the experience \nneeded to consistently improve student achievement.\n  To be successful in closing the achievement gap, we must also do more \nto see that teachers have an incentive to stay in their classrooms once \nthey are there.\n  We should provide financial incentives--through fellowships or salary \nincreases--to teachers who commit to teach in the highest need schools, \nwhere the unique challenges make the schools the hardest to staff. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues as the bill moves forward to \nadd this critical component to the effort.\n  In addition to providing a high quality teacher in every classroom, \nwe must also ensure that children in low-income school districts have \naccess to the same college preparatory classes that more affluent \nschool districts are able to provide--and, importantly, that they have \nthe preparation they need to succeed in those classes. To do so, the \nbill expands access to Advanced Placement and International \nBaccalaureate classes as well as pre-AP and pre-IB courses, especially \nin high need schools, and creates a program to improve instruction in \nmath for elementary and middle school students and provide targeted \nhelp to students struggling with the subject.\n  The bill also addresses the critical need to ensure our education \nsystem is preparing students for the challenges they will face after \ngraduation from high school.\n  According to recent research, the nation loses over $3.7 billion a \nyear in the cost of remedial education and lost earning potential \nbecause students are not adequately prepared to enter college when they \nleave high school.\n  For students directly entering the workforce, 60 percent of employers \nin a survey conducted by the National Association of Manufacturers said \nthat a high school diploma did not adequately prepare a typical student \nwith even basic skills to qualify for an entry level job.\n  Many states have recognized the need to better align elementary and \nsecondary school standards, curricula, and assessments with the demands \nof college, the 21st century workforce and the Armed Forces. Our bill \nprovides grants to assist states in those efforts. The grants would \nsupport state P-16 councils that bring together leaders in the early \neducation, K-12, and higher education communities, in the business \nsector, and in the military to improve the rigor of elementary and \nsecondary education and prepare students for the postsecondary \nchallenges they will face.\n  These provisions will help spur the development of more rigorous \nstandards, as well as innovative curricula that engage our children in \nlearning and inspire a new generation of scientists and engineers. It \nwill assist states in the work they are doing to create new disciplines \nin engineering and technology at the elementary school level to teach \nstudents the practical applications of math and science. The National \nCenter for Technological Literacy at the Museum of Science in Boston is \nat the forefront of these efforts.\n  In addition to the education programs at the Department of Education \nand the National Science Foundation, the legislation relies on the \nresources of the Department of Energy to assist in the effort to \nimprove math and science education. The National Labs at the Department \nof Energy can have a critical role in these efforts, and so can the \nmore than 300 colleges and universities across the country conducting \nresearch supported by the Department of Energy. I appreciate my \ncolleagues' efforts to ensure that the resources of the Department of \nEnergy are used to enhance educational opportunities for children not \nonly in the states that host National Labs, but across the country.\n  It is also becoming increasingly important for students to become \nexposed to and immersed in critical foreign languages and cultures. In \nrecent years, foreign language needs have significantly increased \nthroughout the public and private sector due to the presence of a wider \nrange of security threats, the emergence of new nation states, and the \nglobalization of the U.S. economy.\n  Currently, the U.S. government uses tens of thousands of employees \nwith foreign language skills in 100 languages and more than 80 Federal \nagencies. In addition, American businesses increasingly need employees \nexperienced in foreign languages and international cultures to manage a \nculturally diverse workforce.\n  For students to become proficient in these critical foreign \nlanguages, they must have access to a sustained course of study, \nbeginning in the early grades.\n  But currently, only one-third of students in grades 7-12 and a mere 5 \npercent of elementary school students study a foreign language.\n  Even fewer study critical need foreign languages. Only about 24,000 \nof approximately 54 million elementary and secondary school children in \nthe United States are studying Chinese. In contrast, more than 200 \nmillion children in China study English--a compulsory subject for all \nChinese primary school students.\n  The bill begins to address these needs by providing grants to \ninstitutions of higher education and local educational agencies to work \nin partnerships to create programs of study in critical foreign \nlanguages for students from elementary school through postsecondary \neducation.\n  These programs and investments will help prepare our students to \ncompete in the 21st century, but if we are serious about keeping \nAmerica competitive, there is still more we can--and must--do.\n  A college degree is fast becoming the price of admission to \nparticipation in the global economy. Today, over 60 percent of jobs \nrequire some postsecondary training, and the number is rising rapidly. \nSuch jobs bring higher pay as well. A recent study by the Organisation \nfor Economic Co-operation and Development shows that in the United \nStates, earnings of people with a post-secondary degree are 72\n\n[[Page S2627]]\n\npercent higher on average than those with only a high school diploma.\n  But with soaring costs and stagnant financial aid, college is \nincreasingly out of reach for students and families. Research shows \nthat 400,000 students a year do not go to a four-year college because \nthey cannot afford it. 170,000 do not go to college at all.\n  When our troops returned home from World War II, we created the GI \nBill and sent them to college to learn the skills they would need in \nthe changing world. The pay off to the nation was immense. The economy \nreaped an estimated $7 in benefit for every dollar invested in that \neffort.\n  In recent decades however, federal grant aid has dwindled and the \ngrants don't go as far as they used to. Thirty years ago, seventy-seven \npercent of the federal assistance provided to students was in the form \nof grants, but in recent years the number has dropped to twenty \npercent.\n  With college costs skyrocketing, the value of the Pell Grant has not \nkept pace. To ensure the prosperity of our families and the nation, we \nmust open the doors of college to all by restoring the Pell Grant as \nthe foundation of the student aid system.\n  Last year, Congress squandered an opportunity to significantly \nincrease aid for low income students. The Senate passed a bill that \nwould have immediately increased the Pell grant from $4,050 to $4,500. \nBut this increase was rejected, and the funds were used instead to pay \nfor tax giveaways for the wealthiest Americans.\n  Last month, under the new Democratic leadership, Congress made a \nstrong down payment to help low-income families afford college by \nraising the maximum Pell grant for the first time since 2003 from \n$4,050 to $4,310.\n  I know many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle agree that \nhigher education is the key to keeping America competitive, and I look \nforward to working with them to build on this down payment as we \nreauthorize the Higher Education Act this year to ensure that the cost \nof college is not a barrier to full participation in the new economy.\n  We need to reform the federal student aid system to redirect \nexcessive lender subsidies into additional help and support for \nstudents and families, including increased need-based aid, making \nstudent loans more manageable, and providing loan forgiveness for \nindividuals in public sector careers.\n  We must also do more to address the devastating impacts of the global \neconomy on American workers and their families.\n  Our workers are facing global competition that is often fundamentally \nunfair, but this bill does nothing to level the playing field or to \nhelp ease the burden of their transition to the global economy. To \ntruly improve our national competitiveness, we must address all aspects \nof this challenge. We cannot continue to ignore the plight of working \nAmericans.\n  First, we need to level the playing field in the competition for good \njobs. Americans have nothing to fear from competition that's fair. But \nit's not fair when Americans are competing with foreign workers who \nlack basic protections such as child labor laws, a minimum wage, or the \nright to organize. It's not fair when U.S. companies cut costs by \nexploiting and abusing foreign workers.\n  We need to exercise global leadership in promoting fair wages and \nsafe working conditions for workers around the world, reward companies \nthat treat their foreign workforces fairly, and be a strong voice in \nsanctioning those countries that will not play by the rules.\n  Beyond these basic steps to level the playing field, we owe a \nparticular duty to American workers who are losing their jobs because \nof trade. We all benefit from the lower prices and variety of products \nthat globalization provides, but many of our most vulnerable workers \nare paying the price. We've lost nearly 3 million manufacturing jobs \nsince 2001, and service sector jobs are now moving overseas as well. \nThese are good, middle-class jobs, with decent wages and benefits that \nform the core of the American middle class.\n  Our response to globalization must address the disappearance of good \njobs. We must create the good jobs of the future. We must eliminate tax \nincentives for companies to ship jobs overseas. We must give fair \nwarning to workers who are at risk of losing their jobs to overseas \ncompetition, so that they can plan for their futures. We must \nstrengthen our commitment to help workers who lose their jobs to adjust \nto the new economy, with well-funded training and income assistance \nprograms that ease the transition to new employment.\n  Fulfilling our commitment to American workers also demands that we \ngive them their fair share of the economic growth that globalization \nbrings. Both houses of Congress have now voted overwhelmingly to raise \nthe minimum wage to $7.25 an hour, and that vital legislation should \nreach the President's desk soon. But that's only a first step. We need \nto do much more to promote good jobs and ensure that workers get their \nfair share of economic growth. We also must give workers a stronger \nvoice in the new economy by protecting their right to organize and form \na union.\n  If we truly want to be competitive in the global economy, we need to \naddress these challenges facing the American workforce head on. Our \nemployees deserve greater job security in the present, and better job \nopportunities in the future. I hope that the same bipartisan coalition \nthat has worked together so effectively on this competitiveness bill \ncan also work together to address these important issues for America's \nworking families.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is not a complete package. \nWhat it does represent is the beginning of a strong commitment that we \nwill need to sustain and build on if America is to remain competitive \nin the years ahead. It's gratifying that this bill has strong \nbipartisan support, because that support is critical to ensuring that \nthese proposals become a reality.\n  Words alone will not keep America competitive. This legislation must \nbe more than a promise. I look forward to working with my colleagues as \nthe bill moves forward to ensure that Congress provides the new \ninvestments essential to fully support these important proposals.\n  Americans know how to rise to challenges and come out ahead. We've \ndone it before and we can do it again. We rose to the challenge after \nWorld War II with the GI Bill. We rose to the Soviet Union's challenge \nof Sputnik in 1957 by passing the National Defense Education Act, and \nwe went on to inspire the nation in the next decade by sending a man to \nthe moon and by doubling the federal investment in education.\n  We need the same bold commitment now to help the current generation \nmeet and master the global challenges we now face. The America COMPETES \nAct can be an effective first step. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to improve upon the bill as it moves forward and to expand \non these efforts in the months to come to make this essential \ninitiative as effective as possible.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the America \nCOMPETES Act. I am pleased to join Senators Reid and McConnell in \nintroducing this bipartisan bill that addresses the challenges in \nkeeping the U.S. competitive in the global economy. The Council on \nCompetitiveness, through their ``Innovate America'' report, and the \nNational Academies, through the ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm'' \nreport, made it clear that we owe the economic vitality of the Nation \nto the productivity of highly trained people and the innovations they \nproduce. This bill addresses recommendations in these reports to \nsupport the Nation's future health, vitality and economic prosperity.\n  Only 29 percent of Americans believe the United States has the most \ninnovative economy in the world. Nearly half choose China or Japan \ninstead. Why? The No. 1 reason cited by Americans is that these other \ncountries are more committed to their education, their youth or their \nschools. We need this to change.\n  This bill addresses new and expanded approaches to science education \nand research to meet the future needs of our children and the Nation. \nTests show that U.S. students are behind other developed nations in \nmath and science. We also found out in February that seniors in high \nschool cannot read as well as seniors back in 1992. This is telling us \nthat in some areas we are moving backwards. A good education is\n\n[[Page S2628]]\n\nevery child's way to realize his and her American dream. We must keep \nmoving forward.\n  We need to consider how we can help our Nation's top universities \nlead some of their best and brightest students, especially in STEM and \ncritical foreign languages, into successful teaching careers. This bill \nencourages integrated college math, science, engineering and foreign \nlanguage programs with teacher development programs to produce \ncertified, knowledgeable teachers in areas with critical needs. The \nresulting teachers will have the teaching credentials and, importantly, \nthe necessary content expertise in STEM disciplines with the hope of \nimproving student interest and achievement in STEM areas and critical \nforeign languages.\n  New teachers are but a small portion of those teaching in STEM \nclassrooms each year across the country. These new instructors need \nsupport and mentoring from established teachers. This bill supports \nmaster's degree programs for existing teachers seeking to enhance their \ncontent knowledge, teaching skills and leadership in STEM and foreign \nlanguages. Teachers in these programs study part-time over 2 to 3 years \nto obtain master's degrees. These programs also prepare them for \nleadership roles in their schools through participation in, for \nexample, mentoring activities, math and science curriculum \nenhancements, teacher development, and student achievement evaluations \nand assessments.\n  It is troubling that many students with their newly-obtained high \nschool diplomas find themselves unprepared for college or the \nworkforce. It is time to ensure that high schools prepare their \nstudents for the future. To do this right, States must start aligning \nwhat children learn starting in kindergarten, or earlier, to meet the \nevolving higher education and business needs for the 21st century and \nbeyond.\n  High schools are not preparing students for college or the workforce. \nWe know that middle and high school students engaged in challenging \ncoursework attend and succeed in college at a greater rate than those \nwho follow programs of study without rigorous content. What happens to \nthe others? To start, more than a quarter of college students end up \ntaking remedial classes. The percentage is much higher, more than two \nin five, at institutions with large minority enrollments. We need to \nprepare for the future through college-ready course content and \nappropriate assessment standards all the way up through our high school \nand continue that rigor until completion of college. I am pleased that \nthis legislation contains many of the components of S. 109-2337, the \nCollege Pathways Act of 2006, a bill I introduced to increase access to \npostsecondary education through better alignment of curriculum and \nenhanced data systems.\n  High-quality data systems are also critical to improve schools and \nstudent outcomes. Accountability for high school graduation numbers and \ndrop-out rates is important to addressing education reform in our high \nschools. States and schools need data systems to trace successful \neducational outcomes back to specific programs, coursework and \ninterventions. They need to know what works and what doesn't work.\n  Unique identifier for students from pre-kindergarten through college \nwill permit States to analyze school progress. Test results, grades, \ncollege-readiness assessments, assigned teachers and whether students \nneeded remedial courses in college can all go into the data system. \nThis information should provide feedback to make needed improvements \nwhile expanding and rewarding areas of success.\n  The legislation specifies that the unique student identifier could be \na bar code. That is appropriate. Bar codes and scanners were created \nand expanded in the U.S. in part through federally funded research. The \nNational Science Foundation, NSF, funded research on scanners starting \nback in the 1970s that made accurate bar codes a reality. Few realized \nat the time the eventual widespread use of the technology. But this is \nan example of the kinds of basic research investments in innovation and \ningenuity that drive much of our economy.\n  NSF is the principal agency sustaining basic research in all science \nand engineering fields. Basic research outcomes have led to many \nimportant innovations, stimulating economic growth and improving the \nquality of life for all Americans. This legislation increases the \nNation's investment in this innovation by doubling the overall funding \nfor NSF from approximately $5.6 billion in 2006 to $11.2 billion in \n2011. NSF's three strategic goals for its portfolio are discovery, \nlearning, and research infrastructure. These goals match up directly \nwith the three primary areas of the America Competes Act: increased \nresearch investment, STEM education, and innovative infrastructure.\n  To encourage more students to enter technical professions, this \nlegislation increases Federal support for STEM graduate fellowships and \ntrainee programs by expanding the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship \nProgram by 1,250 fellowships. These fellowships follow the students \npermitting the greatest flexibility in choosing graduate programs that \nbest fit their needs and interests.\n  We also expand the NSF Integrated Graduate Education and Research \nTraineeship, IGERT, program by 1,250 new traineeships. In the IGERT \nprogram, grants are awarded to universities to develop cross-\ndisciplinary training programs for students in areas including science, \nmath, engineering, and policy. The program is intended to produce a \nchange by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and \ntraining that reach across traditional disciplinary boundaries. It is \nalso intended to facilitate diversity in student participation, and to \ncontribute to a world-class, broadly inclusive, and globally engaged \nscience and engineering workforce.\n  This legislation further addresses the issue of improving talent in \nscientific disciplines by expanding the existing STEM Talent Expansion \nProgram, STEP, to the scope originally intended. The STEP, or Tech \nTalent program, which I first proposed in October 2001, provides \ncompetitive grants to undergraduate institutions to develop new methods \nof increasing the number of students earning degrees in science, math, \nand engineering. It is essential that we increase the number of college \ngraduates with the skills to contribute to the science and technology \nworkforce, yet this program has never been fully funded.\n  The Department of Energy's Office of Science is the principal Federal \nagency for research in high energy physics, nuclear physics, and fusion \nenergy sciences. This legislation puts the Office of Science on a \ndoubling track, over 10 years, reaching more than $5.2 billion in 2011. \nWe create important educational opportunities through Centers of \nExcellence in Mathematics and Science. These centers bring together our \npremier National Laboratories as partners with high-need high schools. \nNational Laboratories also will host summer teacher institutes and will \nprovide expert assistance to teachers at specialty schools in math and \nscience.\n  The bill also creates an ``Innovation Acceleration Grants'' program \nto stimulate high-risk research by setting a goal for Federal research \nagencies to allocate no less than 8 percent of their current R \nbudgets to breakthrough research--the kind of research that gave us \nfiber optics, the Internet and countless other technologies relied on \nevery day in this country and around the world. We anticipate this \nfunding would be used for ``grand challenges'' and other transformation \nresearch at the frontiers of discovery and innovation. We must continue \nto encourage the groundbreaking experimentation and longer term outlook \nthat made this country great.\n  I am pleased to join my colleagues in this bipartisan effort to \naddress the science, technology and education needs that will fuel \ninnovation and continue to drive American growth and prosperity. I urge \nmy colleagues to cosponsor this legislation and support its passage.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am delighted to join our \ndistinguished Majority and Minority Leaders in introducing and \ncosponsoring the America COMPETES Act. This is an essential and \nimportant first step in addressing critical challenges facing our \nNation in an increasingly competitive global economy. America must be a \nleader in scientific research and education. It is in the best interest \nof both our national and economic security.\n\n[[Page S2629]]\n\n  This bill renews and expands our national focus on strengthening key \nareas of research, education and innovation. It is the product of a \ntruly bipartisan effort, undertaken with the blessing and encouragement \nof the Senate leadership and by the leadership of the three principal \ncommittees with jurisdiction over these matters: the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation, the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources, and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions. Mr. President, I am proud to be part of this bipartisan \ninitiative to provide new resources to support these competitiveness \nprograms.\n  This legislation increases research investment by doubling the \nauthorized funding levels for the National Science Foundation (NSF) \nfrom approximately $5.6 billion in fiscal year 2007 to $11.2 billion in \nfiscal year 2011. It doubles funding for the Department of Energy's \nOffice of Science over 5 years, from $3.6 billion in fiscal year 2006 \nto over $5.2 billion in fiscal year 2011.\n  Another vital focus of the bill is to strengthen educational \nopportunities in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and \ncritical foreign languages. It authorizes competitive grants to States \nto promote better coordination of elementary and secondary education \nwith the knowledge and skills needed for success in post-secondary \neducation, the workforce and the U.S. Armed Forces. Another key \nemphasis is strengthening the skills of thousands of math and science \nteachers through support for the Teachers Institutes for the 21st \nCentury Program at NSF.\n  As Ranking Member of the Space, Aeronautics and Related Sciences \nSubcommittee of the Commerce Committee, and a member of the Science, \nTechnology and Innovation Subcommittee, I am especially pleased that \nthis legislation ensures that both NASA and NSF are able to expand \ntheir strong traditional roles in fostering technological and \nscientific excellence. The language we have crafted increases essential \nNASA funding to support basic research and foster new innovation by \ncalling for full use of existing budget authority that we provided \nwithin the 2005 NASA Authorization Act. Under the terms of this \nlegislation and the previous authorization, the Congress could provide \nan additional $1.4 billion dollars in fiscal year 2008 for application \ntowards these activities, above what has been requested. By directing \nNASA's full participation in inter-agency efforts for competitiveness \nand innovation, this legislation points the way for the Administration \nto now make use of that additional authority in supporting projects \nthat can help meet these important competitiveness and innovation \ngoals.\n  This bill represents an important first step in our efforts to meet \nthe increasing challenges to our Nation's competitive posture. I \nencourage all of my colleagues to join in cosponsoring this bill and \nworking with us at the appropriate time to ensure its passage by this \nbody and its enactment into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. McCain, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 762. A bill to include dehydroepiandrosterone as an anabolic \nsteroid; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President. I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwould further expand the definition of anabolic steroids under the \nControlled Substances Act to include DHEA. I am pleased to be joined in \nthis bi-partisan effort by my colleagues Senator McCain and Senator \nDurbin.\n  Eight years ago, baseball fans everywhere were witness to history as \nRoger Maris' 37 year old single season record of 61 home-runs was \nfinally broken. Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa captivated the public as \ntheir chase for the home-run record unfolded in living rooms \neverywhere. Three years later, Barry Bonds of the San Francisco Giants \nset a new record when he hit an unthinkable 73 home-runs in just one \nseason. Now, with another Major League Baseball season just around the \ncorner, the 42 year old Barry Bonds is on the brink of breaking the all \ntime home-run record held by the great Hank Aaron.\n  A lot has changed since that historic 1998 season though. We now know \nthat Mark McGwire had been taking an over the counter testosterone \nboosting supplement known as ``Andro'' at the time he broke the home-\nrun record. A few years later, an anonymous phone call sparked what has \nsince become the largest doping scandal in professional sports history. \nThe BALCO scandal as it is famously known today, has exposed numerous \ntop athletes across a wide range of sports and continues to this day. \nIn fact, just this week, we learned that investigators found evidence \nthat testosterone and other performance enhancing drugs may have been \nillegally purchased over the internet by current and former Major \nLeague Baseball and NFL players, college athletes, high school coaches, \na former Mr. Olympia champion, and another top contender in the body \nbuilding competition.\n  The publicity generated from these doping scandals even spurred \nCongress into action. In 2004, we passed legislation expanding the list \nfrom 23 to 59 anabolic steroids that are now regulated by the DEA, \nincluding ``Andro''. Legislation has also been introduced that would \nforce Major League Baseball and other professional sports leagues, to \nstrengthen their testing procedures and set new minimum penalties for \nany violations of the policy.\n  While all this publicity has helped to raise public awareness about \nthe dangers of illegal performance enhancing drugs, much work remains \nto be done. Some recent studies appear to indicate that the use of \nillegal steroids among adolescents is beginning to decline. While this \nis good news, an alarming number of young people are still turning to \nthese dangerous drugs to improve performance, appearance, or their self \nimage.\n  Even more widespread however, is the use of over the counter \nsupplements. Many young people turn to these ``supplements'' as an \nalternative to already illegal steroids, mistakenly believing that \nbecause they are sold over the counter, they must be safe. Yet, many of \nthese over the counter ``supplements'' actually produce the same \ndangerous effects on the body as illegal steroids, some even become \nsteroids in the blood stream.\n  In the year following Mark McGwire's record breaking 70 home-run \nseason, sales of andro surged by more than 1000 percent. In 2004, we \ntook action to control sales of these dangerous drugs and protect the \nunsuspecting public. Yet as I speak today, one anabolic steroid remains \non the shelves of health stores around the country. This potentially \nharmful steroid can be bought by anyone, at any age and without \nconsulting a physician first.\n  DHEA, is a steroid hormone that when ingested in the body, is \nconverted into other more powerful steroid hormones including Andro and \nTestosterone. Both Andro and Testosterone are already controlled by the \nDEA under the Controlled Substances Act.\n  DHEA like all other steroids, may cause a number of long-term \nphysical and psychological effects. Women could experience facial hair \ngrowth, scalp hair loss, deepening of the voice, and increased girth. \nMen could experience increased blood pressure or breast enlargement. \nUnfortunately, side effects associated with hormones don't always \nappear right away. While these effects may be mild at low doses, \naccording to many experts high levels of DHEA might promote liver \ndamage and cancer of the breast or prostate over time. The truth is we \nknow very little about DHEA's long term effects.\n  In addition, because DHEA is marketed as a dietary supplement rather \nthan a medicine, companies distributing DHEA products are not required \nto prove their safety and effectiveness to the Food and Drug \nAdministration. Therefore, it is impossible to tell if these products \nare 100 percent pure or whether you are getting the same amount of DHEA \nthe label claims. In fact, in 2000, the Good Housekeeping Research \nGroup examined 8 popular DHEA products with ``antiaging'' claims and \nfound that 5 of the 8 brands sent to an independent lab for testing, \nfailed to accurately state the level of DHEA labeled on their product.\n  While often cited as an anti-aging pill, some advertisements do \nspecifically target athletes. Take for example this advertisement on \nwww.bodybuilding.com:\n\n       DHEA is HOT, and you will see why. As a pre-cursor hormone, \n     it leads to the production of other hormones. When this \n     compound\n\n[[Page S2630]]\n\n     is supplemented, it has shown to have awesome effects.\n\n  Here is another advertisement found on AST Sports Sciences,\n\n       If you're a bodybuilder, and want to increase lean body \n     mass at the expense of body fat, actual studies show this \n     supplement may significantly alter body composition, favoring \n     lean mass accrual.\n\n  DHEA is already banned by the Olympics, the World Anti-Doping Agency, \nthe National Collegiate Athletic Association, the National Football \nLeague, the National Basketball Association and minor league baseball, \nyet under current Federal law it enjoys special protections.\n  In 2005, as Major League Baseball and their steroid policy were \ncoming under increasingly heavy fire, the top medical advisor to the \nLeague turned the tables on us as lawmakers, referring to DHEA and \naccusing us of failing to write a zero tolerance steroids policy into \nFederal law.\n  With that in mind, I am pleased to introduce this legislation today, \nwhich would put these potentially dangerous steroids behind the counter \nwhere they belong. We must make every effort to keep ALL steroids out \nof the hands of children and protect unsuspecting consumers. DHEA is \nnot a food supplement, and should be treated as every other \ntestosterone boosting substance in the steroid family.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join in support of this legislation.\n  I send the draft of this legislation to the desk and ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. INCLUSION OF DEHYDROEPIANDROSTERONE.\n\n       Section 102(41)(A) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 802(41)(A)) is amended--\n       (1) in the matter preceding clause (i), by striking \n     ``corticosteroids, and dehydroepiandrosterone'' and inserting \n     ``and corticosteroids'';\n       (2) by redesignating clauses (x) through (xlx) as clauses \n     (xi) through (xlxi), respectively; and\n       (3) by inserting after clause (ix) the following:\n       ``(x) dehydroepiandrosterone (androst-5-en-3b-ol-17-\n     one);''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Nelson \n        of Florida, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Durbin, and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 764. A bill to amend title IXX and XXI of the Social Security Act \nto permit States the option of coverage of legal immigrants under the \nMedicaid Program and the State children's health insurance program \n(SCHIP); to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Legal \nImmigrant Children's Health Improvement Act, legislation that would \nagain allow States to use Federal funds to provide critical healthcare \nservices to pregnant women and children. I want to thank Senator Snowe \nfor partnering with me on this bipartisan effort.\n  All across New York and America, legal immigrants work hard, pay \ntaxes, and exercise their civic responsibilities. I see examples of \nthis every day in New York. They fight for our country in the military. \nThey contribute to our Nation's competitiveness and economic growth. \nThey help revitalize neighborhoods and small towns across the country. \nAnd most are fiercely proud to call themselves Americans.\n  Yet, in 1996, Congress denied safety net services to legal immigrants \nwho had been in the country for less than five years. Today, Senator \nSnowe and I are introducing legislation that would take a first step \ntowards correcting that injustice. The Legal Immigrant Children's \nHealth Improvement Act will allow States to use Federal funds to make \nthe State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) and Medicaid \navailable to legal immigrant pregnant women and children who are within \nthe five year ban.\n  There is tremendous need for this legislation. An Urban Institute \nstudy found that children of immigrants under the age of 6 years are \ntwo times as likely to be in fair or poor health compared to same-age \nchildren of natives, whereas 6 to 17 year old children of immigrants \nare almost three times as likely to be in fair or poor health. While \nmost children receive preventative medical care, such as vaccines and \nroutine dental care, too often immigrant children do not. They are \nforced to forego treatment and can ultimately end up seeking needed \ncare in emergency rooms--the least cost-effective place to provide \ncare. To make matters worse, minor illnesses, which would be easily \ntreated by a pediatrician, may snowball into life-threatening \nconditions.\n  And women without access to prenatal care are four times more likely \nto deliver low birth weight infants and seven times more likely to \ndeliver prematurely than women who receive prenatal care, according to \nthe Institute of Medicine. All of these health outcomes are costly to \nsociety and to the individuals involved.\n  Today, 16 States, including New York and Maine, use State funds to \nprovide healthcare services to legal immigrant pregnant women and \nchildren within the five year waiting period. An additional six States \nprovide some coverage to either pregnant woman or children.\n  The Legal Immigrant Children's Health Improvement has been endorsed \nby a wide range of organizations including Asian American Justice \nCenter, Catholic Health Association, National Immigration Law Center, \nNational Health Law Program, Families USA, and National Council of La \nRaza and I want to thank them for their support.\n  This year Congress will reauthorize the SCHIP program and it is my \nhope that we will finally eliminate the unfair ban on legal immigrant \nchildren and pregnant woman by incorporating the Immigrant Children's \nHealth Improvement Act into the reauthorization of SCHIP. I look \nforward to working with Senator Snowe and my colleagues to enact this \nbill into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Obama, Ms. Murkowski, and Ms. \n        Mikulski):\n  S.J. Res. 5. A joint resolution proclaiming Casimir Pulaski to be an \nhonorary citizen of the United States posthumously; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce S.J. Res. 5, \nhonoring the valor of General Casimir Pulaski, who made the ultimate \nsacrifice in pursuit of American freedom. This Resolution would grant \nposthumous honorary citizenship to General Pulaski.\n  Casimir Pulaski was a young soldier whose activities to advance \nPolish liberty'' from Russian influence led to his exile from Poland. \nIn Paris, he met Benjamin Franklin and was inspired to join the \nContinental Army in its fight for American independence.\n  On September 11, 1777, Casimir Pulaski fought with distinction in the \nBattle of Brandywine. His bravery and abilities in battle averted an \nAmerican defeat and saved the life of George Washington. That same \nyear, Pulaski wrote to George Washington, ``I came here, where freedom \nis being defended, to serve it, and to live or die for it.''\n  Casimir Pulaski was promoted to Brigadier General and, as General, \ncontinued to provide great leadership. In 1779, at the siege of \nCharleston, South Carolina, he helped to fend off British forces. Later \nthat year, his letter to George Washington proved prophetic when in \nOctober, during a major offensive against British forces in Savannah, \nGeorgia, Pulaski was mortally wounded. He died at sea, aboard the \nU.S.S. Wasp, on October 11, 1779.\n  General Pulaski's life and death inspired his contemporaries just as \nhe inspires us today. Shortly after his death, the Continental Congress \nresolved to build a monument in his honor; one that proved to be the \nfirst of many. In 1825, General Lafayette, an honorary American \ncitizen, laid the cornerstone for the Pulaski monument in Savannah, \nGeorgia. In 1929, Congress resolved that October 11 of each year would \nbe Pulaski Day in the United States, and several states have followed \nthis example. In 1973, my own state of Illinois designated the first \nMonday of March as Pulaski Commemorative Day and in 1986 declared that \nday to be a state holiday. There are countless schools, streets, and \nmemorials across the country that bear his name, and honor his great \ncontributions.\n  We in Illinois are privileged to have a large and vibrant Polish-\nAmerican\n\n[[Page S2631]]\n\ncommunity. From Casimir Pulaski to legendary artists like Ignacy Jan \nPaderewski, the Polish people have contributed a great deal to \nIllinois, and to this country. Chicago is home to the Polish American \nCongress, which encompasses three thousand Polish organizations across \nthe county, as well as the Polish Museum of America. The Polish-\nAmerican community also has a large presence in the Illinois National \nGuard which has enjoyed a long-standing relationship with the Polish \nAir Force.\n  I am honored to rise today, on Pulaski Commemorative Day, to \nintroduce this Resolution to grant posthumous honorary citizenship to \nGeneral Casimir Pulaski. Honorary citizenship is a proper tribute to a \nman who gave his labor and life to the cause of American independence. \nWhen we think of our Nation's struggle for freedom in its early years, \nwe also must think of Casimir Pulaski and his indelible contribution to \nour Nation's birth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/05/senate-section/article/S2631-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2631-S2632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 93--SUPPORTING THE GOALS OF ``INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S \n                                 DAY''\n\n  Mrs. BOXER (for Mr. Biden (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Cantwell, \nMrs. Clinton, Mrs. Feinstein, Ms. Klobuchar, Ms. Landrieu, Ms. \nMikulski, Mrs. Murray, and Ms. Stabenow)) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S.

female President in the history of \n     Africa, and the 2005 election of Angela Merkel as the first \n     female Chancellor of Germany and who will also serve in 2007 \n     as the second woman to chair a G-8 summit;\n       Whereas women now account for 80 percent of the world's \n     70,000,000 micro-borrowers, 75 percent of the 28,000 United \n     States loans supporting small business in Afghanistan are \n     given to women, and 11 women are chief executive officers of \n     Fortune 500 companies in the United States;\n       Whereas, in the United States, women are graduating from \n     high school and earning bachelor's degrees and graduate \n     degrees at rates greater than men, with 88 percent of women \n     between the ages of 25 and 29 having obtained high school \n     diplomas and 31 percent of women between the ages of 25 of 29 \n     having earned bachelor's degrees;\n       Whereas even with the tremendous gains for women during the \n     past 20 years, women still face political and economic \n     obstacles, struggle for basic rights, face discrimination, \n     and are targets of gender-based violence all over the world;\n       Whereas women remain vastly underrepresented worldwide in \n     national and local legislatures, accounting on average for \n     less than 10 percent of the seats in legislatures in most \n     countries, and in no developing region do women hold more \n     than 8 percent of legislative positions;\n       Whereas women work two-thirds of the world's working hours \n     and produce half of the world's food, yet earn only 1 percent \n     of the world's income and own less than 1 percent of the \n     world's property;\n       Whereas, in the United States between 1995 and 2000, female \n     managers earned less than their male counterparts in the 10 \n     industries that employ the vast majority of all female \n     employees;\n       Whereas, of the 1,300,000,000 people living in poverty \n     around the world, 70 percent are women;\n       Whereas, according to the United States Agency for \n     International Development, two-thirds of the 876,000,000 \n     illiterate individuals worldwide are women, two-thirds of the \n     125,000,000 school-aged children who are not attending school \n     worldwide are girls, and girls around the world are less \n     likely to complete school than boys;\n       Whereas women account for half of all cases of HIV/AIDS \n     worldwide, approximately 42,000,000 cases, and in countries \n     with a high prevalence of HIV, young women are at a higher \n     risk than young men of contracting HIV;\n       Whereas each year over 500,000 women globally die during \n     childbirth or pregnancy;\n       Whereas domestic violence causes more deaths and \n     disabilities among women between the ages of 15 and 44 than \n     cancer, malaria, traffic accidents, and war;\n       Whereas worldwide at least 1 out of every 3 women and girls \n     has been beaten in her lifetime, and usually the abuser is a \n     member of the victim's family or is someone else known to the \n     victim;\n       Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, at least 1 out of every 6 women and girls in the \n     United States has been sexually abused in her lifetime;\n       Whereas, in the Unites States, one-third of the women \n     murdered each year are killed by current or former husbands \n     or boyfriends;\n       Whereas 130,000,000 girls and young women worldwide have \n     been subjected to female genital mutilation and it is \n     estimated that 10,000 girls are at risk of being subjected to \n     the practice in the United States;\n       Whereas, according to the Congressional Research Service \n     and the Department of State, illegal trafficking in women and \n     children for forced labor, domestic servitude, or sexual \n     exploitation involves between 600,000 and 900,000 women and \n     children each year, of whom 17,500 are transported into the \n     United States;\n       Whereas between 75 and 80 percent of the world's 27,000,000 \n     refugees are women and children;\n       Whereas, in Iraq, women are increasingly becoming the \n     targets of violence by Islamic extremists, street gangs, and \n     elements within the anti-occupation insurgency;\n       Whereas, in Darfur, a growing number of women and girls are \n     being raped, mainly by militia members who use sexual \n     violence as a weapon of war;\n       Whereas, in Afghanistan, Safia Ama Jan, the former Director \n     of Women's Affairs, became the first female assassinated \n     since the fall of the Taliban; and\n       Whereas March 8 of each year has been known as \n     ``International Women's Day'' for the last century, and is a \n     day on which people, often divided by ethnicity, language, \n     culture, and income, come together to celebrate a common \n     struggle for women's equality, justice, and peace: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals of ``International Women's Day'';\n       (2) recognizes and honors the women in the United States \n     and in other countries who have fought and continue to \n     struggle for gender equality and women's rights;\n       (3) reaffirms its commitment to ending discrimination and \n     violence against women and girls, to ensuring the safety and \n     welfare of women and girls, and to pursuing policies that \n     guarantee the basic rights of women and girls both in the \n     United States and in other countries;\n       (4) urges the President to reaffirm his commitment to \n     pursue policies to protect the health and rights of women and \n     girls; and\n       (5) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     International Women's Day with appropriate programs and \n     activities.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a Senate resolution \ndesignating March 8, 2007, as International Women's Day. Since 1911, \nInternational Women's Day has provided a chance for people all over the \nworld to pause and observe the remarkable steps that women have made in \ntheir fight for equality and recommit themselves to dosing lingering \ngender disparities. I am particularly pleased that I am joined by a \ntremendous group of women who are original co-sponsors of today's \nmeasure, Senators Boxer, Cantwell, Clinton, Feinstein, Klobuchar, \nLandrieu, Mikulski, Murray and Stabenow. These nine senators are living \ntestament to the progress and promise of women's achievements. They are \ntrailblazers and role models to whom we owe a great deal of gratitude.\n  Besides the steady increase in the number of women senators, I need \nonly look down the hallway to see another sign of extraordinary \nprogress in 2007--the first ever woman Speaker of House, Representative \nNancy Pelosi. Similar electoral accomplishments can be found in other \ncountries. For instance, Michelle Bachelet became the first female \nPresident of Chile and Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf became first female \nPresident in Liberia in the history of Africa. In 2005, Angela Merkel \nbecame the first female Chancellor of Germany.\n  Of course, participation in the political process is but one marker \nof women's empowerment and equal footing. Access to education, economic \nsecurity, employment nondiscrimination, eradication of poverty, \nequality before the law, access to HIV/AIDS prevention and other health \ncare services, and freedom from gender-based violence, including human \ntrafficking--these are all critical benchmarks of women's progress.\n  An essential component to achieving gender equality is ending \nviolence against women--an issue about which I care deeply. The time is \nnow to concentrate our energies on efforts to end domestic and sexual \nviolence abroad.\n\n[[Page S2632]]\n\nLast year Congress passed the Violence Against Women Act of 2005, an \naccomplishment that shows real consensus and momentum to end gender-\nbased violence and heal America's families. The United Nations and the \nWorld Health Organizations have released ground-breaking studies on the \nprevalence and impact of domestic violence globally. Finally, \ninternational service organizations are finding that their efforts to \nhelp women in the field, be it opening the school doors to girls or \ngetting HIV/AIDS medicine to young women, are ultimately ineffectual if \nwe do not help these same women escape from violent homes.\n  Furthermore, gender-based violence is pervasive in conflicts around \nthe globe. In Darfur, women are systematically raped as a weapon of \nwar. In Afghanistan, Safia Ama Jan, became the first female \nassassinated since the fall of the Taliban. Just last week, two Iraqi \nwomen accused the Iraqi national security forces of gang-raping them in \nBaghdad headquarters. This year's theme for International Women's Day \nis ``Ending Impunity for Violence Against Women and Girls''--a fitting \nmandate for all of us.\n  I am working on legislative measures to fight the global epidemic of \ngender-based violence. In addition, International Women's Day is also a \nperfect opportunity for the Administration to review its position and \nsupport ratification of the International Women's Rights Treaty \n(formally known as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of \nDiscrimination Against Women (CEDAW)). I whole heartedly support this \nhuman rights treaty that brings together in one document women's \neconomic, social, cultural, civil and political rights and is an \nimportant tool for women rights advocates around the globe.\n  I've said it before, but it bears repeating: Ending the systemic \ndiscrimination of women is not just a woman's issue, it is not just the \nresponsibility of heads of state or Nobel Peace Prize winners, it is \neveryone's moral responsibility. You cannot build peace and you cannot \nbuild democracy when half of the population is not free. And no country \ncan reach its full potential when women are not allowed to fully \ncontribute. Spreading democracy must mean empowering women, ending \ndomestic and sexual violence and holding abusers fully accountable. I \nurge my colleagues to join our Resolution to Commemorate International \nWomen's Day on March 8th and thank advocates everywhere who work day in \nand day out I to improve women's lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/05/senate-section/article/S2632-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 94--HONORING THE EMPLOYEES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF \n       HOMELAND SECURITY ON THE 4TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEPARTMENT\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH (for himself, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Stevens, \nMr. Warner, and Ms. Collins) submitted the following resolutions; which \nwas considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, I will briefly comment on this action. It \nwas a good occasion today. A press conference was held, led by myself \nand Senator McConnell, with a good bipartisan group of excellent \nSenators, regarding legislation that would improve America's \ncompetitiveness. It is important legislation. It has been worked on by \na number of bipartisan Senators, including Senator Bingaman. The person \nwho worked on it, from my perspective, more than anybody else is the \ndistinguished Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander, as did Senator \nEnsign and Senator Lieberman. It is totally bipartisan.\n  I hope we can, on a bipartisan basis, move it out of here in the near \nfuture.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if I might add something, this is a \nclassic example of the Senate at its best. It is a significant \nbipartisan measure put together, as the majority leader indicated, with \nleadership on his side of the aisle and on our side by Senators \nAlexander, Domenici, and Stevens.

Mr. President, the Senate is in the second week of \nconsideration of the 9/11 bill. S. 4 was reported out during the recess \nand was available to all Members on Monday, February 26.\n  We had to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed last Tuesday. Once \ncloture was invoked, there was a further delay in proceeding to the \nbill, and we were not allowed to begin consideration of the bill until \nWednesday, February 28.\n  On Thursday of last week, Senator DeMint offered his amendment to \nstrike the TSA provision of the bill. We have been trying to get an \nagreement to vote on his amendment basically since that evening and on \nother amendments on the same subject matter as his amendment by \nSenators McCaskill and Lieberman.\n  Today, Senator Collins offered her TSA amendment. We are willing to \nadd her amendment to the agreement. That was objected to.\n  As I indicated and the distinguished Republican leader indicated, \ntomorrow I will move to table the DeMint amendment.\n  I mention this because this is a good, very important piece of \nlegislation. It has all the markings of being able to do something on a \nbipartisan basis, once we get over these few little humps. There are \nnow 31 amendments pending to the bill. Most of the amendments do not \ndeal with 9/11 recommendations. They are important funding issues that \nmust be resolved and other 9/11 issues I would like to resolve before \nthere is a cloture vote on this bill. We have all day tomorrow and we \nhave Wednesday to finish this bill.\n  Accordingly, I am going to wait as long as I can to file cloture. We \nneed to resolve this bill this week. Immigration amendments are going \nto have to wait until we deal with that bill later this year. It is not \ngoing to be too late because we are going to have to do immigration. I \nknow the immigration people feel strongly about this issue. A number of \nthe people who have been heavily involved in this immigration debate \npreviously have offered immigration amendments on this bill. I think it \nis better we do the immigration legislation all at once and not \npiecemeal. I know how strongly the people feel who have offered these \namendments, but this is not the vehicle to offer those amendments. If \ncloture is invoked, most of these amendments will fall. In fact, I \nthink all of them will.\n  I have indicated to the distinguished Republican leader that we are \nwilling to make sure we can dispose of the amendments that appear to be \ngermane prior to the cloture vote. We want to move this legislation as \nquickly as possible and as fairly as possible. So I hope the people who \nhave amendments to offer will do it on this legislation. I hope they \nkeep in mind that this is the 9/11 Commission recommendations and not \nan immigration bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me add briefly before we adjourn \nthat I have asked my Members to come over, call up their amendments, \nand let's see how many we can get processed in the next couple of days. \nWe are anxious to have amendments up and have amendments voted on and \nwill be cooperating toward that end.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/05/senate-section/article/S2647-4", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
