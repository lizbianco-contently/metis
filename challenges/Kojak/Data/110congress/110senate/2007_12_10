But I do wish to use \na few minutes of my leader time at the outset of today's session.\n  Mr. President, the majority in the House of Representatives will soon \npropose a half-trillion-dollar spending bill. They have left it to the \nSenate to make sure the bill includes troop funding. We have another \nresponsibility to keep in mind as we wait for the House to act, and \nthat is our responsibility to the taxpayers.\n  Nearly a quarter of the way into the fiscal year, we are still 11 \nappropriations bills short. That is out of a total of 12. Eleven out of \n12 have not yet been signed into law. We need to act on these and to do \nso in a fiscally responsible way that ensures they actually become law.\n  As I have said, and as we have all seen, there is a way to make law \nand there is a way to make a political statement. On these \nappropriations bills, the middle-class tax hike known as the AMT, the \nfarm bill, the Energy bill, and FISA, there is a way we can get all of \nthese done, and we know what that way is. The path forward is clear. \nThe question now is whether the majority will take it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/10/senate-section/article/S15040-3", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS DAY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this is International Human Rights Day. \nI would like to take a moment to call attention to the tragic lack of \nhuman rights the world recently witnessed in Burma.\n  A few months ago, we watched in hope as pro-democracy activists took \nto the streets in quiet protest against the oppressive policies of the \nState Peace and Development Council.\n  Then we watched in horror as the Burmese regime showed its ugly face \nby putting down peaceful protesters, killing many, and leaving still \nmore unaccounted for. Soon the sound of gunfire gave way to rumors of \ntortured prisoners and the rounding up of Buddhist monks who had sought \nnothing more than justice and peace and freedom.\n  Unfortunately, the news cycle also gave way to new stories and new \nimages. A world that had been outraged about what it saw in Burma soon \nmoved on to other pressing things. But the Senate has not forgotten. We \nare not fooled by SPDC's all-too-modest efforts at ``dialog'' with Aung \nSan Suu Kyi, nor are the people of Burma, nor are the people of the \nworld.\n  So it is my hope on this International Human Rights Day that the U.N. \nSecurity Council will this month turn its attention to consideration of \nan arms embargo on Burma. Burma faces no external threats. It uses its \nweapons not to defend itself but to maintain its grip on power and \nintimidate its own people.\n  Several weeks ago, Senator Biden and I introduced S. 2257, the Burma \nDemocracy Promotion Act of 2007, which would further tighten U.S. \nsanctions on the SPDC. A companion measure in the House is expected to \nbe considered soon.\n  It is my hope that in the very near future we can move to Burma \nsanctions legislation. In so doing, we would reaffirm this body's \nlongstanding commitment to freedom and democracy in Burma.\n  Let's not forget the images that shook the world, nor the people who \nstood up against their oppressors, many of whom still suffer for the \nbravery they showed in those days.\n  On this International Human Rights Day, let's show them around the \nworld we remember their struggle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/10/senate-section/article/S15040-4", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I would now like to return to the pending \nbusiness, the farm bill, which we have now been working on in the \nSenate for a period of time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The pending business is the farm \nbill.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I will make a few general comments about the farm bill. \nIt is a piece of legislation which is very important to the food and \nfuel security of this country. I have had the honor of working with \nSenator Harkin and his leadership of this effort, along with Senator \nChambliss now, for at least 2\\1/2\\ years.\n  This legislation is truly historic for our country. Senator Thune, \nwho is on the floor with me this afternoon, has also been one of those \nchampions in trying to be sure we get a good farm bill for the United \nStates of America.\n  At the heart of this farm bill, we are talking about opening a whole \nnew chapter for America. It is not just a new chapter for rural \nAmerica, this is opening a new chapter for the clean energy future for \nthe United States of America. And title IX of this legislation, which \nhas been supplemented with the resources that are coming from the \nFinance Committee and the leadership of Senator Baucus and Senator \nGrassley, will make this farm bill the best farm bill for the clean \nenergy future of America we have ever had.\n  So it will open a whole new chapter of opportunity for America as we \ntry to deal with those forces that have kept us addicted to the foreign \npowers that control the oil of this world. It goes beyond energy, in \nterms of the new chapter we open here. It also deals with conservation, \nwhere the additional $4 billion or so that is in this legislation will \nhelp us embrace a new ethic forward in conservation; will make sure \nthat that 70 percent of America which now houses the farms and ranches \nof America remains the kind of land and water we can be very proud of.\n  It is a very good bill in terms of conservation. It also is a very \ngood bill in making sure the nutrition programs of this country are \nfully funded. We often remind the people of this country that even \nthough it is called a farm bill, and people think about it as a bill \nthat affects only rural America, it affects all\n\n[[Page S15041]]\n\nof America, and you see that particularly in the nutrition title.\n  As Senator Conrad has come to the floor and often reminded our \ncolleagues, about 67 percent of all the investment we are making in \nthis farm bill is going into the nutrition title of this legislation.\n  That is a significant investment to help those who are most \nvulnerable. There are significant additions we are making in this farm \nbill that will make our nutrition programs even better, that include \nthe fruit and vegetable programs, which are very much a part of this \nfarm bill.\n  It is important to remind the people of America that when we talk \nabout the farm bill, we are talking about providing the best food that \ncan be provided. This chart shows countries such as Indonesia, where 55 \npercent of disposable income goes for food. In the Philippines, it is \n38 percent. In China, it is 26 percent. In America, it is only 10 \npercent; 10 percent of the money we spend from our personal disposable \nincome goes for food. That means American farmers and ranchers are \nproviding the best food at the lowest possible cost. At the end of the \nday, that is what is at the heart of this farm bill.\n  I thank Senator Harkin and Senator Chambliss for having brought us to \nthis point.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3616 To Amendment No. 3500\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside and I \ncall up amendment No. 3616.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Salazar], for himself, Mr. \n     Kerry, Mr. Schumer, and Ms. Stabenow, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3616.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \n       incentives for the production of all cellulosic biofuels)\n\n       Beginning on page 1472, line 1, strike all through page \n     1480, line 3, and insert the following:\n\n                    PART II--ALCOHOL AND OTHER FUELS\n\n     SEC. 12311.

Mr. President, I thank my colleagues who have \ncosponsored this amendment: Senators Kerry, Schumer, and Stabenow. This \namendment will strengthen the provisions in the farm bill that came out \nof the Finance Committee. It is an amendment that deals with cellulosic \nbiofuels. We all know that cellulosic biofuels come from a different \nfeedstock than the conventional ethanol going into our engines today, \nand it offers great promise for a clean energy future. Conventional \nethanol typically comes from corn or soy, but cellulosic biofuels can \nbe produced from a wide variety of feedstocks, including agricultural \nplant wastes, such as corn stover and cereal straws, plant waste from \nindustrial processes, such as sawdust, and energy crops which are grown \nspecifically for fuel production, such as switchgrasses.\n  Cellulosic biofuels have an energy content three times higher than \ncorn ethanol, and they emit a low net level of greenhouse gases. Thanks \nto the great work of scientists around our country, including the \nNational Renewable Energy Lab in Golden, CO, we are on the verge of \nputting cellulosic ethanol into widespread use. The agricultural tax \npackage reported out of the Finance Committee with the leadership of \nChairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley helps us get cellulosic \nethanol into production by creating a tax credit equivalent to $1.28 a \ngallon, a number that is based on findings from the Department of \nEnergy and structured on the enhanced credit we established in the 2005 \nEnergy Policy Act. The only trouble with a tax credit is that it \napplies to cellulosic alcohols rather than to all cellulosic biofuels. \nThis may appear to be a semantic difference but it actually has a huge \nimpact.\n  As currently proposed, specifying that the credit must go only to \ncellulosic alcohols unnecessarily limits the applicability of this \nvital incentive. In my view, Congress should not be picking winners \nfrom among the cellulosic biofuels and technologies that are out there. \nThe fact is there is an entire new range of fuels technologies being \ndeveloped in the United States to go beyond ethanol. These technologies \nwould be able to make renewable blends for diesel, jet fuel, gasoline, \nboiler fuels, locomotives, and marine use. Unfortunately, many of these \nfuels would not be eligible for the tax incentive under the current \nlanguage which specifies that a fuel must be a cellulosic alcohol. \nTherefore, our amendment makes a simple change. It changes cellulosic \nalcohols to cellulosic biofuels. I hope my colleagues will support this \nsimple and sensible fix. It will further strengthen the important part \nof the farm bill that deals with a clean energy future. I look forward \nto working with my colleagues on this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today we begin in earnest to debate the \nFood and Energy Security Act of 2007, commonly referred to as the 2007 \nfarm bill. The naming of this bill is not without meaning. It is \nabundantly clear that agriculture and energy production are now \ninherently related and together will move our Nation toward greater \nfood and energy security. Nearly all the controversy surrounding this \nfarm bill is focused on whether farmers and ranchers should be \nreceiving the assistance this bill would provide, with very little \ndiscussion of the potential this bill carries to propel American \nagriculture into producing alternative fuels to lessen our Nation's \ndependence on foreign energy sources. The 2002 farm bill was the first \nfarm bill to include an energy title. As a member of the House \nAgriculture Committee during the 2002 farm bill debate, I can attest \nthat including an energy title in the farm bill was not easy, nor was \nit without controversy. However, Congress had the foresight to realize \nthat renewable energy was an integral part of our agricultural economy \nand a comprehensive farm bill would be incomplete without including \nrenewable energy incentives.\n  The energy title included in the Food and Energy Security Act of 2007 \nalso includes an energy title that builds on the success of the 2002 \nfarm bill. The incentives in this energy title will greatly benefit \nAmerican consumers, our agricultural producers, and our Nation's energy \nindependence. The farm bill before us was crafted in the spirit of \nbipartisanship in the Senate Agriculture Committee and was passed out \nof committee by unanimous consent. We all know the 2002 farm bill \nexpired earlier this year on September 30. I am pleased to report that \nafter the agreement that was reached last week, both Republicans and \nDemocrats will be able to offer amendments to this bill. More than 120 \nRepublican amendments have been filed on this farm bill. More than 140 \nDemocratic amendments have been filed on this farm bill. Although not \nall of these amendments will receive a vote on the Senate floor, I am \npleased the leadership made an agreement to allow consideration of 40 \namendments so we can move a farm bill forward.\n  After a several-week delay, we are now on track to debating this farm \nbill in an open and fair manner on the floor of the Senate. America's \nfarmers are making planning decisions for next year without knowing \nwhat type of farm programs will be available to them. Time is of the \nessence. We must move quickly and with purpose to finish this farm bill \nfor not only American agriculture but also for the millions of people \nwho receive benefits under the nutrition and other titles of this bill. \nThis bill will give our agricultural producers the additional security \nthey need to move forward with production decisions and will help meet \nour food and energy needs for the next 5 years and beyond.\n  I wish to share a couple of facts about the 2007 farm bill. The 2007 \nfarm bill is 1,600 pages long, and it will cost more than $286 billion \nover 5 years. The very first farm bill passed 70 years ago was 24 pages \nlong. The 2007 farm bill also includes the first farm bill tax title \nsince 1933, adding an extra degree of difficulty and further reason for \nopen debate. During the past 30 years, the farm bill has averaged about \n2 weeks of floor time and required as many as 30 recorded votes. It is \nnot just America's farmers and ranchers who are waiting for the 2007 \nfarm bill. Food banks, Food Stamp, and other emergency food program \nrecipients are all anxiously awaiting this farm bill to pass. Their \nshare of the farm bill stake accounts for more than 66 percent of total \nfarm bill spending, and they are pushing hard to get this farm bill \npassed. Rural development incentives are also on hold until we pass the \n2007 farm bill.\n  For example, a powerplant in rural America is delayed because funding \nfor USDA's rural utility service is tied up in this farm bill. Our \nfarmers and ranchers and millions of other Americans are watching and \nwaiting anxiously for the Senate to debate this farm bill and move it \non to a conference committee with the House of Representatives. I look \nforward to engaging my colleagues this week in a fair and open debate \non this monumental legislation which will govern programs affecting \nrural America for the next 5 years.\n  I appreciate my colleague from Colorado, Mr. Salazar, being here and \nmanaging this legislation on the behalf of the Democrats today, because \nfarm bills are not political in their orientation, at least they have \nnot been in the past. Farm bill debates don't end up being normally \npartisan debate. There are regional differences, differences between \ndifferent commodity organizations. Everybody comes to a farm bill \ndebate with different priorities, depending on what part of the country \nthey represent. But farm bills have never been partisan or resulted in \nthe kind of partisan gridlock and fights that typically accompany other \nlegislation in the Senate.\n  The Senator from Colorado and I have worked closely on a number of \nprovisions in this farm bill, particularly the energy title. Energy \nproduction has become an integral part of the success and prosperity of \nrural America. In fact, this farm bill starts moving us into the next \ngeneration of energy policy and renewable energy production. We have \nhad great success with corn-based ethanol. We will have seen by the end \nof this year 7.5 billion gallons of production of corn-based ethanol \nliterally, growing in the last 10 years from ground zero to where we \nare today, a remarkable tribute to the good work, the initiative, and \ncreativity of our farmers and those who are involved in ethanol \nproduction. I give them credit for where we are today. But we also have \ngreat potential as we move into the future. We have to put in place \npolicies that will provide the necessary financial and economic \nincentives for those who want to invest in this next generation of \nethanol production, cellulosic ethanol production made from other forms \nof biomass. We have to have the right kind of incentives in place in \norder for that to move forward and to continue the momentum that has \nbeen so good for many communities across rural America.\n\n  With regard to the issue of energy production, a lot of people look \nat a farm bill and look at the amount of money spent on production \nagriculture and say: Isn't that terrible that we are spending all this \nmoney on food and fiber. We do have in front of us a food, fiber, and \nenergy security bill. I would argue with anyone, based on the \nstatistics the Senator from Colorado put up earlier about the cost of \nfood in the United States and what that means to our economy and the \nsafety and quality of the food we have in this country, that support \nfor production agriculture makes so much sense. If you look at this \nbill in its totality, the overall funding and how much is spent on \nproduction agriculture, it is only about 14 percent of total funding in \nthe underlying bill. If you look at where the funding in this bill \ngoes, about 9 percent of it goes into conservation programs. Those are \nprograms that are important to America. Probably the most important \nconservation policy that we will put in place in terms of the \nenvironmental stewardship we have a responsibility for will be found in \nthe conservation title of this farm bill. There is a conservation \nreserve program, a wetlands reserve program, a grassland reserves \nprogram, an EQIP program, all programs utilized extensively by farmers \nand ranchers to help address the issues of soil erosion, water quality, \nwind erosion--all those things that are so important not only in terms \nof being good stewards of the land but also in many States such as \nmine, where wildlife production has become an important part of our \neconomy. This year in South Dakota we have 10,000 pheasants. That is a \nrecord going back to 1962. We have not seen that many pheasants in \nSouth Dakota, largely a result of the good practices put in place \nthrough incentives included in farm bill policies in past farm bills.\n  The conservation title is 9 percent of the money, and 14 percent of \nthe\n\n[[Page S15044]]\n\nmoney goes into production agriculture. That leaves about 67 percent or \nabout two-thirds of the funding in this bill going toward food \nassistance programs, Food Stamps, WIC Programs, those types of programs \nthat support people who don't have access to good quality food and need \nthat form of assistance.\n  So food pantries, food banks, and all of those other organizations \nacross this country that meet those types of needs are awaiting action \nby the Congress to address those needs and get them a bill that will \nenable them to move forward with the programs that help address the \nvery important concerns and needs that people providing food assistance \nhave in this country.\n  This is a bill that is comprehensive. It is a bill that struck a \nbalance as it came out of the Agriculture Committee. It was a \nbipartisan bill when it left the Ag Committee. I hope it can continue \nto be bipartisan as we debate it on the floor.\n  A lot of people have different ideas about how to address farm policy \nin this country. A lot of people have very different notions of what \nought to be in a farm bill from those the Senator from Colorado or I \nmight have. But that is why we have the opportunity for a fair and open \ndebate.\n  A lot of the amendments that are going to be debated I will probably \nsupport, and there are many I will probably oppose depending upon how I \nview those amendments affecting the balance that has been struck in the \nbill and the way it would impact my particular State of South Dakota. \nBut I think it is fair to say it is high time this debate got underway.\n  I also have to say when you look at the cost of farm bills, it is \nimportant to keep in mind, as we debate this one, that much of the cost \nthat has been associated with the 2002 farm bill in the form of the \nsafety net--and by that I mean your loan deficiency payments, your \ncountercyclical payments, your direct payments--if you look at the \ntotality of the bill and the cost over time, in the last 5 years, $22 \nbillion in tax dollars has been saved because of higher prices, which \nwas the way that program was designed to work. When farm prices went \nhigher, the assistance kicked out. When prices dropped, the assistance \nkicked back in.\n  But what we have had now is a fairly substantial period of good \nprices for our producers in this country. That has led to savings for \nthe taxpayers--$22 billion in savings over the past 5 years, over the \nperiod of the last farm bill. In many respects, I attribute that to the \nsuccess of the ethanol industry because the demand for corn has raised \nthe price of corn in this country. As the price of corn has gone up in \nthis country, as is typically the case, the rising tide lifts all \nboats.\n  We have seen wheat prices go up, we have seen soybean prices go up \nlargely because there is only so much acreage out there that can be put \nin production. So we have seen sustained prices that have enabled us to \nsave, under the 2002 farm bill, payments that otherwise would have been \ngoing out to the farmers of this country, to the tune of $22 billion.\n  So when people criticize the effect that the renewable fuel programs \nhave on farm programs, and the costs, I think it is important to keep \nthat statistic in mind. In fact, in a January 2007 statement, the USDA \nchief economist stated that farm program payments were expected to be \nreduced by some $6 billion due to the higher value of a bushel of corn.\n  As I said, when you multiply that across other commodities--whether \nit is wheat, soybeans--overall savings in the last farm bill was $22 \nbillion, attributable in my mind, in many respects at least, to the \nenergy policies that were put in place in the 2002 farm bill, the \ninvestment that has been made by those across this country in this \ngrowing industry that has enabled us to save money in the form of farm \nprogram payments. But just as importantly, it has enabled us to lessen \nour dependence upon foreign sources of energy--7.5 billion gallons of \nethanol by the end of this year.\n  What does that mean in terms of our dependence upon foreign oil? In \n2006, the production and use of ethanol in the United States reduced \noil imports by 170 million barrels, saving $11 billion from being sent \nto foreign and often hostile countries. By the end of 2009, ethanol \nproduction is expected to increase to 12.5 billion gallons, displacing \neven more of our Nation's petroleum use.\n  Promoting clean, homegrown fuels and reducing our dependence on oil \nimports from dangerous parts of the world is more than just good \npolicy, it is a matter of national security. So this farm bill, with \nits strong energy policy, moves us in a direction that not only builds \nupon the gains and the success we have seen in the form of corn-based \nethanol, and the 7.5 billion gallons that have already been produced in \nthe form of corn-based ethanol, but it opens the door to a whole new \ngeneration of ethanol production in this country that is based upon \nother forms of biomass, whether that is corn stover or corncobs or \nswitchgrass or wood chips or other types of biomass that we have an \nabundance of across this country.\n  It is just flat necessary and important and imperative for us to \ncontinue to diversify our energy in this country away from our \ndependence upon foreign petroleum so the American consumer can access \nthe energy, the fuel they need to get to their jobs, to work, to \nrecreate--to do all those things--in a less expensive way but, more \nimportantly, so we are not dependent on countries around the world \nwhose intentions toward the United States can be described as nothing \nless than hostile.\n  With that, we kick off this debate. There are amendments I think that \nwill be offered by some of our colleagues, some of which are already \npending at the desk, others of which will be offered throughout the \ncourse of the day.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor. The Senator from \nColorado, I think, perhaps, has someone to recognize for an amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I thank my friend from South Dakota for \nhis leadership on this bill. As he said, this has been a bipartisan \neffort. This bill came out of the Agriculture Committee on a voice \nvote. And the Finance provisions, which have now been included in this \nfarm bill, also came to this floor with a very huge bipartisan voice of \nsupport. So I am hopeful we can move forward quickly to get to a point \nwhere we do have final passage of this bill.\n  I congratulate and thank Senator Reid, our majority leader, for \nhaving worked with the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, having \nbrought us together last week so we were able to finally move forward \nwith a set of amendments that will get us moving in the direction where \nwe can finally bring about a finality to this very important bill for \nAmerica.\n  I thank my friend from South Dakota for his leadership, as well, on \nall the energy issues because we have worked a lot on these energy \nissues not only in the farm bill but in other aspects of our work here. \nAt the end of the day, how we can have rural America help us grow our \nway to energy independence is one of the great opportunities we have as \na nation. I look forward to working with both my Democratic and \nRepublican colleagues as we try to do this effort on this bill through \nits energy provisions, as well as trying to deal with the Energy bill, \nhopefully, later on in the week.\n  Mr. President, I understand our colleague from Idaho has an amendment \nand wishes to be recognized.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, before I call up my amendment, let me thank \nboth the Senator from Colorado and the Senator from South Dakota for \ntheir leadership in getting this very important new ag policy to the \nfloor. I, like they, have been frustrated the last month that we could \nnot get on the bill and cause it to work its will. That is where we are \ntoday. We are on the bill, ready for it to work its will.\n  I do appreciate the comments the Senator from South Dakota has made \nand thank him for his leadership as it relates to the biofuels issue, \nto ethanol. Because of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, we have expanded \nand accelerated--along with agricultural policy--this issue. As you \nknow, if we can pass the Energy bill with the renewable fuels standard, \nwe will go to potentially 15 billion gallons a year in ethanol in the \noutyears, and hopefully 15\n\n[[Page S15045]]\n\nbillion plus 6 billion in the outyears of cellulosic biostalk ethanol-\nbased fuel.\n  If the Energy bill cannot work its will, then the Senator from South \nDakota and I and Senator Domenici from New Mexico, who just passed \nthrough, will attempt to put on the farm bill the renewable fuels \nstandard, which is phenomenally important to the continuation and the \ngrowth of the biofuels that will make us increasingly independent of \nthose rogue nations and of what I call the ``petronationalism'' that is \nsweeping the world, in the fact that if you are a small country and you \nproduce oil, you can take a big country like ours and jerk it around \nright by its nose, if you will, simply by pricing the oil that you know \nis so sacred to the developed world.\n  Having said that, with the phenomenal runup in commodity prices in \nthe last several years, in part because of what the Senator from South \nDakota has said--the high value of corn, as corn moved out of \nfeedstock, if you will, into a new kind of feedstock, to ethanol \nproduction--farmland and farmland values have gone up tremendously. A \nfarm that had been a second- and third-generation farm--for which, a \ndecade ago, a farmer or his son or daughter might have said: We can no \nlonger afford to farm it; we are going to sell it into development--all \nof a sudden that land, as part of our energy base and part of our food \nbase has become increasingly important.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3640 To Amendment No. 3500\n\n  With that, Mr. President, at this time I call up amendment No. 3640 \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to setting aside \nthe pending amendment?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig], for himself, Mr. \n     Brownback, and Mr. Allard, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3640 to amendment No. 3500.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, the bill talks about land, it talks about \nvaluable farmland, it talks about valuable grazing land, and the issue \nis eminent domain. As we all know, the issue of eminent domain was \nelevated greatly as an issue following a highly controversial 2005 \nSupreme Court decision known as Kelo vs. The City of New London. Since \nthat decision, we as a nation have allowed State governments and local \nmunicipalities to utilize eminent domain to force landowners to yield \ntheir property to private development.\n  That is a new phenomenon in our country. That has not been and was \nnot the historic use of eminent domain. We are talking about land that \nmaybe generationally has served America's farmers and ranchers for the \npurpose of food and fiber.\n  As shown in this picture, here is an example of a beautiful piece of \npastureland in Camas County, ID, for which one day the county and/or a \ncity in the area could decide: Oh, gee, we like it for open space. It \nis open space today. As I would suggest, the economics of today would \nsuggest it will remain open space for a long time.\n  But since the Supreme Court's Kelo ruling, farmers and ranchers in \nparticular have become vulnerable to State and local municipalities \ntaking their property for economic development, open space \ndesignations, or other purposes.\n  The recent, most vivid happening occurred in the State of \nPennsylvania, where over a 3-year period in Pennsylvania, a county \ngovernment has been in a struggle with a local family over an attempt \non the county's part to purchase a section of their farmland. When the \nnegotiations failed, the county moved to seize the land using eminent \ndomain, with the goal of turning the land into a park or an open space \nalong, I believe it was, the Susquehanna River. Very recently, after 2 \nyears of dispute over the value of the land, the county withdrew its \nrequest, leaving the family without any kind of deal, with the family \nhaving spent thousands of dollars and years on endless amounts of \nlitigation and court costs. There were no winners, but the family that \nhad the farm still owns the farm.\n\n[[Page S15046]]\n\n  In the words of the American Farm Bureau's president, Bob Stallman--\nhe says it this way, and I think he says it accurately--No one's home \nor ranch or ranchland is safe from government seizure because of the \nKelo ruling.\n  We are now increasingly hearing of incidents in which States and \nlocal governments may be pushing the boundaries of what our \nconstitutional power was designed to accomplish. I read often of \nfarmers and ranchers being forced to fight to save their land from \nlocal governments looking to take it. The Pennsylvania decision, of \ncourse, is a great example of that. I believe we in Congress need to \nbring back common sense in determining when we use the power and what \nit is appropriately used for; and, of course, I am talking about the \npower of our Constitution in respect to eminent domain. What are we \ntalking about when we talk about common sense in State and local \ngovernments, what they should or should not do: Does it make sense to \ntake open space out of the private sector and make it open space in the \npublic sector by simply a taking, if you will, by the power of eminent \ndomain? There are plenty of ways to assure that farmland and grazing \nlands stay as open space if the county or the government wishes to \nreward the landowner and establish a relationship with that landowner \nfor the purpose of keeping that space open and available. But just to \nuse the power of government for the purpose of crushing that private \nproperty owner's right is simply wrong.\n\n  American Farmland Trust reports that every minute of every day, \nAmerica loses two or more acres of farmland, and the rate is increasing \nas our population grows and expands. This farm bill and what it \nembodies now will tell you that farmland will probably become \nincreasingly more valuable for the production of food and fiber. In \nmany instances, we don't have an acre to spare. When our county \ngovernments decide they want to take it for the purpose of simply \nchanging its ownership, that is greatly frustrating.\n  Additionally, many of our parks in this country are facing major \nbudgetary shortfalls. To unnecessarily add more parks using eminent \ndomain makes the problem worse, and to take private land to do so \nsimply makes no sense. If the city wants to create a park, go find a \nwilling seller and a willing buyer. That is the way it has been done \nhistorically--not to use the power of eminent domain given them, if you \nwill, by the Kelo decision.\n  My amendment is very simple. For this reason, in offering it, the \namendment will deter State and local governments from taking working \nagricultural land against the will of the landowner only to designate \nthe same land as open space for parks and similar purposes. It is a \nvery targeted amendment. It addresses only cases in which private \nworking agricultural land is taken and turned into open space--a park \nor a preservation or a conservation area.\n  Listen, fellow Senators: It does not prevent States and local \ngovernments from exercising their right of eminent domain. What we are \ntalking about is that it does not prevent nor deter the use of eminent \ndomain such as taking for what we have always viewed as a legitimate \npublic purpose: power lines, schools, and similar projects of public \nvalue; rights-of-way, when necessary, for roads and all of that type of \nuse. It does not even tackle the issue of taking private land for \nprivate economic development. That is the Kelo decision. That fight, I \nhave to say, is probably for another day. I hope my colleagues of the \nJudiciary Committee would grab the value of private land-ownership in \nthis country and change and allow us to work our will on the law and \nnot give municipalities and local governments the right of eminent \ndomain over economic development, for a private purpose. But, as I say, \nthat is for another day and another purpose.\n  What does this amendment do? It creates a strong but targeted \nfinancial disincentive for the local governments to get involved. This \nwill cause State and local governments to stop and think when \nconsidering forcibly taking the working land of a farmer or a rancher \nin order to keep that property as open space. Every farmer and rancher \nreserves the right to voluntarily, of course, enter into an agreement; \nas I mentioned earlier, a willing seller, a willing buyer, into a land \ntrust for the value of keeping land private and all of those types of \nthings but to allow it to remain as it is for the purpose of openness. \nThat is already going on. That already has well established law as it \nrelates to how that land gets used.\n  I believe land preservation is a worthy cause. However, farmers and \nranchers should not be forcibly removed from their lands simply to \nprevent them from making a personal decision about their private \nproperty sometime out into the future.\n  Let me end by saying it is necessary for Congress to discourage the \nillogical and unwarranted use of eminent domain. I think that is very \nclear. Many of us were surprised by the Kelo decision, and we saw new \nprecedent being set as it relates to government's use of eminent \ndomain. I believe it is both illogical and unwarranted to forcibly take \nworking agricultural land only to designate it as land as an open space \nor for a similar purpose. A farm bill is an appropriate vehicle to \naccomplish this goal to protect our private property rights and our \nNation's farmers and ranchers, and I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  Let me thank Cori Whitman on my staff for working this issue. I also \nnote the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Cattlemen's Beef \nAssociation, the Public Lands Council, and many others are recognizing \nthe risk and the threat to private operating agricultural properties \nand are supporting this amendment to become policy in the new \nagriculture policy embodied in this bill.\n  I thank my colleagues for listening. I hope to gain their support as \nwe work this amendment through the process over the balance of this \nweek.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3549 to Amendment No. 3500\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 3549 on behalf of Senator Roberts and ask that it be set \naside.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Thune], for Mr. Roberts, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3549.\n\n  Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, is an amendment in order or do I have to \nmove to set aside an amendment in order to offer one?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Unanimous consent is required to \nset aside the pending amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that it be set aside so that I \nmay proceed with a different amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3614 to Amendment No. 3500\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to call up amendment No. 3614.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3614.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Tuesday, November 13, \n2007, under ``Text of amendments.'')\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think there are a number of people who \nwant to cosponsor this amendment, but I will handle those later--except \nfor the two Senators who are here; I ask that they be original \ncosponsors at this time, as well as the distinguished Senator from \nIdaho, Mr. Craig.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S15047]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will try to be as brief as I can. A \ncouple of weeks back there was much talk about the need to keep only \nrelevant amendments in order on this farm bill. While there was much \nleft to interpretation of what exactly ``relevant amendments'' mean, \nthere can be no question that the Senate should debate and vote on my \namendment.\n  This farm bill is called the Food and Energy Security Act of 2007. I \ncannot think of an amendment more relevant to the economic security of \nthe American farmer and energy security of the American people than an \namendment to increase the renewable fuels standard. Since we passed the \nfirst ever renewable fuels standard in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, \nof which I was proud to be the floor manager and the leader, we have \nseen a surge in ethanol jobs and a surge in the construction of plants.\n  In 2006 alone the U.S. ethanol industry supported the creation of \n160,000 new jobs while producing 5 billion gallons of ethanol. These \nare American farm jobs which help produce American fuels and help \nreduce our dependence on foreign oil. We are not aware of this \nhappening because we have a gigantic country. As for 160,000 new jobs \nand 5 billion gallons of ethanol being added to the American workplace, \nthat is happening because of the gigantic disparity that has occurred \nin the cost of oil now versus a year and a half or two ago. That is why \nthere is so much activity in foreign countries where we have seen a \nwhole country saying: We are going to build a brand-new country from \ntop up full of hotels and motels, banks, and the like. That is oil \nmoney. That is the disparity between the price of oil they are charging \nus now and what it was worth sometime ago, and all that left over is \ngoing into the hands of those who produce crude oil and sell it to us. \nWe might as well understand that is not helping America.\n  People say: Well, it isn't hurting us yet. They still have--they are \nbuying up our bonds. Well, I believe it is hurting us. I believe it is \npart of the crisis--problem with the dollar--not crisis yet. It is also \npart of the problem with the gross domestic product of the United \nStates in that it is not going to be as buoyant in the future because \nso much of our basic wealth is going out of our country, and the price \nof oil that we are paying to whatever country produces it and sends it \nto us.\n  Now, what my amendment does is changes--sets an annual requirement \nfor the amount of renewable fuels used in motor vehicles, homes, and \nboilers. It will require that our Nation use 8.5 billion gallons of \nrenewable fuels in 2008 and progressively increasing to 36 billion \ngallons by 2022. Now, you understand wherever we use the words \n``renewable fuel,'' that means something else other than the crude oil \nthat I have just been talking about. It means it is getting produced \nhere or under our control.\n  Beginning in 2016, an increasing portion of renewable fuel must be \nadvanced biofuels. Beginning in 2016, increased cellulosic ethanol--\nadvanced biofuels include cellulosic ethanol, biodiesel, and other \nfuels derived from unconventional biomass feedstocks, like sorghum. The \nrequired amount of advanced biofuels begins at 3 billion gallons in \n2016 and increases to 21 billion gallons by 2022.\n  Advanced biofuels do not have many of the challenges that \nconventional ethanol does. The inclusion of advanced biofuels strikes a \nbalance that will allow America to begin diversifying our fuel supply, \nboth in the short term and the long term. That is why when supporting \nthese same provisions in the Energy bill, the Renewable Fuels \nAssociation said they ``strike the right chord, `` noting that ``such \nan investment in our Nation's energy future promises to spur the \ncreation of new, good-paying jobs'' across our land.\n  The amendment I seek to offer and that I have offered consists of the \nvery same provisions that passed the Senate in June during \nconsideration of the Energy bill--the then-Energy bill. That was not \nthe Energy Policy Act. It was the next major bill. Some may ask, then: \nWhy do I seek to offer the amendment on the farm bill? My answer is \nthreefold.\n  One, it is clear that the Energy bill has slowed down, largely \nbecause the House has passed two major provisions--a tax increase and a \nrenewable portfolio standard--that are untenable to many in the Senate, \nand they have slowed the bill down. They have brought forth a \ndiscussion from the President of the United States that is unequivocal; \nthat if those two provisions are in the bill, he will veto the bill. \nThat is the renewable portfolio standard and the tax increases that are \nin the House bill. They are not only untenable to the Senate, we ought \nto make the point over and over that they are untenable to the \nPresident.\n  So what good is it to have that bill and say we are going to do it or \nelse? What is the ``or else?'' We are going to do nothing. We are going \nto pass something that will never become the law. I wish we could do \nsomething different so we would not have to adopt this Domenici \namendment because it will be adopted on the other bill where it already \nlies and languishes.\n  Second, the House Energy bill in many respects weakens the renewable \nfuels standard in the Senate Energy bill. Besides, if the Senate makes \nprogress on passing the Energy bill and getting it signed into law, \nthere would be nothing to prevent a conference from simply removing \nthis then unnecessary provision.\n  Third, this amendment is relevant to the farm bill and necessary now \nto reinvigorate an ethanol industry that is looking to Congress to \nextend this mandate as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, in one sense, we have been a victim of our own \nsuccess. Thanks to the 2005 Energy bill, rural America has answered the \ncall for increased ethanol production. In fact, we have now exceeded \nthe original mandated fuel in our fuel mix. For example, in 2006, the \nethanol standard was 4 billion gallons. I think the two Senators on the \nfloor played an active role in that and are fully aware of that. In \nfact, our domestic production of ethanol is 5 billion, far exceeding \nthe billions of gallons we directed. We can do more, a lot more, and \nthe American farmer is looking for Congress to do more.\n  Over the last year, the price of ethanol dropped nearly 40 percent. \nThe reason for this is simple economics. We have an increased supply \nand diminished demand in the marketplace. As a result, the construction \nof new plants has been delayed, meaning new job growth has been \ndiminished and rural communities are looking to us to take action. We \ncannot wait for the Energy bill while rural communities are losing \ntheir opportunities. This amendment is not simply just relevant to the \nfarm bill, it is necessary.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment. I further \nask our leadership go to work today, which I am sure they will, and \ntomorrow on the Energy bill that went to the House. It was sent back to \nus not as a bill but rather as a message, and it does not do justice to \nthe biofuels for energy. They ought to fix that and, at the same time, \ntake the taxes out and take the 15-percent electricity mandate for \nalternative fuels.\n  I ask sincerely that our distinguished leader take the lead in that \nand see that gets done quickly.\n  I yield the floor and thank the Senators for letting me proceed.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, very briefly--because it is the other \nside's opportunity--I thank the ranking Republican on the Energy \nCommittee for bringing this amendment forward. It fits well in the farm \nbill. Last Friday afternoon, I spoke to that again. Clearly, this is an \nopportunity we cannot pass by. I would like to see it in the Energy \nbill and see this concept grow to 2022 and get us to 36 billion \ngallons. Corn based and cellulosic is absolutely critical. This is a \nmarket we created by public policy and with public support. There is no \nquestion about it. This is a market that can continue to grow and \ndevelop, as long as Government advances it and stays out of its way.\n  I thank the Senator from New Mexico for bringing up the amendment. It \nis appropriate on the farm bill. I hope our colleagues will consider it \nas a plus to the overall growth of domestic American agriculture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico\n\n[[Page S15048]]\n\nfor bringing the RFS amendment to the floor. I urge my colleagues to \nfigure out a way for us to move forward with the renewable fuels \nstandard we in the Senate embrace because it is the right way to move \nforward with an RFS.\n  When you look at many of the concepts we have dealt with in terms of \ngrowing our energy independence, the fact is the renewable fuels \nstandard is key in terms of how we get there. We worked long and hard \nin the Energy Committee to come up with the concepts included in the \nEnergy bill. In my mind, when I look at the Energy bill, which is being \ndiscussed in its final forms in the negotiations between the House and \nSenate, there were five pieces to that bill. I believe we can get to a \npoint where we have a bill that becomes a final and good energy bill, \nwhich passes the Congress and gets signed by the President.\n  I think we are close, as I understand it, to moving forward with CAFE \nstandards in the legislation that makes sense to the people who are \nleading this effort in both Chambers. The biofuels program, which at \nits heart is the RFS amendment Senator Domenici was talking about, is \nsomething that is essential and a key component to having a good energy \npackage.\n  The carbon sequestration provisions we passed out of the Senate, I \nunderstand, have been accepted by the House. It is important to move \nforward with that. I know conversations are going on with respect to \nthe renewable portfolio standards. I wish to make a quick comment on \nthe renewable fuel standard. We spent a tremendous amount of time \ndealing with that issue in the Energy Committee because it was so \nimportant on how we move forward. There was a recognition among the \nwitnesses before the committee that there was a limitation with corn-\nbased ethanol. The scientists and the experts are telling us we can get \nto about 15 billion gallons of production with corn-based ethanol. But \nwe know the future for America, and for us being able to produce \nethanol all across this country, is based on the next generation of \nadvanced biofuels, and that is cellulosic ethanol. That is why this RFS \nmakes so much sense and we should adopt it and move forward with it, \nwhether it be in the farm bill or in the Energy bill.\n  The RFS we passed out of the Senate Energy Committee, with the \nleadership of Senator Bingaman, a great advocate and proponent of the \nRFS in the Energy bill, contemplates that we will produce 21 billion \ngallons of advanced biofuels. That is 21 billion gallons of cellulosic \nethanol, the alcohol-based ethanol I spoke about earlier today. So I \nhope that, as these discussions move forward in the week ahead and we \nlook at crafting a good energy bill for this country, the renewable \nfuels standard Senator Domenici spoke about in his amendment is \nincluded in that energy legislation. If not, it seems to me we may want \nto look at including it in the farm bill because it is so important to \nthe future of rural America and to us being in a position where we can \nhelp grow our way to energy independence.\n  I yield the floor. My friend from South Dakota has additional \ncomments.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I, too, acknowledge the good work of our \ncolleague from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, on this issue. It largely \nis a result of his good work in 2005. Senator Salazar is on the Energy \nCommittee. I was, at the time, on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, which worked to get the first ever renewable fuels standard \nput into law. That was a monumental breakthrough in terms of renewable \nenergy production in this country.\n  If you look at the way the market has responded to that, the story \nhas been nothing less than remarkable. In 2005, we set a goal of \nreaching 7\\1/2\\ billion gallons of renewal fuel production by 2012. We \nwill achieve that by the end of this calendar year, 2007. South Dakota \nwill have, on its own, a billion gallons of ethanol production reached \nby the end of 2008.\n  This is a great success story not only for agriculture and for the \nfarmers and the rural economies that benefit but for our environment \nbecause it reduces greenhouse gases. It is a great success story also \nin terms of lessening our reliance upon foreign sources of energy. I \nmentioned the statistic earlier: 170 million barrels of oil were \ndisplaced by the amount of ethanol production in this country. That \nsaved $11 billion that we would have shipped to one of those petro \neconomies elsewhere around the world that Senator Domenici referenced \nin his remarks.\n  So the renewable fuels standard that passed in 2005 was a \nbreakthrough; it was a milestone piece of legislation in terms of \nlaunching this industry. But what is remarkable about that is we are up \nagainst the lid that was set in that 2005 bill of 7.5 billion gallons.\n  What is happening now is you have a lot of those who would invest in \nethanol production in this country pulling back, not knowing what the \nfuture of the industry is. The amendment offered by the Senator from \nNew Mexico, of which Senator Salazar and I are cosponsors, would \nincrease the renewable fuels standard in 2008 to 8.5 billion gallons, \nwhich ramps it up in 2022 to 36 billion gallons. It is an amendment I \nbelieve is desperately needed. We hoped it would be included in the \nEnergy bill. There is a version of it in the Energy bill. It would be \nbetter than what we have today.\n  We believe the amendment offered by the Senator from New Mexico is a \nfar better solution, superior to what is proposed now in the Energy \nbill. I hope we could at least get the language the Senator from New \nMexico has put forward included in the Energy bill, or adopted to the \nfarm bill that is under consideration right now. It is that important \nto the rural economy, to agriculture, and, frankly, there isn't \nanything we do, next to the production title of the farm bill, that \nimpacts agriculture more than does the renewable fuels standard, to \nincrease it to 36 billion gallons by 2022, relying largely on advanced \nbiofuels, cellulosic ethanol. To help us get there, those are all \nimportant things to have.\n  One comment regarding the Energy bill. There is a renewable fuels \nstandard included in that. There are a couple of troublesome provisions \nto many who support the industry. One allows the EPA Administrator to \nessentially modify and grant waivers to the renewable fuels standard, \ndependent upon ``significant renewable feedstock disruption or other \nmarket circumstances.'' In other words, the EPA Administrator has total \ndiscretion when it comes to a waiver of this renewable fuels standard \nin the Energy bill that is currently pending. So the language, as \nproposed by the Senator from New Mexico, would be far superior in terms \nof what this industry needs in terms of market signals and certainty \ngoing forward. So whether that is included in the Energy bill or in \nthis farm bill, it seems that ought to be the direction in which we \nmove in this industry.\n  The other thing I will mention by way of importance, in terms of \nrenewable energy, is not only the renewable fuels standard, which is \ncritical to those who invest in this industry, but that Congress is \ngoing to send a message that the policy incentives put into place in \n2005 are going to be extended and, in fact, expanded; second, that we \nbegin to look at increasing the blends. Right now, about 50 percent of \nthe gasoline in this country is 10 percent ethanol. Because of \ninfrastructure constraints, it is difficult to see us getting further \nthan 11 to 12 billion gallons of ethanol produced and marketed in this \ncountry at the 10-percent level.\n  If we were to increase the blends to 20 or 30 percent, it would \ndramatically increase the market for ethanol in this country. Studies \nare currently underway by the EPA and the Department of Energy that I \nbelieve will in time demonstrate that not only does ethanol not impact \nmaterials compatibility, drivability, and not only does it not affect \nin any way or disadvantage emissions, relative to 10 percent ethanol, I \nthink a lot of studies are actually finding that, ironically, the \nmileage is better at E20 than even traditional gasoline. So those \nstudies are in the works. When they are complete, I hope we can move \nquickly to implement higher blends. That is a critical component in the \nsolution to the renewable fuels industry in this country and to \nlessening our dependence upon foreign sources of energy.\n  Every gallon of ethanol, every bushel of corn we are buying from an \nAmerican farmer means that many fewer dollars we are sending to some \npetronationalistic economy somewhere else in the world whose intentions \nto\n\n[[Page S15049]]\n\nthe United States, as I said, very well could be hostile.\n  This is an important amendment. I hope as the farm bill debate \ncontinues this week and these amendments that are currently pending are \ndisposed of in one form or another, if we do not get a vote on this \namendment that we can get the amendment accepted so that we have this \nmarker in the farm bill in the event something should happen that would \nnot permit the Energy bill to pass and, just as important, getting \nlanguage in the renewable fuel standard that is better than what we see \ncurrently in the Energy bill with regard to the waiver authorities that \nexist for EPA in the current Energy bill and the RFS is included in \nthat.\n  I do not see any other speakers at this moment, Mr. President, so I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to speak \ngenerally about the importance of the farm bill. I wish to speak about \nthree aspects of the bill. The first has to do with rural America, \nwhich is a part of what I have called ``the forgotten America'' since I \ncame to the Senate nearly 3 years ago. Second is to speak briefly about \nthe importance of the conservation provisions which are included in \nthis historic legislation. And finally, I wish to speak generally about \nsome of the renewable energy provisions that are laid out in this bill.\n  First, with respect to what we see happening in rural America, as we \nsee on the chart behind me, there is a lot of red and a lot of yellow. \nThose are counties, some 1,700 counties in the United States of \nAmerica, which have actually declined in population between the years \n2000 and 2006.\n  What happens around this country, as we look at the macroeconomic \nstatistics that affect the United States of America, everybody says \nthat all is hunky-dory and things are going very well. The fact is, for \na long time when we look at places in rural America, there are counties \nand communities that continue to decline in their economic well-being, \nand the very vitality of rural America is threatened. When the vitality \nof rural America is threatened, the food security of this Nation is \nalso threatened. That is why when we have legislation such as the \nlegislation before us, the farm bill, we see Democrats and Republicans \ncoming together, many of us from rural States, many of us wanting to be \nchampions of\n\n[[Page S15050]]\n\nrural America which we believe is so important, we see Democrats and \nRepublicans coming together to say this is a bill which is critical for \nour future and a bill we must have.\n  When we look at those red parts of the United States that are on this \nmap, they are counties, and the people who live there are suffering. \nSome of them are small counties, some of them are huge counties from a \ngeographic point of view. What we will find in those counties will be \npeople who are hard workers and who on average make less than $10,000 \nper capita than their counterparts who happen to live in the bigger \ncities. That is a $10,000 differential in terms of their per capita \nincome.\n  What we will find in those counties is also a disparity in health \ncare. There is less health care available to people who live in those \ncounties than people who happen to live in the larger metropolitan \nareas.\n  We also find a higher cost of living with respect to the prices paid \nfor fuel and a whole host of other items in many of these rural \ncommunities.\n  So I hope, as we work before the Christmas break, that we can \nunderstand this legislation is very important to the forgotten America. \nFor me, what I like to do when I travel around the 64 counties of my \nState, is I like to go to many of these places out in rural Colorado \nwhere I know communities and counties are suffering.\n  We have 64 counties in my State of Colorado. It is a large State, not \nmuch different than South Dakota in many ways. There are many places \nwhere one can drive down the main streets of these communities that \nwere thriving a few years ago and now see half of the main street \nboarded up, and we see the pains of an economy that is suffering.\n  The next picture I am putting up is a picture of Merino, CO. Merino, \nCO, as we can see, is a town in my State which is not having the best \nof economic times. I would say at least half, perhaps three-fourths, of \nthe main street in Merino, CO, today is either for sale or has many of \nits commercial establishments boarded up in the way that is depicted in \nthis picture behind me. It is not only Merino; it is lots of other \nplaces.\n  When you get out into the eastern plains on our major interstate \ncorridors and the town of Brush, CO--here is the town of Brush, CO. \nAgain, this is the main street of Brush, CO, with one of its important \nbuildings for sale. If this was the only building on the main street of \nBrush, CO, that was for sale, one would say that happens all the time; \nwe often see real estate for sale. What happens is, when we go into the \nmain street of Brush, CO, there is a huge percentage of the buildings \non that main street that today are for sale. This is a typical picture \nof community after community across nearly a thousand counties of the \nUnited States of America.\n  I hope one of the statements we can make together as Democrats, led \nby Senator Reid, and as Republicans, led by Senator McConnell, is that \nwe do care about this forgotten America and that we are willing to \ninvest in this forgotten America through the passage of this farm bill.\n  Secondly, I wish to speak about the conservation provisions of this \nfarm bill. All of us who have followed the history of farm programs and \nthe history of conservation in the United States of America know there \nis no greater champion for conservation than Senator Tom Harkin. He \nhas been a champion of the conservation programs in this farm bill from \nday one. This farm bill before the Senate today reflects very \nsignificant additional investments in conservation.\n\n  As my friend from South Dakota said earlier in his comments when \ntalking generally about the farm bill and what it has done for hunters, \nhe said there were 10 million pheasants in the State of South Dakota. \nThat is an incredible contribution for people in our country who love \nto hunt. The Presiding Officer is a great hunter. I am sure he would \nlove to go to South Dakota and get some of those 10 million pheasants. \nThe conservation programs contribute greatly to the quality of life in \nAmerica.\n  For my life, much of it spent as a farmer and as a rancher, I have \nalways said that farmers and ranchers are some of the best \nenvironmentalists because they truly understand the importance of \nfighting for land and for water. They know that at the end of the day, \nunless they take care of the land and water they depend on, next year \ntheir livelihood is going to be taken away from them. So they know they \nhave to take care of their soil. They know they have to take care of \nthe water. They know they have to take care of that place which is the \nvery essence of their livelihood.\n  This farm bill is a historic farm bill in terms of conservation \nbecause it invests more in conservation, in all the traditional \nprograms such as the Conservation Reserve Program, the grasslands \nprogram, and a whole host of other programs that will let us make sure \nwe continue to protect the land and water of America.\n  In this picture behind me, we see one of the conservation programs \nfunded under the EQIP program in my State of Colorado. It is an \nirrigation line ditch to make sure that water is not being wasted in \nthe arid part of my State. For those of us from the western part of the \nUnited States, we know that water truly is the lifeblood of our \ncommunity. They say in Colorado that whiskey is for drinking and water \nis for fighting. That is because we know how precious the commodity of \nwater is in the arid West.\n  Programs such as this conservation program under the EQIP program \nmake sure we are being as efficient as possible in how we use water in \nour communities.\n  It goes beyond how we use water for irrigation, which is what is \ndepicted in that picture, but it is also making sure we are helping \nranchers with water tanks and cross fencing so we can make the most use \nof our resources. Here is a picture of an EQIP project which has put in \nlivestock water tanks and also has put in cross fences in the northern \npart of my State. It is another example of one of our conservation \nprograms.\n  The next picture is of a wetland reserve program near Nathrop, CO. \nThis is a picture of a wetland which was restored under the WRP that \nhas been included in this farm bill and has been significantly \nenhanced. We know the importance of wetlands not only to wildlife but \nalso to water quality. This wetland, which shows the Rocky Mountains \nwith its snow in the background, is one of those wetlands that has been \nmade possible through the investments we are making in the farm bill.\n  Finally, in the conservation area, there is also a tremendous amount \nof training that takes place. This picture behind me is of farmers \ngetting together, going through a training seminar in Colorado to learn \nmore about how they can take care of their farms. It is a very \nsuccessful program which is not only a program underway in my State but \nalso in many other States around the country.\n  I wish to spend a few minutes talking a little bit more about the \nenergy parts of this bill. I wish to talk about how important it is to \nmy State.\n  When we look at what has happened with the energy challenges we face \nin this country, I do believe that is one of those areas where this \nCongress has made significant, positive action over the last several \nyears. We started it through the passage of the 2005 Energy bill, which \nwas led by Senator Domenici and Senator Bingaman. I had the privilege \nof sitting on that committee through many hearings that ended up with \nthe 2005 Energy Policy Act we passed in the Senate. Last year, we \npassed another Energy Policy Act that opened up lease sale 181 in the \ngulf coast and created the Land and Water Conservation Fund which is a \nvery important program.\n  This year we have an additional opportunity to move forward with \npassage of new energy legislation which we are all hoping happens maybe \nas early as this week.\n  In my State, a lot has happened in the last 2 years. When we look at \nall the different aspects of renewable energy, we have done more in \nColorado in a very short period of time than I have seen happen with \nalmost anything else that has come to my State. All of us probably in \nthis Chamber would like to claim that our respective States are \nbecoming the renewable energy capital of the United States. In my State \nof Colorado, it is happening in a lot of different ways, in part \nthrough the national legislation we passed in the Congress and in part \nthrough the initiative of the voters of the State of Colorado through \nthe passage of an RPS which was adopted by the voters in 2004.\n\n[[Page S15051]]\n\n  This is a picture of a wind farm located in Prowers County in Lamar, \nCO. It is one of several wind farms which have sprouted up across my \nState in the last several years. Some people may say these wind farms \nare important, but how much are they doing? In my State, by the end of \nthe year 2008, our hope is that we will have about 1,000 megawatts of \npower being produced from these wind farms that have sprouted up \nthroughout the eastern plains and northern Colorado. And 1,000 \nmegawatts of power, for those who happen to be watching today, if we \nwant to put that in layman's terms, is approximately the amount of \nelectricity that would be generated from three coal-fired \npowerplants. Well, in my State of Colorado, 2\\1/2\\, 3 years ago, there \nwas almost zero electrical generation coming from wind. Today, we are \non the verge of approaching a thousand megawatts of electrical power \nfrom wind. So we are just beginning to tap that potential.\n\n  And it is not just from Colorado. I know in the plains of both \nDakotas, as well as in Wyoming and a whole host of other States, the \nState of Texas and others, we see wind energy becoming a very integral \npart of the portfolio for renewable energy for our future. This farm \nbill creates significant incentives for us to continue to enhance our \nefforts with respect to wind power.\n  Here is another quick example of a smaller set of wind turbines that \nare now up and functioning in the State of Colorado. We have included \nin this legislation amendments that will allow for a credit to be \nprovided for what we call small wind microturbines. Those are \nmicroturbines that will produces less than 50 megawatts of power. \nActually, that is less than 50 kilowatts of power. And with those small \nmicroturbines there will be enough electricity generated from these \nsmall wind generators to be able to provide the energy that is needed \nat a farm or a small industrial park or those kinds of smaller uses.\n  So there is a whole future, which is a very positive future, on wind \nenergy that is being embraced in this legislation. And as we have \nspoken about energy on the floor this afternoon, we also have spoken \nabout ethanol and cellulosic ethanol.\n  Several years ago--it was less than 3 years ago--after having been \nsworn in with my colleague from South Dakota, I went back to Colorado \nand said: There is a lot of excitement from many of my colleagues about \nethanol and about the future of biofuels in America. I want to go and \nvisit an ethanol plant somewhere in my State of Colorado.\n  I was told at the time that we did not have ethanol plants in my \nState of significant size. Well, that has changed dramatically just in \nthe last 2 years, in part because of the passage of the 2005 Energy \nPolicy Act.\n  Today, we produce over 100 million gallons of ethanol a year. We are \nat 100 million gallons of ethanol per year. The picture behind me is a \npicture of an ethanol plant in Sterling, CO. When I went there 2 years \nago, there was nothing but an empty field outside of the town of \nSterling. The town of Sterling is located in a place that is part of \nthat America that struggles to keep going forward.\n  I went back a year later and what is now a $50 million ethanol plant \nhas been constructed there. It is an ethanol plant that has produced \njobs for the local community. There are over 20 workers who work at \nthis ethanol plant all the time. It has been good for the farmers \nbecause they have an alternative market for their corn which they bring \nto this ethanol plant. It has been good for the cattle feeders because \nthey take the feedstock after the ethanol has been taken, then they \nfeed it to the cattle in Sterling, CO. So this ethanol plant is only \none of four ethanol plants that we now have throughout the State of \nColorado, and it is our hope in the years ahead that we will have many \nmore of these kinds of plants that we will actually see in \nconstruction.\n  But as we know, through the testimony we had in the Energy Committee, \nthe testimony we have had in front of the Agriculture Committee as \nwell, there are limitations as to how much ethanol we can actually \nproduce through these kinds of plants, where that ethanol is derived \nfrom corn. That is why these advanced biofuels and how we move forward \nwith this renewable fuels standard is so essential. That is why in the \nRFS that we included in our energy legislation we recognized that there \nwas a 15-billion-gallon limitation that would be coming from these kind \nof ethanol plants. And, therefore, when we talked about the advanced \nbiofuels, we meant we would get 21 million gallons of advanced biofuels \nfrom cellulosic ethanol. And that truly is where the future for America \nis, in my view, Mr. President, relative to making sure we are able to \ngrow our way to energy independence for our country.\n  We are now at a point where we are asking our colleagues to come and \noffer amendments. We have had a number of amendments that were offered \nand are pending from last week. We have also had a number of amendments \nwhich have been offered and are pending here today, and we would invite \nour colleagues to come down and speak about the farm bill and to offer \nany amendments they might have.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3596 to Amendment No. 3500\n\n  (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to establish a \n  pilot program under which agricultural producers may establish and \n  contribute to tax-exempt far savings accounts in lieu of obtaining \n federally subsidized crop insurance or noninsured crop assistance, to \n    provide for contributions to such accounts by the Secretary of \nAgriculture, to specify the situations in which amounts may be paid to \n  producers from such accounts, and to limit the total amount of such \n   distributions to a producer during a taxable year, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Sessions, I ask \nunanimous consent to call up amendment No. 3596 and ask that it be \nreported and temporarily set aside.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Reserving the right to object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, we do not have an objection with respect \nto the amendment which was offered by the Senator from South Dakota.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the clerk will \nreport the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Thune], for Mr. \n     Sessions, proposes an amendment numbered 3596 to amendment \n     No. 3500.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Thursday, December 6, \n2007, under ``Text of Amendments.'')\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3569 to Amendment No. 3500\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Stevens, I ask \nunanimous consent to call up amendment No. 3569 and that it be reported \nand temporarily set aside.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Thune], for Mr. Stevens, \n     Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Lott, and Mr. Smith, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3569 to amendment No. 3500.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To make commercial fishermen eligible for certain operating \n                                 loans)\n\n       On page 778, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       (c) Commercial Fishing.--Section 343 of the Consolidated \n     Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1991) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by inserting ``and, in the case of \n     subtitle B, commercial fishing''\n\n[[Page S15052]]\n\n     before the period at the end of each of paragraphs (1) and \n     (2); and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(c) Definition of Farm.--In subtitle B, the term `farm' \n     includes a commercial fishing enterprise.''.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I think we are almost up to our 20 \namendments. I don't know of anybody else coming down on our side, \nalthough I know of a couple of amendments out there that may get \noffered. But we are very close to meeting the allocation we have under \nthe agreement, and so I suspect if there are others who want to have \ntheir amendments called up, if they can get them down here, we will get \nthem put in the queue and made pending so that when everyone is back \ntomorrow we can, hopefully, move to consideration based on those \namendments, start getting them voted on, disposed of, and, hopefully, \nget to a final vote on the bill by the end of the week. That is my hope \nand certainly the hope of the Senator from Colorado, and I hope that is \nthe view that is shared by our respective leaders as well.\n  I would say, too, again, by way of general observation on the bill, \nas my colleague from Colorado has talked about, many of the different \ntitles in the bill--and we have both covered a lot of the energy \nprovisions which he has spoken at some length about--the conservation \ntitle, the commodity title, and as we were discussing earlier today, 67 \npercent of the funding of the bill is in nutrition programs, food \nassistance, and other types of programs; about 9-plus percent in \nconservation, about 14 percent, actually, in the commodity title, which \nsupports production of agriculture, and then there is a rural \ndevelopment title. But in any event, it is a fairly balanced bill.\n  I think much of the emphasis on this bill, a new emphasis at least, \nhas to do with what the Senator from Colorado had talked about earlier, \nand that is the renewable energy industry. I don't know that there are \na lot of differences between this bill, if we can get it through the \nSenate, and what has already passed the House.\n  There are some things that are different in the two bills, but I \nthink these are very reconcilable bills. And I guess my hope has been \nall along that we would be able to get a bill to conference and on the \nPresident's desk before the end of the year. That may be a little \noptimistic, but I think it is important we, at least in the Senate, act \non our version of the bill, get it passed, clear that hurdle, and \nhopefully put us on a glidepath to getting a bill signed into law if \nnot by the end of the year, then sometime early next year so that \nproducers can begin to make decisions about next year; that we don't \nhave to go through the exercise of passing an extension of the 2002 \nbill.\n  I think we have a good bill before us. And now that we finally have \nan agreement to move forward with amendments, I hope we can get this \nbill through the process and perhaps passed by the Senate if not this \nweek certainly early next week, and that will put us on a pathway to \ngetting a bill signed into law by early next year.\n  As I said before, in addition to the farmers who are looking and \nanticipating the passage of this bill, and those who depend upon other \ntitles in the bill, the renewable energy industry does need some action \non some of the provisions not only in this bill but that are pending in \nthe Energy bill. A renewable fuels standard needs to be enacted either \nas a part of the Energy bill or the farm bill.\n  The Senate passed earlier this year as part of its Energy bill a 36-\nbillion-gallon renewable fuels standard by the year 2022. The House did \nnot have a provision on a renewable fuels standard under its version of \ntheir bill. After the two sides got together, the Energy bill now \ncontains a renewable fuels standard; although, as I mentioned earlier, \none with some provisions and some conditions imposed on it that I think \nmake it less preferable to many of us than the renewable fuels standard \namendment that has been offered to the farm bill.\n  But to the point my colleague from Colorado made about other forms of \nenergy, we, too, in South Dakota have enormous potential to benefit \nfrom wind energy. We have wind energy. And I have seen studies--in \nfact, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado suggests \nthat South Dakota is the windiest State in the Nation. We have the best \nwind for wind energy development, exceeding all other States in the \ncountry. Many of our constituents would probably argue that it exceeds \nthe amount of wind and hot air that comes out of Washington, DC, but if \nyou look at where the end wind in this country is generated, it is in \nthat middle section of the United States, and that, too, holds enormous \npotential for us to get away from depending upon foreign sources of \nenergy.\n  Many of our constituents in the Midwest rely on fuel oil for their \nwinter heating. You have, of course, a lot of energy that is generated \nfrom sources that are less environmentally friendly than wind energy. \nAnd so I would hope the provisions in this farm bill that provide \nincentives for small wind, and then some provisions in the Energy bill \nthat include incentives for larger wind farms and types of projects--\nproduction tax credits, the clean renewable energy bond program--that \nthose, too, could get enacted and we could continue to move forward \ntoward the development of more renewable energy in this country and \nless dependence upon foreign sources of energy from countries that \nwould do us harm.\n  I again commend to my colleagues, when we get to a final vote, that \nthe energy title of this farm bill is critically important--not to just \nthose who are investors in ethanol plants but, I would argue, to our \nenergy security and to our national security as well.\n  I don't see anybody else here to offer amendments. If the Senator \nfrom Colorado would like to make some comments?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I note that the unanimous consent \nagreement under which we are operating in consideration of the farm \nbill allows for 20 amendments from the Republican side and 20 \namendments from the Democratic side. I understand we are, on the \nRepublican side, almost at the number 20 of amendments that have been \noffered and called up. On the Democratic side, there have been four \namendments that have been offered and called up. If any of our \ncolleagues are here and want to come down and help us move this process \nalong, we urge them to come to the floor and offer and call up their \namendments.\n  The fact that we are down to 20 amendments on the Republican side, 20 \namendments on the Democratic side, is a very good step in the right \ndirection. There were approximately 300 amendments that were filed on \nthis bill. There is no way in which we were going to work our way \nthrough those 300 amendments, so narrowing down that universe in the \nway we have has been very helpful and hopefully will get us to where we \nall want to get; that is, to get to a farm bill that can be finalized \nin this Chamber so we can start working toward getting a farm bill that \nwill help guide the farm policy of this country for the next 5 years.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 3551 and 3553 En Bloc\n\n  Mr. THUNE. On behalf of Senator Alexander, I ask unanimous consent to \ncall up two amendments--the first amendment is No. 3551 and the second \namendment is No. 3553--and that those amendment also be reported and \ntemporarily set aside.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Reserving the right to object, I will suggest the \nabsence of quorum for a few minutes so I can study the amendments.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendments.\n\n[[Page S15053]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Thune], for Mr. \n     Alexander, proposes amendments numbered 3551 and 3553, en \n     bloc.\n\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3551\n\n(Purpose: To increase funding for the Initiative for Future Agriculture \n                   and Food Systems, with an offset)\n\n       In section 401(b)(3) of the Agricultural Research, \n     Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998 (as amended by \n     section 7201(a)), redesignate subparagraphs (A) and (B) as \n     subparagraphs (B) and (C), respectively, and insert before \n     subparagraph (B) (as so redesignated) the following:\n       ``(A) In general.--Of the funds of the Commodity Credit \n     Corporation, the Secretary shall transfer to the Account--\n       ``(i) $24,000,000 for fiscal year 2010; and\n       ``(ii) $25,000,000 for each of fiscals year 2011 and 2012.\n       Strike section 12302.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3553\n\n   (Purpose: To limit the tax credit for small wind energy property \nexpenditures to property placed in service in connection with a farm or \n                         rural small business)\n\n       On page 1465, strike line 6 through page 1469, line 13 and \n     insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 12301.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator temporarily \ntaking the chair for me at this time so I can make a few brief comments \non the farm bill. I thank everyone who has been involved in getting us \nto this point. It has been challenging, but we have a product, as you \nknow, that came out of committee unanimously.\n  I thank Senator Harkin and Senator Chambliss for their leadership in \nbringing us to this point. I also thank Senator Conrad for his budget \nexpertise that helped get us to this point, and so many other people \nwho have worked very hard to create a product that we all can be very \nproud of.\n  We do not only support traditional agriculture, which is very \nimportant--people in my State think of automobiles, particularly as we \nare talking about the energy debate now--but our second largest \nindustry is agriculture. So this is a very important bill from the \nstandpoint of the economy of Michigan.\n  We have traditional agricultural programs that are supported in this \nlegislation which I am very pleased about. But we also do something \nvery important. We take a step toward the future in this bill in a \nnumber of ways.\n  Also very important to me and Michigan, and I appreciate my \ncolleagues supporting the effort, is to have half of the crops grown by \nfarmers in the United States, fruit and vegetable growers, called \nspecialty crops, included in a very real way for the first time in this \nfarm bill. That is historic. We are talking about many family farmers, \nfolks who are growing the apples and asparagus and the cherries and the \nblueberries and the oranges and all of the foods we want our children \nto eat.\n  We tell our children: Eat your fruits and vegetables. Well, this farm \nbill for the first time makes a permanent place, a permanent home for \nthose growers. I appreciate my colleagues who have worked with me in \norder to be able to make that happen.\n  We also take a turn to the future with alternative energy. I thank \nthe distinguished Presiding Officer from Colorado for his passion \naround the issue of alternative energy as well as my distinguished \ncolleague from South Dakota for his interest and leadership around \nthese issues as well. We all join together in understanding that we \nwant to be able to say: Buy your fuel from middle America instead of \nthe Middle East. That would create energy independence. It would be \ngreat for our\n\n[[Page S15054]]\n\nfarmers. It is great for new technologies.\n  We also are very proud to be making the automobiles that will use \nthat new fuel. So this farm bill is an energy and security bill, an \neffort in a very major way to turn us to that future through various \nkinds of incentives and supports and research and cellulosic ethanol \nthat we know is the future.\n  We not only want to make ethanol from corn--and we grow a lot of corn \nin Michigan, but we also grow a lot of sugar beets, we have a lot of \nwood byproducts, we have a lot of switchgrass available and other \nthings that we can use for the technology to be developed and supported \nthrough this farm bill to be able to create energy.\n  That is important. This is about the future. I believe part of \nreform, when we talk about reforming the farm bill, we talk about more \nfocus on our fruit and vegetable growers, more focus on energy crops, \nmore focus on nutrition, and the importance of being able to support \nour farmers markets and community gardens, the ability for people to \nhave access to nutritious food in the United States.\n  This is also an important bill for conservation. Again, I know our \nPresiding Officer cares very much about this issue. Our chairman has \nbeen a passionate leader, focusing on conservation. This bill does it \nin a very real way. I thank the chairman as well for including language \nthat addresses Great Lakes water erosion, soil runoff into the Great \nLakes, into our water systems, a very critical issue. I appreciate him \nincluding language from a broad strategic effort that was put together \nwith all eight States and our friends in Canada and the administration \nand others to put together a strategy to protect our Great Lakes \nwaters. Part of that is reflected as it relates to our conservation \nportion of the farm bill. So there are numerous ways in which this \nparticular legislation, as comprehensive as it is, makes sense.\n  I would also be remiss if I did not mention rural development. I do \nnot think there is a town in northern Michigan, southern Michigan, in \nthe Upper Peninsula, that has not benefitted by some help with water \nand sewer or housing development or small business loans or the ability \nto buy a needed fire truck, to be able to meet rural needs.\n  I am very proud of the fact that we have expanded and included the \nbroadband access. We know, just as the telephone system was made more \nvaluable by making sure the farmer at the end of the road was able to \nbe connected by telephone, we need to be sure that every person in \nevery corner of the country is connected and has access to broadband. \nThis legislation does that as well.\n  There are numerous provisions in this legislation that relate to \nsupporting and developing rural America, supporting new technologies, \nsupporting the communities, protecting our natural resources and \nconservation, focusing on alternative fuels and energy independence at \na time when we have never needed it more; also the wonderful \npartnership that we have established between our nutrition programs, \nschools, seniors, community programs, and our fruit and vegetable \ngrowers who are growing that nutritious food that we want to make sure \ngets to our families.\n  I hope we will come together. It is very positive that we finally \nbroke through the logjam, and we are together here on the floor moving \nforward this bipartisan bill. It is my hope we will be able to move \nthrough these amendments and do it in a way that allows us to complete \nthis bill this week and have the Senate's vision for the future of \nrural America and energy and nutrition, conservation, our support for \ntraditional agriculture, have all of those visions out there together \nbefore we leave for the end of the year. This is important what we have \ndone together. It is an important piece of work. I am pleased that we \nare now moving to that next step. I am hopeful that working together, \nwe will be able to get that done this week.\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, we have had a number of folks here today \nwho have spoken to different aspects of the farm bill. All are \nrelevant, and everybody has a unique interest in this legislation. Many \npeople come to a farm bill representing agriculture States and, \ntherefore, have a keen interest in the commodity title of the bill, \nthat part of the bill that directly affects production agriculture. \nMany are involved in food assistance programs and, therefore, \ninterested in that aspect.\n  I have spoken at some length today, as has my colleague from \nColorado, about the energy title of the bill which we also believe to \nbe critically important to the future of agriculture and rural \neconomies. I do want to speak to one other aspect of the bill that \nSenator Salazar also spoke to earlier today. That is the conservation \ntitle.\n  One of the aspects of this bill that is as critical to production \nagriculture as the commodity title is the conservation title. The \nconservation title of the farm bill comprises only about 9 percent of \nits total cost, yet it potentially affects more than 350 million acres \nof land. This is a photo of a piece of ground in South Dakota. This \npicture was taken in 2007. It is a great example of the role played by \nthe farm bill's conservation title. The best land in this photo is \nplanted with corn, the low-lying wetland area being enrolled in a \nConservation Reserve Program. We have an example of crop production and \nconservation working hand in hand. You have CRP in the foreground, \nwetland and corn ground in the background. The CRP on this farm and the \nmillion-and-a-half acres that are enrolled in CRP in South Dakota add \n10 million pheasants and $153 million to South Dakota's economy every \nsingle year. This year's record corn crop in South Dakota at 556 \nmillion bushels is worth an additional $1.8 billion to South Dakota's \nfarmers.\n  I wanted to contrast that and focus on another picture taken in South \nDakota in 2007. This one actually, believe it or not, was taken in \nMarch of this year. If you look at this, at first glance you would \nbelieve that was a picture that was taken during the ``dirty \nthirties,'' the time of the Great Depression. Actually it is the result \nof native sod in South Dakota that was cropped because crop insurance \nprovided an unintended incentive to convert marginal pastureland or \nnative sod to cropland. This picture sends a stronger message than any \nwords could about the inherent need to take care of our land. The \ntopsoil and the fence line and ditch along this South Dakota field took \nliterally millions of years to create and one dust storm to remove. The \ndamage you see here simply cannot be undone.\n  A sod-saver provision in the farm bill we are considering will \nprohibit anyone from converting native sod to cropland. What this sod-\nsaver provision will do is eliminate the incentives found in current \nFederal farm policy that encourage unwise farming practices which \nresult in the consequences that are shown in this photo.\n  The next photo is a picture that is an example of some of the native \nsod that is being converted to cropland in South Dakota. For the past \n100 years, millions of acres of prairie have been converted to \nproductive farmland. Most native sod that can be productively farmed in \nSouth Dakota and other prairie States has already been converted to \ncropland. We faced a shortage of money to write this farm bill. I don't \nbelieve it is wise to use Federal funds to pay for crop insurance and \ndisaster programs on this type of land. If the farmer who owns this \nland wants to crop it, wants to farm it, he or she is free to do so. \nBut let's not subsidize it.\n  The next picture comes from South Dakota as well. This was a couple \nyears ago in 2005. Dust storms, obviously, were not limited to the \n1930s. This picture was taken in South Dakota in 2005. Once again, the \nconsequences of unwise land stewardship practices are disturbingly \nevident. During the 1930s, South Dakota received billions of tons of \nKansas and Oklahoma topsoil, much of it still in place in fence lines \nand fields. The programs we have drafted in the conservation title of \nthis farm bill, if funded adequately, will ensure that Kansas and\n\n[[Page S15055]]\n\nOklahoma farmers no longer see their topsoil blow to South Dakota, and \nSouth Dakota farmers will keep their topsoil in their fields and not in \nthe ditches and fence lines, as we see in this picture.\n  I want to emphasize this one more time: Production agriculture and \nconservation should not compete. Rather, they should complement each \nother. Every agricultural area in this country is blessed with \nproductive land and land that needs help to keep from polluting the \nwater we drink and the air we breathe. I ask those who are so critical \nof this farm bill to take a close look at the conservation title and \nwhat it does for all Americans. In spite of the budget cuts that made \ndrafting this farm bill more difficult than writing any other farm bill \nhas been, I am pleased that my colleagues and I have been able to come \nup with a farm bill with a sound conservation title.\n  I want to point out once more the benefits of the conservation title \nof the farm bill. First, it protects and enhances our soil and land. \nSecondly, it helps provide an economic alternative to placing costly \nfertilizer, seed, and chemicals on unproductive cropland. It also \nenhances recreation and boosts local economies, as is true in South \nDakota, with a very robust recreation industry that is created by the \nabundance of pheasants we have had in the past few years and the $153 \nmillion that it contributes to South Dakota's economy. I believe it is \nimportant that we take a breather from some of the controversy that \nsurrounds farm bill debates and focus on the farm bill's proven \ncapabilities to enhance rural America and to improve our Nation's water \nand soil. The conservation title of this farm bill will do that. This \nis one of many reasons that this farm bill deserves the support of our \ncolleagues.\n  I don't think there is much we do around here in terms of public \npolicy that has as much impact as what we do in this farm bill in the \nconservation title when it comes to environmental stewardship. The \nconservation title is so important. The programs that have been \nenumerated, the Conservation Reserve Program, the Wetlands Reserve \nProgram, the Grasslands Reserve Program, the Environmental Quality \nImprovement Program, or EQIP, which is used by livestock producers, all \nthese programs are designed to lessen the impact of soil erosion, wind \nerosion, and improve the quality of our water. The sod-buster provision \nin this farm bill also moves us toward a policy that discourages those \nfrom cropping areas that should not be cropped simply to take advantage \nof programs such as crop insurance.\n  So the conservation title in this farm bill is a critically important \ncomponent of the overall farm bill and one that I hope people, as they \nlook at the farm bill in its totality, will take a very good, hard look \nat.\n  Nationwide, without a conservation title, we would have 13.5 million \nfewer pheasants, 450 million tons of topsoil disappearing every single \nyear, 2.2 million fewer ducks, an additional 170,000 miles of \nunprotected streams, and 40 million fewer acres of wildlife habitat.\n  Again, if you look at what can happen when conservation programs and \nproduction are used to complement each other--and here, as shown in \nthis picture, is another example of a field in the background and a \nCRP--or grasslands--in the foreground. But that is the kind of balance \nwe try to achieve in this farm bill.\n  The conservation title in this farm bill is important. It is only 9 \npercent of the money, but it impacts 350 million acres of land in this \ncountry and adds so much to our economy and to the concerns we have \nabout protecting and preserving our environment.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized to speak as in morning business for as much time as I may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I know for most of the day today we \nhave been speaking about the importance of the 2007 farm bill, which is \nabout food, about fiber, and about our fuel security. It is a very \nimportant piece of legislation. We are very hopeful we will be able to \nget a farm bill completed very soon that can then go to the President \nfor his signature.\n  I wish to spend a few minutes talking about another piece of \nlegislation which many of us have spent a great deal of time working on \nover the last year under the leadership of Senator Bingaman; and that \nis the Energy bill which came through this Chamber with a very \nsignificant, bipartisan vote and which is a very good bill that moves \nus forward into the new era of a clean energy economy for the United \nStates that will help us lead the world on how we can embrace the clean \nenergy economy for our country.\n  From my point of view, when I look at the reasons why we need to move \nforward with this clean energy economy, it comes down to three very \nsimple reasons. The first is our national security, the second is our \nenvironmental security, and the third is the economic opportunities for \nour country.\n  On the first of those principles, when we think about what has \nhappened to America since the 1970s and beyond, it is that America has \nslept. America has slept while we put our heads and our necks in the \nnoose of the powers from foreign countries that are the petropowers \nthat essentially control the oil resources of our country.\n  Many of us will remember when President Richard Nixon stood before \nthe country and coined the term ``energy independence.'' His view was \nthat because of the formation of OPEC, we in the United States of \nAmerica were in a position where what we were doing was abandoning the \npossibility of our independence because of the formation of this very \npowerful cartel called OPEC. So he said: We have to be energy \nindependent.\n  Many of us in my generation will remember the nighttime prime-time \nspeech President Carter gave where he spoke about the moral imperative \nof energy independence. He called it the equivalent of war, that it had \nthe same kind of moral equivalency in terms of us moving forward with \nenergy independence.\n  Yet what has happened from the 1970s, through the 1980s, through the \n1990s, and here as we begin this new 21st century, is the fact that we \nhave gone from a point where we were importing 30 percent of our oil \nfrom foreign countries to the point where today, in March of this year, \n2007, we imported 67 percent of our oil from foreign countries. That is \n67 percent of our oil from foreign countries. So when you think about \nwhat has happened, those warnings and the visions that were set out by \nPresident Carter and President Nixon simply have not materialized. The \nUnited States of America has had a failed policy on energy, and it is \nhigh time that we in Washington, DC, in our Nation's Capital, take the \nbull by the horns and put us in a position where we can move forward \nwith a new ethic and a new set of programs that will get us to energy \nindependence.\n\n  Yes, this President--with whom I disagree on a number of different \nissues--came to the joint session of Congress in his last two State of \nthe Union addresses, and he talked about the addiction of the United \nStates to oil and how it was time for us to get rid of our addiction to \nforeign oil. Well, he is right in that concept. Now, what we need to do \nis to have a set of programs that gets rid of that addiction to foreign \noil. Our farm bill does that, as my friend from South Dakota spoke \nabout, and as I spoke about earlier, because we have a very robust \nenergy title in this farm bill. But the energy legislation which was \npassed out of this body a few months ago also is a very good step in \nthat direction because of the significant components that are included \nin it.\n  Now, when I look at the foreign policy issues--I, like most of my \ncolleagues in the Senate, have traveled to the Middle East. I have \ntraveled to Iraq three times in the last 3 years. I have been on the \nborder between Lebanon and Israel, looking down at Hezbollah \nencampments. For all of us who are concerned about what is going to \nhappen to the United States and its future, I think we all recognize \nthe foreign policy implications of our addiction to oil.\n\n[[Page S15056]]\n\nI asked myself--when I looked down at the Hezbollah encampments where I \nsaw Hamas activities--where is that money coming from to fuel these \narmies to be able to be created, and where is the money coming from \nthat is giving to them the kinds of armaments that they have today? The \nmoney is coming from us here in America as we pay $3 and $4 a gallon \nfor gasoline or for diesel and $89 to $100 now for every barrel of oil \nthat is imported into this country. We are creating a wealth transfer \nfrom America to those petro nations that don't have the interests of \nthe Western World and certainly not the interests of the United States \nat heart. So we are compromising our foreign policy by this addiction \nto foreign oil. That inescapable force should bring together \nprogressives and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans, to work \ntogether on a real agenda for energy independence.\n  It was only a short few days after I arrived in Washington that I \nreceived a visit from a conservative and a progressive in my office who \nasked me if I would join a number of my colleagues on an agenda called \nthe Set America Free agenda. Those friends who came to talk to me that \nday were my former Senator and good friend from Colorado, Tim Wirth, \nalong with C. Boyden Gray, who is one of the best known conservatives \nin this country. They said it was time for us to start working \ntogether--progressives and conservatives, Republicans and Democrats--on \nan agenda to Set America Free. So the inescapable force of our own \nforeign policy and our need to be an independent America, that is \nindependent from these forces of the Middle East and Venezuela--it is \nimportant for us to make sure we move forward with a strong program on \nenergy independence.\n  The second principle at stake in the energy legislation which is now \nunder discussion has to do with our environmental security. The time \nfor us to argue about whether global warming is here I think has \npassed. I think the scientific community concluded long ago that the \nissue of global warming was a real issue. Yes, we will have debates on \nthe floor of the Senate. There are debates I know that were conducted \nin the EPW Committee in the Senate just last week about what is the \nbest way to move forward. But I think everyone has concluded we do need \nto deal with the issue. We do need to somehow formulate the best \napproach of how we are going to move forward to deal with the reality \nof global warming because otherwise it puts the planet and puts \ncivilization very much in jeopardy.\n  So we have foreign policy and our national security, we have \nenvironmental security which compels us to act, and then we have the \neconomic security of our Nation and the economic opportunities that a \nclean energy economy also embraces. We have spoken about some of those \nopportunities on the floor of the Senate today. Some of those \nopportunities I have seen blossom in my own State of Colorado over the \nlast 2 years in a way that I am very proud of, but I am also proud of \nthe fact that they are also blossoming in other places around the \ncountry. The National Renewable Energy Lab in Golden, CO, is truly one \nof the crown jewels on renewable energy and efficiency. It is a place \nwhich has been visited by Democrats and Republicans alike.\n  Senator Harkin, as the chairman of our committee, actually in the \nformation of the farm bill, spent some time at the National Renewable \nEnergy Lab in Golden, CO, as well as those who visited it, as President \nBush did a year and a half or 2 years ago, found the best in technology \nin terms of energy. They will tell you the only limitation we have in \nterms of how far we can go with the renewable energy revolution is the \nlimitation that we impose upon ourselves. When you ask them to tell you \ncandidly whether we can be in a position where we can develop 30 \npercent of our energy from renewable energy resources by the year 2020, \nthey will tell you that if you want to, we can, in fact, do it. So the \nscientists who have the best knowledge on the research and the \ntechnology tell us that a lot is possible in the renewable energy \nequation.\n\n  Now, because we have developed these technologies, we are also seeing \na lot of economic activity throughout our country. In my State, again, \nin Colorado, when you go to the land of the turquoise skies, my native \nSan Luis Valley where the Sun shines about 350 days of the year, we \nhave the largest solar electrical generating plant now in existence in \nthe world. There are other efforts that are underway in places such as \nBakersfield, CA, where a company there within the next 2 years will be \nable to have completed the construction of a solar electrical \npowerplant that will generate 175 megawatts from one powerplant. So \nthere is tremendous capacity underway that is being built all around \nthe country as we harness the power of the Sun.\n  We are also harnessing the power of the wind, as I said. In my State, \nwe are on the verge of getting to the point where we can generate 1,000 \nmegawatts of power from the wind. We are not stopping with the power of \nthe wind. We are moving forward with ethanol and a whole host of other \nthings that are happening in my State. So there is tremendous economic \nopportunity for America as we embrace a new energy future for this \ncountry.\n  So I believe the forces that drive the new clean energy economy for \nAmerica, again, are national security, environmental security, and \neconomic opportunity--very simple, very fundamental principles that \nshould guide our actions in the Senate. When we talk to experts who are \ninvolved in this field, they can get very excited about it because in \ntheir eyes, what they see is salvation not only for our country but \nalso for civilization in terms of how we handle this very important \nsignature issue for the 21st century.\n  I want to spend a few minutes speaking about the Energy bill that we \ncrafted in the Energy Committee which was amended with the Finance \nCommittee provisions on the floor of the Senate. From my point of view, \nthere were five key aspects to that legislation. The first was the \nincrease in efficiency standards, the increase in CAFE standards which \nhave not been revised now for 30 years in this country. The second was \na renewable fuels standard that will help us usher in this biofuels \nrevolution for our country. The third is dealing with global warming by \ngetting an understanding of how we can sequester carbon here within our \ncountry. The fourth is a renewable electrical standard or a renewable \nportfolio standard across the country. The fifth are the tax provisions \nthat essentially function as a jet engine which allow us to move much \nof our policy forward that we articulated in that bill.\n  I am hopeful that as we move forward we will not lose sight of these \nkey measures of the legislation and that we get as close to as much of \nthese key components of this legislation enacted into law as we can. I \nknow if the discussions that are taking place now between the \nleadership of the House and the Senate are successful, many of these \naspects of the legislation will, in fact, be addressed so we have the \n60 votes to get a good bill out of the Senate and then get a bill on to \nthe President's desk that the President will sign.\n  I will make just one final comment on one of those five key aspects, \nand that, again, is the renewable fuels standard. The renewable fuels \nstandard which we set at 36 billion gallons in that legislation that we \npassed out of this body is a very good piece of legislation. I do not \nbelieve the Senate should compromise on that renewable fuels standard \nat all. We went through a very thoughtful process to come up with that \n36-billion-gallon standard. We had experts from around the country, \nincluding from the National Renewable Energy Lab, coming in and talking \nto us about how we could achieve the limitation of corn-based ethanol \nat 15 billion gallons. We also heard from experts who tell us we are \nwithin a year or two away from being able to open the door to the \ncommercialization of cellulosic ethanol.\n  We made the determination that is where the future of our energy \nindependence lies--in the area of biofuels and transportation. So we \nsaid we can produce in a new RFS 36 billion gallons. That is a \nquintupling of the current renewable fuels standard which we currently \nhave in place. That is the correct number because that is what the \nscience will support. We know that because 15 billion gallons will come \nfrom corn, and 21 billion gallons will come from the advanced biofuels \nwhich we are pushing in that legislation.\n\n[[Page S15057]]\n\n  So I hope those who are involved in dealing with the renewable fuels \nstandard in the legislation which is currently under negotiation \nunderstand the importance of the RFS and how much work went into coming \nup with that 36-billion-gallon-a-year RFS that came out of the Senate \nEnergy Committee which was adopted with a broad bipartisan vote on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  I believe the people of America would be delighted if we in the \nSenate, working with the House of Representatives, were able to \ncomplete the legislation on these two very important issues: to \ncomplete the farm bill and to get it done before Christmas, and to \ncomplete a good energy bill that will help us move forward toward \nenergy independence and address these key, critical policy challenges \nthat confront us. It is a signature issue for the 21st century. The \nclean energy economy is something which we must embrace. It is \nsomething we do in both pieces of legislation that we have talked about \ntoday, the farm bill, as well as the 2007 Energy bill.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR.

Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3539\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, on behalf of Senator Durbin, I call up \namendment No. 3539.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Salazar], for Mr. Durbin, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3539.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR.

TERMINATION OF AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT INSPECTIONS \n                   AND ISSUE REGULATIONS.\n\n       (a) Termination of Authority.--The authority to conduct \n     inspections and issue regulations under the provisions of law \n     described in subsection (b) shall terminate on the date that \n     is 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Provisions of Law.--The provisions of law referred to \n     in subsection (a) are--\n       (1) the Poultry Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 451 et \n     seq.);\n       (2) the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601 et \n     seq.);\n       (3) the Egg Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 1031 et \n     seq.); and\n       (4) chapter IV of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \n     (21 U.S.C. 341 et seq.).\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I am pleased that the leadership of \nboth parties has resolved the issues surrounding consideration of the \nfarm bill. I have been extremely frustrated with the delay up to this \npoint. In my home State, thousands of Wisconsinites are waiting for \nthis bill to pass as they prepare for the coming year. This is true for \nfarmers, of course, but also for the hard-working people who run and \ndepend on food pantries and other hunger relief organizations.\n  I know how hard the committee, particularly Chairman Harkin and \nRanking Member Chambliss, worked to draft this extensive bill. I am \npleased that this bill would make some significant improvements over \ncurrent policy in a number of areas. I have heard some suggest that, if \nthis impasse continued, Congress ought to just extend the status quo \nfor 2 years. Frankly, this would be a shirking of our responsibility, \nand would ignore the improvements made in committee, as well as those \nthat have already been, or may still be, added during Senate \nconsideration. For example, the Senate committee bill would increase \nthe reimbursement rate for the Milk Income Loss Contract, or MILC, \nprogram to 45 percent in 2009. Many Wisconsin farmers will benefit from \nthis important increase in the MILC program's responsible safety net \nfor small and medium dairy farmers.\n  I am acutely aware of the importance of the support programs for \nAmerican farmers. However, there is plenty of room for improvement, and \nI know many of my colleagues agree. Many of us, on both sides of the \naisle, have filed relevant amendments that would make reasonable \nchanges to existing programs and spend our limited money more \nresponsibly. I have crafted a moderate reform amendment that I am glad \nto have combined with a similar effort by Senator Menendez. I hope our \namendment will be considered by this body before the bill is passed, \nand look forward to supporting other reform efforts. The Senate should \nbe considering these and other amendments to improve the bill, such as \nthe payment limit amendment offered by Senators Dorgan and Grassley.\n  The committee bill also provides significant investments in \nconservation, nutrition, and rural development programs. I especially \nwant to highlight the nutrition programs, as the beneficiaries of Food \nStamps, TEFAP, and other such programs would be among the first to see \nthe benefits of a new farm bill, at a time when food and fuel prices \nare on the rise. The committee bill does much for these programs--\nincluding increasing the standard deduction for Food Stamps and \nindexing benefits to inflation. I am encouraged by these important \ninvestments that provide a total increase of over $5 billion.\n  The current problems facing food banks and pantries across the \ncountry demonstrate the need for an infusion from the farm bill. As \nmany of my colleagues know, food pantries across the country that have \nlong distributed TEFAP and other similar programs are finding that, \nthis year, the same resources are providing significantly less food for \ntheir needy constituents as the cost of both food and transportation \nhas eroded their buying power.\n  Just last week, my staff got an email from an employee at Milwaukee \nHunger Task Force, one of the largest TEFAP distributors in the State, \nwhich highlights this dilemma. He explained that they just ordered a \ntruckload of TEFAP peanut butter at a cost of $37,000; a year ago, this \nsame order cost a full $10,000 less. And it is not just peanut butter--\nthe cost of a truckload of flour rose $7,000 in the same year; a \ntruckload of tuna rose $8,000. I am sure my colleagues have seen some \nof the stories in their State papers as I have in Wisconsin, announcing \nthe bare cupboards at food pantries, shelters, and other hunger relief \ngroups. The increases for nutrition programs included in the farm bill \nare vital for these groups and the Americans they serve.\n  I look forward to supporting proposals to further improve support for \nfarmers, enhance life in rural areas and increase nutrition. Several \namendments would significantly address the needs of farmers and rural \ncommunities while making available additional funds for nutrition as \nwell. For example, the proposed Dorgan-Grassley payment-limits \namendment that I am pleased to cosponsor provides over $200 million for \nnutrition programs, including $56 million to index TEFAP benefits for \ninflation. Similarly, my amendment with Senator Menendez provides $301 \nmillion for Food Stamps in the ``outyears'' of the next farm bill, \n2013-2017, and about $70 million annually for purchase of local food \nthrough various nutrition programs including WIC Farmers market \nvouchers, the Seniors Farmers Market Nutrition Program, the Fresh Fruit \nand Vegetable Snack Program and the Commodity Supplemental Food \nProgram.\n  I hope those Senators who were delaying consideration of this bill--\nwhich helps millions of Americans, farmers and nonfarmers alike--will \nallow the Senate to have a fair and thorough debate on this important \nlegislation. After all these months, any additional delay is simply \nunacceptable.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S15058]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, for the information of all our colleagues \nwho have been watching the debate on the farm bill today, and the \namendments that have been offered, we are making significant progress \nbased upon the unanimous consent agreement that was reached last week. \nWe now have moved to a point where the 20 Republican amendments have \nbeen filed on the bill, there are five Democratic amendments that have \nbeen filed on the bill, and what we will do, starting in just a few \nseconds and moving on into tomorrow, is move forward trying to get to a \nfinal point on this farm bill.\n  We are hopeful and optimistic we are going to get this done. I think \nthere is good bipartisan agreement. And I think this legislation, which \nSenator Harkin has championed as chairman of the Agriculture Committee, \nalong with the assistance of Ranking Member Chambliss, will in fact \nmove its way forward to a conclusion in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Tuesday, December 11, \nwhen the Senate resumes H.R. 2419, it then return to the Lugar-\nLautenberg amendment, No. 3711, and that there be 3 hours of debate \nequally divided and controlled in the usual form, prior to a vote in \nrelation to the amendment; that no amendment be in order to the \namendment prior to the vote; that at 12:30 Tuesday, the Senate stand in \nrecess until 2:15 p.m. for the respective party conference meetings; \nthat upon reconvening at 2:15 p.m. the Senate resume the debate with \nrespect to amendment No. 3711; and that upon the use or yielding back \nof time, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to amendment No. 3711.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart, saddened \nand angered by the violence that shook my State of Colorado yesterday. \nOn a day that many Americans devote to family and faith, we awoke to \nnews that two of our young people had been shot dead early Sunday \nmorning on the grounds of Faith Bible Church in Arvada, CO.\n  Tiffany Johnson was only 26 years old. Philip Crouse was 24 years \nold. They were killed, and two of their colleagues were injured as they \nworked at Youth With a Mission dormitory, waiting to welcome back kids \nwho were returning from a late night youth bowling trip.\n  A few hours later, 70 miles to the south, in Colorado Springs, \nviolence again dared to enter a place of worship on Sunday. A gunman \narmed with a high-powered rifle, stormed into New Life Church, killing \ntwo sisters, Stephanie Works, age 18, and Rachael Works, age 16, and \ninjuring four others, including their father.\n  Only the quick thinking and bravery of a security guard was able to \nstop the rampage. Law enforcement officials throughout the day \nyesterday, last night and today, are working at top speed to get to the \nbottom of what happened. They have the full support of Governor Ritter \nof Colorado, Federal agencies, and numerous State and local law \nenforcement agencies that are working in this investigation.\n  As a former attorney general of Colorado, I know firsthand the \nextraordinary capabilities of our local and State law officials. I have \nfull and complete confidence in their abilities. But having overseen \ninvestigations, including the investigation of the shooting at \nColumbine High School, I know that however successful we may be in \nuncovering what happened and bringing justice to those responsible, the \ntransgressions the Nation witnessed yesterday defy reason and \ncomprehension.\n  Sunday's violence has no place in our society. That five people were \nshot is a terrible tragedy, no matter in what city, neighborhood or \nstreet that kind of violence occurs. But that this barbarity invaded \ntwo places of worship, where young people were serving their community \nand where families were attending a Sunday service, stirs a particular \noutrage in all of us.\n  There are certain sanctuaries we share, and they should never, ever \nsee bloodshed. Schools are sanctuaries. Our homes are sanctuaries. \nChurches, mosques, synagogues, and other houses of worship are \nsanctuaries. When these places come under attack, for whatever reason, \nwe all suffer, for our right to pray in peace should be inviolate.\n  When someone undermines this right, we are compelled to respond. We \nare compelled to respond not just with the force of law but by \nmobilizing the force of our shared values and of our community. We must \nrebuild that sense of security that should envelop every house of \nworship in this country. Americans should never feel fear in a place of \nfaith.\n  Our thoughts and prayers today are with the victims of yesterday's \nattacks, with their families and friends. To those who lost a son, a \ndaughter or a friend, I know no words can assuage the pain you feel. I \ncan only hope that in time your memories of the service, faith, and \nlove of those you lost will overcome the senselessness of this terrible \ntragedy.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to express, on behalf of \nmyself and my wife Joan, our devastation and heartfelt sadness for both \nthe families and communities that are suffering as a result of the \nsenseless shootings yesterday in Colorado.\n  Every shooting, and every loss of an innocent life, is a terrible \nblow. But, shootings at schools or churches hit an especially weak spot \nin our public armor. They hurt our Nation in a deeper and more profound \nway and we mourn for the families and communities of those who have \nbeen affected by the tragedies this weekend.\n  The first attack on Sunday occurred at 12:30 a.m. and left two \nvictims dead and two other wounded at the Youth with a Mission center \nin metro Denver. The second, 12 hours later in Colorado Springs, left \ntwo dead and three others wounded.\n  The two killed at the Youth with a Mission center were a young woman \nfrom Minnesota and a young man from Alaska. They were at the center to \nlearn how to better spread the message of their faith. The two wounded \nat the center are in the hospital, one in critical condition and one in \nfair condition. The two victims who lost their lives at the New Life \nChurch were teenage sisters, shot in the parking lot as they left a \nworship service. Three others, including the father of the two teenage \nvictims, were also wounded at the church and are recovering from \ninjuries.\n  There were 7,000 people at the New Life Church yesterday when the \nshooting took place. A volunteer security guard stopped this murderer \njust inside the building, saving an unknown--but certainly large number \nof those from being attacked as well. The name and background of the \nsecurity guard who stopped the gunman are still being withheld, but she \nbravely acted on her instincts and training. With quick and decisive \naction, she returned fire with the gunman, fatally wounding him. This \nreal-life hero has been widely credited today for saving hundreds of \nlives inside the church. I join with the people of Colorado in praising \nher actions.\n  Mr. President, I hope we can find the time to consider the church \nmembers lost in Colorado yesterday, the heartache of those left behind, \nand the valiant action of those who stopped the tragedy from spreading \nand helped those in need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/10/senate-section/article/S15058-3", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15058-S15059]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HATE CRIMES\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, earlier this year this Nation marked the \n50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1957. That landmark \nlegislation was Congress's first civil rights bill since the end of \nReconstruction. It established the Civil Rights Division of the Justice \nDepartment and empowered Federal prosecutors to obtain court \ninjunctions against interference with the right to vote. It also \nestablished a Federal Commission on Civil Rights with authority to \ninvestigate discriminatory conditions and recommend corrective \nmeasures.\n  In the Judiciary Committee, under the leadership of my distinguished \ncolleague, the senior Senator from\n\n[[Page S15059]]\n\nVermont, we held a hearing to commemorate this milestone, to talk about \nour Nation's progress over the past half century, and how we must move \nforward if we are to live up to the ideals enumerated in the \nConstitution. My former colleague from the House and an American hero, \nRepresentative John Lewis, shared his recollections and his hopes for \nthe future with us.\n  Today, however, it is with great sadness that I come to the Senate \nfloor to talk about a rash of incidents involving the hanging of nooses \nin this country. These incidents are a painful reminder of just how far \nwe have to go. I am introducing a Senate resolution that expresses the \nsense of the Senate that: the hanging of nooses is a horrible act when \nused for the purpose of intimidation, and which under certain \ncircumstances can be a criminal act; that it should be thoroughly \ninvestigated by Federal, State, and local law enforcement authorities; \nand that any criminal violations should be vigorously prosecuted. The \nHouse of Representatives unanimously passed a similar resolution, H. \nRes. 826, on December 5, and I ask the Senate to take the same action.\n  American students are being targeted by this epidemic of hate crimes, \nmany of which have occurred after the Jena Six incident arose. Just \nthis year, nooses were discovered hung on the campuses of the \nUniversity of Maryland, Indiana State University, the United States \nCoast Guard Academy, East Carolina University, North Carolina State, \nColumbia University, Louisiana State University, and Purdue.\n  Nooses are being found in elementary and high schools, in Illinois, \nLouisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, and New York. And so we have \na new generation of children who are growing up with the same symbols \nof hate that proliferated more than 100 years ago.\n  Our Nation's first responders are targeted with these symbols of \nhate: firefighters in Jacksonville, FL, and police departments in \nHempstead and Brooklyn, NY. Nooses have been displayed in hospitals in \nPittsburgh, PA, and Orangeburg, NY. Finally, the Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission has filed more than 30 lawsuits for hanging \nnooses in the workplace since 2001, and stated that it observed ``a \ndisturbing national trend of increased racial harassment cases \ninvolving hangman's nooses in the workplace.''\n  Let us remember the chilling history of the United States on this \nsubject. The hanging of nooses and lynching was first used to punish \nAfrican slaves as early as the 17th century and was still commonplace \nin the United States until the 1960s civil rights movement. An \nestimated 5,000 people were lynched in the United States--roughly 70 \npercent of whom were African-Americans--between the 1880s and 1960s.\n  Mr. President, the situation is even more dire than most Americans \nimagine. The Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Project counted \n844 active hate groups in the United States in 2006.\n  Hate crimes' tentacles reach far beyond the intended targets. They \nbring a chill to entire neighborhoods and create a sense of fear, \nvulnerability, and insecurity in our communities. They poison the well \nof our democracy and strike at the very heart of the American spirit.\n  Hate crimes are un-American. They cannot be tolerated. When \nindividuals are targeted and attacked because of who they are, entire \ncommunities suffer, we are all diminished by it. I call on the Senate \ntoday to condemn the recent spate of noose hangings and urge vigorous \nFederal, State, and local investigation and prosecution of criminal \nviolations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/10/senate-section/article/S15059-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15059]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE PUBLIC AVAILABILITY OF CONFERENCE REPORTS\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Mr. President, today is Human Rights Day. Fifty-\nnine years ago today, thanks in large measure to the tireless \nleadership of Eleanor Roosevelt, the United Nations General Assembly \nunanimously adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n  The principles encompassed in the declaration are uniquely rooted in \nthe American tradition, beginning with our founding documents. Yet the \ndeclaration also wove together a remarkable variety of political, \nreligious, and cultural perspectives and traditions. The United States \nand the United Kingdom championed civil liberties. The French \nrepresentative on the committee helped devise the structure of the \ndeclaration. India added the prohibition on discrimination. China \nstressed the importance of family and reminded U.N. delegates that \nevery right carried with it companion duties. Today should be a day of \ncelebration, a day when we hail the universality of these core \nprinciples, which are both beacons to guide us and the foundations for \nbuilding a more just and stable world.\n  The Universal Declaration was a radical document in its time, and its \npassage required courageous leadership from political leaders. Even \nthough no country could have been said to be in full compliance with \nits provisions, including the United States where Jim Crow still \nprevailed, all U.N. member states committed themselves to promoting, \nprotecting, and respecting fundamental human rights. Although Franklin \nDelano Roosevelt did not live to see the enactment of the historic \ndeclaration, it enshrined his ``four freedoms''--freedom from want, \nfreedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom from fear. \nIndividuals in the United States and everywhere else were entitled, \nsimply by virtue of being human, to physical and economic security. The \ndeclaration was born of the recognition, in the words of one human \nrights scholar, that ``what is pain and humiliation for you is pain and \nhumiliation for me.''\n  Anniversaries are a good time to examine how faithful we have been to \nour own aspirations--to ask ourselves how well we are measuring up, to \nassess whether our practice lives up to our promise. We in the United \nStates enjoy tremendous freedoms, but we also carry a special \nresponsibility--the responsibility of being the country so many people \nin the world look to, just as they did in Mrs. Roosevelt's day, for \nhuman rights leadership.\n  Today, on this anniversary, we must acknowledge both bad news and \ngood news. The bad news is that for nearly seven years, President Bush \nhas ignored Franklin Roosevelt's wise counsel about the corrosive \neffects of fear. Indeed, instead of urging us to reject fear, he has \nstoked false fear and undermined our values.\n  Wounded by a horrific terrorist attack, we were warned that Saddam \nHussein--a man who had nothing to do\n\n[[Page S15060]]\n\nwith that attack--could unleash mushroom clouds from nuclear bombs. We \nwere told that waterboarding was effective. We were assured that \nshipping men off to countries that tortured was good for national \nsecurity. We were led to believe that our military and civilian courts \nwere inadequate, and so we established a network of unaccountable \nprisons. And the administration launched secret wiretapping \ninitiatives, scoffed at the rule of law, and flaunted the will of the \nCongress.\n  Nonetheless, in his second inaugural, President Bush rightly \nproclaimed, ``America's vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now \none.'' But, tragically, he has failed to heed his own words. We have \nnot only vacated the perch of moral leader; we have also compounded the \nthreat we face, spurring more people to take up arms against us.\n  The further bad news is that other countries have not stepped up to \nfill the void left by our lack of moral leadership. The hundreds of \nthousands killed and two million displaced by the genocide in Darfur; \nthe shell-shocked Buddhist monks in Burma; the political opposition in \nZimbabwe; the imprisoned independent journalists in Russia; the brave \nhuman rights lawyers and judges in Pakistan--they do not know where to \nturn internationally. Human rights abusers win seats on the U.N. Human \nRights Council, the International Criminal Court issues war crimes \nindictments, but no country steps up to enforce them; the U.N. \nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations begs in vain for troops, \nhelicopters and police to help stave off humanitarian catastrophes. For \nall these reasons, the world needs renewed, principled U.S. leadership.\n  There is another critical reason why America must again provide moral \nleadership on human rights: the fate of women around the world. Whether \nit is in creating wealth, access to capital, and property rights, or \nreceiving quality education, health care, and social services, women \nstill lag far behind men. And of course the lack of full reproductive \nrights can be a matter of life and death for too many women. Inequality \nmeans insecurity for women, especially those who comprise 70 percent of \nthe world's poorest. There is a clear link between discrimination and \nviolence against women; equality and empowerment of women is the most \neffective approach to ending violence against women. Today, violent \nacts against women, in the words of UNICEF, ``are the most pervasive \nviolation of human rights in the world today.''\n  Women's inequality and the persistent prevalence of honor killings, \ntrafficking, repression, and sexual assault nearly six decades after \nthe Universal Declaration shame us all. One need only look to Saudi \nArabia, where a 19-year-old woman, who was raped, instead of receiving \ntreatment and support, was sentenced to 200 lashes and 6 months in \nprison for riding in a car with a non-related male. In the Democratic \nRepublic of Congo and in Darfur, rape is routinely used as a weapon of \nwar by militia and government forces. In northern Uganda, young girls \nare given as ``prizes'' to older male soldiers to reward performance.\n  In Pakistan, international observers report that one of the largest \nchallenges facing its next election is guaranteeing women enough \nsecurity so they can leave their homes to vote. In Iraq the \nmilitarization and rise of radical Islam has eroded women's rights. In \nAfghanistan, while nothing can compare to the day when the Taliban \nruled the entire country, women throughout that country complain that \ntheir freedoms have been woefully curtailed. The United States alone \ncannot solve the problem of women's suffering and gender inequality \naround the world, but with new, principled leadership, the United \nStates can elevate women's economic, political and social development \nto the top of our international agenda and ensure that women around the \nworld know that they have a reliable friend and partner in America.\n  Let me close by saying that the very depth of the anti-Americanism \nfelt around the world today is a testament not to hatred but to \ndisappointment, acute disappointment. The global public expects more \nfrom America. They expect our government to embody what they have seen \nin our people: industriousness, humanity, generosity, and a commitment \nto equality. We can become that country again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/10/senate-section/article/S15060-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15060]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                            TERM OF SERVICE\n\n Mr. BAUCUS.

Mr. President, today I celebrate the tenure of \nWesley College president Dr. Scott D. Miller. After 10 years as \npresident, Dr. Miller will step down to assume leadership of Bethany \nCollege in my home State of West Virginia in January 2008.\n  Founded in 1873, Wesley College is located on 50 acres in historic \nDover, DE. Delaware's oldest private college, the school offers 30 \nbachelors and 4 associates degrees, and master's degrees in nursing, \neducation, business administration and environmental science.\n  I first met Dr. Miller in 1997 when I was Governor of Delaware, and \nhe was appointed as the 15th president of Wesley College. During his \ntenure, the college proudly reported record applications, a climbing \nenrollment, increased alumni participation and a greater minority \npresence. For these and other accomplishments, Dr. Miller has been \nnationally acclaimed for his contributions to higher education.\n  Under Dr. Miller's leadership, Wesley experienced substantial growth, \nincluding total enrollment increases from 1,052 to 3,210 and $67 \nmillion raised in the Campaign for Wesley fund, with more than $40 \nmillion earmarked for capital renovations and new construction. Dr. \nMiller oversaw the creation of four graduate programs and the \nestablishment of a New Castle County campus for Adult Studies. In \naddition, he established an undergraduate nursing program and five \nother new undergraduate majors.\n  Beyond academics, Wesley College has also been granted membership in \nthe selective Capital Athletic Conference and enjoys the addition of \nnew varsity sports programs. Congratulations to the Wolverines who are \nagain in the quarterfinals this year for the NCAA Division III South \nRegion collegiate football championship.\n  To maintain Wesley's support of the local community, Dr. Miller was \nalso instrumental in building an alliance with Delaware State \nUniversity and the Friends of the Capital Theater to maximize the usage \nof the historic Capital Theater, positioning it as the premiere \nperforming arts center in southern Delaware. The relationship was \nformalized in January 2007 with the three organizations becoming equal \npartners in the operation, management and programming of the theater.\n  In addition to all the accolades already mentioned, Scott and his \nfamily have become valued friends of mine and of many others in \nDelaware over the past decade. Dr. Miller's wife Ann is an educator in \nher own right and has been a full partner with her husband in \nsupporting his efforts to lead Wesley to new heights. We were also \nlucky to have their daughter Ashlee serve as an intern in my Wilmington \noffice this past summer.\n  Scott and Wesley College have also supported my charter school \ninitiative in Delaware by being one of the first colleges in America to \ncharter and provide space for a public charter school. Additionally, \nWesley College was one of the first institutions to sign on as a \npartner of a homeownership initiative that I started in Dover by \nsupporting the effort to increase homeownership rates in the capital \ncity. Our new homeowners include employees of the\n\n[[Page S15061]]\n\nAramark company which provides food services to Wesley College.\n  Prior to joining the Wesley community, Dr. Miller served as \npresident, executive vice president, and vice president for development \nof Lincoln Memorial University; an interim public information officer \nat West Virginia Wesleyan College; and director of University Relations \nand Alumni Affairs at the University of Rio Grande.\n  Dr. Miller earned his bachelor's degree from West Virginia Wesleyan \nCollege, master's degree from the University of Dayton, education \nspecialist from Vanderbilt University, and doctorate in higher \neducation administration from the Union Institute and University. He \nhas also completed postgraduate studies at Ohio University and Harvard \nUniversity.\n  Outside of the college, Dr. Miller was an active community \nparticipant during his time in Delaware. He served on the board of \nnumerous local and national groups including the National Association \nof Schools and Colleges of the United Methodist Church, the United Way \nof Delaware and the Greater Dover Commission. Dr. Miller was also an \nhonorary commander of the Dover Air Force Base for 2 years and was \nselected to serve on the Joint Civilian Orientation Council by the \nSecretary of Defense.\n  I would like to personally acknowledge and sincerely thank Dr. Miller \nfor the outstanding contribution he has made to Wesley College and the \nsurrounding community over the past 10 years. The Millers have been \ngood for Wesley, for Dover, for Kent County, and for Delaware. We will \nmiss them a great deal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/10/senate-section/article/S15061-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT OF 2007\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  Early in the morning of May 8, 2007, 51-year-old Stevenpaul Richey \nwas severely beaten by two men inside his Missoula, MT, apartment. The \nprevious night, Richey had been at a bar in downtown Missoula where he \nmet Michael Daniel Lemay and Christopher Lance Newrider, both 20 years \nold. The three men reportedly headed back to Richey's apartment at \nabout 1 a.m., stopping on the way to buy beer. At that point, Richey \nassumed that the trio would have drinks and listen to music. He was \nwrong. According to Richey, once inside the apartment, one of the men \nstated that he did not like gay people while the other hit him suddenly \nfrom behind. Richey fell to the ground. Newrider and Lemay tied his \nankles and wrists, continuing to batter him and yelling anti-gay \nepithets. The attackers left Richey bound with a punctured lung, two \nbroken ribs, and shattered bones in his face. Although investigators \nexamined the possibility that the beating was bias-motivated, Montana \nbias-crime laws currently do not cover crimes motivated by sexual \norientation. The two assailants were charged with kidnapping and \naggravated assault.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew \nShepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by \npassing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts \nand minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/10/senate-section/article/S15061-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               ENROLLED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION SIGNED\n\n  At 3:24 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bills and joint resolution:\n\n       S. 888.

A bill to require the National Incident Based Reporting \nSystem, the Uniform Crime Reporting Program, and the Law Enforcement \nNational Data Exchange Program to list cruelty to animals as a separate \noffense category; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, today the Nation closed the book on a \nheinous story that brought the criminal act of dogfighting into the \nnational spotlight. Michael Vick received 23 months in jail for his \nactions, but that is not the end of the story. Nor is it the end of the \nnation's attack on dogfighting.\n  Dogfighting is reprehensible in its own right. There is no \njustification for the intentional mauling and destruction of a living \nanimal. But it is a precursor of so much more. That is why we must \ncontinue to fight these crimes.\n  Dogfighting isn't just about cruelty to animals. Dogfights are one \nbecoming an increasingly profitable enterprise for violent gangs. These \ncriminals can bring in as much as $25,000 by selling a champion dog on \nthe black market, and they can take a cut from bets that can run in \nexcess of $100,000 for a single fight. Stopping animal cruelty means \ncutting off the flow of money that these criminals use to intimidate \nand terrorize their communities.\n  Studies show that animal cruelty is a steppingstone to violent crimes \nagainst humanity. When the FBI profiles serial killers, they try to \nfind out if they have a history of animal abuse. If someone's been \nprosecuted for animal cruelty, they are four times more likely to \ncommit a violent crime. The Chicago Police Department found that almost \n6 out of every 10 people arrested for crimes against animals turned out \nto be members of gangs. Animal cruelty is one of the strongest \nindicators of participation in other acts of violence that \ncriminologists have ever discovered.\n  No on can argue that this barbaric practice should continue. But \nthere is an unnecessary barrier to stopping it: gathering reliable data \non animal fighting is more difficult than it should be. We don't have a \ngood idea of how fast it is growing because of a simple problem with \nhow the crime is categorized.\n  That is why I introduced the Tracking Animal Cruelty Crimes Act, \nwhich would list cruelty to animals as a separate offense category in \nthe three major crime reporting systems used by the federal government. \nIt's time to begin tracking these crimes, so we can better understand \nit--and ultimately so we can shut down this vast, exploding and \nincreasingly lucrative criminal enterprise.\n  Currently in the world of criminal justice, there are ``Type I'' \ncrimes, like homicide and arson, and ``Type II'' crimes, like drug \nabuse, gambling, and vagrancy. But then there are crimes that are \nthrown into a category called ``Other.'' Acts of animal cruelty, \nincluding dogfighting, are in the ``Other'' category. That means law \nenforcement can't separate out and analyze data about them.\n  How are we supposed to come up with an effective policy to target \nanimal cruelty if that data is lumped together with other totally \nunrelated crimes? But there is a simple fix to this problem. Once law \nenforcement officials can gather information on animal cruelty as a \nseparate category, they can track criminal activity, monitor trends, \nallocate resources more efficiently, and ultimately stop these \ncriminals before they commit even more heinous crimes.\n  The repulsive blood-sport of dogfighting is a truly national problem, \nincluding in my home State of New Jersey, where last year officials \nfound a dog ring in a bunker 11-feet underground. That was during a \ndrug raid, showing how tied up that activity is with illegal gambling, \ndrugs, and violence.\n  If we are going to combat a culture of violence wherever it exists in \nthis country, we need to do everything in our power to stop the gangs \nthat terrorize our streets and cut off their flow of money--whether it \nis through setting tougher penalties for gang activities, expanding \nfunding for community policing, or boosting prevention efforts such as \nafter-school programs.\n  For the sake of the safety of our communities, I urge my colleagues \nto take swift action to enact this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 2440.

A \n     substantial part of this increase in market concentration is \n     the direct result of mergers and acquisitions that the \n     antitrust enforcement agencies did not challenge, in large \n     part because of the lack of guidelines focused on identifying \n     particular structural characteristics in the agricultural \n     industry and the adverse competitive effects that such \n     acquisitions and mergers would create.\n       (iii) The cost of transportation, impact on quality, and \n     delay in sales of agricultural commodities if they are to be \n     transported to more distant buyers may result in narrow \n     geographic markets with respect to buyer power.\n       (iv) Buyers have no economic incentive to bid up the price \n     of agricultural commodities in the absence of effective \n     competition. Further, the nature of buying may make it \n     feasible for larger numbers of buyers to engage in tacit or \n     overt collusion to restrain price competition.\n       (v) Buyers with oligopsonistic or monopsonistic power have \n     incentives to engage in unfair, discriminatory, and \n     exclusionary acts that cause producers of agricultural \n     commodities to receive less than a competitive price for \n     their goods, transfer economic risks to sellers without \n     reasonable compensation, and exclude sellers from access to \n     the market.\n       (vi) Markets for agricultural commodities often involve \n     contexts in which many producers have relatively limited \n     information and bargaining power with respect to the sale of \n     their commodities. These conditions invite buyers with \n     significant oligopsonistic or monopsonistic power to exercise \n     that power in ways that involve discrimination and undue \n     differentiation among sellers.\n       (B) Issuance of guidelines.--After consideration of the \n     findings under subparagraph (A), the Assistant Attorney \n     General and the Chairman, in consultation with the Special \n     Counsel, shall issue agricultural guidelines that--\n       (i) facilitate a fair, open, accessible, transparent, and \n     efficient market system for agricultural products;\n       (ii) recognize that not decreasing competition in the \n     purchase of agricultural products by highly concentrated \n     firms from a sector in perfect competition is entirely \n     consistent with the objective of the antitrust laws to \n     protect consumers and enhance consumer benefits from \n     competition; and\n       (iii) require the Assistant Attorney General or the \n     Chairman, as the case may be, to challenge any merger or \n     acquisition in the agricultural industry, if the effect of \n     that merger or acquisition may be to substantially lessen \n     competition or tend to create a monopoly.\n       (C) Contents.--The agricultural guidelines issued under \n     subparagraph (B) shall consist of merger guidelines relating \n     to existing and potential competition and vertical \n     integration that--\n       (i) establish appropriate methodologies for determining the \n     geographic and product markets for mergers affecting \n     agricultural commodity markets;\n       (ii) establish thresholds of increased concentration that \n     raise a concern that the merger will have an adverse effect \n     on competition in the affected agricultural commodities \n     markets;\n       (iii) identify potential adverse competitive effects of \n     mergers in agricultural commodities markets in a nonexclusive \n     manner; and\n       (iv) identify the factors that would permit an enforcement \n     agency to determine when a merger in the agricultural \n     commodities market might avoid liability because it is not \n     likely to have an adverse effect on competition.\n       (2) Agriculture competition task force working group on \n     buying power.--In issuing agricultural guidelines under this \n     subsection, the Chairman and the Assistant Attorney General \n     shall consult with the working group on buyer power of the \n     Task Force established under subsection (c)(4).\n       (3) Completion.--Not later than 2 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Chairman and the Assistant \n     Attorney General shall--\n       (A) issue agricultural guidelines under this subsection;\n       (B) submit to Congress the agricultural guidelines issued \n     under this subsection; and\n       (C) submit to Congress a report explaining the basis for \n     the guidelines, including why it incorporated or did not \n     incorporate each recommendation of the working group on buyer \n     power of the Task Force established under subsection (c)(4).\n       (4) Report.--Not later than 30 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Chairman and the Assistant \n     Attorney General shall jointly submit a report to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate and the Committee on \n     the Judiciary of the House of Representatives regarding the \n     issuing of agricultural guidelines under this subsection.\n       (f) Agribusiness Merger Review and Enforcement by the \n     Department of Agriculture.--\n       (1) Notice.--The Assistant Attorney General or the \n     Commissioner, as appropriate, shall notify the Secretary of \n     any filing under section 7A of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. \n     18a) involving a merger or acquisition in the agricultural \n     industry, and shall give the Secretary the opportunity to \n     participate in the review proceedings.\n       (2) Review.--\n       (A) In general.--After receiving notice of a merger or \n     acquisition under paragraph (1), the Secretary may submit to \n     the Assistant Attorney General or the Commissioner, as \n     appropriate, and publish the comments of the Secretary \n     regarding that merger or acquisition, including a \n     determination regarding whether the merger or acquisition may \n     present significant competition and buyer power concerns, \n     such that further review by the Assistant Attorney General or \n     the Commissioner, as appropriate, is warranted.\n       (B) Second requests.--For any merger or acquisition \n     described in paragraph (1), if the Assistant Attorney General \n     or the Chairman, as the case may be, requires the submission \n     of additional information or documentary material under \n     section 7A(e)(1)(A) of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. \n     18a(e)(1)(A))--\n       (i) copies of any materials provided in response to such a \n     request shall be made available to the Secretary; and\n       (ii) the Secretary--\n\n       (I) shall submit to the Assistant Attorney General or the \n     Chairman such additional comments as the Secretary determines \n     appropriate; and\n       (II) shall publish a summary of any comments submitted \n     under subclause (I).\n\n       (3) Report.--\n       (A) In general.--The Secretary shall submit an annual \n     report to Congress regarding the review of mergers and \n     acquisitions described in paragraph (1).\n       (B) Contents.--Each report submitted under subparagraph (A) \n     shall provide a description of each merger or acquisition \n     described in paragraph (1) that was reviewed by the Secretary \n     during the year before the date that report is submitted, \n     including--\n       (i) the name and total resources of each entity involved in \n     that merger or acquisition;\n       (ii) a statement of the views of the Secretary regarding \n     the competitive effects of that merger or acquisition on \n     agricultural markets, including rural communities and small, \n     independent producers; and\n       (iii) a statement indicating whether the Assistant Attorney \n     General or the Chairman, as the case may be, instituted a \n     proceeding or action under the antitrust laws, and if so, the \n     status of that proceeding or action.\n       (g) Authorization for Additional Staff and Funding for the \n     Grain Inspection,\n\n[[Page S15081]]\n\n     Packers, and Stockyards Administration.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to enhance the \n     capability of the Grain Inspection, Packers, and Stockyards \n     Administration to monitor, investigate, and pursue the \n     competitive implications of structural changes in the meat \n     packing and poultry industries by hiring litigating attorneys \n     to allow the Grain Inspection, Packers, and Stockyards \n     Administration to more comprehensively and effectively pursue \n     its enforcement activities.\n       (h) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Agricultural commodity.--The term ``agricultural \n     commodity''--\n       (A) has the meaning given that term in section 102 of the \n     Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 (7 U.S.C. 5602);
