Mr. President, the scheduled termination date of this \nCongress is a week this coming Friday--a week after the day after \ntomorrow. We have a lot to do. We are going to finish, sometime today, \nthe Defense authorization bill. I am in conference with Senator Levin \nto see if there is something we can work out. If not, this matter will \nbe completed, no matter what anyone does, at 9:30 tonight. The vote \ntonight is on passage of the bill. It is not 60 votes. We just have to \nget a simple majority.\n  I will file cloture on the Coburn package, which has scores of bills \nin it that have been held up. I had a very good conversation with him \nyesterday. I will meet with him later today to see if we can work \nsomething out and move forward on that without a cloture vote. I hope \nthat can be done. Senator Coburn said he thought it could be. I hope \nthat is, in fact, the case. I will be as reasonable as I can be, and I \nam hopeful and confident that he will be.\n  After that--whatever is determined on that--we are going to move to \nthe tax extenders. We need a vehicle to do that. Any of the 99 Senators \ncan object to having a vehicle to do that. We, of course, procedurally, \ncould move to something, but it could take a couple extra days. Of \ncourse, everyone should understand that we may have to be working the \nnext week or so with no time off. If we have people who are trying to \nslow things up, stall things, then we are going to have to use the time \nthat we have to use, procedurally, to get to an instrument. Once we get \nto that, Senator McConnell and I have an agreement that we are going to \ntry to effectuate where we would vote on paying for all the tax \nextenders as it relates to renewables. Then we would have a vote on \nwhether we are going to pay for AMT, and then a vote on the package and \nsend that to the House.\n  Of course, after that, there are other things we need to do. We have \nan economic recovery package. The House will be sending us that. We \nhave a CR that we have to complete to fund the Government. There is one \nthing I didn't mention by oversight.\n  When we finish the tax extenders, we have to do the rest of our \nenergy legislation. That is the bill the House passed last night. We \ncan use that for a vehicle. Everybody is expecting--rightfully so--that \nthere would be a vote on Senator Bingaman's alternative, there would be \na vote on the Republican alternative, and there would be a vote--if, in \nfact, they decide to move forward on it--on the Gang of 10's so-called \nbipartisan legislation. So there is the House-passed bill, the Bingaman \nbill, the Republican alternative, and the bipartisan bill. All of them \ninclude drilling. So people can vote their hearts out on drilling. \nSomeone could actually vote for all four of those.\n  As I indicated, we have the CR. There are a lot of other things the \nCR may take care of that we have not finished, including MilCon, VA, \nand Homeland Security appropriations; and there are people out there \nwho are concerned about things we should do before we\n\n[[Page S8898]]\n\nleave here, such as LIHEAP. Hopefully, that could be included in either \nthe stimulus package or the CR. Oil prices are not as high as they have \nbeen, but fuel oil in the Northeast is expected to be high this winter. \nWe hope to work something out on mental health parity, the Ledbetter \nissue. We could have another vote on that, if I decide that. We have a \nlot to do.\n  This morning, we are going to have a period for morning business for \nup to 1 hour, as soon as I complete my statement. The majority will \ncontrol the first 30 minutes. My understanding is that Senator Dorgan \nis here and available, and he will speak for about 15 minutes. The \nRepublicans will control the last 30 minutes.\n  Following that, we will resume consideration of S. 3001, the Defense \nauthorization. Yesterday, cloture was invoked on the Defense bill, and \nI announced at that time I was appreciative of the help we got from the \nRepublicans. All postcloture debate time will expire about 9:30 \ntonight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/17/senate-section/article/S8898-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the impact of Hurricane Ike, as we all \nknow, devastated part of the United States, including my State of \nKentucky. This past Sunday, 70-mile-per-hour winds blew through the \nState, leaving thousands of people with damaged or destroyed property.\n  I could give my own personal observation about it. My wife and I were \nout at lunch Sunday when the storm came through. There were very high \nwinds, as I indicated--70-mile-an-hour winds--which we are certainly \nnot accustomed to in Louisville, KY. We drove home and saw that one way \ninto our house was blocked because a tree in our own yard had fallen \nacross the road. We took another route around to try to get into the \nback of the house, and another tree had fallen across the road. That \nwas replicated across Louisville, KY. The power in my own house is \nstill out--to personalize it--as it is in a huge number of houses in \nLouisville and northern Kentucky, which is across from Cincinnati. This \nhad a severe impact on a lot of people. The good news is that the \nhospitals and major facilities do have power.\n  As many as 170,000 homes are still without power. And schools in \nseveral counties remain closed today as the cleanup continues.\n  State and local officials are working as hard as they can to survey \nthe destruction and get help to anyone who needs it.\n  I expect the State will soon ask the Federal Government for disaster \nassistance, which I will strongly support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/17/senate-section/article/S8898-5", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Our constituents do not want campaign speeches and \nhyperpartisan accusations--they want security for their home and \nsavings. They want energy security and lower costs for gas and oil. And \nthey want protection from future tax hikes on their income.\n  Government should be focused on bipartisan efforts to address the \nfundamental problems in the credit markets and must be cautious in \nputting taxpayer dollars at risk.

Mr. President, in giving these remarks, I am saluting \nSenator Byrd.\n  Just a few short blocks from this Capitol at the National Archives \nlies an old and yellowing document, encased under heavy glass.\n  It is the Constitution of the United States, signed on this day in \n1787 by 39 brave Americans. They and their countrymen had just fought a \nwar for liberty. And they understood that the highest goal of a \ngovernment is to preserve and protect that liberty.\n  The oldest delegate, Benjamin Franklin, was already revered by his \ncolleagues as one of America's greatest statesmen. They wanted to hear \nhis opinion on their work. Franklin told his compatriots in \nPhiladelphia, ``I consent, sir, to this Constitution, because I expect \nno better, and because I am not sure that it is not the best.''\n  Over two centuries later, we can say proudly that the system of \nGovernment those great men devised is the best--simple in form, elegant \nin function, and firmly devoted to the preservation of liberty. Amended \nmany times but never abandoned, our Constitution is the oldest still in \nuse today.\n  We celebrate, every year, the brilliant document our Founders gave us \nby marking September 17 as Constitution Day. Senator Byrd was the one \nwho suggested that we do that. It is a day for all Americans, but \nespecially schoolchildren, to learn more about the Constitution, to \nunderstand how it works, and to appreciate how it has guided our Nation \nthrough growth and change.\n  I want to thank the senior Senator from West Virginia for sponsoring \nthe legislation 4 years ago to mark this day and to celebrate this \nseminal document. We all know the love Senator Byrd has for American \nhistory, and the history of the Senate.\n  He knows that you cannot truly understand how liberty is preserved in \nour country without understanding the Constitution. Thank you, Senator \nByrd for your efforts.\n  Constitution Day serves to promote civic awareness. In Kentucky, we \ntake this charge seriously, and through important efforts like the \nCivic Literacy Initiative of Kentucky and other projects, we are \nworking to increase civic awareness across the Bluegrass State.\n  So on this day, we recognize the students, teachers, and community \nleaders in Kentucky and across the Nation who promote and protect the \nideals of our glorious Constitution.\n  And we say a special thanks for our men and women in uniform, who \ndefend it.\n  More than two centuries ago, the 39 signers of our Constitution gave \nus a more perfect Union through a document that endures and guides us \nhere today. They understood, as we all must, that above all, Government \nserves to secure the blessings of liberty for the people of our great \nNation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I applaud my colleague for the statement he \nmade. The Constitution is our guiding document in this great \ncountry. There isn't too much emphasis we can place on it. I respect \nthe words of my colleague. I am confident that he speaks for all \nSenators.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/17/senate-section/article/S8898-7", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8898-S8900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is now Wednesday of a week that began \nwith a 504-point collapse in the stock market on Monday. The American \neconomy, I think most people would understand, is in serious trouble. \nThese are not ordinary times for our country. We have been the economic \nengine of the world. We have built an economic engine that is \nunparalleled. It has been an unbelievable economy, and created great \njobs. Yet we now run into some very significant problems.\n\n[[Page S8899]]\n\n  The financial wreckage that has occurred in recent months in this \ncountry is almost staggering. Very large investment banks that have \nbeen around for a long while are gone. Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, \nMerrill Lynch, venerable old investment firms. Bear Stearns, a 158-year \nfirm, survived the Civil War, the Great Depression, but it could not \nsurvive today.\n  What has happened? What is causing all this? We understand in the \nmonths of this year up to $1 trillion of taxpayers' money has been \noffered in support--loan guarantees and various things--to try to \ncontain the growing financial difficulty in this country.\n  I am not going to second-guess those who are working day and night \ntrying to figure out how we stem the damage. I don't know the figures. \nI am not in the engine room to know all of the dials, gauges, and knobs \nthat they are working on to try to figure out how we stem the damage. \nSo I am not going to be critical today of guarantees and takeovers and \nso on.\n  I am going to say to the American people that they should not worry \nabout their bank account in an insured bank. I don't think anybody \nshould be concerned or run down and try to take their deposits out of \ntheir local banks where their deposits are insured by the FDIC. Those \nare sound, and those deposits are not in jeopardy.\n  Even in the middle of a financial storm of the type we are \nexperiencing, I think it is reasonable for the American people, when \nmidnight meetings are proposing tens of billions, $30 billion or $85 \nbillion of taxpayers' money to try to shore up institutions and deal \nwith this spreading problem, to ask the question: How on Earth did this \nhappen, and why did it happen?\n  There are two reasons, and it is important to talk about them even in \nthe middle of the storm. One is greed, unbelievable greed; and the \nsecond is, in my judgment, deliberate neglect. I will talk about each.\n  The reason I want to talk about them is because we have to make sure \nwe understand what has caused this problem in order to fix it and to \nmake sure it doesn't happen again. It is not as if this country hasn't \nseen banks collapse. We saw banks collapse in the 1930s in the Great \nDepression. Franklin Delano Roosevelt put together the New Deal and put \ntogether very specific, very stringent provisions dealing with banking \nand the safety and soundness of banks. Not just the safety and \nsoundness in numbers but the safety and soundness with respect to \nperception of that safety and soundness.\n  They said we learned a lesson in the 1920s, and that lesson is we \nought not merge and fuse together inherently risky items such as \nsecurities, real estate, insurance, and other things with banking, \nwhose entire existence depends on the perception of safety and \nsoundness.\n  Glass-Steagall and other legislative provisions were created that \nseparated traditional banking from the more risky enterprises. That \nexisted for many decades until about 9 years ago when the Financial \nModernization Act, as it was inappropriately named and led by Senator \nGramm from Texas, was passed by the Congress. I was one of eight \nSenators to vote against it because it repealed the elements of the \nGlass-Steagall Act and created the opportunities for large financial \nholding companies to once again fuse and merge together banking with \ninherently risky enterprises of securities, real estate, and others.\n  I know they said: No, no, we are building firewalls. The firewalls, \nit turns out, are not very thick. We learned a lesson and forgot it.\n  Let me describe what happened. Once all of this happened, at the root \nin this country that deals with greed, we had investment banks, \nmortgage brokers, hedge funds, and mortgage banks, all of them up to \ntheir neck in cash, barrels full of cash they were making. Let me \ndescribe how they were doing it, and most people will understand this \nwreckage is not a surprise at all.\n  Here is what they were doing in this country: As the housing bubble \nwas building, caused in part by easy money advertised to people who had \nbad credit, we saw bad loans put out there in what was called then--the \nnew lexicon--subprime lending. Here is what Countrywide, the largest \nmortgage banker said:\n\n       Do you have less than perfect credit? Do you have late \n     mortgage payments? Have you been denied by other lenders? \n     Call us . . .\n\n  Isn't that unbelievable? Countrywide doesn't exist anymore because it \nwas bought by another firm before it went belly up.\n  It wasn't just Countrywide. Here is an ad I pulled off the Internet. \nIt was running on television and radio. Millennia Mortgage:\n\n       12 months, no mortgage payment. That's right. We will give \n     you the money to make your first 12 months' payments if you \n     call in the next 7 days. We pay it for you. Our loan program \n     may reduce your current monthly payments by 50 percent and \n     allow you no payments for the first 12 months.\n\n  Isn't that unbelievable? That is nothing compared to these kinds of \nadvertisements, and most of us have heard them.\n  Zoom Credit, here is what it said:\n\n       Credit approval is just seconds away. Get on the fast track \n     at Zoom Credit. At the speed of light, Zoom Credit will \n     preapprove you for a car loan, a home loan, or a credit card. \n     Even if your credit's in the tank. Zoom Credit's like money \n     in the bank. Zoom Credit specializes in credit repair and \n     debt consolidation, too. Bankruptcy, slow credit, no credit--\n     who cares?\n\n  Is this business? No, this is insanity. This is not business. Zoom \nCredit: Your credit is in the tank, there is money in the bank for you.\n  On top of that, in addition to putting mortgages out to people who \nhad bad credit, here is what they advertised: You want to get a loan \nwith no documentation so you don't even have to document your income, \nthat is no problem. We will give you a no-doc loan. You don't have to \ndocument your loan. We will give you low-doc loan so you do minimum \ndocumentation of your income. By the way, you don't have to make any \npayments the first 12 months, or you can make payments the first 12 \nmonths and pay no principal or you can pay no principal and only \npartial interest. Unbelievable. All of these companies, shame on them. \nUnbelievable, unfettered greed making money by the barrel, leaving the \nrest of us with the financial wreckage that occurred.\n  Here is what happened. They put out all these bad mortgages, called \nsubprime mortgages. They mixed them with good mortgages and securitized \nthem because these days they securitize everything. They discovered \nthese new exotic financial instruments and put them all together like \nsawdust and sausage, as they used to do, and put bad loans in with good \nloans. With all these loans, they put in prepayment penalties saying: \nWe are going to stick you with a reset with a much higher interest rate \ndespite the fact we did a teaser rate at the front end. And when the \nhigher interest rate happens 3 months from now, you may not be able to \npay it, but it doesn't matter. You can flip your property because you \nwill make money. Home prices are going up.\n\n  So they put in prepayment penalties, and the prepayment penalties \nmade these little securities seem like this was a sure thing and big \nmoney. The broker got the mortgage, got a big bonus, went to the \nmortgage companies--Countrywide and others. They securitized them and \nset them up in a hedge fund and moved them around the world.\n  Now they sit with these pieces of security, and they don't have the \nfoggiest idea what is in them. All of a sudden, they go belly up. Mr. \nPresident, $1 billion, $10 billion, $100 billion, $1 trillion, and the \ncarnage spreads across this country's economy.\n  Greed, unbelievable greed. This is all about making big money in a \nmanner that defies good business sense, and even more, deliberate \nneglect by regulators in this town. This is no time for politics, but \nlet me say this. At the start of this administration, regulators came \nto this town and served notice: It's a business-friendly place. Don't \nworry, be happy. We don't intend to regulate. One regulator in one \nagency said: It's a new day here, a new sheriff in town. This is a \nbusiness-friendly place.\n  When the regulators decide they are not going to regulate, it is like \ntaking the cop off the beat. Regulators represent the referee or the \ncop. I have used the referee analogy--a striped shirt and whistle, and \nthey call the fouls. There have been no fouls here. When you have a \nmortgage company that says: You have bad credit, you have been \nbankrupt. You can't pay\n\n[[Page S8900]]\n\nyour bills? Come to us. The regulator should say: What are you doing? \nThey say: We want to give you a mortgage that has an unbelievably low \nrate, 1\\1/4\\ percent and resets at 10 percent and you don't have to \ndocument your loan. We will make the first 12 payments for you. \nUnbelievable, in my judgment.\n  Regulators sat by and watched, and it has cost this country $1 \ntrillion as a result of the unfettered greed that moved across this \ncountry.\n  The fact is, Senator McCain recently said the economy is \nfundamentally sound. It is not. What has happened here is the erosion \nof economic strength as a result of unbelievable greed with the \nsubprime mortgage that has spread all over the country.\n  By the way, I mentioned that what took away Financial Modernization \nAct Glass-Steagall and the protections we put in place was Financial \nModernization Act, also known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. That is \nSenator Phil Gramm who led the fight here to do that. I didn't vote \nwith him. He is out still advising Senator McCain on the economy.\n  Again, this is not about politics, but it is about what happened, how \nit happened, why it happened, and what we ought to do to make sure it \ndoesn't happen again. We need effective regulators who decide they are \ngoing to do, in the interest of the American taxpayers, what they \nshould do. We ought to go back and plug the loophole that was opened by \nSenator Gramm and others who said: You know what. Let's forget the \nlessons of the past. Let's let big holding companies gather up big \nfinancial enterprises and put them into one big sack, and they will run \njust fine.\n  They are not running just fine. They are undermining this country's \neconomic strength.\n  Mr. President, how much time have I consumed?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 13 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will say again, as I said when I \nstarted, this is no ordinary time. Our economy is in peril. We will \nrecover. I hope the kinds of things that are being done by good people \nwho are working 24 hours a day to try to deal with this wreckage will \nhelp our economy recover. We are a very strong country, and we have had \nsome people who have undermined this country's economic strength, but I \nbelieve we will overcome it. But we won't overcome it unless we \nunderstand what happened, how it happened, and why it happened.\n  I say again, as I said yesterday on the floor of the Senate, this is \nnot some mysterious illness for which we don't have a cure. It is \npretty obvious what happened, and it is pretty obvious what we have to \ndo to fix it.\n  I have been on the floor of the Senate talking for some years about \nthis issue, about the unbelievable amount of leverage and the exotic \nfinancial instruments. Does anybody out there know that we have some \n$40 trillion in notional derivative values of credit default swaps? \nMost people who have them don't even know what they are. Most people \ndidn't understand what kind of infection existed deep in these \nsecuritized issues that were being sold back and forth and everybody \nmaking money. They had no idea what was in them that was going to blow \nup at some point. And it has blown up with a significant force at this \npoint that, so far, has cost the American people, by my calculation, up \nto $1 trillion.\n  This ought to be an indelible lesson learned for this institution and \nfor the American people. Greed must be constrained.\n\n  The market system is a wonderful system, but you must have a traffic \ncop on the beat. You must have regulators who regulate. When you begin \nto take apart things that were protecting this country, such as the \nGlass-Steagall Act, and promising all kinds of nirvana for tomorrow, \nwhen it comes apart, you need to go back and do it over again and do it \nright.\n  Mr. President, as I said, these are difficult days, and I want to end \nas I started. I don't want people who listen to this discussion to \nbelieve they should run to the bank and take their deposits out. \nInsured deposits in American banks are sound, and the American people \nshould understand and not worry about that. That is very important. \nWhat we should worry about are the political calculations that led us \nto take apart the protections, such as Glass-Steagall and others, and \nsecond, the unfettered greed that was going on under the noses of \nregulators who came to this town in 2001 and who decided they didn't \nhave any interest in regulating anything. Those are lessons we need to \nlearn and learn well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I first wish to thank the Senator from \nNorth Dakota for his comments. I think it is particularly important, as \nwe get the news day after day about what is going on in the financial \nmarkets of this country, that we don't panic. The fact is, I think the \ninvestments we have in our banks are secure. There is no doubt about \nthat. But the truth is, we have gotten here by an administration that, \nquite honestly, has not done its job with commonsense oversight, and \ngreed has stepped in. The bottom line is that it is costing the \nGovernment a lot of money--$85 billion yesterday--to basically \nnationalize AIG. So I thank the Senator from North Dakota. I think his \ncomments are on point.\n  Today, I want to talk about something that has been on our minds for \nsome time and will be on our minds for some time; that is, the cost of \nenergy. It is an incredibly pressing issue, and it is long past due for \na commonsense energy policy with short-term and long-term solutions--\ncritically important. America deserves no less, and Americans deserve \nno less. It is a matter of national and economic security.\n  Securing our energy future will free America from being held hostage \nby foreign producers, and quite honestly, most of them don't like us \nmuch--countries such as Russia, Venezuela, and Saudi Arabia. Renewable \nenergy projects will generate good new jobs here in America while \ncreating a sustainable energy supply at affordable prices for American \nconsumers.\n  I have spoken many times on this floor about the need to drill for \noil in places that make sense in this country. One of them in \nparticular is a formation called the Bakken formation in eastern \nMontana. I have called on my colleagues to work together to crack down \non oil speculators who artificially drive up the price of oil, and, of \ncourse, I have spoken about the need to conserve--the low-hanging \nfruit, conserve, conserve, conserve--and to invest in alternative and \nrenewable energy for the future to make this country energy \nindependent.\n  That is why I rise today. In Montana, several alternative energy \nprojects have been held up by the Federal Government. Why? Because of \ntoo much redtape. And this administration has cut staff and resources \njust when we need them the most in the area of renewable energy. That \nis why I am introducing legislation, along with Senator Feinstein, that \nwill help get renewable energy projects approved faster. The measure \nwill cut through the redtape that slows down too many of these \ninnovative and important projects. My bill will make it easier for \nfolks who are figuring out how to use new technology to solve the \nenergy crisis while also cutting down on the emissions of greenhouse \ngases. It would also create as many as six renewable energy pilot \nproject offices across the country to coordinate Federal permits for \nrenewable energy projects and transmission lines with State \ngovernments.\n  This legislation is only a part of the puzzle, but it is a very \nimportant piece. In the 2005 Energy bill, we created an oil and gas \npilot project to speed up onshore gas and oil exploration drilling, and \nit is working. If we had put the same focus on renewable energy that we \nhave on oil and gas, we would be in a different spot today. And we \nwon't run out of renewables as we will with oil.\n  I very much appreciate the work many of my colleagues have been doing \nto develop a bipartisan energy proposal, and I support their work. I \ncall on the Senate to work together to pass commonsense solutions to \nthis energy crisis. We can't put all our eggs in one basket energy-\nwise. Energy security will take a mix of solutions, and it is not going \nto happen overnight. But every day we delay is another day we continue \nto rely on foreign energy.\n\n[[Page S8901]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, yesterday evening, in room 219 just off \nthe Senate Chamber, there was a historic meeting where Mr. Bernanke, \nChairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and Mr. Paulson, Secretary of \nthe Treasury, gathered at a large conference table with the leaders of \nboth the House and the Senate, of both political parties. The \ninformation he gave us was serious, and we listened carefully as Mr. \nBernanke explained that the Federal Reserve was about to loan $85 \nbillion to the largest insurance company in America--AIG.\n  Mr. Bernanke spelled out what would happen if AIG failed, which he \nbelieved was imminent, absent intervention by the Government; that this \ninsurance company had 180 subsidiaries, a $1 trillion operation, and \nthe impact of its demise would be felt across America and around the \nworld. He explained it is more than just an insurance company, it is a \ncompany that has insured many contracts, and if that insurance failed, \nit would call into question contractual obligations involving financial \ninstitutions and individuals across America.\n  It was very clear by the end of his explanation that we had few \nalternatives, few options other than to step in. Although I understand \nthis to be unprecedented, it appears to be one of the few things we can \ndo to stop AIG from collapsing and bringing down a large part of the \nAmerican economy with it.\n  This, of course, comes on the heels of announcements earlier in the \nweek that Lehman Brothers was going to fold. I understand a substantial \nportion of it may be taken over by Barclays, and I think that is a good \nthing, particularly for the 10,000 employees whose jobs may be \npreserved. We also heard that Merrill Lynch, one of the traditional \ngiants on Wall Street, had to close down business and accept purchase \nby the Bank of America. That was a week after Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac, the two giants of the housing industry in America, reached a point \nwhere the Federal Government had to take over the responsibility for \ntheir future so that the housing market could be stabilized. And it was \njust a few weeks after that same administration stepped in to take over \nBear Stearns.\n  This sequence of events has caused concern across America and around \nthe world. I believe the response by the administration, at least \nthrough the Federal Reserve, is the best of the bad alternatives that \nwere available to it. But it raises some extraordinary questions we \nhave to face, and Congress has to accept the challenge these events \npresent to us. The challenge was expressed by Mr. Bernanke last night \nwhen I asked him: What can we do now to avoid further collapses of \ngiant companies and institutions? He said: We have to step back and \nlook at the whole system of regulation.\n  I think that was a very candid analysis because we know what has \nhappened. The traditional basis for our financial dealings in America \nhas been banks and other credit institutions, which are regulated by \nthe Government. But in recent times, an additional credit world has \nemerged. It is a dark and shadowy world without the disclosure of these \ntraditional institutions and with little or no regulation. It is that \nworld which is coming down. It turns out that if these institutions are \nnot carefully monitored, if there is not appropriate oversight and \naccountability, greed overtakes common sense, and that is what has \nhappened. So many of these institutions are failing, and with their \nfailure comes added responsibilities for taxpayers.\n\n  It is curious to me that when we reach these disastrous situations, \nit is the taxpayers--the average family in America--who need to ride to \nthe rescue. It is their tax dollars that are going to keep these \ninstitutions afloat for some period of time. They didn't reap the \nprofits of these institutions in their glory days, but now their tax \ndollars are sustaining the skeletons that are left so that there will \nat least be some continuity.\n  I think we need to step back and take an honest look at this and \nrealize we have gone too far when it comes to this notion that we have \nto ``get Government off our back.'' It turns out there are moments in \nhistory and there are situations where individuals, families, and even \nbusinesses alone cannot manage this economy. We need to have the \nAmerican family--we need to have our Government that we have elected \nand chosen in a position of oversight to stop the excesses. We need to \nmake sure we have agencies with the appropriate statutory authority to \nask the right questions, to disclose the right information, and to stop \nwrongdoing. That has not happened, and that failure has led to the \nsituation we see at this moment.\n  Senator McCain and his inspiration, former Senator Phil Gramm of \nTexas, are part of the deregulation school--get Government out of the \nbusiness of regulation. In fact, Senator McCain prides himself on being \na leader when it comes to deregulation. Well, it is that concept of \nderegulation that has brought us to this moment. We have to have \nappropriate regulation. I don't want the Government to go too far, but \nclearly, when the Government steps aside and says: Let 10,000 flowers \nbloom, let this economy emerge, let's see the miracle of capitalism, \nsadly, those miracles turn into tragedies, as they did over the last \nseveral weeks. We need to make sure we have agencies of Government \ndoing the right thing.\n  In the darkest economic moment in American history--the Great \nDepression of the 1920s--it took a new President and a new way of \nthinking to turn America around and to get the economy back on its \nfeet. That President, Franklin Roosevelt, came in and established \nFederal agencies that would demand accountability, and in return he \nsaid that we will stand behind the banks of America. It is a promise we \nhave kept now for over 75 years.\n  Of course, there is regulation of financial institutions and there is \nalso a guarantee that your deposits at your bank are going to be \nprotected by the Government--the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. \nThat is a good tradeoff. We will provide rescue if we can regulate. But \ncurrently we are coming to the rescue of unregulated entities for \nactivities that the Government has had nothing to do with, and that has \nto change. We have to have accountability across the board in our \neconomy. That is a critical element when it comes to the future. This \nCongress is not going to do it. The President is ending his term with \nonly a few months left. He is not in a position to suggest major reform \nlegislation in these closing months, and Congress is not in a position \nto pass it. But we have a responsibility in the new Congress to accept \nthat challenge and to put in appropriate regulation.\n  The era of Phil Gramm deregulation is an era that has not only \ndeclined but fell over the last several weeks. That may have inspired \nJohn McCain years ago, but that cannot lead our country in the future. \nWe have to have a much more honest appraisal that if the taxpayer \ndollars are going to be on the line to rescue these corporations, the \nFederal Government should have some oversight and demand accountability \nin the operation of these institutions before it reaches that point.\n  There is one other element that I think is important which we brought \nup in the meeting last night. Despite all this conversation about all \nthe turmoil on Wall Street and all of the turmoil in our economy, there \nseems to be a hands-off attitude when it comes to the Americans facing \nmortgage foreclosure. What started this economic tumble was the \nsubprime mortgage mess, where financial institutions were derelict in \ntheir responsibility, enticing people into mortgage debt way beyond \ntheir means, giving them these exotic financing packages which exploded \nwhen the ARMs reset, and now many of them are facing foreclosure.\n  This last August, we hit another record high in foreclosures--304,000 \nhomes in some stage of default and 91,000 families losing their homes, \naccording to RealtyTrac, an online marketer of foreclosed properties. I \nthink this is the rot at the base of the economy, and when I have \nappealed to my colleagues in the Senate on the Republican side, the \nSecretary of the Treasury, and even the Chairman of the Federal \nReserve, that we need to look at these mortgage foreclosures in a \nspecific way to see how many of these\n\n[[Page S8902]]\n\nfamilies, if given a reasonable opportunity, could stay in their homes, \nthey have said: No, we don't want to put our hands on that; we have to \nlet the market work its will. Well, we didn't let the market work its \nwill with Bear Stearns. We came to their rescue. We didn't let the \nmarket work its will with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We rescued them. \nWe certainly didn't let the market work its will with AIG. We decided \nthat for the good of our economy we had to step in. I believe those \nwere reasonable efforts to stabilize our economy, but helping the \nfamilies facing foreclosure is also reasonable. Now that our Government \nis taking over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, I think it ought to step in \nwith a new policy when it comes to renegotiating the mortgages of \npeople who are facing foreclosure.\n  I have had a proposal before the Senate, which was rejected on a \nlargely partisan basis, which basically said that if you go into \nbankruptcy in foreclosure, the court will have a chance to rewrite the \nterms of your mortgage to keep you in your home. It is done now for \ninvestment property, vacation property, farms and ranches. But it does \nnot apply to your primary residence, and that makes no sense \nwhatsoever. I think the court ought to step back and say this family \ncan make the payments they have made for the last 5 years and ought to \nbe allowed to stay in their home as a result of it rather than \nforeclose the property. If the property is foreclosed, there are losers \nin every direction. First, the families are on the street; second, the \nfinancial institution; and then the neighborhoods and the community \naround them will see their property values go down because of the \nforeclosure.\n\n  If we want to staunch the bleeding going on at the base of our \neconomy, it should start with those who are facing foreclosure. If we \nare coming to the rescue of major institutions, why do we turn our \nbacks on the families facing foreclosure?\n  One of our colleagues in the meeting yesterday said we have to let \nthe market find the bottom when it comes to foreclosure. We didn't let \nthat happen with respect to giants. We shouldn't let it happen to \nfamilies who deserve a second chance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Mr. President, yesterday I had the chance, once again, to \ntour the devastated area in my State of Texas caused by Hurricane Ike, \nthis time with the President of the United States and the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services, Secretary Mike Levitt, along with David \nPaulson, the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. \nIt had been 2 days before that, on Sunday, that I had done the same \nthing in southeast Texas, in the Beaumont area, talking to the mayors \nand county judges in that afflicted part of the State, as well as \nhaving been to Galveston. Those two places, particularly Orange County \nand Galveston County, in the southeast part of our State, took the \nbrunt of Hurricane Ike.\n  There are a lot of people hurting now in Texas. We have roughly 2 \nmillion people without power. Many people have left their homes under \nevacuation orders and do not know what the condition of their home is \nand certainly are dying to get back so they can assess where they are--\nwhether they have been wiped out or whether there is something they \nwill be able to rebuild, whether this is something from which they can \nrecover.\n  At the same time, we know there are people who are in evacuation \nshelters set up by the Red Cross with FEMA's help, and others, where \nthey are getting the necessities of life--food, water, and shelter. But \nthese are the very same people who are eager to get back to their homes \nto see whether their houses are still standing, to see whether they can \nrebuild, as I say, or whether they are going to have to start from \nscratch.\n  The emergency response by the State of Texas, primarily the Governor \nand his team, as well as the leaders at the local level--county judges \nand the mayors--was about as good as I can imagine it could have been. \nUnfortunately, because of Hurricane Gustav, when it did not turn out to \nbe as severe as many thought, and millions, literally, had evacuated, I \ndon't think many people believed Ike was going to turn out to be as bad \nas it turned out to be. So many people hunkered down in place and did \nnot take the advice of the local and State leadership to evacuate. \nUnfortunately, now they find themselves--roughly 2 million people--\nwithout power.\n  Yesterday, Mayor Thomas, in Galveston, pointed out that the toilets \nhave not flushed since last Friday in Galveston. That not only presents \nan inconvenience and hardship, but it is also a public health hazard. \nWe have many people who, yesterday, decided to give people a chance to \nlook and leave. In other words, if they were worried about their home, \ngive them a chance to come back on Galveston Island, check it out, and \nthen leave because the air-conditioning, the refrigeration, the basic \nservices provided by power were not available.\n  Unfortunately, if you saw, as I did, the entry and exit into \nGalveston Island, it was jammed with people wanting to come back under \nthat look-and-leave policy. But the mayor decided, and I think wisely \nso, to suspend that because of the logjam.\n  In the worst of disasters, usually you find the greatest examples of \nthe human spirit, neighbors helping neighbors. Faith-based \norganizations, for no other cause than serving their very basic \nmission, are out there making sure people are fed, making sure they are \nsheltered, doing everything they can to help people rebuild their \nlives.\n  We were fortunate in one sense that the storm was not as bad as \noriginally predicted. At one point, there was an estimate that 125,000 \nhomes would be lost; that the surge would reach up to 25 feet; that is, \nthe water being pushed ahead of the storm would actually come all the \nway up the Houston Ship Channel and cause massive destruction and \nflooding and possibly loss of human life. While too many people did, in \nfact, lose their lives, fortunately it was not as bad as it could have \nbeen. Texans remember and history reminds us it was just 1900 when \nGalveston was hit by another hurricane where anywhere between 6,000 and \n8,000 people died. Fortunately, the numbers were in the single digits \nin Texas. That is because of not only the preparation but because of \nmodern building codes which created stronger houses for people who did \ndecide to hunker down, and also because of the search-and-rescue \noperation conducted by the State and Federal authorities working \ntogether to try to get people out who had been trapped, literally, \nwithout electricity, without power, without gasoline. We were able to \nget many people out to safety in the shelters.\n  I think it is important for the people of this country to know that \nno matter who you are or where you live, we do have the systems in \nplace both at the local and State level but also the Federal level to \nbe of assistance to you if you need help. Of course, as I mentioned, \nmany people are trapped, really, where they are. Maybe they went to a \nhotel. Maybe they went to a friend or relative's house.\n  Yesterday, the President announced the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency, the Federal Emergency Response Agency, had authorized people to \nbasically stay in the hotel or motel, if that is where they are \nlocated, for up to 30 days while the power gets restored and while \ncleanup is ongoing and maybe downed power lines are removed. That ought \nto give people some relief, that they are not going to have to look for \nmoney they do not have just to be able to pay the bill to stay in place \nif they are in a hotel or motel for the next 30 days, if they come from \nthe affected counties.\n\n  Because of the major disaster declaration that occurred, both public \nassistance in terms of helping to rebuild the affected areas in the \nState and also personal assistance is available through FEMA. We tried \nto announce the first step to the public yesterday. But, obviously, \npeople do not have Internet access when their power is down. They do \nnot have televisions to watch the announcements or maybe\n\n[[Page S8903]]\n\neven radios to be able to know what to do. But it is important for the \npublic to know, and I think not just in the affected regions, that they \nneed to register with FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, \nfor personal assistance. That is the first step to getting back to \ntheir houses, making sure any damages are appropriately assessed, and \nmaking sure the affected people get the help they are entitled to under \nthe law.\n  I would add, in addition to the Federal Emergency Management Agency's \nWeb site and their 1-800 number, if my constituents will call any one \nof my offices, either here in Washington, DC, which we kept open 24-7 \nduring the storm, and also any of my regional offices in Tyler, Dallas, \nHouston, San Antonio, Harlingen, Lubbock, or Austin, we will reach them \nand get them the help they need and to which they are entitled.\n  I have heard some rumors from the other side of the Capitol that \nSpeaker Pelosi was talking about moving a stimulus package, a huge \nadditional spending package of roughly $50 billion, and there were \ngoing to be some provisions in it for disaster recovery and wild fires \nand other things.\n  I would welcome that with this caution: that we not allow politics \nand the opportunity to use this as a sort of Christmas tree for a bunch \nof bloated spending that is not necessary to restore people to their \nhomes and to repair the damaged infrastructure; that this not be used \nas an occasion for politics. To me, the most cynical thing possibly \nthat could happen in Congress is we look past the people in immediate \nneed, and we look for political opportunities to perhaps spend the \ntaxpayers' money on programs that would not otherwise pass because they \nare somehow bundled up with emergency spending for storm relief.\n  There is one other thing I learned in this disaster that I think is \nvery important as we look at dealing with our energy crisis generally, \nwith the high price of gasoline, and high price of oil, which, perhaps, \nis the No. 1 economic concern of the American people today. The gulf \ncoast is indeed a laboratory of energy that supplies the daily needs of \nour country. When a big hurricane comes in, like this one did, of the \n25 refineries--these are the places that actually make gasoline out of \noil--representing more than one-quarter of the Nation's refining \ncapacity, 17 of the 25 had to be taken offline because of the storm. In \naddition, nine different oil pipelines--these are the major oil \npipelines that transmit oil from the gulf to various parts of the \ncountry--also had to be shut down because of Hurricane Ike. That is \ngoing to have an impact on America's oil and gas supply.\n  Hopefully, the first indications are going to prove to be true, and \nthere were no major environmental spills or problems associated with \nthis hurricane. To me, it was just another reminder of how much \nCongress needs to remember that we cannot put all of the Nation's \nenergy--or at least 25 percent of it--in one place. It is literally \nlike putting all of our eggs in one basket. As the saying goes, if you \nput all your eggs in one basket, you better take care of that basket.\n  The fact is, as we look forward to hopefully removing the moratorium \non Outer Continental Shelf drilling and exploration and production of \noil and building of refineries at home so we have to depend less on \nimported energy from the Middle East, that we will remember the lessons \nof Hurricane Ike and Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Katrina and \nHurricane Rita.\n  Frankly, I think putting so much of our Nation's energy capacity in \nan area that is from time to time going to be affected by these natural \ndisasters is something we ought to take note of and do something about. \nBy producing the ability, or at least allowing the ability, for more \nexploration and development and building of pipelines, building of \nrefineries in other parts of the country and, producing more at home, \nwe, as we use less by conservation measures, can produce more American \nenergy so we are less reliant on imported oil from the Middle East.\n  There have been a lot of interesting proposals being made. I want to \ncaution my colleagues against some of the proposals that claim to do \nmore about drilling but which in fact create further obstacles to \nfurther American oil exploration and drilling. As a matter of fact, one \nof the initial proposals we saw--I know this was in good faith. I am \nnot questioning the good faith of the proponents. But the effect of it \nwould actually be to raise taxes and diminish domestic oil production \nand actually limit energy exploration.\n  It is true, we would go from 85 to roughly 70 percent of the Outer \nContinental Shelf that would be available for drilling under this \nproposal, but what we would in effect be doing is putting a 60-vote \nbarrier on going into that other 70 percent in the future. I do not \nknow why, if we are willing to acknowledge the fact that modern \ndrilling technology will allow for the exploration and production of \noil in one place, such as the Outer Continental Shelf, why we would \nrestrict it in other places on the Outer Continental Shelf, or \ndeveloping the oil shale out West or perhaps even in the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge--in a 2,000-acre piece of frozen tundra in the \nmiddle of a 19 million-acre wildlife refuge--something that can be \ndeveloped, I believe, in an environmentally responsible way.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I have some remarks, this being Constitution Day, that I \nwant to make in closing. It was 221 years ago today when the delegates \nof the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia completed their work; \n39 of them signed it and gave us the very Government we have come to \nknow, we have come to love, and, sometimes, there are those who say \nthey have come to loathe it.\n  But today, we celebrate the very fact that we live in a country where \npeople have the freedom of speech, that we have our political rights to \npetition Government, where Government's power is acknowledged to come \nfrom the governed, ``we the People'' as Lincoln said, ``Government of \nthe people, by the people and for the people.'' It is not the decision \nof a small group of people here in Washington, DC that somehow has to \nbe fed to us like castor oil and we have to take it. This literally is \na government of the people representing all 300 million of us who live \nin this country that was created that day by that Constitution.\n  Mr. President, it was on this day, September 17, 1787, that the \ndelegates to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia completed \ntheir work. Thirty-nine of them signed the U.S. Constitution, setting \nup the government system that we have come to know, love, and sometimes \nloathe.\n  As Senators, we have sworn an oath to protect and defend the \nConstitution\n\n[[Page S8904]]\n\nof the United States. This is a duty and a responsibility that does not \ndiscriminate based on our party ideology. Still, it is our mutual love \nfor and defense of the Constitution that often provokes our most \nvigorous debates in this chamber. This spirited debate is vital to \nliberty and the continued survival of our Nation.\n  If you read Madison's notes from the Constitutional Convention, you \nwill see that the delegates themselves engaged in a lively debate about \nhow to best implement the principles of liberty, equality, and justice \nestablished in the Declaration of Independence. Years later, during the \njubilee celebration of the Constitution, John Quincy Adams said, ``The \nDeclaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States \nare parts of one consistent whole, founded upon one and the same theory \nof government.''\n  With population growth, increasing diversity, agricultural and \neconomic development and massive technological advancement, our Nation \nhas changed tremendously in the 221 years since the Constitution was \nsigned. Yet, despite these changes, there remains a fundamental \nconsistency in human nature.\n  James Madison expressed it best in the Federalist Papers, Number 51: \n``If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were \nto govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government \nwould be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered \nby men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first \nenable the government to control the governed; and in the next place \noblige it to control itself. A dependence on the people is, no doubt, \nthe primary control on the government; but experience has taught \nmankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions.''\n  You see, we are indebted to the Founding Fathers for their wisdom and \nforesight. They understood that human nature would be unlikely to \nchange, and that 18th century and contemporary American policymakers \nwould be pressured to promote policy solutions that may not serve the \npublic interest.\n  According to Madison, ``Complaints are everywhere heard from our most \nconsiderate and virtuous citizens, equally the friends of public and \nprivate faith, and of public and personal liberty, that our governments \nare too unstable, that the public good is disregarded in the conflicts \nof rival parties, and that measures are too often decided, not \naccording to the rules of justice and the rights of the minor party, \nbut by the superior force of an interested and overbearing majority. . \n. . These must be chiefly, if not wholly, effects of the unsteadiness \nand injustice with which a factious spirit has tainted our public \nadministrations.''\n  Madison was concerned about the effect of special interest groups on \nthe policy process. In Federalist 10 he wrote, ``The latent causes of \nfaction are thus sown in the nature of man; and we see them everywhere \nbrought into different degrees of activity, according to the different \ncircumstances of civil society. . . .''\n  ``So strong is this propensity of mankind to fall into mutual \nanimosities, that where no substantial occasion presents itself, the \nmost frivolous and fanciful distinctions have been sufficient to kindle \ntheir unfriendly passions and excite their most violent conflicts. But \nthe most common and durable source of factions has been the various and \nunequal distribution of property. Those who hold and those who are \nwithout property have ever formed distinct interests in society. Those \nwho are creditors, and those who are debtors, fall under a like \ndiscrimination. A landed interest, a manufacturing interest, a \nmercantile interest, a moneyed interest, with many lesser interests, \ngrow up of necessity in civilized nations, and divide them into \ndifferent classes, actuated by different sentiments and views. The \nregulation of these various and interfering interests forms the \nprincipal task of modern legislation, and involves the spirit of party \nand faction in the necessary and ordinary operations of the \ngovernment.''\n  In a pure democracy, Madison argues, ``A common passion or interest \nwill, in almost every case, be felt by a majority of the whole; a \ncommunication and concert result from the form of government itself; \nand there is nothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker \nparty or an obnoxious individual. . . . Such democracies have ever been \nspectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found \nincompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have \nin general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in \ntheir deaths. Theoretic politicians, who have patronized this species \nof government, have erroneously supposed that by reducing mankind to a \nperfect equality in their political rights, they would, at the same \ntime, be perfectly equalized and assimilated in their possessions, \ntheir opinions, and their passions.''\n  Since it is impossible to force everyone to share the same opinion \nand intensity of opinion, Madison seeks to control the effects of \nfactions by creating a republican form of government.\n  ``The two great points of difference between a democracy and a \nrepublic are,'' he writes, ``First, the delegation of the government, \nin the latter, to a small number of citizens elected by the rest; \nsecondly, the greater number of citizens, and greater sphere of \ncountry, over which the latter may be extended''.\n  ``The effect of the first difference is, on the one hand, to refine \nand enlarge the public views, by passing them through the medium of a \nchosen body of citizens, whose wisdom may best discern the true \ninterest of their country, and whose patriotism and love of justice \nwill be least likely to sacrifice it to temporary or partial \nconsiderations. Under such a regulation, it may well happen that the \npublic voice, pronounced by the representatives of the people, will be \nmore consonant to the public good than if pronounced by the people \nthemselves, convened for the purpose. On the other hand, the effect may \nbe inverted. Men of factious tempers, of local prejudices, or of \nsinister designs, may, by intrigue, by corruption, or by other means, \nfirst obtain the suffrages, and then betray the interests, of the \npeople''.\n  Madison was skeptical that elected representatives would always act \nin the public interest. ``Enlightened statesmen will not always be at \nthe helm,'' he wrote in Federalist 10.\n  Today, we have only to see the parade of huge spending bills that \nfind their way to the floor to know that it is a herculean task to \nwhet, much less control the appetites of the hundreds of organized \ninterest groups who want their piece of the federal pie made with tax \ndollars collected from hard working American families.\n  The entitlement mentality of many of these organized groups, many of \nwhich cannot lay claim to a substantial number of members, has \npressured an all too receptive Congress to grow the size of government, \nincrease spending to new heights, while we ignore insolvency of large \nentitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security, and hope that \nour children and grandchildren will bail us out for our bad decisions.\n  In their wisdom, the Founding Fathers wrote a Constitution that \nestablishes a system of separate institutions that share policymaking \nand political power. This was a clear effort to control the effects of \nfactions and to guard against despotic rulers.\n  The public elections established by the Constitution encourage the \nelectorate to select their representatives wisely.\n  For those of us privileged to be elected by the people, we have a \nsworn obligation to protect and defend the Constitution and to show \nourselves worthy of this great trust.\n  On any given day, not just anniversary dates like today, it is \nsomething we ought to think more about.\n  I see my colleague from Louisiana here. I am going to yield the rest \nof our time that we have in morning business to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska.) The Senator from \nLouisiana is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/17/senate-section/article/S8904-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8904-S8906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I stand to join with all other Senators, \nin fact, to join with all the American people, in offering our strong \nsupport for all of the hurricane victims Senator Cornyn talked about.\n  In fact, there is enormous devastation, enormous loss and continuing \nsuffering in those parts of the country,\n\n[[Page S8905]]\n\nparticularly in southeast Texas, hit hard by Ike, following right on \nthe heels of Hurricane Gustav. Our hearts go out to all of those folks. \nOur best wishes, our prayers are with them and our intent and focus \nhere in Congress to meet their basic needs, their key needs, is here as \nwell.\n  Representing Louisiana, of course, I have spent most of the last 3 \nweeks touring Louisiana and looking at hurricane damage there. Of \ncourse we were first hit by Hurricane Gustav, which had enormous winds, \ncaused major power outages, significant wind damage in many parts of \nthe State. And then right on the heels of that came Hurricane Ike. \nWhile Hurricane Ike slammed into southeast Texas, it pushed floodwaters \nin the Gulf all through coastal Louisiana, from the western edge at the \nTexas border all the way to the eastern edge, Plaquemines Parish, where \nLouisiana meets Mississippi.\n  We are still struggling with those challenges. But again, I want to \nacknowledge the even greater suffering, the even greater devastation \nthat others face from Hurricane Ike, particularly folks in Galveston \nand southeast Texas. Our hearts and prayers go out to them and our \ncommitment to help in every reasonable way possible goes out to them as \nwell. I trust Congress will act on that key priority as those folks \nface a true moment of crisis and extreme need.\n  As we act in that regard in the next couple of weeks, I also hope we \nnotice something Senator Cornyn mentioned, that part of our country, \nthe gulf coast, the Gulf of Mexico, particularly the western gulf, is \nenormously vital in terms of meeting our nation's energy needs. We are \nproud to offer that service to the Nation. We have a long, storied \ntradition in terms of that. We are very proud of that tradition. We \nwant it to continue. But, quite frankly, we do not want to continue to \nbe the only part of the country that meets our Nation's energy needs \nright here at home. We need to expand that activity. We need to bring \nthat same activity to other parts of the country, diversify, if you \nwill, have more activity and more places so we are not so singularly \nvulnerable to gulf hurricanes and storms as we are now, as we have \nlived through with the experiences of Katrina and then Rita, and now \nGustav and now Ike.\n  So as this Congress responds to the immediate needs of hurricane \nvictims in southeast Texas in the gulf coast, including Louisiana, I \nhope we also continue to focus and start acting on energy, and what \nremains a top priority for all of America.\n  I know there is a great rush to get out of here for the elections. I \nknow the leadership is pushing to adjourn for the elections as early as \nthe end of next week. But before we do that, we need to address the \nNation's business. We need to pass immediate relief for suffering \nhurricane victims, and we need to act, not just talk, not just debate, \ncertainly not fight or finger-point, but act on energy. Even in that \nlimited time period, I believe we can do all of those things in a \nsubstantial way.\n  With regard to developing an aggressive national energy plan, I have \nfour key priorities, and all of those priorities, I believe, are \nabsolutely achievable, even in that very tight timeframe.\n  No. 1, we must lift the current moratorium on offshore oil and gas \nproduction. The American people have spoken in a clear and resounding \nway. They think that current moratorium is crazy. They think we are \nnuts to take 85 percent or more of our domestic energy resources off \nthe table, not allow energy companies and producers to access or touch \nthem.\n  The way you change that is lifting the current moratorium under \nFederal law. Now, as we all know, that does not take action by \nCongress, it simply takes inaction by Congress. We need to make sure \nthat that moratorium, which expires on its own October 1, is not \nrenewed.\n  I urge all of my colleagues, Democratic and Republican, to listen to \nthe clear, crystal clear, clarion call of the American people: Do not \nextend that moratorium. We cannot put that moratorium in any continuing \nlaw such as a continuing resolution. We must lift that moratorium and \nallow the American people to access their own energy resources right \nhere at home.\n  No. 2, I think we should match aggressive action in that regard with \naggressive action with regard to new forms of energy, including \nrenewables. And the most significant, quickest thing we can do with \nregard to that is pass the major tax incentives that virtually all of \nus support with regard to new technology, new forms of energy, \nrenewables.\n  As we all know, that robust package of tax incentives is a major \ncomponent of the so-called tax extenders bill. We need to come together \naround a bipartisan version of that tax package, including those \nimportant incentives for new technology and renewable energy and pass \nthat into law.\n  Again, even in this very tight timeframe in which we operate, we can \ndo that. We must do that. We must act for the American people.\n  Third, I believe we should pass revenue sharing for offshore \nproduction to create an incentive for more States to get into that \nbusiness. As we lift the moratorium, as we open up all of our offshore \nto potential energy production, we should give participating States an \nincentive. And that powerful incentive would be royalty sharing, \nrevenue sharing, so they get 37.5 percent of the royalties produced \nfrom offshore production.\n  We set that policy, we set that precedent 2 years ago, with regard to \nnew production in the Gulf of Mexico. We should expand that precedent. \nWe should expand that policy as we allow and encourage offshore \nproduction in all parts of the country: the western gulf, the east \ncoast, the west coast, and elsewhere.\n  Finally, let me end with a fourth key point. My fourth key priority \nis something that is very important. It is not something we should do, \nit is something we should not do. If we are serious about domestic \nenergy production, if we are serious about energy independence, getting \naway from our reliance on foreign sources, we should not raise taxes on \ndomestic energy production.\n  The first rule of economics is that if you want more of something, \nyou do not tax it. Because when you tax something, you get less of it, \nnot more. I urge my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, not to \nincrease taxes in a significant way on domestic energy production. We \nwant more domestic energy production, we do not want less. So it is \nsimple economics that we do not tax what we want more of in a more \nonerous way because that will produce less of it.\n  This is not an economics theory, this is history and practice. This \nis our experience. President Jimmy Carter passed a windfall profits tax \nduring his tenure as President. What did that produce? It produced \nexactly what one might expect, less domestic production, less energy.\n  The proposals that are being floated now with regard to section 199 \nand other energy tax provisions are a windfall profits tax by another \nname. They will have precisely the same effect. They will drive down \ndomestic energy production when we want to drive it up. They will \ndiscourage activity at home in the energy sector when we want to \nencourage and expand it. It simply does not make any sense.\n  So I urge us not just to talk, not just to debate, certainly not to \nargue and finger-point and play partisan politics. I urge us to act. I \nurge us to come together in a bipartisan, responsible way and act as \nthe American people want us to act.\n  They support hurricane victims in East Texas and elsewhere who are \ndevastated by these storms, and we should support those victims too \nthrough concrete, responsible action. The American people support \nenergy independence. They support doing more for ourselves right here \nin this country with regard to energy. We should reflect their wisdom \nand act in that regard as well.\n\n  Specifically with regard to the four points I mentioned, No. 1, we \nmust ensure that the current moratorium on offshore production is \nlifted, that it is not renewed. All we have to do there is let the \nmoratorium expire and not renew it.\n  No. 2, we need to encourage new technology, renewables, through a \nrobust set of tax incentives in the tax bill. We need to pass that and \ndo it now. We need to act.\n\n[[Page S8906]]\n\n  No. 3, we must create an incentive for more States to get into the \nbusiness of offshore oil and gas production through revenue sharing. We \nmust expand that policy which we started 2 years ago in new production \nin the gulf.\n  No. 4, the last thing we should do if we want to increase domestic \nenergy production is tax it at higher and higher rates. Let us not pass \na new windfall profits tax by another name. Let us not discourage the \ndomestic energy sector and discourage domestic energy production, when \nwe all profess that we want to do the opposite.\n  I will be fighting for these four key priorities. We can accomplish \nall of them in the next 10 days. Let us show the American people we do \nget it, that we are responsible, that we can come together and work \ntogether, and that we can act in positive ways for their benefit.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I want to bring to the \nattention of the Senate a little known fact, as the clock continues to \ntick for us to take up drilling legislation off the Outer Continental \nShelf, in particular, the proposal that has been cast by the so-called \nGang of 10 as a compromise, which is looking at a comprehensive \napproach, which I applaud, that includes revenues. But it also includes \ntax incentives for alternative fuels and so forth.\n  The part the two Senators from Florida extremely object to is the \nfact of intruding in the military mission, the only testing and \ntraining area that is the largest for our U.S. Department of Defense, \nand all other agencies, including for classified and black programs \nthat go on for testing and evaluation in this training range.\n  But what is particularly egregious is that in opening up all of that \narea that is now closed pursuant to the statute we passed 2 years ago, \nthe 2006 statute--that we closed all of that area to drilling because \nof the military--in the opening of that area, and in the so-called \ngiving of revenue to the adjacent State--in this case Florida--well, lo \nand behold, all the revenue allocated to the State does not go to the \nState of Florida, even though it is the waters of the Gulf of Mexico \noff of the State of Florida.\n  What happens in the complicated formula that is there is that 10 \npercent of all the revenues from the leasing of Federal lands for oil \nand gas production goes to each State on the gulf. That would include \nTexas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. In other words, the revenue \ndoes not go to the State of Florida, even though it is off the coast of \nFlorida. Forty percent of that State revenue due to the State would go \nto the other States instead of Florida.\n  That is simply not fair. When I explain that to Senators, they are \nsurprised, and in some cases aghast, because common sense would tell \nyou it is not fair. That is another reason this Senator has put his \nfoot down that we are not going to let Florida, nor the Department of \nDefense, be the sacrificial lamb for some kind of proposal so people \ncan say we are drilling out there.\n  I want to drill. I want to drill offshore. But I want to drill where \nit makes sense. The formula that has been concocted certainly does not \nmake sense.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \ndevastation inflicted by Hurricane Ike. It is the worst hurricane to \nhit Texas in almost 50 years and probably the fourth costliest \nhurricane of all time.\n  Last week, when Hurricane Ike entered the Gulf of Mexico and started \nmoving toward Texas, State, local, and Federal officials came together \nand moved into action. We had reason to fear the worst. In the year \n1900, the island of Galveston was destroyed by a hurricane that claimed \nover 6,000 lives, the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history. I was \nborn on Galveston Island. I was raised in Galveston County. When I was \ngrowing up, I heard stories about 1900. There have been books written \nabout that hurricane of 1900. And we also faced on a yearly basis \nhurricane warnings. Of course, some of them hit.\n  While preparing for this storm, the people of Texas had fresh \nmemories from Hurricane Rita, another violent hurricane that came \nashore around Sabine Pass in 2005. While Hurricane Rita only caused \nseven direct fatalities, the evacuation and recovery efforts along the \ngulf coast were not without difficulties, and for that reason, everyone \nwho could possibly be helpful in this wanted to improve the emergency \npreparedness in advance of the next storm.\n  So in the days leading up to Hurricane Ike, Texas was prepared. Over \n1 million Texans successfully evacuated from their homes. However, when \nthe skies cleared on Saturday afternoon, it was clear that Hurricane \nIke had caused an appalling amount of property damage. From the early \nestimates, the cost of Hurricane Ike could reach almost $30 billion. \nForty-nine people are now confirmed dead. That number will surely rise. \nThousands are homeless. Many communities remain under water and are \ncompletely inaccessible due to the significant amount of debris. \nYesterday, 2.2 million Texans still lacked electricity. Emergency \nworkers are struggling to distribute food, water, and ice. Offshore oil \nplatforms are damaged and many refineries are without electricity. So \nit is likely that before the region's oil and gas industry return to \ncapacity, we will see some shortages in gasoline and, therefore, some \nhigher prices.\n  Gulf refineries and ports are the source of 50 percent of the fuel \nand crude used in the eastern half of the United States. Disruption of \nthat infrastructure underscores the urgent need for us to expand \nrefinery capacity. Indeed, we need to expand our entire energy supply \nso that America's economy is never undermined by acts of nature or \nforeign adversaries.\n  On Sunday, I joined with Senator John Cornyn, my colleague, and the \nSecretary of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff, and many members of \nour congressional delegation to survey the hardest-hit regions. We came \nto listen to the concerns raised by the mayors and the county judges, \nafter we had been on the telephone with them for the 4 days before, \ntrying to determine that people were as prepared as they could be in an \ninstance such as this and, of course, we wanted to try to correct any \nconcerns that had been raised. Some were raised. I will say that the \nmayors of our cities and the county judges have done a terrific job of \nrepresenting their constituents at the local level. I met with Mayor \nBill White of Houston, Mayor Lyda Ann Thomas from Galveston, Harris \nCounty Judge Ed Emmett, I talked on the phone with the mayor of Port \nArthur, Beaumont, the county judge of Orange County, trying to help in \nevery way we could from the Federal level.\n  Yesterday, I joined with the members of the Texas delegation who were \nhere. Many were still in Houston touring with the President to see the \ndamage and determine what more could be done. I talked to Senator \nLandrieu and Senator Vitter yesterday about their concerns about \nHurricane Ike which hit them very hard. We all know Louisiana has \nsuffered so much in the last few years with Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita. Texas joined them in suffering from the evacuees in Katrina and \nthen\n\n[[Page S8907]]\n\nRita, and now we have Ike. We jointly must have the support of all of \nour colleagues in Congress to help our constituents. We are working \ntogether--our Texas delegation, our Louisiana delegation--to have a \nsupplemental appropriation so that FEMA will be fully funded to address \nthe concerns.\n  The Corps of Engineers will have repairs to make throughout the gulf \ncoast. There are shelters that are going to be needed for families who \nhave nothing to go back to. As I passed over Bolivar Peninsula and I \nsaw what used to be a wonderful group of homes on stilts, today they \nare stilts. The homes are completely gone--completely gone--as if there \nwas never anything there but sticks. It was amazing to me because I \nhave been there so many times and seen these communities. So we are \ngoing to come together and we are going to help the people who have \nbeen afflicted.\n  I wish to speak for a moment about the people of Texas. We are known, \nI guess, around the country for being a hearty bunch and usually a \nhappy bunch and always resilient. We have a great spirit in Texas. I \nnever have seen it any more so than right now. Colleagues in Galveston \nand Bolivar Peninsula, Port Arthur, Beaumont, Orange, Harris County, \nHouston, many are down because they have not been able to get back in \nto see their homes. On Galveston Island the health conditions are so \nbad that they are not letting people come back on the island, so people \nhave not even seen their homes. They are very frustrated.\n  But the generous spirit of Texans is surrounding those who are \nafflicted. The spirit, the pride, the resilience is there. I have seen \nour citizens do everything they can on a personal level. One of my \nregional directors of Harris County, Jason Fuller, has 12 Texans living \nwith him right now, including three new dogs and a cat. He is doing his \npart on a personal level. He is also going out to the shelters and \nrepresenting our constituents and trying to make sure that the points \nof distribution are open, things he can do. Some communities that don't \nhave power organized block parties and they are having barbeques and \ncookouts because they have no electricity in their homes. Local \nchurches, the Baptist Men, the Second Baptist Church in Houston has an \nincredible outpouring. The local churches are providing staff support. \nVolunteers are distributing the water and ice and food to surrounding \ncommunities. There are so many good things happening. Neighbors are \ncoming together to help neighbors.\n\n  I wish to ask my colleagues to help us. Because we do have an \nemergency disaster bill coming through for many areas of the Midwest \nthat have suffered from previous disasters, I am going to ask, along \nwith my colleague John Cornyn and my colleagues Mary Landrieu and David \nVitter that we be included in this. We don't have the exact assessments \nyet, but we know it is going to be big. We know we have given for \nKatrina. We have given to other disasters. What we ask is to be treated \nin the same way so we can recover and get our economies going again, \nget our jobs going again, get our schools open, which are not yet done \nin many parts of our State, so that we can recover, clean up, and begin \ncontributing again to the economy as we have done so much in the past.\n  I thank my colleagues for listening. My heart goes out to my \nconstituents who are suffering right now in Texas. I am going to stay \nin constant contact with them. I wish to say particularly how much I \nappreciate our Secretary of Homeland Security who has so many \nresponsibilities, who has already been to Texas and Louisiana once, who \nis going back today as we speak, and will be there to try to solve any \nproblems that have arisen. As well prepared as we were, there were \nthings that had not been done. Some lack of coordination has occurred. \nHe is going down there personally to try to fix that. We appreciate \nthat very much and we want to work with him hand in hand to assure that \nour communities get up and going and that my beloved Galveston Island \nwill once again be able to bring in tourists because of its beauty and \nits historic value, its ports and its beautiful beaches. I am going to \nwork tirelessly to make sure that happens, along with all of the other \nareas of our coast that have been damaged.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/17/senate-section/article/S8907-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8907-S8910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last night, just a short ways off the Senate \nChamber, I met with Chairman Bernanke, Secretary Paulson, and others. \nThe meeting came at the request of the administration. These two men \nexpressed their views on the deepening economic turmoil and laid out a \nplan that has now been reported in the media this morning.\n  AIG, arguably the largest insurance company in the world, was in the \nprocess of going bankrupt. The deadline was 8 o'clock last night. The \nboard of directors met to see if they would accept the offer made by \nthe Federal Government to attempt to save parts of the company. \nObviously, the meeting ended with the board of directors approving the \nbailout. The Secretary and the Chairman promised to provide more \ndetails of their plans in the near future, which I believe must address \nthe broader underlying structural issues in the financial markets.\n  I just completed a press conference with a number of other Senators, \nand the press was asking question after question: What is the Senate \ngoing to do? The answer is very clear: This is a multitrillion dollar \nproblem which has been ongoing for a long time. We are going to have to \nget some committee hearings underway, which is why we are not going to \nadjourn. We will be in pro forma session so committees can still meet, \nthough we won't have any activities here on the floor as relates to \nthese markets.\n  Secretary Paulson has said this will have to take place in the next \nadministration because there is so much to be determined in the \ndirection we need to go. They gave every impression, these two good \nmen, that they are attempting to do the best they can to understand \nAmerica's financial institutions and the problems with them. But the \ngood intentions of these two decent men cannot escape the reality that \nthe Bush administration's willful neglect of oversight and an \noverzealous embrace of big business are directly responsible for the \ncrisis we now face.\n  The most important job of our country is to safeguard the American \npeople from physical and financial harm. This was the role of the great \nFranklin Roosevelt. That is the role of any President. But it seems \nthis President has focused only on protecting us from physical harm. \nThe financial harm needs to be part of the duties of the President. \nWhen it comes to the financial sector, this means ensuring that \ninstitutions do not impose systematic risks on the entire system \nbecause of the ripple effect that can have on our economy.\n  Democrats and Republicans who have served before our current \nPresident have all understood that providing oversight--oversight of \neverything but also of our financial sector--is not somehow \nanticapitalistic. Just the opposite--it helps capitalism flourish. But \nthat all changed with George Bush and Dick Cheney. When they came to \npower, there was no more oversight. They are such devout followers of \nthe top-down, big-business-first, Herbert Hoover approach to the \neconomy that they see any oversight as a threat to their greed. They \nput cronies and ideologues in charge of the most critical agencies, \nincluding the Justice Department. Alberto Gonzales is the poster child \nof that, hiring people who only graduated from certain select religious \nuniversities. I repeat, they put cronies and ideologues in charge of \nour most critical regulatory agencies, who ensured that special \ninterests would always come before the common good. They refused to \nexercise their regulatory authority over the mortgage industry, \nallowing massive fraud and widespread predatory lending.\n  Now, what is predatory lending? Look it up in the dictionary. I did. \nIt is the practice of preying on borrowers with deceptive, dishonest \nloan offers. This paved the way for the largest\n\n[[Page S8908]]\n\nmortgage crisis in American history--a bigger crisis than during the \nGreat Depression. And the reason for that is the great work done by \nPresident Roosevelt and the New Deal and the work done by President \nJohnson with the great things he did so people could buy homes. So of \ncourse more people own homes now than then. Republicans, though, \ncontinued to ignore the problem long after the extent of the plundering \nand pillaging of the mortgage market became widely known.\n  I have a friend, Mr. President. I have known him a long time. We did \nwork together. His name is Joe Alioto, Jr. His father was a famous \nlawyer and mayor of San Francisco. In my estimation, Joe Alioto, Jr., \nis one of the most legal scholars and the finest antitrust lawyer in \nthe country--doing plaintiffs work, not defense work. He has done some \ngreat things to help our society. He is so concerned about what has \nhappened these past 8 years. The Justice Department has not touched \nthese economic conspiracies going on. They have ignored it. It has to \nchange.\n  Mr. President, talking about regulation, remember last Christmas? It \nstarted around this time, a couple weeks from now. What were people \nconcerned about? Kids getting sick and dying from toys. Why? Because 80 \npercent of our toys are manufactured in other places, most of them in \nChina.\n  We discovered, during that period of time, that the Bush \nadministration, in their zealousness to do away with regulation--they \nhate oversight so much that the Consumer Product Safety Commission had \nliterally one man in a cubbyhole, a windowless cubbyhole, in charge of \ntesting every toy in America for the safety of our children. Our \nchildren were not protected by a team of engineers or by consumer \nexperts but by a single employee who could do little more than to drop \na toy from his desk on the floor to see if it would break. And that is \nthe truth.\n  The financial turmoil we are now seeing is a direct outcome of the \nirresponsible Bush-Cheney approach to governing--which, by the way, \nJohn McCain has supported every step of the way. As he said day before \nyesterday: The fundamentals of this economy are strong.\n  There is a cartoon today running in the Las Vegas Sun newspaper. The \ncartoon is by syndicated columnist Mike Smith. You see all his cartoons \nin all the newspapers and magazines in the country. It shows a ship in \nthe ocean. Three-quarters of it is underwater, but the caption is: The \nhull is fundamentally strong.\n  This administration's fervor to favor big business has crippled the \nvery big companies they sought to strengthen, and now the American \nconsumer is the one hurt the most. When the history books are written, \nthey will show that while Bush and Cheney were giving away the keys to \nthe castle to big business, Democrats in Congress were trying to \nrestore fiscal sanity.\n  In 2000, Senator Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, a senior Democrat on the \nBanking Committee and one of America's all-time great Senators, \nintroduced the Predatory Lending Consumer Protection Act to restrict \nabusive lending practices. The same year, Senator Schumer introduced \nthe Predatory Lending Consumer Protection Act. In 2002, Senator \nSarbanes reintroduced his bill.\n  When we came with the rewrite of the bankruptcy law, Senator Durbin \noffered an amendment to say, if you have predatory lending practices \nyou cannot recover that matter in Bankruptcy Court. That was defeated \nby the Republicans by one vote.\n  In 2004, Senator Sarbanes and the current chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, Senator Dodd, called on the Federal Reserve to take action \non alternative mortgages. Senator Dodd called them a ``nightmare'' for \nlow-income Americans--4 years ago.\n  In 2005, the House of Representatives passed bipartisan legislation \nto reform the regulation of government-sponsored enterprises such as \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac. After passing the House 331 to 90, the \nDemocratic minority in the Senate tried to pass it but were blocked by \nthe White House and Senate Republicans. This was one of the many \nRepublicans have put out.\n  Representative Mike Oxley, one-time chairman of the House Banking \nCommittee and a devout Republican, brought this legislation to the \nWhite House. As he put it, these are his words, the administration gave \nthe legislation the ``one-finger salute.''\n  In February 2008 Senate Democrats introduced the Foreclosure \nPrevention Act, which was blocked by Senate Republicans after a veto \nthreat from the White House. This is one of the Republicans' 94 \nfilibusters in the last 20 months.\n  In June 2008 the White House threatened to veto the Federal Housing \nFinance Regulatory Reform Act, which would have improved oversight of \nFannie and Freddie. The reason for the veto threat is here. This is \nwhat they said--they didn't want to help communities struggling with \nforeclosed properties. That is what I said, not what they said, but \nthat is what it boiled down to. They wanted the market to take care of \nit.\n  If the President had signed that bill this past June, we perhaps \ncould have saved billions--I won't say ``perhaps.'' We would have saved \nbillions we will now have to spend to bail out Fannie and Freddie. In \nevery one of these instances, Democrats saw the storm clouds gathering \nand attempted to pass legislation that could have steered our course \naway from the crisis we now face. But every time the White House and \nSenate Republicans chose to continue along their irresponsible path. \nThink about how irresponsible this is.\n  Even this year, with the housing market fully in turmoil and crisis, \nRepublicans broke all Senate records by filibustering the housing \nbill--not once, not twice, not three times, not four times, not five \ntimes, not six times--seven times. Every day the Republicans blocked us \nfrom finally passing housing legislation at least 9,000 Americans went \ninto foreclosure. People in Pennsylvania, people in Maryland, all over \nthis great country, went into foreclosure. During the Republicans' \nseven-time filibusters more than 160,000 homes went into foreclosure.\n  When Republicans had a chance to help, they wanted the status quo. \nOne thing has happened here the last few weeks. Republicans can no \nlonger have the status quo. That is gone. They tried for almost 8 years \nto maintain the status quo, and it is not going to be the status quo \nanymore. After 8 years of a failed approach, President Bush is ready to \nleave office and have the financial nightmare given to the next \nPresident. President Bush's preferred candidate is a disciple of the \nBush-Cheney school of economics. If there is any doubt about it, just \nlook to the man John McCain hired to tell him what to say on this \neconomy, former Senator Phil Gramm.\n  This is the same Phil Gramm who pushed through legislation that \nallowed firms such as Enron to avoid regulation and destroy the life \nsavings of its employees and now allows Wall Street traders today to \nbid up the price of oil without oversight, leaving us the bill to pay--\nand some bill it is to pay.\n  An eminent economist at the University of Texas, James Galbraith, \nsaid Gramm was ``the most aggressive advocate of every predatory and \nrapacious element the financial sector has. . . . He's a sorcerer's \napprentice of instability and disaster in the financial system.''\n  Warren Buffett, one of the richest men in the world, called the \nresult of Gramm's legislation ``weapons of mass destruction.''\n  I don't know about you, but after all that has gone on in the \nfinancial sector, the last person I want whispering in the ear of the \nnext President of the United States is the chief architect and No. 1 \ncheerleader for the elimination of responsible oversight.\n  My office received a call: I don't know if you should say anything \nabout Senator Gramm because there was something called the Gramm-Leach-\nBliley Act that said one holding company could own more than one \nfinancial services company. They said you better look how you voted.\n\n  I voted against that bill. I remember very clearly. I was the person \nhandling this floor during that period of time for Senator Daschle. I \nvoted against that bill. We took that matter to conference, and we \nimproved the bill in conference. The main issue at that time, for we \nDemocrats, was they were red-lining people. The banks would just red-\nline places. They wouldn't make loans outside of a certain area.\n  It happened in Pennsylvania. The Presiding Officer is aware of that. \nWe\n\n[[Page S8909]]\n\nspent a lot of time trying to change that. Did we get everything we \nwanted? No, we didn't. But it came back from conference, and it passed \nby an overwhelming vote. I voted against the bill. But the main point \nof that legislation is that it still allowed regulation. It didn't say \nthe regulators could no longer regulate. The problem is regulators, \nduring that period of time, had been asleep at the switch. They have \nnot enforced what is on the books, and that should be the focus: that \nMcCain's philosophy and Bush's philosophy are the same.\n  I am going to continue talking about the fact this man, John McCain, \nis taking a lot of advice from a person who eminent economists and \nbusiness people say has been a disaster for our economy.\n  After 8 years of this failed approach, we have what we have. On \nMonday, with one major investment bank headed for bankruptcy, another \nsold at a bargain price to avoid the same fate, tens of thousands of \npeople losing their jobs, and one of the largest insurance companies \nteetering, John McCain declared that the fundamentals of the economy \nare strong.\n  The straight talk express is really in bad shape. This vehicle has \nfenders ripped off of it. There are very few seats left inside it. It \nhit another big wall on Monday, hit another big wall on Tuesday, and \ntoday it hit another big wall. The wall today is that John McCain said \ntoday--this just came out in the Associated Press--he said today the \nreason for all this stuff is lack of good regulation.\n  How in the world could the straight talk express say that? I think \nthat is one reason I am not sure the straight talk express is even \nrunning after the last three collisions. It is in very bad shape. But \nyesterday even John McCain finally acknowledged what everyone else \nalready knew. I guess he no longer thought the fundamentals of the \neconomy were great, as he said a day or so before that. What he said is \nthe economy is broken. That is some switch, isn't it--from being sound \nfundamentally to broken? But who does McCain think broke it? Was it \nGeorge Bush, Dick Cheney, Phil Gramm, McCain's own Republican Congress?\n  The economy is not going to turn around overnight. We can't snap our \nfingers or pass a bill and expect the problems to be solved instantly. \nWe were told that last night by Chairman Bernanke and Secretary \nPaulson. This whole situation is not going to be easy. It is going to \ntake bipartisan cooperation. I know for certain we are not going to fix \nour economy with a candidate who only yesterday woke up and realized \nthere is a problem.\n  Last month, 606,000 jobs were lost. I don't know how many will be \nlost this month. I know Hewlett-Packard gave it a good start by laying \noff 25,000 people yesterday. I don't know how many people lost their \njobs with Lehman Brothers. I don't know how many people are going to \nlose their jobs with AIG.\n  I would like for once this administration to come to me with a \nproblem that they would like to help us work on to help the middle \nclass. They come to us all the time to bail out that big company or \nthat big company or that big company or this big conglomerate. But \nwhere are they for emergency meetings to help people who can't afford \ngas or health insurance or can't afford to keep their kids in college?\n  We are paying record prices for gas, groceries, health care. That \ndidn't happen yesterday. Millions of families are losing their homes to \nforeclosure or seeing their home equity disappear. That didn't happen \nyesterday.\n  Monday's McCain said our economy is strong. Tuesday's McCain said our \neconomy is broken. Wednesday's McCain said it is because of lack of \nregulation. Try to figure that out. This is the straight talk express \nwhich is broken and in bad shape, and he can't find passengers anymore.\n  Perhaps today's McCain will explain how a candidate who spent 30 \nyears in Washington siding with Wall Street over Main Street, who \nchanged his view on the economy 180 degrees in 24 hours--I think he is \nrunning into himself--is prepared to lead us on the road to economic \nrecovery? I don't think he is.\n  The extraordinary economic challenges we now face demand leadership \nand a new approach. The Senate will continue to listen intently to any \nproposal the administration offers, but we know the real change we need \nwill come only when we have a President who will act as a guardian for \nthe American people--not only their physical protection but their \nfiscal protection--rather than as a guarantor for the titans of Wall \nStreet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his \ncomments. I agree completely with him that the circumstances have \nreached a point that we need to change direction, and we need \nleadership that will move us from the policies of the past to deal with \nthe economic problems that we currently confront.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I can proceed as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, the problems we have been talking about on \nMain Street America have reached Wall Street. I have taken the \nopportunity to speak on the floor on several occasions about the fact \nthat the problems homeowners were facing in losing their homes in \nforeclosure were not just the problems of those particular homeowners, \nthat it affects each and every one of us, that it was a housing crisis \nin America that would affect our entire economy. I talked about the \nfact that we have an obligation to try to do something to help.\n  Foreclosure rates are now at historically high levels. In August of \nthis year, there were over 300,000 foreclosures in America. In my own \nState of Maryland, we have had over 3,000 foreclosures each and every \nmonth. Maryland is normally a quiet State. Homeowners are wondering \nwhether they are going to be able to hold on to their homes. Homeowners \nhave suffered from a significant reduction in property values. All \nhomeowners have suffered through this. When there is a foreclosure in a \nneighborhood, it affects every house in that community.\n  The real estate industry is suffering through declining home sales. \nWe know the numbers are dramatically lower. We know what that means as \nfar as the economy is concerned. Housing starts are at their 17-year \nlow.\n  We know the impact these economic conditions are having on middle-\nincome families. Their wages have been stagnant--in fact, in real \nterms, have fallen--and yet their needs have increased; the high cost \nof energy, the high cost of health care, the cost of trying to afford a \ncollege education for their children, even affording their food budget. \nSo we know middle-income families are hurting. We know Main Street is \nhurting.\n  But now we see that these problems have gone to Wall Street. We \nlearned a few months ago about Bear Stearns and that the Government had \nto come to the rescue of Bear Stearns in order to make sure the jitters \non Wall Street would be contained. That was followed by the Government \ncoming in and standing behind Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, putting tens \nof billions of dollars of U.S. Government potential expenditures at \nrisk. This past week, we saw that Lehman Brothers, an entity that had \nsurvived the stock market crash of 1929, went bankrupt. Merrill Lynch \nwas sold at a bargain-basement price. AIG now has Government \ninvolvement. This past Monday, the stock market fell by over 500 \npoints--the Dow Jones average--which is the largest single drop since \nthe terrorist attacks of September 2001. The taxpayers are being asked \nto stand behind these financial institutions. Individuals who depended \nupon their investments for retirement or for savings have seen a large \npart of that evaporate.\n  The administration says the economy is basically sound. John McCain \nsays the fundamentals of our economy are strong. Well, it is the \neconomic policies of this administration that have made it much more \nvulnerable. It was the former Secretary of HUD, Alphonso Jackson, who \nsaid, ``Let's take a hands-off approach.'' The lack of Federal \nregulation and the lack of this administration's oversight of the \nfinancial institutions in our country have certainly led to where we \nare today.\n  Our economy is much more vulnerable because of the economic policies \nof this administration. Let me give you a few examples.\n\n[[Page S8910]]\n\n  We have seen that during the past 8 years this administration has \ntaken an economy with large budget surpluses to an economy with large \nbudget deficits. This administration took a national debt that was a \nlittle over $5 trillion and we are now approaching $10 trillion. They \ntook a surplus of a couple of hundred billion dollars a year and turned \nit into a deficit of over $400 billion a year. They have grown the \ntrade deficit to over $700 billion a year, costing us jobs here in \nAmerica. They have had a policy that yielded to the oil companies this \noil dependency where we are not energy independent, so gasoline prices \napproach $4 a gallon. The health care system has seen 6 million more \nAmericans lose their health insurance and become uninsured as a result \nof the administration's policies. And the unemployment rate that was a \nlittle over 4 percent has grown to over 6 percent.\n  Now, Congress has taken some steps in order to try to deal with this. \nQuite frankly, we could have taken those steps a little faster if it \nwere not for the Republican filibusters. But we need to do a lot more. \nWe have taken steps to try to help families save their homes. Yes, I \nthink we should be doing more. I was listening to the assistant \nmajority leader talking about ways we could do that through changes in \nthe bankruptcy laws. I think we need to do that. There are things we \ncan do to help homeowners save their homes.\n  We can certainly do more to help families deal with the consequences \nof this economy, whether it is the high cost of energy and air-\nconditioning their homes or, in the winter, heating their homes or \nwhether there are other areas we can help those who are suffering \nthrough this economy.\n  I hope our colleagues will not filibuster those opportunities so we \ncan help those who have lost their jobs. I think we have a \nresponsibility. That is what Government should be doing. The economy is \nnot producing the jobs they need. They cannot find jobs through no \nfault of their own; it is the economic problems. That is where \nGovernment can help.\n  We could certainly have the right regulatory and oversight system to \ndeal with what is happening with our financial institutions.\n  But we need to get back to basics. We need to get back to fiscal \nresponsibility. You cannot cut taxes, go to war, and not pay for the \nwar or pay for the tax cuts and get these huge deficits and expect our \neconomy to be strong. Fiscal responsibility starts with balancing the \nbudget, by recognizing that tax cuts have to be paid for and this war \nspending has to be paid for. Quite frankly, I believe the right course \nis to get our troops out of Iraq and save those dollars.\n  We have to help deal with a trade policy, a trade policy that will \ngive American workers a level playing field so they can compete. They \ncan compete with any country in the world, with their workforce, if it \nis a level playing field. But we need an administration that is going \nto fight for environmental and labor standards so that we have that \nlevel playing field and that will eliminate the tax breaks we give in \nour own code for companies that take their jobs overseas. That makes no \nsense at all. We need to fight for those changes.\n  We need an energy policy that will make this country truly \nindependent. We need to do that not just for our economy--and we know \nthe cost of energy and what has happened because of countries halfway \naround the world changing their production, and it affects the price \nhere in America. It affects our economy. But we have to do it for our \nown security so we do not have to go to war because we are in danger of \nlosing oil. We have to do it for our environment because global climate \nchange is real. We can accomplish all three of those goals by energy \nindependence and help our economy.\n  But we are not going to achieve it through drilling. I know there are \na lot of people here who want to drill. We have 3 percent of the \nworld's reserves; we use 25 percent of the world's oil. You are not \ngoing to get energy independence through drilling. Yes, we support \ndrilling where it can be done in a sensible way because we need the \noil, certainly in the short term, but we need to develop alternative \nand renewable energy sources. That makes the most sense for this \ncountry. That is what we have to do. We have to use less energy.\n  We can become energy independent if we set our minds to do it. I hope \nwe will take this as the last wake-up call and at least enact policies \nthat will truly make us energy independent. We are going to have a \nchance to do that later this week--at least move in that direction--and \nI hope my colleagues will join me in supporting that legislative \neffort.\n  We have to take on the health care system. It is too costly in \nAmerica. We spend too much money on health care. We do not have the \nresults to indicate that. It is a national disgrace that we have 47 \nmillion without health insurance in America. And each of us is paying \nfor it. We are paying for it through higher taxes and through higher \npremium costs. It is time that every American has access to affordable, \nquality health care, and that means we have to deal with the 47 million \nwho are uninsured. They need to have insurance.\n\n  We need to deal with preventative health care. It saves a lot of \nmoney to make sure people are able to get the test and lab work \nnecessary to have early intervention into diseases.\n  It makes sense for us to take on the pharmaceutical manufacturers. \nWhy are we paying three times what the consumers of the industrialized \nworld are paying for the same medicines that are manufactured here? Our \ntaxpayers are paying for that. And those of us who pay our bills are \nalso paying more for pharmaceuticals than we should.\n  In short, we have to get back to basics. We have to get back to \nbasics. We need to change the economic policies of this administration, \nget back to fiscal responsibility, get back to energy independence, and \nget back to health care reform.\n  Let's do the things that will make this Nation competitive. And if we \ndo, our economy will not be as vulnerable as it is today. That is why \nwhat started as a mortgage problem grew into a housing crisis, grew \ninto an economic problem for working families, and now it is affecting \nWall Street. It does not make any difference whether you are an \nemployee or employer, company or worker, you are being hurt badly by \nthe economic policies of this administration.\n  It is time for us to work together, Democrats and Republicans. This \nis not a partisan issue. It should not be a partisan issue. Energy \nindependence should not be a partisan issue. Health care reform should \nnot be a partisan issue. Balancing the budget should not be a partisan \nissue. So let's work together, Democrats and Republicans. Let's help \nthose who are looking to their Government in this time of need to be \nthere to help them. Let's do the right thing for the people who need \nour help. But then let's rebuild our economy so we are never as \nvulnerable as we are today, so that we have the economic basis to be \nable to deal with the normal cycles in the economy without so many \nfamilies losing their homes and so many families being wiped out on \ntheir savings. We can do this if we work together.

Mr. President, my colleague has made a case for more \nGovernment intervention into the problems on Wall Street and in our \neconomy, basically blaming the free markets for our failures.\n  I would like to make it clear what I think most Americans already \nknow, which is that many of the problems we are having today, \nparticularly the problems with AIG, the failures on Wall Street, the \nmortgage industry, actually go back not to greed in the private market \nbut political greed--the problems that were created when this Congress \nand this Government set up Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as government-\nsponsored enterprises with\n\n[[Page S8911]]\n\nthe implied and now very explicit backing of the American people. It \nprovided so much cheap credit to the market, securities that were \nbought and sold by many companies. AIG is in trouble because of these \nbad mortgages that basically originated with Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac.\n  My point is that the problems we are having are caused by the wrong \nkind of Government intervention. This is not a failure of free \nenterprise; this is a failure of Government solutions and the lack of \nGovernment oversight into enterprises such as Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac that were started.\n  Now, in a situation where we already have debt as a nation, we are \nborrowing excessively and our economy is slowing down. We are in a \nsituation where we have to continue to spend money to bail out these \ncompanies because of bad Government decisions decades ago. A lot of \nmoney is being spent and a lot is being wasted by this Congress.\n  We have had a debate over the last 2 years about wasteful spending \nand earmarks. There has been a lot of talk about creating more \ntransparency and stopping this wasteful spending. We had an ethics bill \nthat passed with a lot of fanfare where we talked about making these \nearmarks more transparent, putting them in the bills themselves so that \nthe American people could see what we are spending, and that if we were \ngoing to have a ``bridge to nowhere,'' at least the American people \nknew we were spending that money.\n  We have talked about this for the past 2 years, and even the \nPresident has recognized that so much of this earmarking has resulted \nin wasteful spending in transportation, and especially in the military, \nthat he has issued an Executive order that has made it clear that when \nwe produce a bill, such as the Defense authorization bill, and then, as \nan aside, we produce what we call report language, with oftentimes \nthousands of earmarks, politically directed spending all over the \ncountry--few that the military asked for, most they did not.\n  A lot of these are meritorious projects. The fact is, if we want to \nlook up the bill itself, the text, and search for different types of \nspending, it is not available because it is not in the bill itself. For \nmany years in the Senate and the Congress as a whole we have produced \nspending and authorization bills and then did the report language on \nthe side with hidden earmarks that people didn't know were there. The \nPresident said in his Executive order that when we send a bill over \nwith report language on the side, he is going to direct his agencies \nnot to honor these earmarks unless they are meritorious, unless they \nagree with the mission of the agency and the purpose of the \nlegislation. It doesn't mean these are all taken out and lost, which is \nwhat has been presented on the Senate floor today. What it means is \nthey have scrutiny; that the administration, if it sees wasteful \nprojects, does not feel obligated to spend the money, which is a good \nthing.\n  In this Defense authorization bill, some Senators, my Democratic \ncolleagues, have decided they want to go around the Executive order. \nThey want all of these earmarks to have the force of law, which means \nwhether they are meritorious or not the administration has to honor \nthem. The way they have done this, which sets us back years as far as \nearmark reform in the Senate, is they have put a little section in this \nbill that references all of these earmarks and in effect makes them \nlaw. What I have offered is an amendment. I asked to have one amendment \non this bill. There is a tradition in the Senate that Senators are \nallowed to offer an amendment. I have been waiting a week to offer the \namendment. It strikes that section that tries to secretly attach all of \nthe earmarks to the actual law. It is a simple amendment of three \nwords: ``Strike section 1002.'' It does not eliminate all of the \nearmarks, but it gives the administration the right they should have \nnot to spend money on projects in this green book that are not needed \nby the military or to defend this country and that the military \nconsiders wasteful. We should not allow Members of the Senate to \npretend to have reformed the earmark process, to pretend to have a more \nethical process, when, in fact, what they have done is the most \nunethical thing we have ever done with earmarks: to try to make \nsomething secret actually have the force of law with a little section \nwritten here.\n  My amendment would change that and put it back to the way it has been \nfor years. I ask my colleagues not to go backwards as far as earmark \nreform, not to defy what the American people have told us increasingly \nabout wasteful spending at a time of an economic downturn, a time of \nwar, a time of heavy debt, when we have 5 billion dollars' worth of \nearmarks in this little green book that Americans won't see, and we \ncan't bring it up, as we talked about in the ethics reform bill, in a \nsearchable format where people can find all this wasteful spending. It \nis hidden, and it is not right.\n  I encourage my colleagues to appeal to the majority leader to give me \nthis amendment so that we can at least have a vote. I encourage all \ncolleagues to vote for it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I think that September 17 should be honored \nequally with the Fourth of July. Both dates mark bedrock, fundamentally \nimportant events in the life of our country. Most Americans know that \nJuly 4, 1776, marks the signing of the Declaration of Independence, but \nfar fewer could say what is so important about September 17.\n  I am sure that you are not scratching your head over this date, but \nperhaps some who are listening are doing just that. September 17--does \nit mark the end of the American Revolution? Was it the date of George \nWashington's inauguration? Did Christopher Columbus spot land or the \npassengers of the Mayflower disembark on this date? The answer to all \nof the above is no. Those are important historical events, to be sure, \nbut none of those dates reaches out to touch the daily lives in as many \nways as September 17.\n  On September 17, 1787, the U.S. Constitution was signed. Our great \nnational experiment in representative democracy began nearly 2 years \nlater with the approval and entry into force of the Constitution on \nMarch 4, 1789, after New Hampshire became the ninth State to ratify it. \nSeptember 17, 1787, however, marks the ``miracle in Philadelphia'' when \nthe Constitutional Convention gave birth to its masterpiece.\n  We all know that the Declaration of Independence describes in soaring \noratory the grand goals for the new Republic, chief among them the \n``life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness'' that most people \nrecognize. It is also full of more specific examples of things the \nFounders could no longer tolerate, such as taxation without \nrepresentation, having British troops quartered in private homes, and \nlack of access to fair trials. In the Constitution, the Founders \ncreated the structures of government to implement both the grand \nvisions of a free republic and to prevent the abuses of government they \nhad suffered under British rule and outlined in the Declaration. As a \nresult, the Constitution generally makes for less compelling reading \nmaterial than the Declaration of Independence. It is not full of \nstirring prose, but rather, it is like an assembly and repair manual, \nstraightforward and commonsense. Yet it supports the framework for \nfreedom and justice. Its words, and those of its amendments, are as \ncritically important to every American as instructions on how to \noperate a lifeboat are to the passengers of a storm-tossed ship.\n  The Constitutional Convention that met in Philadelphia managed to \nbuild an entire government in just seven articles and a preamble. One \narticle for the legislative branch, one for the executive branch, one \nfor the judicial branch, one for the States, one for the amendment \nprocess, one to define Federal power, and one to set forth the \nrequirements for ratification--the Constitution is shorter than many \ninstruction manuals for new cars, even if you\n\n[[Page S8912]]\n\nadd the 27 amendments. Yet, for over 200 years, the Constitution and \nthe Government it created have overcome the challenges of insurrection, \nwar, depression, growth, and technologies that could never have been \nanticipated by the Founding Fathers.\n  This fall and winter, Americans will again witness their Constitution \nin action. We will elect a new President and many new Members of the \nHouse and Senate as well. Through the processes outlined in the \nConstitution and honed through years of practice, the Nation will \npeacefully transition to a new government. It seems routine to us, but \nthe peaceful transition of government is a precious thing. Our system \nof checks and balances is a precious thing.\n  On September 17, I hope that all Americans who love our country and \ncherish our flag will take just a few minutes to read and think about \nour remarkable Constitution. Keep it close to your heart, as I do.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na Washington Post article entitled ``Cheney Shielded Bush From \nCrisis.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post Sept. 15, 2008]\n\n                    Cheney Shielded Bush From Crisis\n\n                          (By Barton Gellman)\n\n       Vice President Cheney convened a meeting in the Situation \n     Room at 3 p.m. on Wednesday, March 10, 2004, with just one \n     day left before the warrantless domestic surveillance program \n     was set to expire. Around him were National Security Agency \n     Director Michael V. Hayden, White House counsel Alberto R. \n     Gonzales and the Gang of Eight--the four ranking members of \n     the House and the Senate, and the chairmen and vice chairmen \n     of the intelligence committees.\n       Even now, three months into a legal rebellion at the \n     Justice Department, President Bush was nowhere in the \n     picture. He was stumping in the battleground state of Ohio, \n     talking up the economy.\n       With a nod from Cheney, Hayden walked through the program's \n     vital mission. Gonzales said top lawyers at the NSA and \n     Justice had green-lighted the program from the beginning. Now \n     Attorney General John D. Ashcroft was in the hospital, and \n     James B. Comey, Ashcroft's deputy, refused to certify that \n     the surveillance was legal.\n       That was misleading at best. Cheney and Gonzales knew that \n     Comey spoke for Ashcroft as well. They also knew, but chose \n     not to mention, that Jack L. Goldsmith, chief of the Office \n     of Legal Counsel at Justice, had been warning of major legal \n     problems for months.\n       More than three years later, Gonzales would testify that \n     there was ``consensus in the room'' from the lawmakers, ``who \n     said, `Despite the recommendation of the deputy attorney \n     general, go forward with these very important intelligence \n     activities.' '' By this account--disputed by participants \n     from both parties--four Democrats and four Republicans \n     counseled Cheney to press on with a program that Justice \n     called illegal.\n       In fact, Cheney asked the lawmakers a question that came \n     close to answering itself. Could the House and Senate amend \n     surveillance laws without raising suspicions that a new \n     program had been launched? The obvious reply became a new \n     rationale for keeping Congress out.\n       The Bush administration had no interest in changing the \n     law, according to U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth, \n     chief of the federal government's special surveillance court \n     when the warrantless eavesdropping began.\n       ``We could have gone to Congress, hat in hand, the judicial \n     branch and the executive together, and gotten any statutory \n     change we wanted in those days, I felt like,'' he said in an \n     interview. ``But they wanted to demonstrate that the \n     president's power was supreme.''\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Late that Wednesday afternoon, Bush returned from \n     Cleveland. In early evening, the phone rang at the makeshift \n     FBI command center at George Washington University Medical \n     Center, where Ashcroft remained in intensive care. According \n     to two officials who saw the FBI logs, the president was on \n     the line. Bush told the ailing Cabinet chief to expect a \n     visit from Gonzales and White House Chief of Staff Andrew H. \n     Card Jr.\n       A Senate hearing in 2007 described some of what happened \n     next. But much of the story remained untold.\n       Alerted by Ashcroft's chief of staff, Comey, Goldsmith and \n     FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III raced toward the hospital, \n     abandoning double-parked vehicles and running up a stairwell \n     as fast as their legs could pump.\n       Comey reached Ashcroft's bedside first. Goldsmith and his \n     colleague Patrick F. Philbin were close behind. Now came Card \n     and Gonzales, holding an envelope. If Comey would not sign \n     the papers, maybe Ashcroft would.\n       The showdown with the vice president the day before had \n     been excruciating, the pressure ``so great it could crush you \n     like a grape,'' Comey said. This was worse.\n       Was Comey going to sit there and watch a barely conscious \n     man make his mark? On an order that he believed, and knew \n     Ashcroft believed, to be unlawful?\n       Unexpectedly, Ashcroft roused himself. Previous accounts \n     have said he backed his deputy. He did far more than that. \n     Ashcroft told the president's men he never should have \n     certified the program in the first place.\n       ``You drew the circle so tight I couldn't get the advice \n     that I needed,'' Ashcroft said, according to Comey. He knew \n     things now, the attorney general said, that he should have \n     been told before. Spent, he sank back in his bed.\n       Mueller arrived just after Card and Gonzales departed. He \n     shared a private moment with Ashcroft, bending over to hear \n     the man's voice.\n       ``Bob, I'm struggling,'' Ashcroft said.\n       ``In every man's life there comes a time when the good Lord \n     tests him,'' Mueller replied. ``You have passed your test \n     tonight.''\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Goldsmith was out the door. He telephoned Ed Whelan, his \n     deputy, who was at home bathing his children.\n       ``You've got to get into the office now,'' Goldsmith said. \n     ``Please draft a resignation letter for me. I can't tell you \n     why.''\n       All hell was breaking loose at Justice. Lawyers streamed \n     back from the suburbs, converging on the fourth-floor \n     conference room. Most of them were not cleared to hear the \n     details, but a decision began to coalesce: If Comey quit, \n     none of them were staying.\n       At the FBI, they called Mueller ``Bobby Three Sticks,'' \n     playfully tweaking the Roman numerals in his fancy \n     Philadelphia name. Late that evening, word began to spread. \n     It wasn't only Comey. Bobby Three Sticks was getting ready to \n     turn in his badge.\n       Justice had filled its top ranks with political loyalists. \n     They hoped to see Bush reelected. Had anyone explained to the \n     president what was at stake?\n       Whelan pulled out his BlackBerry. He fired off a message to \n     White House staff secretary Brett Kavanaugh, a friend whose \n     position gave him direct access to Bush.\n       ``I knew zilch about what the matter was, but I did know \n     that lots of senior DOJ folks were on the verge of \n     resigning,'' Whelan said in an e-mail, declining to discuss \n     the subject further. ``I thought it important to make sure \n     that the president was aware of that situation so that he \n     could factor it in as he saw fit.''\n       Kavanaugh had no more idea than Whelan, but he passed word \n     to Card.\n       The timing was opportune. Just about then, around 11 p.m., \n     Comey responded to an angry summons from the president's \n     chief of staff. Whatever Card was planning to say, he had \n     calmed down suddenly.\n       What was all this he heard, Card asked, about quitting?\n       ``I don't think people should try to get their way by \n     threatening resignations,'' Comey replied. ``If they find \n     themselves in a position where they're not comfortable \n     continuing, then they should resign.''\n       ``He obviously got the gist of what I was saying,'' Comey \n     recalled.\n       It was close to midnight when Comey got home, long past the \n     president's bedtime. Bush had yet to learn that his \n     government was coming apart.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Trouble was spreading. The FBI's general counsel, Valerie \n     E. Caproni, and her CIA counterpart, Scott W. Mueller, told \n     colleagues they would leave if the president reauthorized the \n     program over Justice Department objections.\n       Assistant Attorney General Christopher A. Wray, who ran \n     Justice's criminal division, stopped Comey in a hallway.\n       ``Look, I don't know what's going on, but before you guys \n     all pull the rip cords, please give me a heads-up so I can \n     jump with you,'' he said.\n       James A. Baker, the counselor for intelligence, thought \n     hard about jumping, too. Early on, he got wind of the \n     warrantless eavesdropping and forced the White House to \n     disclose it to Lamberth. Later, Baker told Lamberth's \n     successor that he could not vouch that the Bush \n     administration was honoring its promise to keep the chief \n     surveillance judge fully informed.\n       ``I was determined to stay there and fight for what I \n     thought was right,'' Baker said in an interview, declining to \n     say what the fight was about, on or off the record. He had \n     obligations, he said, to the lawyers who worked for him in \n     the Office of Intelligence Policy and Review. ``If it had \n     come to this, if people were willing to go to the mat and \n     tolerate the attorney general and deputy attorney general \n     resigning, that's pretty serious. God knows what else they \n     would have come up with.''\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       At the White House on Thursday morning, the president moved \n     in a bubble so tight that hardly any air was getting in. It \n     was March 11, decision day. If Bush reauthorized the program, \n     he would have no signature from the attorney general. By now \n     that was nowhere near the president's biggest problem.\n       Many of the people Bush trusted most were out of the \n     picture. Karl Rove was not cleared for the program. Neither \n     was Dan Bartlett or Karen Hughes.\n       National security adviser Condoleezza Rice had the \n     clearance, but Cheney did not invite her to the meetings that \n     mattered.\n       Bush gave a speech to evangelicals that morning and left \n     the White House for an after-lunch fundraiser in New York. In \n     whatever time he took to weigh his options, the\n\n[[Page S8913]]\n\n     president had only Cheney, Card and Gonzales to advise him.\n       The vice president knew exactly where he stood, unswerving \n     in his commitment to keep the program just as it was. \n     Gonzales later told two confidants that he had broken with \n     David S. Addington, Cheney's lawyer, urging Bush to find \n     common ground with Justice. Card, too, told colleagues that \n     he had urged restraint.\n       ``My job was to communicate with the president about the \n     peripheral vision, not just the tunnel vision of the \n     moment,'' he said, deflecting questions about the details.\n       Did peripheral vision mean a broader view of the \n     consequences?\n       ``Yes,'' Card replied. ``It was like--I don't want to limit \n     it to this particular matter, but that's part of a chief of \n     staff's job. A lot of people who work in the White House have \n     tunnel vision, and not an awful lot of people have peripheral \n     vision. And I think the chief of staff is one of the people \n     who should have peripheral vision.''\n       Card didn't really need the corner of his eye to see a \n     disaster at hand. Even so, Bush didn't know what his \n     subordinates knew that Thursday morning.\n       Cheney, Addington, Card and Gonzales had plenty of data. \n     Card had heard the news directly from Comey the night before. \n     On Thursday, the FBI director delivered much the same \n     warning.\n       For Cheney, it didn't matter much whether one official or \n     10 or 20 took a walk. Maybe they were bluffing, maybe not. \n     The principle was the same: Do what has to be done.\n       ``The president of the United States is the chief law \n     enforcement officer--that was the Cheney view,'' said \n     Bartlett, Bush's counselor, who was later briefed into the \n     program and the events of the day. ``You can't let \n     resignations deter you if you're doing what's right.''\n       Cheney and Addington ``were ready to go to the mat,'' he \n     said, and the vice president's position boiled down to this: \n     `` `That's why we're leaders, that's why we're here. Take the \n     political hit. You've got to do it.' ''\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Addington opened the code-word-classified file on his \n     computer. He had a presidential directive to rewrite.\n       It has been widely reported that Bush executed the March 11 \n     order with a blank space over the attorney general's \n     signature line. That is not correct. For reasons both \n     symbolic and practical, the vice president's lawyer could not \n     tolerate an empty spot where a mutinous subordinate should \n     have signed. Addington typed a substitute signature line: \n     ``Alberto R. Gonzales.''\n       What Addington wrote for Bush that day was more \n     transcendent than that. He drew up new language in which the \n     president relied on his own authority to certify the program \n     as lawful. Bush expressly overrode the Justice Department and \n     any act of Congress or judicial decision that purported to \n     constrain his power as commander in chief. Only Richard M. \n     Nixon, in an interview after leaving the White House in \n     disgrace, claimed authority so nearly unlimited.\n       The specter of future prosecutions hung over the program, \n     now that Justice had ruled it illegal.\n       ``Pardon was in the air,'' said one of the lawyers \n     involved.\n       It was possible to construct a case, he said, in which \n     those who planned and carried out the program were engaged in \n     a criminal conspiracy. That would be tendentious, this lawyer \n     believed, but with a change of government it could not be \n     ruled out.\n       ``I'm sure when we leave office we're all going to be \n     hauled up before congressional committees and grand juries,'' \n     Addington told one colleague in disgust.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Bush signed the directive before leaving for New York \n     around lunchtime on Thursday, March 11, 2004.\n       Comey got word a couple of hours later. He sat down and \n     typed a letter.\n       ``Over the last two weeks . . . I and the Department of \n     Justice have been asked to be part of something that is \n     fundamentally wrong,'' he wrote. ``As we have struggled over \n     these last days to do the right thing, I have never been \n     prouder of the Department of Justice or of the Attorney \n     General. Sadly, although I believe this has been one of the \n     institution's finest hours, we have been unable to right that \n     wrong. . . . Therefore, with a heavy heart and undiminished \n     love of my country and my Department, I resign as Deputy \n     Attorney General of the United States, effective \n     immediately.''\n       David Ayres, Ashcroft's chief of staff, pleaded with Comey \n     to wait a few days. He was certain that Ashcroft would want \n     to quit alongside him. Comey agreed to hold his letter \n     through the weekend.\n       Bush was not a man to second-guess himself. By Friday \n     morning, he would need new facts to save him. Somebody, \n     finally, would have to tell him something.\n       It was Rice, largely in the dark herself, who threw the \n     president a lifeline. She had a few minutes alone with him, \n     shortly before 7:30 a.m., on the day after he renewed the \n     surveillance order. She told Bush about Comey's agitated \n     approach, the day before, to Frances Fragos Townsend, the \n     deputy national security adviser for combating terrorism. \n     This was no way to keep a secret.\n       ``It was a compartmented issue,'' Rice recalled in an \n     interview. ``Obviously, there was a security issue here and \n     not just a legal one, because you didn't want this sort of \n     bumping around.''\n       Rice made a suggestion.\n       Comey is ``a reasonable guy,'' she told the president. \n     ``You really need to make sure that you are hearing these \n     folks out.''\n       An hour later, Comey and Robert Mueller arrived at the \n     White House for the regular 8:30 terrorism briefing. They had \n     a lot to cover: Bombs aboard commuter trains in Madrid had \n     killed 191 people.\n       Both men told aides that this would be their last day in \n     government. There would be no door-slamming, but the \n     president had made his choice and they had made theirs.\n       Bush stood as the meeting ended, crossing behind Cheney's \n     chair. Comey moved in the opposite direction, on his way out. \n     He had nearly reached the grandfather clock at the door, two \n     witnesses said, when the president said, ``Jim, can I talk to \n     you for a minute?''\n       Bush nodded toward the private dining room a few steps from \n     his desk, the one he shared with Cheney once a week. This \n     time the vice president was not invited.\n       ``I'll wait for you downstairs,'' Mueller told Comey.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       By now, around 9:15 Friday morning, Bush knew enough to be \n     nervous about what the acting attorney general might do. That \n     did not mean he planned to reverse himself. One high-ranking \n     adviser said there was still an ``optimism that maybe you can \n     finesse your way through this.''\n       Afterward, in conversations with aides, the two men \n     described the meeting in similar terms.\n       ``You don't look well,'' Bush began.\n       Oldest trick in the book. Establish dominance, put the \n     other guy off his game.\n       ``Well, I feel okay.''\n       ``I'm worried about you. You look burdened.''\n       ``I am, Mr. President. I feel like there's a tremendous \n     burden on me.''\n       ``Let me lift that burden from your shoulders,'' Bush said. \n     ``Let me be the one who makes the decision here.''\n       ``Mr. President, I would love to be able to do that.''\n       Bush's tone grew crisp.\n       ``I decide what the law is for the executive branch,'' he \n     said.\n       ``That's absolutely true, sir, you do. But I decide what \n     the Department of Justice can certify to and can't certify \n     to, and despite my absolute best efforts, I simply cannot in \n     the circumstances.''\n       Comey had majored in religion, William and Mary Class of \n     1982. He might have made a connection with Bush if he had \n     quoted a verse from Scripture. The line that came to him \n     belonged to a 16th-century theologian who defied an emperor.\n       ``As Martin Luther said, `Here I stand; I can do no other,' \n     '' Comey said. ``I've got to tell you, Mr. President, that's \n     where I am.''\n       Now Bush said something that floored Comey.\n       ``I just wish that you weren't raising this at the last \n     minute.''\n       The last minute! He didn't know.\n       The president kept talking. Not the way it's supposed to \n     work, popping up with news like this. The day before a \n     deadline?\n       Wednesday. He didn't know until Wednesday. No wonder he \n     sent Card and Gonzales to the hospital.\n       ``Oh, Mr. President, if you've been told that, you have \n     been very poorly served by your advisers,'' Comey said. ``We \n     have been telling them for months we have a huge problem \n     here.''\n       ``Give me six weeks,'' Bush asked. One more renewal.\n       ``I can't do that,'' Comey said. ``You do say what the law \n     is in the executive branch, I believe that. And people's job, \n     if they're going to stay in the executive branch, is to \n     follow that. But I can't agree, and I'm just sorry.''\n       If they're going to stay.\n       Comey was edging toward a breach of his rule against \n     resignation threats.\n       This man just needs to know what's about to happen.\n       ``I think you should know that Director Mueller is going to \n     resign today,'' Comey said.\n       Bush raised his eyebrows. He shifted in his chair. He could \n     not hide it, or did not try. He was gobsmacked.\n       ``Thank you very much for telling me that,'' he said.\n       Comey hurried down to Mueller, who sat in the foyer outside \n     the Situation Room. A Secret Service agent followed close \n     behind. The president would like to see you, the agent told \n     Mueller.\n       Comey pulled out his BlackBerry and sent a note to six \n     colleagues at 9:27 a.m.\n       ``The president just took me into his private office for a \n     15 minute one on one talk,'' he wrote. ``Told him he was \n     being misled and poorly served. We had a very full and frank \n     exchange. Don't know that either of us can see a way out. . . \n     . Told him Mueller was about to resign. He just pulled Bob \n     into his office.''\n       The FBI director was no more tractable than Comey. This was \n     a rule-of-law question, he told the president, and the answer \n     was in the Justice Department. The FBI could not participate \n     in operations that Justice held to be in breach of criminal \n     law. If those were his orders, he would respectfully take his \n     leave.\n       And there it was, unfinessable. Bush was out of running \n     room, all the way out. He had only just figured out that the \n     brink was near, and now he stood upon it.\n       Not 24 hours earlier, the president had signed his name to \n     an in-your-face rejection of the attorney general's ruling on \n     the law. Now he had two bad choices. March on, with all the \n     consequences. Or retreat.\n       The president stepped back from the precipice. He gave \n     Mueller a message for Comey.\n\n[[Page S8914]]\n\n       ``Tell Jim to do what Justice thinks needs to be done,'' he \n     said.\n       Seven days later, Bush amended his March 11 directive. The \n     legal certification belonged again to the attorney general. \n     The surveillance program stopped doing some things, and it \n     did other things differently. Much of the operation remained \n     in place. Not all of it.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Because Bush did not walk off the cliff, and because so \n     much of the story was suppressed, an extraordinary moment in \n     presidential history passed unrecognized.\n       ``I mean, it would be damn near unprecedented for the top \n     echelon of your Justice Department to resign over a position \n     you've taken,'' Bartlett said.\n       There might be one precedent, he allowed. He did not want \n     to spell it out.\n       ``Not a good one,'' he said.\n       During the Watergate scandal, the attorney general and \n     deputy attorney general resigned, refusing to carry out \n     Richard Nixon's order to fire the special prosecutor. Nixon \n     lost his top two Justice officials, and that was called the \n     Saturday Night Massacre.\n       Bush had come within minutes of losing his FBI director and \n     at least the top five layers at Justice. What would they call \n     that? Suicide, maybe?\n       ``You don't have to be the smartest guy to figure out that \n     [mass resignations] would be pretty much the most devastating \n     thing that could happen to your administration,'' said Mark \n     Corallo, Ashcroft's communications director and, during \n     Bush's first race for the White House, chief spokesman for \n     the Republican National Committee. ``The rush to hearings on \n     the Hill, both in the House and Senate, would be \n     unbelievable. The media frenzy that would have ensued would \n     have been unlike anything we've ever seen. That's when you're \n     getting into Watergate territory.''\n       Long after departing as chief of staff, Card held fast to \n     the proposition that whatever happened was nobody's business, \n     and no big deal anyway.\n       ``I think you're writing about something that's \n     irrelevant,'' Card said. ``Voyeurism.''\n       Because?\n       ``Nobody resigned over this,'' he said. It all boiled down \n     to trash talk: `` `Oh, I was gonna swing at the pitch but it \n     was too high.' ''\n       That seems unlikely to stand as history's verdict. In the \n     fourth year of his presidency, a man who claimed the final \n     word was forced by subordinates to comply with their ruling \n     on the law. Ashcroft, Comey, Goldsmith, Philbin--believers, \n     one and all, in the ``unitary executive branch''--obliged the \n     commander in chief to stand down. For the first time, a \n     president claimed in writing that he alone could say what the \n     law was. A rebellion, in direct response, became so potent a \n     threat that Bush reversed himself in a day.\n       ``This is the first time when the president of the United \n     States really wanted something in wartime, and tried to \n     overrule the Department of Justice, and the law held,'' said \n     Goldsmith, after studying similar conflicts under Abraham \n     Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n       In the aftermath, the White House senior staff asked \n     questions. Was the president getting timely information and \n     advice? Had he relinquished too much control to Cheney?\n       Bush, aides said, learned something he would not forget. \n     Cheney was the nearest thing to an anti-politician in elected \n     office. Bush could not afford to be like that. In his second \n     term, his second chance, the president would take greater \n     care to consult his own instincts.\n       ``Cheney was not afraid of giving pure, kind of principled \n     advice,'' Bartlett said. ``He thinks from a policy \n     standpoint, and I think he does this out of pure intentions. \n     He thinks of the national security interest or the \n     prerogatives of the executive. The president has other \n     considerations he has to take into account. The political \n     fallout of certain reactions--he's just going to calculate \n     different than Cheney does.''\n       ``He grew accustomed to that,'' Bartlett said.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I thank all Senators.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words in thanking \nSenator Byrd, not only for his years of illustrious service to the \nAmerican people but for reminding us about the importance of the \nConstitution. It is incredible that year after year he has come up \nhere--and perhaps more than any other Member of the Congress--to \ninstruct the American people about that great document and to urge \npeople--children, old people, people from all over this country--to \nonce again study what the Constitution is about.\n  I would hope, as a result of Senator Byrd's efforts, classrooms all \nover this country--our young people--will understand the importance of \nthe Constitution.\n  So I say to Senator Byrd, thank you so much for your service in that \nregard.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as we observe Constitution Day today, we \ndo not have to look very far to be reminded why it is important for us \nto reflect on the 221st birthday of the Constitution, which was signed \nby the Framers in Philadelphia on this date in 1787. I think the reason \nwhy it is so important to take a hard look at the Constitution today is \nbecause of what has happened over the last 8 years, because in many \nrespects we have had a President who did not do as Senator Byrd urged \nus to do: Study the Constitution.\n  We all know that international terrorism is a very serious issue. We \ntake it terribly seriously, and all of us are pledged to do everything \nwe can to protect the American people from international terrorism. \nHowever, many of us believe we can do it within the context of the \nUnited States Constitution and the separation of powers----\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Brought forth in that Constitution.\n  Unfortunately, over the last 8 years under the Bush administration, \nwe have seen a tragic effort on the part of the executive branch to \nimpose on the people of this country a vision of government where, \ninstead of three coequal branches of government as laid out by our \nConstitution--the executive, the legislative, and the judicial \nbranches--we have moved toward one dominant branch, that of the \nexecutive ruling under the theory of the unitary executive.\n  Mr. BYRD. King.\n  Mr. SANDERS. In my view, that is not what the Constitution of our \ngreat country is about, nor is it what the Framers wanted it to be. The \ntheory of unitary executive states that since the Constitution \ninherently gives the President the power to do all kinds of things--\nespecially within the military and defense context beyond what is \ndetailed in article II, then the President essentially can make up \nwhatever he wants to justify for this or that action. In other words, \nhe can say: We are threatened by international terrorism and I, as the \nPresident of the United States, can do anything I want to fight \ninternational terrorism. I don't have to worry about separation of \npowers. I don't have to worry about the laws of the land. I don't have \nto worry about the Constitution. I am the President. In my judgment, I \ncan do what I want. I think the Senator from West Virginia would agree \nwith me, that that is not what the Constitution of this country is \nabout.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is right.\n  Mr. SANDERS. And that, unfortunately, we have a President who does \nnot understand that.\n  In the last 8 years, sadly, we have seen a steady erosion of the \nfundamental rights and balance of power laid out in the Constitution \nand in our Bill of Rights. We have seen the President, the Vice \nPresident, and the administration carry out an unprecedented number of \nprograms that insult our constitutional system and erode our standing \naround the world----\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Because our Nation was founded as a nation of laws, not \nof individuals.\n  Mr. BYRD. Right.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Let me list a few of the programs. I will not go on for \ntoo long, but I want the American people to get a glimpse of what has, \nin fact, gone on in the last 8 years under a President who neither \nunderstands the Constitution nor respects the Constitution. Let me \nenumerate some of those provisions:\n  Passage of the original PATRIOT Act and the PATRIOT Act \nReauthorization.\n  Illegal and expanded use of national security letters by the FBI.\n  The NSA's warrantless wiretap program.\n  Using Presidential signing statements to ignore the intent of \nCongress's laws.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SANDERS. We have a President who says: Well, it is an interesting \nlaw. I will pick and choose which of the provisions I want to \nimplement. That is not what the Constitution says. If you don't like \nthe law, veto it.\n\n[[Page S8915]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SANDERS. But you cannot pick and choose. That is clearly not what \nthe Constitution had in mind.\n  Furthermore, we have seen profiling of citizens engaged in \nconstitutionally protected free speech and peaceful assembly. My view \nis, if you are an American, you have a right to protest, you have a \nright to engage in the political process without worrying that somebody \nis spying on you.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SANDERS. We have seen in recent years data mining of personal \nrecords.\n  We have seen, of course, the Abu Ghraib prison scandal.\n  We have seen a broad interpretation of congressional resolutions \nregarding use of military force as justification for unauthorized \nsurveillance and other actions.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SANDERS. We have seen extraordinary renditions of detainees to \ncountries that allow torture.\n  We have seen getting rid of the right of detainees to file habeas \ncorpus petitions.\n  We have seen the condoning of the use of torture.\n  We have seen political firings of U.S. Attorneys.\n  We have seen destruction of CIA tapes.\n  The list goes on and on and on. Those are just some of the insults to \nthe Constitution that we have seen over the last 8 years.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I also wish to take a few moments to \nhighlight one of the more egregious examples of this abuse which was \nrecently chronicled by the Washington Post.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. Please do.\n  Mr. SANDERS. This article describes the unprecedented use of \nexecutive authority which trampled on the rule of law and, in the \nprocess, Americans' basic civil liberties. Specifically, the article \nfocuses on how a small group of people in the White House--the \nPresident, the Vice President, the Vice President's Chief of Staff, and \na few others--decided through their own twisted interpretation of the \nConstitution that with the President's say-so alone, they had the power \nto perform warrantless surveillance on innocent Americans known as the \nNSA warrantless wiretapping program. They created a program almost \ncompletely outside of the authority of our laws based on the principle \nthat because the President of the United States is the Commander in \nChief, and it is his job to protect the country, anything they think of \nthat protects this country--anything that fights terrorism--is \njustified under the Constitution. That, in my view, is dead wrong.\n  Mr. BYRD. Shame.\n  Mr. SANDERS. This view of the Constitution and the balance of power \nin our Government should make all Americans, no matter what political \npersuasion--and I do want to say there are a number of conservatives \nall over this country--and every honest conservative should be appalled \nby the constitutional abuse that has taken place by President Bush. No \nmatter what your point of view is, you should be concerned, but \nespecially for those citizens in our country who consider themselves \nconservatives and wish to limit the role of government.\n  I ask the Senator from West Virginia: How often have we heard \nconservatives talk about a limited role in government and then go out \nand say: Oh, the government can do anything they want; forget the \nConstitution.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, how often?\n  Mr. SANDERS. I think that is absolutely hypocritical.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Even more amazingly, when a few members of the \nDepartment of Justice--the top law enforcement agency of our \nGovernment--including then-Attorney General John Ashcroft, FBI Director \nRobert Mueller, and Acting Attorney General James Comey, who learned of \nthe program and refused to renew the program unless it was redrafted to \nfall within the confines of U.S. surveillance law, the President and \nhis aides attempted to completely bypass these critics and decide that \nthe President, and the President alone, could decide what is lawful or \nunlawful.\n  Mr. BYRD. Oh, my, my.\n  Mr. SANDERS. During a debate about who had the final word on the \nwarrantless wiretapping program, the Washington Post quotes President \nBush as saying: ``I decide what the law is for the executive branch.''\n  Mr. BYRD. Oh, my God.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I concur.\n  The President does not decide the law. It is the people of this \ncountry through the Congress who decide the law, and the President, as \nevery other American citizen, obeys the law.\n  Mr. BYRD. Right.\n  Mr. SANDERS. When we lose that understanding, we lose what our \nConstitution is about, we lose the essence of what the United States of \nAmerica is about. Thankfully, thankfully--let's give credit where \ncredit is due--by threatening their mass resignation, the top leaders \nof the Justice Department forced the President to revise his and the \nVice President's legal justification for this wiretap program, making \nit only a bit less objectionable.\n  While I am opposed to the wiretapping program in its current form due \nto the fact that it does not have an adequate check on the power to \nmonitor the conversations of innocent Americans, I do respect--and I \nhope we all respect--those individuals at the Department of Justice \nwho, during this time in 2003 and 2004, stood up for the basic aspects \nof our legal system.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of \nthe Washington Post articles written by Barton Gellman and published on \nSeptember 14 and 15 of this year be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I am not the only person with these \nconcerns about the balance of power between the branches of Government. \nAn August poll conducted by the Associated Press and the National \nConstitution Center found that:\n\n       Two-thirds of Americans oppose altering the balance of \n     power among the three branches of government to strengthen \n     the presidency, even when they thought that doing so would \n     improve the economy or national security.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Amen.\n  Mr. SANDERS. This is not a partisan issue, no matter what \nadministration, no matter what party. I am quite confident that whether \nit is a Democratic President or a Republican President, Senator Byrd \nwill be there raising exactly the same issues.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Because he understands--and I hope all of us \nunderstand--that the Constitution is far deeper than partisan politics \nor who happens to sit in the White House in this or that year.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SANDERS. The secret creation of the warrantless wiretapping \nprogram outside the confines of law is only one example of a number of \nthe ways the Constitution has been abused over the last 8 years.\n  I conclude by again congratulating Senator Byrd. Because the work he \nis doing here of trying to make sure that people from Maine to \nCalifornia study our Constitution--something that is not happening \nenough in our schools--\n  Mr. BYRD. Right.\n  Mr. SANDERS. People should understand the Constitution and understand \nthat the Constitution has laid out an extraordinary framework from the \nfirst day of this country. It is an extraordinary document, perhaps the \ngreatest document ever written in the Western World.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. SANDERS. We should be enormously proud. What we have to do \nregardless of our political views is we have to stand and defend and \nfight for the integrity of that Constitution.\n  So I thank Senator Byrd so much for what he has done in that regard \nto protect our constitutional rights.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. And I thank Senator Sanders.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 14, 2008]\n\n             Conflict Over Spying Led White House to Brink\n\n                          (By Barton Gellman)\n\n       A burst of ferocity stunned the room into silence. No other \n     word for it: The vice president's attorney was shouting.\n\n[[Page S8916]]\n\n       ``The president doesn't want this! You are not going to see \n     the opinions. You are out . . . of . . . your . . . lane!''\n       Five government lawyers had gathered around a small \n     conference table in the Justice Department command center. \n     Four were expected. David S. Addington, counsel to Vice \n     President Cheney, got wind of the meeting and invited \n     himself.\n       If Addington smelled revolt, he was not far wrong. \n     Unwelcome questions about warrantless domestic surveillance \n     had begun to find their voice.\n       Cheney and his counsel would struggle for months to quash \n     the legal insurgency. By the time President Bush became aware \n     of it, his No. 2 had stoked dissent into flat-out rebellion. \n     The president would face a dilemma, and the presidency itself \n     a historic test. Cheney would come close to leading them off \n     a cliff, man and office both.\n       On this second Monday in December 2003, Addington's targets \n     were a pair of would-be auditors from the National Security \n     Agency. He had displeasure to spare for their Justice \n     Department hosts.\n       Perfect example, right here. A couple of NSA bureaucrats \n     breeze in and ask for the most sensitive documents in the \n     building. And Justice wants to tell them, Help yourselves? \n     This was going to be a very short meeting.\n       Joel Brenner and Vito Potenza, the two men wilting under \n     Addington's wrath, had driven 26 miles from Fort Meade, the \n     NSA's eavesdropping headquarters in Maryland. They were \n     conducting a review of their agency's two-year-old special \n     surveillance operation. They already knew the really secret \n     stuff: The NSA and other services had been unleashed to turn \n     their machinery inward, collecting signals intelligence \n     inside the United States. What the two men didn't know was \n     why the Bush administration believed the program was legal.\n       It was an awkward question. Potenza, the NSA's acting \n     general counsel, and Brenner, its inspector general, were \n     supposed to be the ones who kept their agency on the straight \n     and narrow. That's what Cheney and their boss, Lt. Gen. \n     Michael V. Hayden, told doubters among the very few people \n     who knew what was going on. Cheney, who chaired briefings for \n     select members of Congress, said repeatedly that the NSA's \n     top law and ethics officers--career public servants--approved \n     and supervised the surveillance program.\n       That was not exactly true, not without one of those silent \n     asterisks that secretly flip a sentence on its tail. Every 45 \n     days, after Justice Department review, Bush renewed his \n     military order for warrantless eavesdropping. Brenner and \n     Potenza told Hayden that the agency was entitled to rely on \n     those orders. The United States was at war with al-Qaeda, \n     intelligence-gathering is inherent in war, and the \n     Constitution appoints the president commander in chief.\n       But they had not been asked to give their own written \n     assessments of the legality of domestic espionage. They based \n     their answer in part on the attorney general's certification \n     of the ``form and legality'' of the president's orders. Yet \n     neither man had been allowed to see the program's codeword-\n     classified legal analyses, which were prepared by John C. \n     Yoo, Addington's close ally in the Justice Department's \n     Office of Legal Counsel. Now they wanted to read Yoo's \n     opinions for themselves.\n       ``This is none of your business!'' Addington exploded.\n       He was massive in his swivel chair, taut and still, \n     potential energy amping up the menace. Addington's pugnacity \n     was not an act. Nothing mattered more, as the vice president \n     and his lawyer saw the world, than these new surveillance \n     tools. Bush had made a decision. Debate could only blow the \n     secret, slow down vital work, or call the president's \n     constitutional prerogatives into question.\n       The NSA lawyers returned to their car empty-handed.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The command center of ``the president's program,'' as \n     Addington usually called it, was not in the White House. Its \n     controlling documents, which gave strategic direction to the \n     nation's largest spy agency, lived in a vault across an alley \n     from the West Wing--in the Eisenhower Executive Office \n     Building, on the east side of the second floor, where the \n     vice president headquartered his staff.\n       The vault was in EEOB 268, Addington's office. Cheney's \n     lawyer held the documents, physical and electronic, because \n     he was the one who wrote them. New forms of domestic \n     espionage were created and developed over time in \n     presidential authorizations that Addington typed on a \n     Tempest-shielded computer across from his desk.\n       It is unlikely that the history of U.S. intelligence \n     includes another operation conceived and supervised by the \n     office of the vice president. White House Chief of Staff \n     Andrew H. Card Jr. had ``no idea,'' he said, that the \n     presidential orders were held in a vice presidential safe. An \n     authoritative source said the staff secretariat, which kept a \n     comprehensive inventory of presidential papers, classified \n     and unclassified, possessed no record of these.\n       In an interview, Card said the Executive Office of the \n     President, a formal term that encompassed Bush's staff but \n     not Cheney's, followed strict procedures for handling and \n     securing presidential papers.\n       ``If there were exceptions to that, I'm not aware of \n     them,'' he said. ``If these documents weren't stored the \n     right way or put in the right places or maintained by the \n     right people, I'm not aware of it.''\n       Asked why Addington would write presidential directives, \n     Card said, ``David Addington is a very competent lawyer.'' \n     After a moment he added, ``I would consider him a drafter, \n     not the drafter. I'm sure there were a lot of smart people \n     who were involved in helping to look at the language and the \n     law.''\n       Not many, it turned out. Though the president had the \n     formal say over who was ``read in'' to the domestic \n     surveillance program, Addington controlled the list in \n     practice, according to three officials with personal \n     knowledge. White House counsel Alberto R. Gonzales was aware \n     of the program, but was not a careful student of the complex \n     legal questions it raised. In its first 18 months, the only \n     other lawyer who reviewed the program was John Yoo.\n       By the time the NSA auditors came calling, a new man, Jack \n     L. Goldsmith, was chief of the Justice Department's Office of \n     Legal Counsel. Soon after he arrived on Oct. 6, 2003, the \n     vice president's lawyer invited him to EEOB 268. Addington \n     pulled out a folder with classification markings that \n     Goldsmith had never seen.\n       ``David Addington was doing all the legal work. All the \n     important documents were kept in his safe,'' Goldsmith \n     recalled. ``He was the one who first briefed me.''\n       Goldsmith's new assignment gave him final word in the \n     executive branch on what was legal and what was not. \n     Addington had cleared him for the post--``the biggest \n     presence in the room,'' Goldsmith said, during a job \n     interview ostensibly run by Gonzales.\n       Goldsmith did not have the looks of a guy who posed a \n     threat to the Bush administration's alpha lawyer. A mild-\n     mannered law professor from the University of Chicago, he was \n     rumpled and self-conscious, easy to underestimate. On first \n     impression, he gave off a misleading aura of softness. \n     Goldsmith had lettered in football, baseball and soccer at \n     the Pine Crest School in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., spending his \n     formative years with a mob-connected Teamster who married his \n     mother. He was not a bare-knuckled brawler in Addington's \n     mold, but Goldsmith arrived at Justice with no less \n     confidence and strength of will.\n       Addington's behavior with the NSA auditors was ``a wake-up \n     call for me,'' Goldsmith said. Cheney and Addington, he came \n     to believe, were gaming the system, using secrecy and \n     intimidation to prevent potential dissenters from conducting \n     an independent review.\n       ``They were geniuses at this,'' Goldsmith said. ``They \n     could divide up all these problems in the bureaucracy, ask \n     different people to decide things in their lanes, control the \n     facts they gave them, and then put the answers together to \n     get the result they want.''\n       Dec. 9, 2003, the day of the visit from Brenner and \n     Potenza, was the beginning of the end of that strategy. The \n     years of easy victory were winding down for Cheney and his \n     staff.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Goldsmith began a top-to-bottom review of the domestic \n     surveillance program, taking up the work begun by a lawyer \n     named Patrick F. Philbin after John Yoo left the department. \n     Like Yoo and Goldsmith, Philbin had walked the stations of \n     the conservative legal establishment: Federalist Society, a \n     clerkship with U.S. Circuit Judge Laurence H. Silberman, \n     another with Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.\n       The more questions they asked, the less Goldsmith and \n     Philbin liked the answers. Parts of the program fell easily \n     within the constitutional powers of the commander in chief. \n     Others looked dicier.\n       The two lawyers worked at the intersection of three complex \n     systems: telecommunications, spy technology, and the \n     statutory regimes that governed surveillance. After a few \n     weeks, Goldsmith said, he decided the program ``was the \n     biggest legal mess I'd seen in my life.''\n       He asked for permission to read in Attorney General John D. \n     Ashcroft's new deputy, James B. Comey. As always, he found \n     Addington waiting with Gonzales in the White House counsel's \n     corner office, one floor up from the chief of staff. They sat \n     in parallel wing chairs, much as Bush and Cheney did in the \n     Oval Office.\n       ``The attorney general and I think the deputy attorney \n     general should be read in,'' Goldsmith said.\n       Addington replied first.\n       ``Forget it,'' he said.\n       ``The president insists on strict limitations on access to \n     the program,'' Gonzales agreed.\n       Weeks passed. Goldsmith kept asking. Addington kept saying \n     no.\n       ``He always invoked the president, not the vice \n     president,'' Goldsmith said.\n       Comey was not exactly Mr. Popular at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. \n     He had arrived at Justice as a 6-foot-8 golden boy, smooth \n     and polished, with top chops as a federal terrorism \n     prosecutor in Northern Virginia and New York City. Then came \n     Dec. 30, 2003. Comey did something unforgivable: He appointed \n     an independent counsel to investigate the leak of Valerie \n     Plame's identity as a clandestine CIA officer, a move that \n     would bring no end of grief for Cheney.\n       In late January, Goldsmith and Addington cut a deal. Comey \n     would get his read-in. Goldsmith would get off the fence \n     about the program, giving his definitive answer by the March \n     11 deadline.\n\n[[Page S8917]]\n\n       ``You're the head of the Office of Legal Counsel, and if \n     you say we cannot do this thing legally, we'll shut it off,'' \n     Addington told him.\n       Feel free to tell the president that his most important \n     intelligence operation has to stop.\n       Your call, Jack.\n       Goldsmith wanted to fix the thing, not stop it. He and \n     Philbin traveled again and again to Fort Meade, each time \n     delving deeper. They were in and out of Gonzales's office, \n     looking for adjustments in the program that would bring it \n     into compliance with the law. The issues were complex and \n     remain classified. Addington bent on nothing, swatting back \n     every idea. Gonzales listened placidly, sipping Diet Cokes \n     from his little refrigerator, encouraging the antagonists to \n     keep things civil.\n       There would be no easy out, no middle ground. Addington \n     made clear that he did not believe for a moment that Justice \n     would pull the plug.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Mike Hayden and Vito Potenza drove down from NSA \n     headquarters after lunch on Feb. 19, 2004, to give Jim Comey \n     his first briefing on the program. In the Justice \n     Department's vault-like SCIF, a sensitive compartmented \n     information facility, Hayden got Comey's attention fast.\n       ``I'm so glad you're getting read in, because now I won't \n     be alone at the table when John Kerry is elected president,'' \n     the NSA director said.\n       The witness table, Hayden meant. Congressional hearing, \n     investigation of some kind. Nothing good. Kerry had the \n     Democratic nomination just about locked up and was leading \n     Bush in national polls. Hardly anyone in the intelligence \n     field believed the next administration would climb as far out \n     on a legal limb as this one had.\n       ``Hayden was all dog-and-pony, and this is probably what \n     happened to those poor folks in Congress, too,'' Comey told \n     his chief of staff after the briefing. ``You think for a \n     second, `Wow, that's great,' and then if you try actually to \n     explain it back to yourself, you don't get it. You scratch \n     your head afterward and you think, `What the hell did that \n     guy just tell me?' ''\n       The NSA chief insisted on limiting surveillance to e-mails, \n     phone calls and faxes in which one party was overseas, \n     deflecting arguments from Cheney and Addington that he could \n     just as well collect communications inside the United States.\n       That was one reason Hayden hated when reporters referred to \n     ``domestic surveillance.'' He made his point with a folksy \n     analogy: He had taken ``literally hundreds of domestic \n     flights,'' he said, and never ``landed in Waziristan.'' That \n     sounded good. But the surveillance statutes said a warrant \n     was required if either end of the conversation was in U.S. \n     territory. The American side of the program--the domestic \n     surveillance--was its distinguishing feature.\n       By the end of February, Goldsmith and Philbin had reached \n     their conclusion: Parts of the surveillance operation had no \n     support in law. Comey was so disturbed that he drove to \n     Langley one evening to compare notes with Scott W. Muller, \n     the general counsel at the CIA. Muller ``got it \n     immediately,'' agreeing with the Goldsmith-Philbin \n     analysis, Comey said.\n       ``At the end of the day, I concluded something I didn't \n     ever think I would conclude, and that is that Pat Philbin and \n     Jack Goldsmith understood this activity much better than \n     Michael Hayden did,'' he said.\n       On Thursday, March 4, Comey brought the findings to \n     Ashcroft, conferring for an hour one-on-one. Three senior \n     Justice Department officials said in interviews that Ashcroft \n     gave his full backing. He was not going to sign the next \n     presidential order--due in one week, March 11--unless the \n     White House agreed to a list of required changes.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       A few hours later, Ashcroft was reviewing notes for a news \n     conference in Alexandria when his color changed and he sat \n     down heavily. An aide, Mark Corallo, ducked out and returned \n     to find the attorney general laid out on his back. By \n     nightfall, Ashcroft was taken to George Washington University \n     Medical Center in severe pain, suffering acute gallstone \n     pancreatitis. Comey became acting attorney general on Friday.\n       The next day--Saturday, March 6, five days before the March \n     11 deadline--Goldsmith brought the Justice Department verdict \n     to the White House. He told Gonzales and Addington for the \n     first time that Justice would not certify the program.\n       A long silence fell. It lasted three full days.\n       Gonzales phoned Goldsmith at home before sunrise on \n     Tuesday, March 9, with two days left before the program \n     expired. Obviously there was bad chemistry with Addington. \n     Why not come in and talk, he asked, just the two of us?\n       Goldsmith arrived at the White House in morning twilight. \n     Alone in his office, Gonzales begged the OLC chief to \n     reconsider. Gonzales tried to dispute Goldsmith's analysis, \n     but he was in over his head. At least let us have more time, \n     he said. Goldsmith said he couldn't do that.\n       The time had come for the vice president to step in. \n     Proxies were not getting the job done. Cheney was going to \n     have to take hold of this thing himself.\n       Even now, after months of debate, Cheney did not enlist the \n     president. Bush was across the river in Arlington, commending \n     the winners of the Malcolm Baldrige awards for quality \n     improvement in private industry. Campaign season had come \n     already, and the president was doing a lot of that kind of \n     thing. That week he had a fundraiser in Dallas, a ``Bush-\n     Cheney 2004 event'' in Santa Clara, Calif., and a meet-and-\n     greet at a rodeo in Houston.\n       Soon after hearing what had happened between Goldsmith and \n     Gonzales, the vice president asked Andy Card to set up a \n     meeting at noon with Mike Hayden, FBI Director Robert S. \n     Mueller III, and John McLaughlin from the CIA (substituting \n     for his boss, George J. Tenet). Cheney spoke to them in \n     Card's office, the door closed.\n       Four hours later, at 4 p.m., the same cast reconvened. This \n     time the Justice contingent was invited. Comey, Goldsmith and \n     Philbin found the titans of the intelligence establishment \n     lined up, a bunch of grave-faced analysts behind them for \n     added mass. The spy chiefs brought no lawyers. The law was \n     not the point. This meeting, described by officials with \n     access to two sets of contemporaneous notes, was about \n     telling Justice to set its qualms aside.\n       The staging had been arranged for maximum impact. Cheney \n     sat at the head of Card's rectangular table, pivoting left to \n     face the acting attorney general. The two men were close \n     enough to touch. Card sat grimly at Cheney's right, directly \n     across from Comey. There was plenty of eye contact all \n     around.\n       This program, Cheney said, was vital. Turning it off would \n     leave us blind. Hayden, the NSA chief, pitched in: Even if \n     the program had yet to produce blockbuster results, it was \n     the only real hope of discovering sleeper agents before they \n     could act.\n       ``How can you possibly be reversing course on something of \n     this importance after all this time?'' Cheney asked.\n       Comey held his ground. The program had to operate within \n     the law. The Justice Department knew a lot more now than it \n     had before, and Ashcroft and Comey had reached this decision \n     together.\n       ``I will accept for purposes of discussion that it is as \n     valuable as you say it is,'' Comey said. ``That only makes \n     this more painful. It doesn't change the analysis. If I can't \n     find a lawful basis for something, your telling me you \n     really, really need to do it doesn't help me.''\n       ``Others see it differently,'' Cheney said.\n       There was only one of those, really. John Yoo had been out \n     of the picture for nearly a year. It was all Addington.\n       ``The analysis is flawed, in fact facially flawed,'' Comey \n     said. ``No lawyer reading that could reasonably rely on it.''\n       Gonzales said nothing. Addington stood by the window, over \n     Cheney's shoulder. He had heard a bellyful.\n       ``Well, I'm a lawyer and I did,'' Addington said, glaring \n     at Comey.\n       ``No good lawyer,'' Comey said.\n       In for a dime, in for a dollar.\n       Addington started disputing the particulars. Now he was on \n     Jack Goldsmith's turf. From across the room the head of the \n     Office of Legal Counsel jumped in. And right there in front \n     of the big guys, the two of them bickered in the snarly tones \n     of a couple who knew all of each other's lines.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       As the sun went down on Tuesday, March 9, the president of \n     the United States had yet to learn that his Justice \n     Department was heading off the rails. A train wreck was \n     coming, but Cheney wanted to handle it. Neither Card nor \n     Gonzales was in the habit of telling him no.\n       ``I don't think it would be appropriate for the president \n     to be engaged in the to-and-fro until it is, you know, \n     penultimate,'' Card said in a recent interview. ``I guess the \n     definition of `penultimate' could vary from four steps to \n     three steps to two steps to one step. That's why you have \n     White House counsel and people who do the legal work.''\n       Participants in the afternoon meeting, including some of \n     Cheney's recruits, left the room shaken. Mueller worked for \n     the attorney general, and the FBI's central mission was to \n     ``uphold and enforce the criminal laws of the United \n     States.'' Hayden's neck, and his agency, were on the line. \n     The NSA director believed in the program, believed he was \n     doing the right thing. But keep on going when the Justice \n     Department said no?\n       Early the next morning--Wednesday, March 10, with 24 hours \n     to deadline--Hayden was back in the White House. One \n     colleague saw him conferring in worried whispers with \n     Homeland Security adviser John A. Gordon, a mentor and fellow \n     Air Force general, much the senior of the two. They huddled \n     in the West Wing lobby, Hayden on a love seat and Gordon in a \n     chair.\n       Jim Comey was in the White House that morning, too, \n     arriving early for the president's regular 8:30 terrorism \n     brief. He had heard nothing since the discouraging meeting \n     the day before.\n       Comey found Frances Fragos Townsend, an old friend, waiting \n     just outside the Oval Office, standing by the appointment \n     secretary's desk. She was Bush's deputy national security \n     adviser for combating terrorism. Comey had known her since \n     their days as New York mob prosecutors in the 1980s. Since \n     then, Townsend had run the Justice Department's intelligence \n     office. She lived and breathed surveillance law.\n       Comey took a chance. He pulled her back out to the hallway \n     between the Roosevelt Room and the Cabinet Room.\n       ``If I say a word, would you tell me whether you recognize \n     it?'' he asked quietly.\n\n[[Page S8918]]\n\n       He did. She didn't. The program's classified code name left \n     her blank. Comey tried to talk around the subject.\n       ``I think this is something I am not a part of,'' Townsend \n     said. ``I can't have this conversation.'' Like John Gordon \n     and deputy national security adviser Steven J. Hadley and \n     Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge, she was out of the \n     loop.\n       Oh, God, Comey remembers thinking. They've held this so \n     tight. Even Fran Townsend. The president's counterterrorism \n     adviser is not read in? Comey towered over his diminutive \n     friend. He chose his words carefully.\n       ``I need to know,'' he said, ``whether your boss recognizes \n     that word, and whether she's read in on a particular program. \n     Because we had a meeting here yesterday on that topic that I \n     would have expected her to be at.''\n       He meant national security adviser Condoleezza Rice. Comey \n     was hoping for an ally, or maybe rescue.\n       ``I felt very alone, with some justification,'' Comey \n     recalled. ``The attorney general is in intensive care. \n     There's a train coming down the tracks that's about to run me \n     and my career and the Department of Justice over. I was \n     exploring every way to get off the tracks I could.''\n       Townsend had a pretty good guess about what was on Comey's \n     mind. Cheney had kept her out of the loop, but it was hard to \n     hide a warrantless domestic surveillance program completely \n     from the president's chief terrorism adviser.\n       ``I'm not the right person to talk to,'' she told her \n     friend, her voice close to a whisper. Comey ought to go see \n     Rice.\n       ``I'm going to tell her you've got concerns,'' Townsend \n     said.\n       Comey's concerns no longer interested Cheney. The vice \n     president had tried to back him down. That didn't work.\n       Only one day remained before the surveillance program \n     expired. Time for Cheney to take the fight somewhere else.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today we celebrate the 221st anniversary of \nthe signing of the Constitution of the United States, the longest-\nliving written constitution in history and the very foundation of our \ndemocracy. I thank Senator Byrd for his tireless commitment to the \nConstitution and to ensuring its recognition every year on Constitution \nDay, which he established in 2004.\n  Our Constitution serves as a testament to the brilliance of the \nFounding Fathers, who sought to create a document that would ensure \nthat political power was derived from the people and that their rights \nwould never be infringed upon. The Framers worked diligently over the \nsummer of 1787 to forge a document that has persisted for more than two \ncenturies. The Framers rightly understood that it would take hard work \nand compromise to establish a solid foundation for a new government \nthat aspired to protect the liberty of all its people. A remarkably \nbrief document, containing only seven articles, the Constitution limits \nthe power of the government, maximizes the freedom of the people, and \nprovides for the common good.\n  Although my home State of Rhode Island did not send delegates to the \nConstitutional Convention in 1787, the effects of this small State on \nthe formation of the Constitution are still felt today.\n  Roger Williams, whose statue stands just outside this Chamber, \nfounded what would become the State of Rhode Island in 1636 after he \nwas exiled from the Massachusetts Bay Colony. A theologian, he founded \nProvidence Plantation on the principles of separation of church and \nstate and religious freedom.\n  One hundred fifty-one years later, the Framers enshrined these same \nprinciples in the Bill of Rights. Williams and the Framers recognized \nthat religious freedom is a natural right that had to be afforded to \nall people. Indeed, this freedom is one of the defining freedoms of our \ndemocracy.\n  I would again like to thank Senator Byrd for his dedication to \nhonoring our Constitution and the achievements of our Founding Fathers. \nHis devotion to this document enriches our understanding of its \nimportance and reminds us of its essential role in our democracy. He \nhas taken up the call to protect and defend the Constitution by \nensuring that its central place in American history is not forgotten. I \njoin him in asking all Americans to honor our great national charter \ntoday and every day.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today we celebrate Constitution \nDay, the 221st birthday of the founding document of our country. Now, \nmore than ever, it is time to reaffirm our commitment to defending the \nliberties guaranteed by the Constitution, and to recognize that \nstrengthening civic education is an important part of this commitment. \n``Democracy must be reborn in every generation, and education is its \nmidwife,'' wrote John Dewey. In fact, civic education was the original \nmission of American public education.\n  Sadly, students today know too little about the civil liberties \nestablished in the Constitution that define our American way of life. \nOn the most recent national civics assessment in 2006, only 20 percent \nof eighth grade students scored at or above the proficient level. Less \nthan one-third could identify the purpose of the Constitution. Less \nthan a fifth of high school seniors could explain how citizen \nparticipation strengthens democracy. Gaps in understanding like these \ntranslate later in life to reduced voter turnout, decreased civic \nengagement and community service, and a weaker sense of national \nidentity.\n  As a result of legislation enacted in 2005, more students across the \ncountry are receiving instruction on the Constitution, civics, and \nAmerican history in their schools today. To become responsible \ncitizens, students need to know that the Constitution is not about the \n39 men who signed it. It is a vital document that shapes events today \nand in the future. Instilling an understanding of the American ideals \nof liberty, justice, equality, and civic responsibility should be a \ncentral task in every school, every day.\n  It should encourage the type of civic-mindedness displayed by the \nactions of community-based organizations and private citizens who \nrushed to aid victims of Hurricane Katrina and the September 11 \nterrorist attacks. The long-term health of our democracy and America's \nstanding in the world depend on our own understanding of our past.\n  In the reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind Act next year, we \ncan strengthen our commitment to history and civics education, and \nencourage them to be integrated into all subject areas, extracurricular \nactivities, and service-based learning.\n  Our Nation's Founders understood that education was critical to the \nstrength of our democracy. As James Madison said to Thomas Jefferson \nafter the Constitution was written, ``Educate and inform the whole mass \nof the people . . .

Madam President, it is easy for us to fall into the \ntrap and the habit of believing the United States and our friends \naround the world are immune from the aggressive actions of hostile \nnations. Since the Cold War has ended, I think we have come to think \nthat conflicts between industrialized nations are an historic relic. I \nbelieve one writer who has since admitted he was in error wrote a book \ncalled ``The End of History.'' But we are not beyond history. We are \nnot immune from the threats that have apparently always been out there \nin the world. And I wish it were not so, but I am afraid it is. I \nbelieve the world clearly remains a dangerous and unpredictable place. \nSignificant and serious threats exist. North Korea and Iran, for \nexample, seek nuclear capabilities despite all kinds of efforts by the \nrest of the world to convince them to the contrary. They continue to \ninvest heavily in the development of long-range missiles that could \ncause us great harm. Russia's recent actions in Georgia remind us that \ncountry, which we once hoped was on a path to greater integration into \nthe global world community, might again be seeking to restore old \nSoviet ideas of dominance throughout their neighbors and in Eastern \nEurope, all of which should serve as a motivation to move ahead with \nthe necessary capabilities to defend ourselves and our allies from \nmissile attack, in particular. If a government, by way of the skills, \nknowledge, and technical achievements of its citizens, has the ability \nto protect itself from a known threat, does it not have a moral \nobligation to do so?\n  I remember once former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger saying:\n\n       I never heard of a nation whose policy it is to keep itself \n     vulnerable to attack.\n\n  Why would we want to allow ourselves to remain vulnerable to a \npotential missile attack from North Korea or Iran? Well, we do not. We \nhave been working for some time now to develop a defense system to \nblock any such missile attack. Although it is highly technical and \ncomplex, we have made tremendous progress, and we now know we have a \nsystem that fundamentally works and we are continuing to advance it \nevery year.\n  We cannot do this alone, however. We have our friends in Europe. We \nasked them for assistance in developing a third site there. In fact, \nperhaps one of the threats we face would be from a missile launch from \nIran. The Iranians are continually working on advanced missiles. I \nbelieve they are also openly moving forward to develop nuclear \ncapabilities. If they were to launch such an attack against the United \nStates, it would pass over Europe. So Europe would be an important site \nfor us in protecting the United States.\n  Indeed, the importance of recent decisions, therefore, taken by the \nGovernments of Poland and the Czech Republic to base missile defense \nassets on their territory to protect our NATO allies and the United \nStates against long-range ballistic missile threats is very important. \nThe United States has been negotiating with the Czech Republic and \nPoland since early 2007 to base a missile-tracking radar and 10 long-\nrange interceptors--just 10, but importantly 10--in those countries. I \nam pleased to note that those agreements were signed between the United \nStates and the Government of the Czech Republic on July 8 of this year \nand with the Government of Poland on August 20 of this year. \nRatification of these agreements by the allied parliaments in those \ncounties is expected this fall. These deployments are intended to \nprovide protection for the United States and most of Europe against \nlong-range ballistic missiles such as those that might be launched by \nIran.\n  The strategic objective of extending missile defense protection to \nour allies is to enhance the ability of the alliance to more \neffectively deter aggression and counter the growing threat posed by \nIran. These deployments would send a strong message to our allies and \nadversaries alike that the NATO alliance will not be intimidated or \nblackmailed by any missile threat.\n  You have leaders of Europe, NATO, and the United States, and if some \ncountry threatens that they will launch a missile, and we have only 1 \nor 2--OK, maybe 10--but if we have the ability to knock those down, \nthat alters the strategic threat capability significantly and allows \nthe President of the United States or any European nation to say: We \nare prepared to defeat your missile attack. We will not be blackmailed. \nWe will not alter our policies that we believe are in our national \ninterests as a result of such threats.\n  So the planned deployments in Poland and the Czech Republic are \nsupported by the NATO alliance. Some of our Members have wanted that. \nThey have said that they would feel better about going forward if the \nalliance itself spoke on this, and so we have obtained that now. The \nsystem to be deployed will be fully integrated into NATO's ongoing \nplans to provide defense against shorter range ballistic missile \nthreats.\n  The April 3, 2008, NATO Bucharest Summit Declaration notes:\n\n       Ballistic missile proliferation poses an increasing threat \n     to allies' forces, territories and populations.\n\n  They went on to say:\n\n       We therefore recognize the substantial contribution to the \n     protection of allies from long-range ballistic missile to be \n     provided by the planned deployment of European-based U.S. \n     missile defense assets.\n\n  In May, the Senate Armed Services Committee, of which I am a member \nand its bill is on the floor today, reported out of the committee, I am \nproud to say, a bill which authorizes fully the administration's $712 \nmillion request for the Polish and Czech missile defense sites. I am \nproud that our committee did that. It was the right thing. It is \nimportant now that the appropriators recognize the critical importance \nof following through with adequate funding for these sites. Events of \nthe past month reinforce the decision by the Armed Services Committee \nto recommend full funding. Not only does Iran persist in defying \ninternational calls to end its nuclear program, Iran continues to test \nspace launch vehicles and ballistic missiles of increasing range, while \nalso conducting military exercises in the gulf with operational \nballistic missiles.\n  We should not take lightly the courageous action taken by the \nGovernments of the Czech Republic and Poland to agree to establish a \nmissile defense site on their territory, for by supporting the defense \nof NATO in this manner, and the defense of the United States, these \ncountries have earned the ire of their big neighbor on the east, \nRussia.\n  In an effort to exert pressure on our allies to not do this, in \nFebruary of 2008 Prime Minister Putin of Russia stated that:\n\n       If it is deployed, we will have to react appropriately. In \n     that case, we will probably be forced to target some of our \n     missiles at the objects threatening us.\n\n  Let's take a moment to analyze that language. What threat is it to \nRussia, let me ask, that an independent, sovereign nation would agree \nto have a defensive missile system deployed on their territory--not a \nhostile missile system, not a nuclear weapon missile system, a missile \nsystem designed to protect their own country and other countries from a \npotential threat? What possible threat is that to Russia? Zero. Of \ncourse, we know Russia has hundreds and hundreds of nuclear-armed \nmissiles. The 10 silos and missiles we would propose to place in Poland \nwould have no ability whatsoever to resist a massive Russian attack, \nGod forbid they would ever launch.\n  So I would suggest something more is at stake here, and I think it is \nsomething that the Poles and the Czechs and the Georgians and the \nUkrainians and the Estonians and the Latvians and the Lithuanians \nunderstand full well, and that is that Putin desires to reestablish \nhegemony over the former Soviet satellites. They think they have a \nright to tell Poland whether to undertake a military partnership with \nthe United States. They have no right whatsoever to do so. Poland is \nglad to be rid of them. They are glad to be out from under the Soviet \nboot. They have no intention whatsoever of allowing themselves to fall \nback under their dominance. They have values that are close to our \nvalues. They want to be part of our heritage and the Western heritage.\n  Just days after the Czech Republic signed the radar basing agreement \nwith the United States, Russia reduced its oil shipments to the Czech \nRepublic without providing any explanation.\n\n[[Page S8920]]\n\nBoom. The oil shipments have since been restored, but threats continue.\n  Despite increasingly bellicose threats by Russia to cut off energy \nsupplies and to target Poland and the Czech Republic with military \nmeans, these allied Governments have maintained their freedom, their \nindependence, their sovereignty, and their courage, and have stood fast \nwith the United Sates and NATO. So the very least this Senate could do \nwould be to recognize the importance of these decisions, to express our \nfull and strong support for what these nations have done on behalf of \nthemselves and the Atlantic alliance and affirm that with the support \nof legislation that would move forward with the third site.\n  In closing, I would share with my colleagues the words of Mirek \nTopolanek, the Czech Prime Minister. The Czech Republic and Poland are \nsuch wonderful countries. They are so proud to be free and independent. \nThey are some of our best allies in the world.\n  The Prime Minister placed this issue in the proper context, when he \nstated:\n\n       The moral challenge is clear and simple. If we are not \n     willing to accept, in the interest of the defense of the \n     Euro-Atlantic area, such a trifle as the elements of a \n     missile defense system, then how shall we be able to face \n     more difficult challenges that may come?\n\n  Isn't that a great statement? That is the right context.\n  I hope this part of the bill will remain intact. I am confident it \nwill. I hope our appropriators will find the money necessary to move \nforward rapidly to complete the development of these systems. Indeed, \nour NATO allies and the United States are certain to face more \ndifficult challenges in the days ahead, as Iran and other nations \ncontinue to develop weapons of mass destruction and the ballistic \nmissile capability to deliver them. As the crisis in the Caucasus \nsuggests, there may be even greater challenges ahead. By supporting the \nEuropean missile defense initiative, we extend missile defense \ncapabilities to our allies while bolstering the defense of the United \nStates homeland. In so doing, we strengthen our partnership and our \ncollective security. We send a strong message to potential adversaries \nthat this alliance will take such actions as necessary to ensure its \nsecurity against threats that may occur.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for whatever time I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, allow me to echo strong agreement with \nmy colleague from Alabama. We both serve on the Armed Services \nCommittee. It is our hope and belief that we will be able to get a bill \ntonight. There are a lot of amendments that we would have liked to have \nhad time to add. Senator Sessions talked about the successes we have \nhad in the Czech Republic and in Poland. It is absolutely necessary. \nThis is a life-threatening situation. I believe we are in pretty good \nshape there. I had several programs that are going to be included in \nthis bill expanding the training and equipment. Sections 1206, 1207, \nand 1208 are significant. Those are things we can do in the field in \nthese countries where we are in a position to train and equip these \npeople, which is certainly to our advantage. Expanding what used to be \ncalled the CERP, the Commanders Emergency Response Program--they \nchanged the name. I can never keep up with these things. But instead of \nhaving it only apply to Iraq and Afghanistan, it now applies to other \nareas also. It gives the commanders in the field a chance to respond \nimmediately rather than go through all the bureaucratic redtape of \ncorrecting problems back in Washington.\n  With the IMET program, which is a program whereby we bring in \nofficers and train them in our facilities in the United States, it used \nto be that until they signed an article, we would not allow them to be \ntrained in the United States. The assumption was that somehow we were \ndoing them a favor by training them. The reverse is true. They want to \ncome to the United States to train because they know we have the best \ntraining. If we refuse to do it, countries such as China will welcome \nthem with open arms. One of the interesting things is, once officers \nare trained in this country, they develop an allegiance that stays.\n  A lot of these things are in the bill that are good. I am delighted, \nbecause I understand we will be voting on it very soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/17/senate-section/article/S8920-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8920-S8922]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 AFRICA\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, the main reason I wanted to come to the \nfloor today is another resolution we hope we will be able to get passed \nbefore we leave having to do with Darfur. I have had the habit of \nbringing attention to situations and conflicts in places around the \nworld that get little attention. However, in the case of Darfur, it has \nhad all the attention. When people ask, what are the problems with \nAfrica, they always talk about Darfur. So while they have received all \nof the attention, there hasn't been any kind of action that has \nfollowed. It is distressing that the situation in Darfur has received \nso much press and generated so much attention, with documentaries and \nadvocacy campaigns and waves of public support, but it has not spurred \nthe international community to more action.\n  We have been saddened and horrified at the pictures we have seen and \nthe stories we have heard about the genocide in Darfur that has \nunfolded since 2003. At least 300,000 people have died, and 2\\1/2\\ \nmillion have been forced from their homes at the hands of violent \nmilitias called the jingaweit who have been encouraged and supported by \nthe Khartoum Government, President Bashir. One of the things that is \ninteresting about this is, we recall the tragic genocide that took \nplace in the middle 1990s in Rwanda. People are now aware of that and \nwondering why we couldn't have done something about it earlier to \nprevent it. They have now killed about a third the number of people of \nthe genocide that took place in Rwanda, and President Kagame is doing \nsuch a great job there. But where were we when we could have helped \nPresident Kagame and prevented the genocide from taking place?\n  It is now up to a third that many in Darfur. So we can do something \nand do something now to avoid it. Last week we received news that \nSudan's central government is launching land and air attacks in Darfur, \nwith many dead and injured. Last month, in August, the Sudanese \nmilitary and police opened fire on Darfur refugee camps, killing 31 \npeople and injuring a lot of others. The United Nations/African Union \nhybrid peacekeeping force assessed the incident and concluded that \nSudan used an excessive, disproportionate use of lethal force. For the \nUnited Nations to come up with that, it has to be bad. They also \nconcluded that the refugees were only carrying sticks and knives and \nspears while the Sudanese forces were armed with guns. Khartoum \ninsisted that they were searching the camp for drugs and weapons.\n  In July, The Hague, the International Criminal Court, began the \nprocess of indicting President Bashir on 10 charges, including three \ncounts of genocide, five crimes against humanity, two of murder, and \nmasterminding the campaign to annihilate the tribes in Darfur. A senior \nU.S. official said recently that he expects the ICC, the International \nCriminal Court, to issue an arrest warrant in the next month--long \noverdue, I might add. Bashir, who no doubt is beginning to feel the \npolitical ground shifting beneath him, continues to resort to more \nintimidation and violence. One major factor in the ongoing violence in \nDarfur can be traced to the continued violations of the U.N. arms \nembargo on Sudan. China is Khartoum's major source of weapons used in \nDarfur. China has embarked on a new form of colonialism in Africa, \ngrabbing as many natural resources as it possibly can while \ndisregarding the effect on the people. I wish more Members were \nfamiliar with Africa and the history of Africa. There are so many books \nwritten about that, one of them addressing the Belgium situation there \nin the early years. They came in, raped the country, took all the \nnatural resources, and left the people there to die. We should be aware \nthat that is exactly what China is doing right now.\n\n  Beijing has declared 2006 the year of Africa. It shows no signs of \nslowing\n\n[[Page S8921]]\n\ndown in spreading its influence to claim resources. Currently, China's \nnational petroleum company is pumping roughly 500,000 barrels a day \nfrom wells in southern Sudan. Keep in mind, China is our biggest \ncompetitor for oil and gas around the world. Obviously, we are \ndependent upon foreign countries, many of them not too friendly to us, \nfor our ability to even fight a war. That is another issue and one we \nwill address. But China is right in the middle of this one, making it \nmore difficult for us. In order to assure continued access to the oil, \nChina has provided weapons to Khartoum and taken a very passive stance \ntoward the government's brutal treatment of the people of Darfur.\n  Last year Amnesty International reported that both China and Russia \nhad broken the arms embargo by supplying Sudan with attack helicopters, \nbombers, and weapons. On July 12, the British Broadcasting Corporation \nreported they had evidence that the Chinese Government provided \ntraining and equipment to Bashir's government. In February, the report \nsaid that China was training pilots to fly Chinese Fantan aircraft jets \non missions from the airfield in southern Darfur. This is a direct \nviolation of the U.N. arms embargo which covers training, not just the \nsupply of weapons, equipment, and military vehicles. The BBC also \ninvestigated weapons that China sold to Sudan in 2005 and found \npostembargoed trucks that carried antiaircraft guns. This news, \nalthough not a surprise, comes at a time when Khartoum is using force \nagainst refugees with the very planes and weapons that China is \nsupplying.\n  China is not the only problem there. Russia is actually a problem \nalso. Russia is to blame for violating the arms embargo. During the \nlast couple of weeks of attacks, Darfur rebels stated that the \ngovernment used four helicopter gunships and two Russian-made Antonov \nairplanes. Russia's continued disregard for crimes perpetrated by the \nKhartoum Government in Darfur and the selling of arms to carry out such \nviolence against the people of Darfur is inexcusable and needs to be \nstopped immediately.\n  I hasten to say there are many other problems I have come to the \nfloor and talked about over the last 12 years in Africa. Darfur is one \nthat has captivated everyone's attention. But I assure my colleagues, \nthere are problems in other areas. Right now, as we all know, China is \ncurrently Zimbabwe's largest investor and President Mugabe has \ndestroyed the economy in Zimbabwe. We can all remember when they were \nconsidered to be the breadbasket of all of Africa. It is amazing that \nZimbabwe is able to buy military articles such as their recent purchase \nfrom China that included $240 million in fighter jets, in light of \ntheir dying economy. When I say ``dying economy,'' they don't even talk \nanymore about the value of their currency because their currency has no \nvalue. So the only ones eating in Zimbabwe, the area that used to be \nthe breadbasket of all of Africa, are the ones who are subsistence \nfarmers, able to grow what they and their families can eat.\n  In 2005, I gave a series of speeches detailing why I believe China to \nbe a threat to our national security. From what we have talked about \ntoday, we know China is also a threat to other countries' national \nsecurity. I challenge my African friends to be wary of current and \nfuture Chinese involvement in their countries. It seems that much of \nthe power-sharing agreement in Zimbabwe has been reached with Mugabe \nremaining as President and opposition leader Tsvangirai taking over the \nday-to-day running of the Government as Prime Minister. I hope it works \nout, but I am not optimistic that it will.\n  We have a problem there. We have a country that had been the \nbreadbasket of sub-Saharan Africa and is now unable to provide \nanything.\n  As to other threats in Africa, I have been quite distressed for some \ntime that as we get the squeeze in the Middle East and al-Qaida and the \nvarious terrorist elements down through the Horn of Africa, but we have \nfinally made a good decision in this country to assist Africa in \nbuilding five African brigades, located north, south, east, west, and \ncentral. This is going to be necessary for them to take care of the \nproblems. As to other problems in Africa, it has been 30 years now \nsince western Sahara was kicked out of their homeland, and they have \nbeen out in the desolate areas now for more than 30 years. It is \nshocking to me that we don't do anything to help them get repatriated \nand sent back to their proper areas.\n  In northern Uganda, on several of my trips there, I have become \nfamiliar with what President Museveni has been trying to do for a long \nperiod. Frankly, President Museveni has been doing a great job. He was \na warrior before he became President of Uganda. But the problem in \nUganda is every bit as bad as it is in Darfur, and it is a problem \neverybody knows about, though it is totally different. We have a guy up \nthere named Joseph Kony, who heads the Lord's Resistance Army. You have \nheard about the Children's Army and how he goes and trains these little \nkids, these little boys who are 12 to 13 and 14 years old, how to use \nautomatic weapons. They have to go back to their villages and murder \nboth their parents and all of their family. If they do not do it, they \nmutilate them. They cut their ears off.\n\n  I have been up in the northen part of Uganda and have been able to \nsee it. What have we been able to do about that? Very little. He is \nstill loose. Just recently they put him on the list of global \nterrorists for the United States, but that did not really resolve \nanything major. So we have that problem. And we have Joseph Kony, who \nis still to this day killing and mutilating little kids.\n  I guess I am a little sensitive to that. We had a great experience in \nmy family. We found a little girl in Ethiopia when she was 3 days old, \nand her health was not very good. As we might expect in Addis Ababa, in \nEthiopia, there is a great need for nurseries and health care for kids, \nbut the health care just isn't there.\n  I remember looking at this little girl. As the weeks went by and she \nstarted developing--escaping death time and time again--she finally \ngrew up and she became a very attractive little girl. I have said on \nthis Senate floor several times that my wife and I have been married 49 \nyears, and we have 20 kids and grandkids. Well, this little girl shown \nin this picture is one of them now because my daughter Molly, who had \nnothing but boys, wanted to have a girl, so she adopted this little \ngirl, Zegita Marie, and she has turned out to be an outstanding little \ngirl.\n  So there are these problems. One of the problems with adopting in \nAfrica is that culturally some countries do not approve of adopting. \nThey think the village should be able to take care of the children who \nbecome orphans. The problem with that is, with such things that are \ntaking place right now in Darfur, with such things that have taken \nplace in Rwanda, the villages cannot absorb the killing and mutilating \nof a million people in a short period of time. That is what has \nhappened in Rwanda.\n  So I am glad several Members of this body, including Mary Landrieu \nfrom Louisiana, have been interested in helping with the adoption of \nsome of these kids so that other children like my little granddaughter \nare not left there to die in a country in sub-Sahara Africa but can \nfind a loving family.\n  Anyway, right now, the subject is Darfur. The subject is Darfur \nbecause what is going on there right now is kind of in the early stages \nof what we witnessed taking place in Rwanda. That genocide can be \nstopped, and it can only be stopped by us along with anyone else in the \ninternational community who cares enough to save lives in sub-Sahara \nAfrica. Certainly, the southern part of Darfur is a crisis right now \nthat needs to be dealt with.\n  So I would ask my colleagues to join Senator Bill Nelson of Florida \nand me in asking for the adoption of a resolution that should take \nplace today. It is one that is going to establish a specific position \nfor the United States of America. The resolution is S. Res. 660, which \nwe have submitted this week. It condemns the ongoing sales of arms to \nbelligerents in Sudan and calls for both an end to such sales and an \nexpansion of the U.N. embargo on arms sales to Sudan.\n  As Russia and China provide Khartoum with more weapons and materials, \nthey continue to fuel the conflict and violence and drive a peaceful \nsolution further away from reality.\n\n[[Page S8922]]\n\n  Countries that want to do business in Africa, or anywhere for that \nmatter, must be held accountable for their behavior. One of the things \nI have observed in Africa, no matter what country you go into--if it is \nan oil-rich country--anything that is new and shiny, whether it is a \nbridge, whether it is a colosseum, a sports arena, it is always built \nby China. So they have the inside track, and it is going to be up to us \nto join together to stop that type of mutilation of the population in \ncountries such as northern Uganda and the Sudan.\n  So I urge the adoption of this resolution today and hope it will \nbecome a reality so we have a new position for the United States of \nAmerica to save little girls like this one in countries that are \ninvolved in genocide.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester).

Mr. President, today the stock market is down over 400 \npoints. Yesterday it was pretty mixed. The day before it was down over \n500 points. It is pretty clear that, judging by what is happening on \nWall Street and judging what is happening to the economy--the news this \nmorning on the front page of the paper: Loan guarantee offered to one \nof the largest insurance companies of America; the bankruptcy of an \ninstitution, Lehman Brothers, which has been around since the late \n1800s; it survived the Civil War and the Great Depression--all these \ntogether demonstrate a very serious problem for this country's economy. \nThis economy is in some peril, and I think we should not underestimate \nthe difficulties that face it.\n  Our Treasury Secretary and the head of the Federal Reserve Board are \ntaking midnight action, working 24 hours a day, apparently, convening \nmeetings here and there, but they share something in common with us. \nNone of us have ever been here before. No one quite understands where \nwe are and what we do to deal with this very serious economic challenge \nto our country.\n  This is a great country. It is the only country like it on this \nplanet. It has a very strong economy and has had for a long while. It \nhas lifted a lot of people out of poverty and dramatically expanded the \nmiddle class. It has provided opportunity over the last century that \nhas been almost unparalleled. Yet we now face some very difficult \ntimes, and it requires all of us to think together and work together to \nput together some plans to deal with this issue and this challenge. \nHowever, you cannot fix a problem you have not diagnosed.\n  I wish to talk a little about what got us here and a bit about what I \nthink we ought to do about it. Two things: a subprime mortgage scandal \ndecimated part of the foundation of this country's economy. I wish to \ntalk about what it means. It sounds like a foreign language: Subprime \nloan scandal. Then, at the same time this economy was weakening because \nof an unbelievable subprime loan scandal, the price of oil was going up \nlike a Roman candle, up to $147 a barrel. It has come down some now; \nback up I think $4 or $5 a barrel today. But that had a huge impact on \nthis economy as well. In some ways, these problems have the same roots: \nUnbridled speculation, regulators who didn't regulate, those who were \nsupposed to regulate were willing to be willfully blind.\n  Let me talk about these things for a moment. Let me talk first about \nthe situation with the price of oil. I held a hearing yesterday for \nalmost 3 hours on the subject of speculation that I believe drove the \nprice of oil to $147 a barrel. At a time when our economy was reeling \nfrom the subprime scandal, running oil up to $147 a barrel was a huge \nburden and had a huge impact in weakening this economy. I am somebody \nwho believes it was speculation that drove this up, right under the \nnose of regulators who didn't care about regulating.\n  Let me tell my colleagues what happened yesterday. We have had all \nkinds of testimony about this. One of the witnesses who was at the \nEnergy Committee yesterday was from J.P. Morgan, a venerable investment \nbank in this country, and Lawrence Eagles delivered testimony yesterday \nfrom J.P. Morgan. He is the head of commodity research, and here is \nwhat Mr. Eagles said:\n\n       We believe that high energy prices are fundamentally the \n     result of supply and demand. We fundamentally believe that \n     high energy prices are a result of supply and demand, not \n     excessive speculation.\n\n  This from a man from the J.P. Morgan company, the global head of \ncommodity research. But an e-mail we obtained today that was sent late \nlast evening to the clients of J.P. Morgan by a Michael Zimbalist, who \nis the global chief investment officer for J.P. Morgan--the same \ncompany--said this--what we have been saying:\n\n       There was an enormous amount of speculation pent up in \n     energy markets; example, an eight-fold increase in bank OTC \n     oil derivatives exposure in the last three years and it \n     wasn't just the supply-demand equation. Oil will rise again \n     and we need solutions to energy supplies, but $140 in July \n     2008 was ridiculous.\n\n  Let me say that again. An executive with J.P. Morgan testified \nyesterday before our committee and said: We believe high energy prices \nare the result of supply and demand, not excessive speculation.\n  Last evening, an e-mail was sent from J.P. Morgan by their global \nchief investment officer and it says what we have been saying: There \nwas an enormous amount of speculation pent up in energy markets.\n  I am trying to understand--and this is not to focus just on this \ncompany--J.P. Morgan. They testified they were an investment bank. We \nhave had meetings with a lot of interest about this subject of excess \nspeculation. I am trying to understand whether we are getting the \nstraight story from people. What was the straight story here, the man \nthey sent to testify or one of the top folks in J.P. Morgan who sent an \ne-mail to clients last evening? They directly contradict each other.\n  We have a whole lot of folks who are making a living these days \nsaying: Well, the price of oil went to $147 a barrel because of supply \nand demand, and I say to them: It doubled in a year. From July to July, \nthe price of oil doubled. I defy anyone to tell me what happened to \nsupply and demand in that year that justified the doubling of the price \nof oil. There isn't anyone in this Chamber and there is no one who has \ntestified before my committees who can make that case. Why? Because the \ncase is not valid. It isn't valid.\n  I have sent a letter to Mr. Jamie Dimon, the chief executive officer \nof J.P. Morgan, asking him to reconcile this. The company was willing \nto testify and they were one of the witnesses yesterday. I invited \nwitnesses who had made the case that speculation was a significant part \nof this problem, of the runup of oil; others had invited those who \nbelieved that speculation was not. This testimony from J.P. Morgan was \npart of testimony invited by those who believe there is not a \nspeculative component. But we have a right as a committee, it seems to \nme, to understand how does this happen. The company sends a \nrepresentative to tell us there is no speculation and then sends an e-\nmail to clients the same day and says speculation is a significant \npart.\n  The reason I mention this is oil is a part of what is happening in \nthis country today with our economy. The runup in the price of oil \nsignificantly weakened this economy. I am expecting a response from \nJ.P. Morgan to try to tell me why the contradiction. Who is talking \nstraight here? When do we get straight answers? If we are going to fix \nwhat is wrong, we have to know what happened and what caused it.\n  Now, I mentioned the subprime loan scandal. The subprime loan \nscandal. I described what I thought was going to happen 9 years ago on \nthe floor of the Senate. We had a bill that came to us from Senator \nGramm called Gramm-Leach-Bliley. Senator Gramm spent a career here \ntrying to get rid of all regulation: Deregulate. Deregulate, he \nclaimed. Financial modernization, he\n\n[[Page S8923]]\n\ncalled it. The Financial Modernization Act. That was a fancy way of \nsaying: Let's take apart the protections that existed after the banks \nfailed in the 1930s and the Great Depression, let's take apart the \nprotections we put in place to make sure it didn't happen again. We put \nin place the Glass-Steagall Act that said you have to keep separate \nbanks and real estate and securities. Why? Because real estate and \nsecurities can be very speculative, and banks need to stay away from \nspeculation. It needs to not only be safe and sound, it needs people to \nthink they are safe and sound.\n  So what was put in place in the 1930s--the Glass-Steagall Act and \nother provisions to separate inherently risky enterprises from \nbanking--worked for a long time. Then to the floor of the Senate comes \nthe Financial Modernization Act in 1999. I voted against it. Let me \nread what I said on the floor on May 6, 1999, on the floor of the \nSenate:\n\n       This bill will also, in my judgment, raise the likelihood \n     of future massive taxpayer bailouts. It will fuel the \n     consolidation and mergers in the banking and financial \n     industry at the expense of customers, farm businesses, family \nfarmers, and others. In some instances I think it inappropriately \nlimits the ability of the banking and thrift regulators from monitoring \nactivities between such institutions and their insurance or securities \nsubsidiaries, raising significant safety and soundness consumer \nprotection concerns.\n\n  Let me say that again: This bill will also, in my judgment, raise the \nlikelihood of future massive taxpayer bailouts.\n  No, I am not a soothsayer. I didn't have a crystal ball. But I knew \nif you don't have good regulation and you are going to create the \nhomogenization of big financial industries and put banking and \neverything together, even if you claim you are going to build \nfirewalls, I knew exactly what was going to happen.\n  On November 4, 1999, on the conference report--I was one of eight \nSenators to vote against it--I said:\n\n       Fusing together the idea of banking--which requires not \n     just the safety and soundness to be successful but the \n     perception of safety and soundness--with other inherently \n     risky speculative activities is, in my judgment, unwise.\n\n  Then I said:\n\n       We will, in 10 years' time, look back and say we should not \n     have done that because we forgot the lessons of the past.\n\n  Those are my statements from 1999. It is now 9 years later, not 10. \nWhat we see are massive bailouts, massive taxpayer bailouts, and the \nlessons we apparently forgot. I voted against all of that. The fact is \nthey sold it. They sold it like medicine from the back of a wagon in \nthe old West, snake oil, solve everything. Allow all these big \ninstitutions to get married; fall in love, get married and become \nbigger and do a little of everything. That way you get one-stop \nshopping. Go ahead and buy your securities, buy your insurance, buy \nyour real estate, and then make a deposit, if you will, and maybe get a \ncheck book if you want to still write some checks if you don't want to \ndo it electronically; just one-stop shopping at all of your financial \ninstitutions and there will be no problem.\n  Guess what happened. In 2001, we had regulators come to town, hired \nby a new President, who said: You know what. It is a new day. \nRegulation is a four-letter word and we think four-letter words are \ndirty and we don't intend to regulate. Yes, we are going to get paid. \nWe are going to run these regulatory agencies, but we don't intend to \ndo anything. We intend to take an 8-year sleep, and they did. They \ndozed off immediately and they have not yet awakened.\n  We had a regulator at one of the very important agencies say: In \nfact, there is a new sheriff in town and this is a new business-\nfriendly environment. We now see what that means. Willful blindness by \npeople we paid to regulate, who came to town hostile to the basic \nnotion of regulation.\n  Now, they saw what I saw. I have a tiny little television set, and so \nin the morning when I shave and brush my teeth, I have that television \nset on and I hear the advertisements on television. Countrywide, the \nbiggest mortgage bank in America, here is what they said:\n\n       Do you have less than perfect credit? Do you have late \n     mortgage payments? Have you been denied by other lenders? \n     Call us.\n\n  What they were saying, essentially, is: Hey, are you a bad risk? Give \nus a call if you want a mortgage. Do you need a loan? This is the \nbiggest mortgage bank in the country saying: If you can't pay your \nbills, for gosh sakes, call us. We want to give you a loan.\n  It wasn't just Countrywide. Here is a company called Millennium \nMortgage and here is what they said. This was seductive. They said: \nTwelve months, no mortgage payment. That is right. We will give you the \nmoney to make your first 12 payments if you call in 7 days. We pay it \nfor you. Our loan program may reduce your current monthly payment by as \nmuch as 50 percent and allow you no payments for the first 12 months. \nThat is a pretty good deal. We will make your first 12 months payments. \nOf course, they will put that on the back of the loan and it will incur \ninterest and you will end up paying a lot more.\n  This is Zoom Credit. You all saw these advertisements:\n\n       Credit approval is just seconds away. Get on the fast track \n     at Zoom Credit. At the speed of light, Zoom Credit will \n     preapprove you for a car loan, a home loan, or a credit card.\n\n  It says:\n\n       If your credit is in the tank, Zoom Credit is like money in \n     the bank.\n       Zoom Credit specializes in credit repair and debt \n     consolidation, too. Bankruptcy, slow credit, no credit--who \n     cares.\n\n  These were the advertisements being run on television and on the \nradio across the country by the shysters trying to place bad mortgages \nout there that people could not make payments on, and then they run the \npaper up through securities, hedge funds, and investment banks, run \nthem all over the world. Then it goes sour and people cannot make \npayments, and you have all these bad loans out there and things \ncollapse. It is called the subprime loan scandal, and here is the \norigin: companies that said: If you have bad credit or you cannot make \nyour payments, come to us, we will give you a loan.\n  So you start with the first baby step of bad business practices--\nbecause everybody was making money. The folks who were selling the \nloans, cold-calling people, were making big bonuses; and the mortgage \nbanks, such as Zoom and Countrywide--the biggest--were making lots of \nmoney slicing these mortgages, the subprime mortgages, up into \nsecurities, securitizing them all.\n  By the way, they also said this: If you have bad credit and cannot \nmake your payments and have been bankrupt, you know something, we also \nhave no-doc loans. That means you don't ever have to document your \nincome. They said: We will give you a loan, and you don't have to make \nthe first 12 months of payments--we will make them for you--and you \ndon't have to document your income. You could do that if you have been \nbankrupt and have been unable to pay your bills. Isn't that \nunbelievable? Guess what. They were all over the country like hogs in a \ncorn crib snorting and making money, hauling it to the bank, saying: We \nare making big money by putting out bad paper.\n  Then what happens? All of a sudden, these mortgages, which in most \ncases had a 3-year reset of interest rates and were offered with teaser \nrates--sometimes 1 percent or 1.25 percent--these mortgages, 3 years \nlater, had the interest rates reset, and they were now paying 10 \npercent. And then deep in the mortgage was the provision of a \nprepayment penalty so that you could not prepay the mortgage even \nthough you were now stuck at 10 percent and could not pay the bill. \nThese companies and the brokers said that it didn't matter; just line \nthis up, and between now and 3 years, you can flip the property; the \nhousing bubble is going up and you are going to make money anyway. And \nthen the whole thing collapses.\n  So hedge funds are making money hand over fist, and investment banks \nare buying securities that are loaded, like sausage packed with \nsawdust, with good mortgages and bad mortgages, and things go sour, and \nall of a sudden, in these big, homogenized financial institutions, you \nhave massive timebombs exploding inside their balance sheets. Then, \nguess what. We wake up and discover that Bear Stearns cannot make it \nand Lehman Brothers is going belly-up. They bail out Bear Stearns by \nallowing somebody else to buy them with $30 billion from the Federal \nReserve Board, securitized\n\n[[Page S8924]]\n\nby, in many cases, bad securities. This morning, the papers said $85 \nbillion. It is pretty unbelievable what is going on. It all starts \nhere.\n  Now, did somebody see this? Did somebody watch television in the \nmorning or read the newspaper or listen to the radio and hear the \nadvertisements about the seductive new mortgages you could get and how \nthe brokers and bankers and all these folks are making all this money? \nIf the American people didn't see it, should the regulators have seen \nit? Weren't there people in this town whom we paid to regulate? How \nabout Alan Greenspan, who is now treating us with a book and \nappearances on the Sunday shows and giving us a current diagnosis? \nWhere was Mr. Greenspan when this was happening? What happened at the \nFed that persuaded them not to interrupt essentially bad business that \nwould injure the foundation of this country's economy, or the many \nother regulatory agencies where people at the head of them decided to \nbe willfully blind and do nothing?\n  If ever there were a time for the people of this country to question \nwhether the term ``regulation'' is a four-letter word, it is now. I \nbelieve the free market is a wonderful thing. I used to teach \neconomics. I believe the free market is one of the best allocators of \ngoods and services known to mankind. I also know it needs effective \nregulation--a regulator--because occasionally it becomes perverted. \nOccasionally, it is broken by certain interests.\n  As I said earlier, I wish I had been wrong when I said, on the floor \nof the Senate on May 16, 1999, in opposing the Financial Modernization \nAct, which took apart the basic protections we had and that we had \nlearned were needed from the bank failures of the 1930s:\n\n       This bill will also, in my judgment, raise the likelihood \n     of future massive taxpayer bailouts. It will fuel the \n     consolidation and mergers in the banking and financial \n     services industry at the expense of customers, farm \n     businesses, family farmers, and others. . . .\n       Fusing together the idea of banking . . . with other \n     inherently risky speculative activity is, in my judgment, \n     unwise.\n\n  That is what I said 9 years ago. I wish I had been wrong, but I was \nnot.\n  We come now to this intersection with the American economy in peril. \nI know we have people at the Fed and at the Treasury Department working \nfull time to try to put this back together. Again, I say you cannot fix \nsomething if you don't know what went wrong. It is why I describe two \nthings today--one, the unbelievable bubble of speculation that moved \noil to $147 a barrel, which put an enormous burden on this country's \neconomy at exactly the time when we could not afford it, as the economy \nwas already suffering the unbelievable effects of the subprime loan \nscandal. Now we have seen an almost perfect economic storm.\n  One doesn't have to be an economist to understand what is happening \nnow in this economy. But it seems to me that all Americans are hoping \nall of us pull together to find ways to put this country back on track, \ninsist that regulators finally begin to regulate on behalf of the \ninterests of the American people--insist that Congress do what it needs \nto do, and there are a number of things we need to do to set this \nright.\n  It is not with joy that I come to the floor of the Senate describing \nthe conditions that, in my judgment, have caused the most significant \neconomic collapse we have seen in a long time. But we must face the \ntruth, and the truth is that we have been through a very difficult \nperiod and we need our Government to behave in a way that stands up to \nprotect the interests of all Americans, not just a few. I am going to \nhave more to say tomorrow about this subject.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter that I \nhad referred to that I have written to the head of J.P. Morgan, as well \nas an attachment with that letter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 17, 2008.\n     Mr. Jamie Dimon,\n     Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board, JPMorgan \n         Chase & Co., Inc., New York, NY.\n       Dear Mr. Dimon: I am the Chairman of the Energy \n     Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources. I convened a hearing of the Subcommittee \n     yesterday, which focused on speculative investments in the \n     energy futures markets. I am troubled that the testimony \n     delivered by Lawrence Eagles, Global Head of Commodity \n     Research for your company, appears to be contradicted by an \n     internal JPMorgan email that my staff has obtained, dated the \n     same day.\n       At the hearing, Mr. Eagles said, ``we believe that high \n     energy prices are fundamentally the result of supply and \n     demand.'' Additionally, the written testimony which was \n     submitted on behalf of JPMorgan by Blythe Masters said, ``we \n     fundamentally believe that high energy prices are a result of \n     supply and demand, not excessive speculation.''\n       But, an email we obtained that was sent late last night by \n     Michael Cembalest, identified as JPMorgan's Global Chief \n     Investment Officer, directly contradicts the testimony by Mr. \n     Eagles and Ms. Masters. In his email (a copy of which is \n     attached), Mr. Cembalest stated, in part: ``what we've been \n     saying: there was an enormous amount of speculation pent up \n     in energy markets (e.g., an 8-fold increase in bank OTC oil \n     derivative exposure in the last 3 years), and it wasn't just \n     the supply-demand equation. Oil will rise again, and we need \n     solutions to energy supplies, but $140 in July 2008 was \n     ridiculous.''\n       It appears that JPMorgan is telling Congress and the public \n     that the run up in oil prices is solely due to supply and \n     demand, while at the very same time it is telling its clients \n     that an ``enormous amount of speculation'' is running the \n     prices up.\n       Please explain why JPMorgan testified before Congress that \n     the high oil prices are only due to supply and demand when \n     your experts clearly acknowledge privately that it was \n     speculation, not market fundamentals, that sent oil prices \n     skyrocketing. As you know, this is a matter of enormous \n     public interest and concern. Americans across our country are \n     hurting as run-away prices have permeated our entire economy \n     and devastated family budgets.\n       It is critical that we have honest and accurate information \n     as we debate solutions to this energy crisis. As Chairman of \n     the Subcommittee that held the hearing yesterday, I am \n     requesting that you send me all documents in the possession, \n     custody or control of JPMorgan Chase during the last 12 \n     months relating or referring to the role of speculation on \n     oil prices. Given that the Congress is currently debating and \n     will be voting on these matters imminently, please provide \n     these documents to us on a rolling basis beginning as soon as \n     possible with all such documents provided by one week from \n     today. Also, due to the limited amount of time available to \n     us before voting will occur, please ensure that the most \n     relevant documents are provided first.\n       I appreciate your willingness to do this promptly to ensure \n     that the public and Congress receive full, accurate, honest \n     and complete information from those who testify before it.\n       I appreciate your timely response. If you have any \n     questions, please contact Dennis Kelleher, my Chief Counsel, \n     or Ben Klein, my Legislative Director.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Byron L. Dorgan,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n       E-mail sent last night by the Global Chief investment \n     Officer for all of J.P. Morgan (see bold section below).\n\n                Eye on the Market, September 16, 2008, \n                           11-Something P.M.\n\n       Update: The U.S. government took another unprecedented step \n     in this odd year and provided a bridge loan to AIG in \n     exchange for 80% ownership in the company.\n       ``SWF: Sovereign Wealth Fed''. Say this for the U.S. \n     Federal Reserve: they're reinforcing their historical \n     independence from the legislative branch. On a day during \n     which Senators McCain, Obama, Dodd and Shelby all came out \n     publicly against a bailout of AIG, the Fed did it anyway. \n     That's not entirely unprecedented; President Clinton tried to \n     pass the 1994 Mexican Stabilization Act through Congress, \n     couldn't, and then figured out a way to get the Exchange \n     Stabilization Fund done without legislative approval. But \n     what is unprecedented, at least for the Fed, is equity \n     ownership. The United States now has its own Sovereign Wealth \n     Fund, with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and AIG as its inaugural \n     investments. Is this a backdoor alternative to privatizing \n     social security?\n       First, a brief bit of background, AIG is an insurance \n     company with roughly $100 billion in capital and $1 trillion \n     in assets. They have an insurance operation that's been \n     around for almost 100 years, and which has deep experience in \n     life, property & casualty, personal, specialty and D \n     insurance (indemnifications related to mistakes by directors \n     and officers). AIG set up a capital markets subsidiary, \n     AIGFP, which effectively provides re-insurance on $440 \n     billion in securities and other derivatives when you cut \n     through all the industry jargon. AIG allowed this subsidiary \n     to grow to be half the company's assets, a decision which in \n     hindsight borders on the bizarre. Within this business unit, \n     there are concentrated problems with a specific $80 billion \n     portfolio of multi-sector CDOs linked to residential \n     mortgages. They've taken $25 billion in losses so far on this \n     exposure, with more expected by Moody's in Q3. While vintage \n     years and terms/conditions differ, AIG's CDO exposure \n     relative to shareholder equity was much larger than other big \n     CDO holders such as UBS and Citigroup.\n\n[[Page S8925]]\n\n       AIG's problem is that rating agency downgrades of AIGFP \n     force collateral to be posted. Such a clause essentially \n     transforms their exposure from an insurance policy that only \n     requires payout when losses are realized, to a policy which \n     requires payout depending on how markets price similar \n     exposures. And right now, mortgage-backed derivatives are the \n     leprosy of the financial markets, with prices arguably below \n     fair value (a). However, for valuation and capitalization \n     purposes, insurance regulators, accountants and rating \n     agencies (no irony intended) are not interested in anyone's \n     estimate of fair value right now. Instead, they're relying on \n     the last marginal price that anyone happens to sell at, with \n     the most desperate seller setting the price. If only property \n     taxes worked that way; everyone would get tax certiorari \n     relief based on the neighborhood's worst foreclosure sales.\n       I will leave it to others to describe the calamitous (or \n     not) outcomes that the Fed decided to avoid. It would be \n     speculation, although today's news of the oldest money market \n     fund in the country (with $60 billion at its peak) ``breaking \n     the buck'' was possibly a small example (b). What the Fed \n     gets in return for saving AIG: a 2-year loan at Libor plus \n     8.5%, plus an 80% ownership interest in the company. I \n     know a lot of private equity and mezzanine funds that \n     would love to have gotten a deal like that, but they \n     didn't have enough capital. And that was the problem: AIG \n     is so big that the numbers involved were too large for \n     banks and other private sector entities to contemplate, \n     particularly within 48 hours. AIG's former chairman stated \n     that equity investors did not have to be wiped out, but \n     there was only one entity left that was big and adroit \n     enough to offer the terms and capital needed to forestall \n     a possible bankruptcy (c), and it was the U.S. government. \n     While I think the U.S. government made a good investment \n     for taxpayers, the Pandora's box is going to be quite a \n     challenge.\n       We're not going to rush out and buy equities on the view \n     that the world's problems are over, or that the Fed will bail \n     anything else out. The economic news, drowned out by \n     corporate events over the last two weeks, is still pretty \n     bad. This week's charts from our investment meeting (state \n     tax receipts, small business optimism, the U.S. manpower \n     employment survey, the Baltic Freight index, retail sales, \n     Eurozone industrial production, hotel occupancy rates and \n     just about everything related to growth or construction in \n     China) all look the same: plummeting. There's also the minor \n     issue that the Fed is running out of money for these bailout/\n     investment exercises (d). But with the decline in commodity \n     prices, inflation forecasts are tumbling, rendering \n     stagflation risks much lower. While we're at it, the Peak Oil \n     crowd promoting crude oil call options struck at $200 should \n     concede what we've been saying: there was an enormous amount \n     of speculation pent up in energy markets (e.g., an 8-fold \n     increase in bank OTC oil derivative exposure in the last 3 \n     years), and it wasn't just the supply-demand equation. Oil \n     will rise again, and we need solutions to energy supplies, \n     but $140 in July 2008 was ridiculous.\n       We are making some regional shifts in portfolios (from \n     Europe to the U.S.) given a slower global economy, the \n     prevalence of much higher levels of government and corporate \n     debt in Europe, and more rapidly slowing European earnings \n     estimates. We are also holding onto our cash balances, and \n     are investing newly funded accounts slowly. But we are not, \n     as we reiterated last week, positioning for Armageddon, which \n     the Fed might have just averted with its actions this week.\n       Notes:\n       (a) AIG released a report on August 7 with their CDO \n     stress-testing. The assumptions look conservative to me: 80%-\n     90% of subprime loans expected to default, with 20%-30% \n     recoveries upon foreclosure. Assumptions on prime loans were \n     not much better: 60% expected to default, with recoveries of \n     65% upon foreclosure. AIG computed its fair value stress-\n     testing loss on the CDO portfolio at around $10 billion, \n     compared to the $25 billion in losses they've taken so far. \n     This suggests that one of 3 things are true: (i) the non-\n     transparent process through which AIG applied the stress-\n     testing assumptions were too generous and underestimate the \n     loss, (ii) secondary market prices driving the actual marks \n     are too low, or (iii) the markets are right and the \n     assumptions above are still not catastrophic enough. These \n     outcomes are not mutually exclusive, but you could drive \n     a truck through the difference between the stress-testing \n     case and losses realized so far. Call me crazy but I think \n     it's mostly (ii).\n       (b) That's what happens when a money market fund does not \n     provide a dollar back for each dollar invested. A very rare \n     occurrence which only happened once, in 1994.\n       (c) As far as we can tell, the Fed's investment does not \n     constitute an ``event of default'' the way the GSE \n     conservatorship did.\n       (d) For monetary policy geeks only: the AIG deal reduces \n     the amount of unencumbered Treasury bonds held by the Fed \n     under $200 billion. From the March 12, 2008 Eye on the \n     Market: ``Something is nagging at me. Over the long run, I \n     hope the Fed hasn't misjudged something. It's not that the \n     Primary Dealer Credit Facility, is inflationary. For every \n     dealer that comes to the Fed, the Fed sells assets to raise \n     cash to lend, so their monetary targets are unchanged. But \n     Fed assets are not unlimited: existing facilities already \n     reduce some of the Fed's $700 billion in assets. In the \n     highly unlikely event that the Fed's assets were exhausted, \n     they'd have to start the printing press.

Madam President, I come to the Senate today to talk \nabout an important segment of our Nation's population, America's senior \ncitizens.\n  Our senior population has seen a very rapid growth in the 20th \ncentury. As of the year 2000, there were about 35 million people who \nwere 65 years of age or older. Compare this with 3.5 million people at \nthe beginning of the 20th century. Today, about 37 million people are \n65 years or older. This amounts to about 12, 13 percent of our total \npopulation.\n  In 2011, the first baby boomers turn 65. This will mark the beginning \nof an explosion in our senior population. By 2030, the senior \npopulation will be twice as large, growing from 35 million to 70 \nmillion.\n  You may ask why I am citing these numbers. My Senate colleagues may \nthink I am setting the stage for a lengthy discussion about our \nentitlement programs--Social Security and Medicare. While the impending \nentitlement crisis does require my attention, along with the attention \nof every Member of Congress--and very soon--I wish to discuss another \nissue that is at the center of this year's political debate, and that \nis that mean word ``taxes''--yes, taxes on our senior citizens. I wish \nto explain to my Senate colleagues and my friends in the media how \nseniors are taxed under current law. I also would like to talk about \nhow the Republican and the Democratic Presidential candidates' tax \nplans will affect our senior citizens.\n  With a significant increase in our older population looming, those \nwho are currently 65 and older--and those who will be turning 65 over \nthe next 2 decades--should pay close attention to the tax changes that \nwill be faced under a Republican administration and Senator McCain or a \nDemocratic administration and Senator Obama as President. People should \nnot only be wary of campaign promises, they must also understand the \nflaws in the various tax proposals being offered the voters this \nelection season. Change may result in higher taxes.\n\n[[Page S8926]]\n\n  I wish to start by picking up from a speech I gave back in July. That \nspeech featured Rip Van Winkle. I have a picture of Rip Van Winkle up \nhere on a chart. In that speech, I explained how a charismatic, \nlikable, articulate, young Governor from Arkansas barnstormed across \nAmerica in 1992 as the Democratic Presidential candidate. That \ncandidate--now former President Bill Clinton--had a battle cry: \n``putting people first'' and ``middle-class taxpayer fairness.'' It \nsounds familiar, doesn't it?\n  Another familiar tune is what candidate Clinton was saying in that \nsame year, 1992. He said, if elected, ``the only people who will pay \nmore income taxes are those living in households making more than \n$200,000 per year.''\n  If elected, the junior Senator from Illinois, the Democratic \ncandidate, says that he will only raise taxes on families earning \n$250,000 or more.\n  But once candidate Clinton was sworn in as President Clinton, that \ncampaign promise was quickly discarded. In 1993, President Bill Clinton \nand a Democratic Congress enacted the largest tax increase in history. \nThose are not my words. I will quote the great chairman of the Finance \nCommittee at that time, New York Senator Patrick Moynihan, who termed \nit ``the largest tax increase in the history of public finance in the \nUnited States or anywhere else in the world.'' And much to the voters' \nsurprise, the tax increase of 1993 was on people who earned more than \n$20,000, not just those earning more than $200,000, as candidate \nClinton had said in that campaign.\n  So the moral of this story is that candidate Clinton, who promised \nmiddle-class tax relief, raised taxes on the hard-working middle-class \ntaxpayers once he became President Clinton. This was obviously change \nthat you could not believe in.\n  The reason I told that story was to tell this story back then. Not \nonly did President Clinton raise taxes on the middle class, he raised \ntaxes on seniors.\n  That is why I am speaking to my colleagues about the impact of tax \nproposals on senior citizens that are an issue in this election. That \nis right, taxes were raised on seniors.\n\n  What was this tax increase on seniors back in 1993? It was an added \ntax on Social Security benefits. Let me take a moment to explain how \nthis tax currently works.\n  Prior to the 1993 tax increase, married seniors with incomes less \nthan $32,000 did not pay taxes on their Social Security benefits. For \nsingle seniors, those with less than $25,000 paid no taxes on their \nSocial Security benefits. However, single seniors with incomes over \n$25,000 and married seniors with incomes over $32,000 paid income tax \non only 50 percent, or maybe for the people paying it, it was on the \nwhole 50 percent of their Social Security benefits. The revenue raised \nfrom this tax is directed into the Social Security trust fund.\n  These rules remain in place today, but under the 1993 tax increase \nthat President Clinton signed, senior citizens with incomes over \n$34,000 and married seniors with incomes over $44,000 were required to \npay income tax on not 50 percent of their Social Security benefits but \n85 percent of their Social Security benefits. So this so-called tier 2 \nSocial Security tax is still part of our tax laws. The revenue \ngenerated from the tier 2 tax is directed to the Medicare trust fund.\n  Let me pause for a moment to show how many seniors actually pay tier \n1, that is 50 percent, and tier 2, the additional 35 percent. We can \nsee on this chart a number for 1994 and a number for 2005. In 1994, \nwhen the tier 2 tax became effective, almost 6 million seniors paid \nincome tax on their Social Security benefits. This includes singles and \nmarried seniors.\n  Compare this with 2005, the most recent year we have accurate data \nfrom the IRS. Around 12 million seniors paid the tier 1 and the tier 2 \nSocial Security tax. So you can bet your bottom dollar that seniors \nwith incomes of less than $200,000 were surprised when they woke up to \nthe fact that the tax increase of 1993 hit them.\n  Why were they surprised? Candidate Clinton assured them their taxes \nwould not go up. Not only did their taxes go up, they had to give back \na significant portion of their Social Security benefits to the \nGovernment, benefits that they worked a lifetime to receive.\n  Will America's seniors and the middle class, for that matter, wake up \nto higher taxes after the 2008 election? That is the key for my being \nhere, to look at the tax debate going on in this election season for \nthe Presidency. Will American seniors and the middle class, for that \nmatter, have to wake up to higher taxes after the 2008 election?\n  Much like Rip van Winkle woke up to a different, changed world, will \nSenator Obama's change be something seniors can believe in? Could \nhistory repeat itself?\n  I wish now to explain how the 2001 and 2003 bipartisan tax relief \nbenefits American seniors. The reason I call them the bipartisan tax \nrelief bills is because it had bipartisan support, unlike the rhetoric \nof the campaign which is always referring to the Bush tax cuts.\n  If these were the Bush tax cuts, they would have been a heck of a lot \nbigger tax cuts than the bipartisan tax relief that is now the law of \nthe land.\n  I wish to specifically focus on the reason for the 2003 tax relief \nbecause in 2003, Congress reduced the top tax rate on capital gains \nfrom 20 percent down to 15 percent. Congress also tied dividend income \nto the capital gains tax rate instead of the taxpayers' marginal tax \nrate. That is, of course, the same 15 percent as for capital gains.\n  For low-income taxpayers, the tax rate on capital gains and dividends \nis currently zero. How does a lower capital gains and dividend income \ntax rate benefit our senior citizens who have contributed so much to \nthis country? Census Bureau statistics show that about 23 percent of \nthe taxpayers claiming dividend income are senior citizens; in other \nwords, 65 or over. A nonpartisan research group, the Tax Foundation, \nshows that nearly 26 percent of all taxpayers claiming capital gains \nare seniors 65 or over. So a considerable number of seniors rely on \ninvestment income as a cornerstone of their overall income.\n  The Democratic leadership may file on to this floor and tell you that \nthe majority of seniors' income is locked away in retirement plans and \nIRAs and because of this, they don't need the favorable tax relief of \ncapital gains and dividend income. I have news for anybody. First, as I \npointed out, a large number of seniors rely on a stable flow of income \nthat dividends provide. Add seniors' reliance on capital gains and you \nsee that any reduction in investment income through higher taxes will \nhurt our hard-working senior citizens.\n  Let me show my Democratic colleagues and friends in the media the tax \nsavings that seniors currently enjoy due to lower tax rates. As we can \nsee on the chart, seniors with incomes under $50,000 earning dividend \nincome see the biggest tax savings. Their tax liability is 17 percent \nless than it would be if the favorable tax relief expired. This portion \nof the chart also illustrates how much more seniors rely on this \nfavorable tax treatment than taxpayers of all ages. For all other \ntaxpayers, their tax liability is 7.6 percent less, as we can see from \nthe chart, the first bar.\n  Let's look at seniors claiming capital gains. Same chart, as we can \nsee. Seniors with incomes under $50,000 pay about 13 percent less in \ntaxes than they would without the favorable tax relief in the 2003 \ncapital gains law. That is a significant chunk of change for our hard-\nworking seniors or, if they are retired, for having worked hard \nthroughout their life.\n  So we can see my Democratic friends don't have a leg to stand on. \nThey come out here--we have seen them and heard them--like the big bad \nwolf and huff and puff about how seniors do not benefit from the 15-\npercent capital gains and dividend income tax rate. But the facts, as I \npresented them, are clear, and we get this information from foundations \nand study groups. Seniors rely on capital gains and dividend income to \nmaintain their standard of living and pay their medical expenses. \nSeniors benefit significantly from the favorable tax treatment on \ncapital gains and dividend income, especially low-income seniors.\n  The moral of this story is that lower tax rates on investment income \nmeans these seniors can keep more of their earnings to pay for life's \nnecessities. Taking these tax benefits away from seniors by raising \ncapital gains and dividends, these are people who will be hurt because \nthey most typically live\n\n[[Page S8927]]\n\noff of a fixed income and their standard of living would be severely \nimpacted.\n  My Democratic colleagues in Congress actually want to take away the \n2003 tax relief for seniors. For example, in March of this year, this \nbody took a very important vote. I, along with my Senate colleagues, \nvoted on an amendment to the budget that would have allowed the 15-\npercent capital gains and dividend income tax rates to be extended \nbeyond their sunset period of 2010. Every Democrat voted no. If the \nDemocrats get their way, this favorable tax treatment will go away for \nseniors, raise taxes on seniors, and lower the standard of living of \nseniors. I voted to extend the 15-percent capital gains and dividend \nincome tax rate.\n  The senior Senator from Arizona voted yes. Interestingly, the junior \nSenator from Illinois voted no. My friend's vote is interesting because \nthe junior Senator from Illinois is now barnstorming across America \ncampaigning to be President, much as President Clinton did. On the \nstump, the Democratic candidate has stated he does not want the 15-\npercent capital gains and dividend income tax rates to go away, at \nleast for families earning less than $250,000 a year. Let me repeat, \nthe junior Senator from Illinois, whose word is his bond, voted with \nthis budget vote last spring to allow the 15-percent capital gains and \ndividend income tax rates to expire, but now he is saying he wants this \ntax relief to stick around.\n\n  To a degree, I am glad for that change of heart, but the more I think \nabout it, the more I wonder whether the junior Senator from Illinois \nwill stick to this campaign promise if elected because he might find \nhimself in a position like Candidate Clinton who failed to stick to his \ncampaign promise when he became President not to tax the middle class. \nSo maybe my Democratic friend will be the big bad wolf after all. Huff \nand puff and let the 15-percent capital gains and dividend income tax \nrate expire. I am not sure if a President Obama will be living in such \na brick house. His house may be made of straw and his campaign promise \nof extending the 15-percent capital gains and dividend income tax rate \nfor families earning less than $250,000 may be blown down.\n  Former President Clinton's promise was blown down, and we saw the \nbiggest tax increase in history. That is what Senator Moynihan, \nchairman of the committee at that time, said. I don't want history to \nrepeat itself.\n  Let's focus on how seniors would be affected under a Republican or a \nDemocratic administration. Let me start with a Republican \nadministration because Senator McCain's tax plan is straightforward. \nThat is, the Senator from Arizona would continue the current 15-percent \ncapital gains and dividend income tax rates beyond its sunsetting. He \nwould also continue the tax rate of zero percent for low-income \ntaxpayers. Yes, it is a very simple tax plan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes. We are under \na time agreement.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask permission to continue. I was told I would have \nuntil 10 after 6, and I will be done before 10 after 6.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, may I inquire of the Senator, another \n5 or 10 minutes?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Let's say 7 minutes, and if I am not done in 7 minutes, \nI will quit.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, seniors under the tax plan proposed by \nthe senior Senator from Arizona would continue to benefit from lower \ntax rates. This would allow seniors to maintain their current standard \nof living. These taxpayers will be able to age with dignity.\n  The Democratic Presidential candidate's tax plan for seniors is much \nmore complicated. But first let's keep it simple. Although the junior \nSenator from Illinois voted to allow the 15-percent capital gains and \ndividend income tax rates to expire, he is now saying he wants to keep \nthis favorable tax treatment for families earning less than $250,000.\n  It seems the Senator from Illinois thinks the bipartisan tax relief \nis good and should continue for most taxpayers. However, his Democratic \ncolleagues in the House and Senate don't seem to think so. After all, \nthey voted to allow the 15-percent capital gains and dividend income \ntax rate to expire in that vote we had this spring.\n  I ask, if Senator Obama is elected on November 4, will he be able to \nconvince his Democratic colleagues to continue this favorable tax \ntreatment? President Clinton was unable to stop a Democratic Congress \nfrom increasing taxes in 1993. And I wouldn't want history to repeat \nitself.\n  I also want to spend some time discussing a proposal my friend from \nIllinois has discussed on the campaign trail. Senator Obama has \nproposed to exempt seniors with incomes less than $50,000 from income \ntaxes. This sounds pretty good. I mean, for 2007, the median income for \npeople 65 and over was close to $28,000. But if you take a closer look, \nthere are a number of flaws.\n\n  These are not my words. The Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think \ntank that has received notoriety for analyzing the tax plans of Senator \nMcCain and Senator Obama, states that ``the proposal is poorly \ndesigned.'' They also say the proposal ``creates inequities between \nolder and younger workers with the same income.'' The AARP, the \npowerful senior lobby, hasn't even highlighted the proposal in \ncommunications with its membership.\n  But I wish to highlight this proposal and expose its flaws because I \ndon't want our seniors to believe in a campaign promise that can't be \ndelivered.\n  First, the $50,000 exemption amount would not be indexed. This means \nit would erode over time, becoming less and less valuable to seniors.\n  Second, the $50,000 threshold is a cliff. That means a senior earning \n$1 over $50,000 won't qualify for the exemption and that senior might \nstop working to make sure they do not go over that cliff.\n  Third, the $50,000 exemption amount applies to both single and \nmarried taxpayers. This produces a marriage penalty that is unfair to \nmarried seniors.\n  Finally, this proposal exempting seniors making less than $50,000 \nfrom paying income taxes would add to the Social Security and Medicare \ndeficits. This may not be such a big deal for seniors, but it is a big \ndeal for those of us here in Congress who have to find solutions to the \nshortcomings of Medicare and Social Security.\n  Let me tell my colleagues, and of course the media, how this proposal \nwould add to the Social Security and Medicare deficits. As I discussed \nearlier, our current tax laws require seniors with incomes over \n$250,000 and $32,000 to pay income taxes on their Social Security \nbenefits. According to preliminary data released by the IRS, close to \n14 million seniors paid income tax on their Social Security benefits in \n2006. This is because many seniors continue to work. Or they retire, \nbut earn interest income, capital gains dividends, or rental income. \nEven half of their Social Security benefits are taken into account for \npurposes of determining whether a taxpayer must pay income taxes on \ntheir Social Security benefits.\n  Now, there are many seniors who are earning less than $50,000 but \nmore than $25,000 and $32,000. Currently, the income taxes these \nseniors pay on their Social Security benefits go directly to Social \nSecurity and Medicare. This means if these seniors are exempt from \ntaxes, less tax revenue flows into the Social Security and Medicare. \nThe trustees of these funds are already projecting that the Medicare \ntrust fund will run out of money in 2019 and that the Social Security \ntrust fund will follow in 2041.\n  The Senator from Illinois may say he will make up for this revenue \nloss by raising payroll taxes on families earning more than $250,000 a \nyear, but his campaign has recently stated that any increase in the \npayroll taxes on these workers would be phased in over 10 years. This \nmeans the revenue Senator Obama was relying on to make up the revenue \nloss that would result from the seniors' tax exemption won't be there. \nI am not sure about you, but making a campaign promise that will \nballoon the Social Security and Medicare deficits is not good judgment, \nespecially when baby boomers are on the verge of turning 65.\n  Now, I have saved the best for last, and I want to say it loud and \nclear so my friends in the media and our Nation's seniors can hear it: \nSeniors will see their taxes go down under Senator McCain's plan, \nespecially married seniors. Low- and middle-income seniors\n\n[[Page S8928]]\n\nwho are married will be taxed less than under the Democratic tax plan. \nSenior citizens will also enjoy tax relief under the McCain tax plan.\n  The Senator from Arizona is doing the right thing in reducing the \ncorporate tax rates. After all, our Nation has the second highest \ncorporate tax rate in the world. That causes companies to move their \noperations overseas. Both Senator Obama and Senator McCain have alluded \nto the competitive problem our corporations face because of high tax \nrates. There is an added benefit to reducing corporate rates. The \nanswer is: a tax cut for middle-class seniors. Well, the incidence of \nthe reduction of corporate tax rates falls on capital. The \nCongressional Budget Office tells me that the burden of the corporate \ntax falls on capital, and so does the Tax Policy Center.\n  So because seniors hold investments in corporations--as evidenced by \nthe fact that almost a quarter of all Americans claiming dividends are \nseniors--they will see the benefits of lowering corporate tax rates. \nThis means they will see their taxes go down if the corporate tax rate \nis reduced. Married seniors in particular will see their taxes go down \nmore than under the tax plan of the Senator from Illinois, and in some \ncases the senior taxes would go up under the Democratic tax plan.\n  The Tax Policy Center has indicated that low-income seniors, those \nearning up to $32,000, would see their taxes go up by close to $150 \nunder Obama's tax plan. Contrast this with Senator McCain's plan, where \nthese same low-income seniors would see tax cuts of over $150.\n  The Senator from Illinois may not believe me. After all, he has \npromised no new taxes for families earning less than $250,000, and that \nthese taxpayers would receive a tax cut. But here on this chart, it is \nin black and white. According to the Tax Policy Center, seniors with a \ntotal income up to approximately $24,500 and $32,000 would see a tax \ncut of $186 and $154 respectively. That is under the McCain plan. Under \nthe Obama plan, these same seniors would see their taxes go up by $157 \nand $131 respectively. That is a tax increase. And if your income is \naround $83,000, you will see a tax increase of $364 under Obama. \nCompare that to a $431 tax cut under the McCain plan.\n  Let's look at single seniors. If you are a single senior with a total \nincome around $21,000, you will see your taxes go up $118 under Senator \nObama's tax plan and they will go down $140 under Senator McCain.\n  So I ask the Senator from Illinois whether he would like to revise \nand extend his remarks. He says no new taxes and tax cuts for people \nmaking less than $250,000. But as we can see here, that is not true. \nAnd the tax increase is on one of the most vulnerable segments of our \nsociety: our seniors.\n  I would like factcheck.org to post the Tax Policy Center's numbers on \ntheir Web site, and I want seniors in Pennsylvania, Florida, Ohio, \nMissouri, and my home State of Iowa to read this and study it. Don't \nbuy a pig in a poke. Be wary of a unified government. We need to make \nsure that we install in the Presidency people who are going to keep tax \nrates low on seniors.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, before I begin speaking about the \ndisaster occurring in Louisiana and in parts of Texas, and refer \nbriefly to some of the other disasters that have struck, I wish to \nrespond briefly to some of the remarks the Senator from Iowa made.\n  We don't have time for a debate, and I respect my friend on the other \nside a great deal, but had the Democrats followed the Republican \nleadership in trying to privatize Social Security, many seniors would \nbe in a very difficult situation right now, as you know. The Republican \nParty has for years tried to privatize Social Security. What a terrible \nsituation we would be in had we allowed that to happen. But we and some \nothers, a few on their side, stopped it from happening. I can hardly \ntell you what the situation would be for our seniors, whether they are \non the poor end of our economic scale, the middle end, or the higher \nend, with Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and others that are now \ncollapsing.\n  So I know we will have a great deal of debate about which economic \npolicy is the best, and I know the Senator rattled off quite a few \nnumbers regarding Social Security, but I couldn't help myself as I was \nstanding here thinking: Thank goodness we didn't privatize Social \nSecurity. Because whatever situation he has outlined, it would be a \nthousand percent worse for our seniors today. So I thank the \njunior Senator from Illinois from stopping that from happening, along \nwith myself and many others.\n\n  I came to the floor today, however, to speak about the disasters \nunfolding in Louisiana and Texas and other parts of our country. I know \nas this Congress gets ready to adjourn, we have done some significant \nwork over the last couple of months, and we have more work to do, we do \nneed to get on an energy debate for this Nation, and I am hoping \nsomething can be worked out there. We also, of course, have a \ncontinuing resolution to discuss. But this is only one of several \npictures I am going to show of the results of a terrible storm that \ncrashed into the southern part of the United States last week.\n  Hurricane Ike hit the gulf coast with a ferocious force of winds and \ntidal surges on September 13. Hurricane Gustav hit us on September 1, \nand Tropical Storm Fay, while it entered in Florida, or hit our country \nin Florida, actually did a tremendous amount of damage to other parts \nof the United States, not only the States along the gulf coast. There \nwas some terrible interior flooding in Arkansas and even up here in \nthis region. As a result, we have homeowners like this.\n  These photos were sent to us by American Press, from the Lake Charles \nAmerican Press, and I thank them. This is the parish of Calcasieu, \nwhich is right outside the Texas border. So you have the counties, of \ncourse, of Houston and Galveston and Beaumont, but right on the other \nside of that border are Calcasieu Parish and Cameron Parish.\n  Let's see some of the extension of the damage in these other \npictures. This is in a city. This is not in a low-lying area. This is \nnot on a beach. There is not a beach anywhere around here. We have had \ntidal surges from Ike much higher than I think many people realize.\n  This is a picture of the eastern part of Louisiana. You all have seen \nthis picture before, and I know you are going to accuse me of actually \nbringing out an old picture from an old storm. I feel as though I am in \nGroundhog Day here. But this is actually taken from last week. This is \nAmerica's energy port. This is Port Fourchon, where 30 percent of the \noffshore oil and gas from the gulf comes. Port Fourchon. You can't see \nPort Fourchon, because it is completely underwater.\n  I feel I am going through the repeat of a movie. We had Katrina, we \nhad Rita, and now we have Fay, we have Gustav, and we have Ike. And \nwhile Ike did hit directly into Galveston--and please let me begin by \nsaying that my heart goes out to the people of Galveston and Beaumont \nand the millions of people right now who still in Texas do not have \nelectricity. We in Louisiana most certainly understand the difficulties \nfrom a storm of that nature. But I would be remiss if I didn't come to \nthe floor this afternoon and say that this storm hit more than the \nTexas coast. It walloped us as well.\n  This is another part, from southeast Louisiana, I believe. This is \nPort Fourchon. This is right on the coast. We can understand this \nhappens when storms occur. This is not in the middle of a city. This is \nnot inland. This is right on the coast. But as I have come down to say \nso many times, when is America going to wake up and realize that these \nare where our pipelines are? These are where our refineries are. By the \nnature of pipelines and refineries and ports, they have to be near a \ncoast. They cannot be inland. We need to do a much better job of \nprotecting these communities.\n  This is in the Houma-Terrebonne area, which is much farther inland. \nWe had some of the worst flooding in Terrebonne Parish, which is really \nin the southeastern part of the State. Remember, the hurricane really \nhit\n\n[[Page S8929]]\n\nTexas, but the hurricane was so big; it was over 600 miles wide. While \nit was not a category 4 or 5, it was a massive storm that really \nflooded parts of Mississippi, almost all of south Louisiana, and Texas.\n  I see my colleague, the chairman of the committee, coming to the \nfloor. I will at this point yield for just a few moments, as I think \nthey have come to some agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/17/senate-section/article/S8929-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 3001\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, let me first thank our dear friend from \nLouisiana for allowing this interruption. It is a very important \npresentation.\n  In a moment, I am going to propound a unanimous consent request. \nBefore doing that, there has been a lot of inquiry as to whether a \nmanagers' package is included in this. It is not. It has been unable to \nbe cleared on the other side, so it is not included in this unanimous \nconsent request, so that everybody understands it.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that at 6:30 p.m., morning business be \nclosed; that after the bill is reported, all postcloture time be \nyielded back, the first and second-degree amendment be withdrawn, the \nbill then be read a third time, and the Senate proceed to vote on \npassage of the bill; that upon passage, it then be in order for the \nSenate to consider, en bloc, the following calendar items: Nos. 733, \n734, and 735; that all after the enacting clause of each bill be \nstricken and the following divisions of S. 3001, as passed by the \nSenate, be inserted as follows: Division A, S. 3002; Division B, S. \n3003; Division C, S. 3004; that these bills be read a third time, \npassed, and the motions to reconsider be laid on the table, en bloc; \nfurther, that the considering of these items appear separately in the \nRecord.\n  Further--and this is what I am going to call the second half of this \nunanimous consent request--the Senate then proceed to the consideration \nof Calendar No. 758, H.R. 5658, the House companion, that all after the \nenacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 3001, as amended and \npassed by the Senate, be inserted in lieu thereof; the bill be read a \nthird time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable; that the title amendment which is at the desk be considered and \nagreed to; that upon passage of H.R. 5658, as amended, the Senate \ninsist on its amendments, request a conference with the House on the \ndisagreeing votes of the two Houses, the Chair be authorized to appoint \nconferees without further intervening action or debate, and that no \npoints of order be considered waived by virtue of this agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I \nshall object, but before doing so, finally, I would like to say to my \ncolleague and Senators on both sides of the aisle, under the leadership \nof yourself, Mr. Chairman, and to some extent my participation as the \nacting ranking member and certainly the members of our committee and \nstaff--we have all worked very diligently to achieve a bill. The \nparticular request my distinguished colleague has put to the Senate, to \nwhich I shall object, really refers to those items we were unable to \nreconcile procedurally in the course of some several days of \ndeliberation beginning, perhaps, as early as last Thursday. We were \nhere Friday. We were here Monday and Tuesday. We were unable to achieve \nthe reconciliation. There were objections, I say absolutely candidly \nand frankly and factually, on both sides. So it is not as if one side \nhas weighed down the other, in my judgment. It has been the inability \nto reconcile differences between the Senators. I have been here 30 \nyears. I have seen it happen before. It will happen many years after I \nleave.\n  At this time, I point out that the cloud seems dark, but the silver \nlining is that a group of us, 61 in number, voted for cloture. That \nenabled us to be here at this moment, and there will be a bill at some \npoint in time. There will be an armed services bill by the Senate. I \nhope it will be favorably acted upon by a majority.\n  At this time, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, let me first thank my dear friend from \nVirginia. He is accurate in his statements about differences not being \nable to be resolved in terms of a number of amendments which we had \nhoped to get to votes. My statement referred only to a managers' \npackage on which we had cleared about 100 amendments. That is the one I \nmade reference to before.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/17/senate-section/article/S8929-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 3001\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I join in making that request. There is \nno objection on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will again thank my friend for all of his efforts on \nthis bill. He has been, as always, a highly constructive force. We \ncould not even be this far without his great support. I am indebted to \nhim and the Senate is indebted to him, I hope, and the Nation again is \nindebted to Senator Warner.\n  Again, I thank our good friend from Louisiana. We have interrupted \nher for a little longer than I promised.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, if I might just add, I thank my \ndistinguished colleague and friend for the 30 years we have been \ntogether. I am certain this institution will carry on just as well \nwithout me--and perhaps even a little bit better. But I have enjoyed \nour working together these many years. I stop to think, you and I \nhaving been here the same number of years, we have served with 273 \ndifferent Senators in that period of time. I have enjoyed it. I don't \nknow of any relationship, either professional or even simply \nfriendship, that I have enjoyed and profited from more than working \nwith you, Senator. I wish you well as you carry on with this committee.\n  Madam President, I do want to thank the staff of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. I have here with me Michael Kostiw, William \nCaniano, David Morriss, David Collins, Sandy Luff of my personal staff, \nMarie Dickinson, Paul Hutton, Gergory Kiley, Lucian Niemeyer, \nChristopher Paul, Lynn Rusten, Robert Soofer, Diana Tabler, and Richard \nWalsh.\n  I know my staff would want me to say--and I say it--we have enjoyed \nworking with the majority staff.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I see several other colleagues are here on the floor to \nspeak, maybe on this subject or another, so I will say I will reserve \nfor myself another 5 minutes and be finished with my remarks.\n  I was speaking about the hurricane damage throughout really the \nsouthern part of the United States. I do not have the figures from \nFlorida or from Mississippi or Alabama, but we are turning in our \nfigures from Louisiana. Again, I remind my colleagues and the Nation, \nFay hit the gulf coast; it hit Florida but devastated parts of the gulf \ncoast and many interior parts of the southeastern part of the United \nStates, with heavy rains and flooding on August 18. Then we had \nHurricane Gustav on September 1, which slammed into Louisiana and did a \ntremendous amount of wind damage to parishes such as Point Coupee and \nRapides and Avoyelles Parish--parishes about which you don't hear very \nmuch because they are not coastal parishes, but the wind damage\n\n[[Page S8930]]\n\nwas very substantial, all the way up to the northern parts of \nLouisiana. Much like Katrina, it affected the northern parts of \nMississippi, although it was a great flooding event down South. These \nstorms are getting very big and very powerful. Then, of course, \nHurricane Ike hitting again the Texas coast, right into Galveston, \nright up the Houston Ship Channel, doing terrible devastation to our \nfriends in Texas. But again the flooding was substantial along the \ncoastal States.\n  Let me just put up this chart you have seen before. These are the \npipelines that support America's energy coast. This is Louisiana's \ncoast. This is Mississippi's coast. This is the Mobile Bay and, of \ncourse, the panhandle of Florida. This is the Texas coast. These two \nstorms, Gustav and Ike, hit right here in this region, in the center \npart of America's energy coast, and wreaked havoc in terms of flooding \nand wind damage. Again, that has gone up through Louisiana and to other \nparts of the coastal States.\n  This is just another example from Lake Charles of the water damage in \ncommunities tucked well in from the coast. This is wind damage in that \nsame area that can show you some of the wind damage our people are \nexperiencing.\n  Because my time is short, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record a letter from the Governor of Louisiana outlining some of \nour priorities.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               State of Louisiana,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                  Baton Rouge, September 13, 2008.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Speaker of the House, U.S. Capitol\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     House Minority Leader, U.S. Capitol,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Capitol,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell\n     Senate Minority Leader, U.S. Capitol,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Pelosi, Leader Reid, Leader Boehner, and \n     Leader McConnell: For nearly two weeks, hundreds of thousands \n     of Louisiana residents have been without power, clean water, \n     and other necessities. Millions of Louisianians were forced \n     to evacuate their homes before Hurricane Gustav struck, and \n     many have still been unable to return. The stress placed on \n     communities, from a lack of electricity hampering people's \n     ability to work and provide for their family, to being split \n     up from loved ones, to a variety of other difficulties, has \n     been enormous.\n       The economic impact has also been significant. With various \n     bills to increase our domestic energy production under \n     consideration, we strongly urge you to consider additional \n     measures to ensure the resiliency of the nation's top \n     producer of safe, secure domestic energy. Louisiana produces \n     22.2 percent of domestic crude oil and 10.5 percent of \n     natural gas in the United States. As evidenced in recent \n     spikes in fuel prices, our nation is vulnerable to disruption \n     to Louisiana's energy production. In addition to energy \n     production, an estimated 25 percent of North America's \n     seafood is produced off of Louisiana's coasts. These \n     industries along with other essential Louisiana economic \n     drivers were critically impaired due to the destruction \n     caused by Hurricane Gustav.\n       On September 1, 2008, Hurricane Gustav made landfall on \n     Louisiana's coast with strong 110 mph winds following a \n     northwest path into central Louisiana, causing widespread \n     physical damage, power outages, and/or flooding across the \n     vast majority of parishes in Louisiana. The storm caused a \n     power outage that left two-thirds of the state's commercial \n     and residential facilities without electricity. Estimates \n     suggest Hurricane Gustav's economic losses total $7-15 \n     billion including $4.5-10 billion in total property damage \n     and $2.5-5.0 billion in lost economic activity. Thousands of \n     employees were displaced and roughly 97,000 employers in \n     Louisiana (80 percent of total employers in the state) \n     suffered business interruption economic losses. Many of these \n     are small businesses still struggling to recover from \n     Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Louisiana, still recovering from \n     the 2005 hurricanes and facing further damages from Hurricane \n     Ike, requests assistance in upcoming stimulus legislation or \n     other legislative vehicles in Congress.\n\n\n    1. Designate 100% Federal Cost Share on all FEMA Categories of \n                               Assistance\n\n       The state has requested a 100% federal cost share on \n     Individual Assistance to include Other Needs Assistance (ONA) \n     and all other individual assistance programs, and Public \n     Assistance categories A through G, to include Direct Federal \n     Assistance. As you may recall, Congress provided for this \n     assistance for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Many communities \n     impacted by these storms are still recovering and do not have \n     a restored tax base, and thus need this relief. In addition, \n     we would like to work with you to evaluate FEMA regulatory \n     policies that improve evacuation and reentry assistance. The \n     threat of Gustav forced the evacuation of nearly two million \n     Louisiana residents. The State was forced to evacuate 30,000 \n     critical transportation-need residents, including 10,400 \n     medical evacuations, which is the largest medical evacuation \n     in U.S. history. The state was also left with 1.5 million \n     cubic yards of debris from Hurricane Gustav along federal and \n     state highways.\n\n\n            2. infrastructure Repair and Coastal Restoration\n\n       Coastal Louisiana is home to 1.2 million people and helps \n     provide nearly 30 percent of the energy consumed in the \n     United States. Hurricane Gustav interrupted access to these \n     energy resources and infrastructure. Additionally, these \n     storms caused significant damage to the communities in this \n     coastal region and miles of coastal lands and wetlands. The \n     state is requesting funding to repair and improve protection \n     to the 100-year standard in south Louisiana. This would \n     include the resources necessary to complete federally-\n     authorized work in the Greater New Orleans area, Lafourche, \n     Terrebonne, and to expedite delayed protection improvements \n     in St. Mary parish and studies for southwest Louisiana. In \n     addition, we request funds for the construction of federally-\n     authorized coastal restoration projects designed to restore \n     coastal lands lost as a result of hurricanes. It is critical \n     that we provide comprehensive flood and hurricane protection, \n     including both coastal restoration and levee protection, for \n     Louisiana's entire coast.\n       Preliminary cost estimates for the repair of FHWA-eligible \n     roads and bridges sustained as a result of Hurricane Gustav \n     total $160 million. Federal-aid highway damage estimates \n     exceed $125 million. While funding to address these damages \n     is authorized under current law, the backlog associated with \n     these needs may prevent the restoration or threaten the \n     integrity of this critical infrastructure. A Presidential \n     waiver of the $100 million limit on FHWA Emergency Relief \n     funding is requested along with a special appropriation from \n     the General Fund to the FHWA Emergency Relief program for \n     Louisiana and other states facing disaster-related damages. \n     Further, Congress should provide emergency funds to the Corps \n     of Engineers for dredging the critical navigation channels \n     that were impacted by the hurricane. The Mississippi River, \n     Atchafalaya River, Calcasieu Ship Channel and other critical \n     waterways are vital to the country's energy supply and \n     maritime commerce affecting nearly every state.\n       While the majority of public infrastructure repairs will be \n     covered by FEMA programs, it is known from experience with \n     the 2005 storms that there will be certain costs of repair \n     deemed ineligible for FEMA funding. The state requests $100 \n     million in Community Development Block Grants to develop a \n     fund to cover the full repair of key infrastructure and \n     public facilities.\n\n\n            3. Agriculture and Fisheries Disaster Assistance\n\n       Louisiana is one of the top domestic producers of sugarcane \n     within the United States, and second in both rice production \n     and international rice exports. Hurricane Gustav crippled all \n     segments of agriculture throughout Louisiana. Many Louisiana \n     producers sustained uninsured losses and will not be eligible \n     for Supplemental Revenue Assistance Payments as currently \n     structured. The hurricane has also caused catastrophic \n     flooding and widespread wind damage for the state's cattle \n     industry, which is still recovering from losing over 20,000 \n     cattle from the 2005 storms. In addition, Louisiana's seafood \n     industry accounts for more than 25 percent of the catch in \n     the nation. Funds are needed to help offset the loss of this \n     product, increased production costs and damage to storage and \n     fishing facilities.\n\n\n                          4. Economic Recovery\n\n       Hurricane Gustav severely impacted our state's overall \n     economy and many small businesses through widespread physical \n     damage, power outages, and/or short-term population \n     displacement across the vast majority of the state. Based on \n     preliminary estimates, Hurricane Gustav's economic impact \n     totals $7-15 billion. Moreover, many small businesses wounded \n     by Hurricane Gustav had not yet recovered from damage \n     previously inflicted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005.\n       The state proposes implementing a comprehensive business \n     recovery plan that addresses immediate and near-term working \n     capital needs and accelerates economic development during the \n     recovery period and beyond. Suggested recovery options \n     include: business recovery bridge loans, an extension of \n     existing GO Zone bonus depreciation deadlines, an additional \n     allocation of Gulf Opportunity Zone bonds targeted at \n     parishes impacted by Gustav, and technical assistance for \n     impacted small businesses. Similar assistance was provided \n     after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita to help small businesses \n     and their employees et back on their feet.\n\n\n                5. Emergency Preparedness and Readiness\n\n       Every critical disaster demonstrates gaps in the existing \n     system of preparedness, and identifies areas of critical \n     needs to improve the response to future storms. Local \n     governments have prioritized (1) prisoner transportation and \n     evacuation planning, (2) watercraft accessibility, (3) \n     enhanced fixed\n\n[[Page S8931]]\n\n     and mobile generator support, and (4) communications as \n     critical elements to enhancing disaster preparedness. In \n     addition, the state is requesting $100 million for law \n     enforcement equipment and infrastructure repairs that will \n     support both preparedness and recovery functions. Similar \n     assistance was provided after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n\n\n         6. Healthcare and Social Services Disaster Assistance\n\n       The Louisiana Hospital Association estimates that the total \n     financial and operational impact of Hurricane Gustav on \n     Louisiana's hospitals is as much as $302 million. The \n     hospitals, many of which were still struggling with post-\n     Katrina and Rita losses, have sustained reported losses of \n     net revenue, and have incurred costs for incremental salary \n     and labor, sheltering and evacuation, facility damage and \n     debris removal, and other non-ordinary costs attributable to \n     the storm. An adjustment of the Medicare Wage Index to \n     address the higher cost of providing services after 2005 and \n     2008 hurricanes would provide significant relief and allow \n     these institutions to continue administering critical medical \n     services.\n       Additionally, the hospitals are requesting funding for \n     hazard mitigation and remediation for hardening of facilities \n     and upgrading of generator capabilities. It became apparent \n     during the event that many hospitals could not maintain \n     optimally safe environments with the current capacity of \n     their generator systems. We are also deeply concerned about \n     the lack of generator capacity in our state's nursing homes. \n     Finally, the State of Louisiana is requesting $50 million in \n     SSBG funding to provide for mental health treatment, primary \n     care medical services, and repair of damaged foster homes.\n       These priorities are among the many challenges still facing \n     our state as we recover from Hurricane Gustav and do not \n     represent an exhaustive list of recovery needs, especially as \n     we still assess damages caused by Hurricane Ike. It is with \n     great hope for the future of the people of Louisiana that we \n     request this assistance and also request that it be included \n     in the upcoming stimulus legislation or any other legislative \n     spending vehicle. Lieutenant Governor Mitch Landrieu and \n     Commissioner of Agriculture Mike Strain will be in Washington \n     to discuss these important recovery needs with you and your \n     staff.\n           Sincerely,\n     Governor Bobby Jindal,\n       State of Louisiana.\n     Lt. Governor Mitch Landrieu,\n       State of Louisiana.\n     Commissioner of Agriculture Mike Strain,\n       State of Louisiana.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I have a number of the press accounts, and I will just \nread for the Record the headlines that are pouring into my office each \nday from newspapers around the State. This one:\n\n       Ike badly damages Rita-ruined region. Hurricane Ike's \n     receding storm waters on Monday revealed a footprint of \n     damage across coastal southwest Louisiana too similar and too \n     soon after Hurricane Rita of 2005.\n       Storm report: Vermilion Parish sees tough road ahead.\n\n  Again, a Parish hard hit just 3 years ago.\n\n       Cameron Parish: ``Still too much water.''\n\n  These headlines are streaming into my office.\n\n       St. Mary Parish: Cypremort Point residents digging out of \n     mud.\n       Barataria to pick up pieces.\n       St. John, St. Charles dig out, clean up.\n       16,000 people at Blackham Coliseum--\n  waiting for help and assistance.\n       Gustav, Ike set record for power outages in Louisiana.\n\n  Finally, as my time draws near:\n\n       Storm update: Gustav's damage to Louisiana crops estimated \n     at hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n  I wish to say on behalf of my friend from Texas, we have some \nheadlines we received in Louisiana about Galveston and about the \nbillions in storm damage to our neighbors in Texas, because we have a \nsituation that I hope our Congress will respond to before we leave \nhere, some agricultural damage and storm damage for the Gulf Coast \nStates, and also to reach back and pick up some of that damage we did \nnot address in the Midwest floods.\n  I thank my colleagues for their understanding. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I know the Senator from Michigan is maybe \ndoing so, but as I understand it, there was objection raised to the \nconsideration of a managers' amendment regarding, I guess, 100 \namendments. One of those amendments is a proposal of Senator Shelby and \nI, along with a unanimous vote of our Banking Committee, after lengthy \ndiscussion. It was the Iran sanctions proposal, which took a lot of \nwork and effort to put together.\n  This was a comprehensive package, widely endorsed across the country \nby organizations to give us the kind of leverage necessary for us to \nbring Iran to the negotiating table diplomatically to reduce the threat \nthat their potential nuclear arsenal poses to us, our allies, the State \nof Israel and others.\n  I appreciate the fact that the managers of this bill had included \nthis amendment in their managers' package. It would be a great \ntravesty, in my view, for us to leave here having the other body having \nadopted similar language. This is the one opportunity for this body to \nembrace an economic sanctions proposal which would give us tremendous \nleverage in our efforts to bring Iran to that table.\n  To lose that opportunity would be a serious loss of opportunity for \nthis country. So, again, my dear friend from Virginia was here. \nTherefore, on behalf of those of us on the committee, unanimously, the \nDodd-Shelby Iran sanctions divestment nonproliferation amendment to the \nDOD authorization bill, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding \nany agreement with respect to S. 3001, it be in order for the Senate to \nconsider amendment No. 5572 and that the amendment be considered and \nagreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object, and I will object, I wish \nto advise the Senator that the vote to take place right now is on final \npassage. It has been agreed to by unanimous consent. Prior thereto, the \ndistinguished chairman raised the question of the package to which you \nrefer.\n  I, personally, approved of putting in the amendment. It had been my \nhope, I say it is now no longer my hope, my disappointment, that that \ncould not be achieved along with about 100 other amendments from both \nsides of the aisle.\n  So at this time I have to object and ask the Chair for regular order \nfor the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/17/senate-section/article/S8931-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 3001, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3001) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2009 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military \n     personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid amendment No. 5290, to change the enactment date.\n       Reid amendment No. 5291 (to amendment No. 5290), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I rise today in support of the fiscal \nyear 2009 Defense Authorization Act, a critical piece of legislation \nthat honors the men and women who are so honorably serving in the Armed \nForces and that provides our military with the tools it needs to keep \nour country safe.\n  I am most proud of the investments this legislation makes in our \nmilitary's most important resource--the men and women who serve in \nuniform. Recognizing the strain multiple deployments and difficult \neconomic times has placed on our troops and their families, this bill \nincreases military pay by 3.9 percent.\n  This bill goes further to make sure that we keep our military strong \nat a time when two wars have overstretched and overstressed our troops. \nThe bill allows us to grow our military. By increasing the end strength \nof the Army, Marine Corps, Air National Guard, and Army Reserve, we can \nreduce the stress on our troops caused by multiple and extended \ndeployments. And we can be sure we have the troops we need to meet \nfuture challenges in an ever more uncertain world.\n\n[[Page S8932]]\n\n  This bill continues bonuses and incentives that reward our military \nmen and women and encourage them to continue their service. It provides \nnew incentives to military psychologists and nursing students to \naddress the ongoing shortages in these critical areas. The legislation \nprohibits the Administration's proposed increase in TRICARE fees for \nretirees and reservists.\n  While medical treatment for wounded soldiers has improved \ndramatically over the course of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, too \noften that care is just too hard to access. I believe that managing \npaperwork and scheduling appointments in a timely and efficient manner \nis just as much a part of quality medical care as the treatment \nprovided by medics and surgeons.\n  Last year this Congress acted aggressively to address the red tape \nthat kept our wounded warriors from their doctors and counselors. The \nWounded Warrior Act allowed the Department of Defense to address the \nsubstandard living conditions, poor outpatient care and bureaucratic \nroadblocks faced by injured soldiers at Walter Reed and around the \ncountry.\n  One month ago, I visited a soldier transition unit at Ft. Meade, MD. \nI saw firsthand how hard our wounded warriors are working to recover \nfrom their often devastating injuries. I saw a Department of Defense \nthat has recommitted itself to making sure our wounded warriors and \ntheir families get the care and support they need and deserve. This \nbill requires that the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs \ncontinue the Senior Oversight Committee that oversees implementation of \nwounded warrior initiatives. This high level leadership is critical if \nwe are going to continue to improve the quality of care we provide our \ntroops.\n  Investments in growing the force as well as in providing fair pay and \ngood benefits are smart investments in our military's most valuable \nresource. Our military is only as strong as the skilled and dedicated \nmen and women who serve.\n  Even with all the important provisions in this bill, I think it can \nbe even better. It's been 60 years since President Harry S. Truman \nended racial segregation in the military. In the intervening years, \nmilitary leaders have come to believe that maintaining a highly \nqualified, diverse military--from the enlisted ranks to the four-star \ngenerals and admirals--is essential to the military's ability to \nprovide for our national security. A military that clearly reflects \nequal opportunity for everyone is critical, not only for morale, but \nalso for readiness. Just look at the increasingly diverse enemies we \nconfront and the divergent environments into which we send our troops.\n  But despite future projections of minority growth in the United \nStates, a recent senior-level Department of Defense projection found \nvirtually no prospect for reaching adequate representation of \nminorities or women in the higher military ranks in the next decade. I \nam proud that increasing the racial/ethnic and gender diversity of our \nmilitary leadership has become a strategic priority for the Department \nof Defense. The Department commissioned the Rand Corporation to make \nrecommendations for how it could improve.\n  Issued in 2008, the Rand Corporation's report, titled Planning for \nDiversity, found that the Department of Defense remains ill prepared to \nretain and promote minorities and women to leadership positions. \nSpecifically, the Department is still without a uniform definition of \ndiversity as well as a department-wide plan to guide, support, and \nstreamline diversity efforts. On the heels of the 60th anniversary of \nintegration of the Armed Forces, we can and must do better.\n  I filed an amendment to the fiscal year 2009 Defense Authorization \nAct that would jump start the creation of a strategic plan for \nachieving this departmental priority: ensuring diversity at all levels \nof the military. My amendment would create a high-level task force to \nstudy the current state of diversity at all levels of the Armed Forces \nand make recommendations for improvement. The task force would consist \nof senior members of the Armed Forces as well as individuals with \nexpertise in cultivating and managing diversity in private or non-\nprofit organizations. The task force would develop the first \ndepartment-wide definition of diversity, evaluate existing policies for \nencouraging diversity in and outside the military, and make \nrecommendations for future action for increasing diversity at all \nlevels and in all areas of the military departments.\n  The amendment builds on a provision included in the House Defense \nAuthorization bill and incorporates comments by the Department of \nDefense. The Department stated in formal comments that it ``welcome[s] \nthe assistance that would come from the work proposed by the \nlegislation.''\n  I am grateful to my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus, \nespecially Congressman Elijah E. Cummings, Congresswoman Diane E. \nWatson, Congressman Hank Johnson, and Congressman Kendrick B. Meek who \nhave worked so hard on this issue and on this provision. I am very \ndisappointed today that the amendment could neither receive a vote nor \nbe included in the bill by unanimous agreement. I hope that as the \nmanagers of this bill work to finalize the fiscal year 2009 Defense \nAuthorization Act, they will consider the language I have proposed to \nincrease diversity at all levels of the Armed Forces.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I commend my colleagues Chairman Levin, \nSenator Warner, and all the other members of the Armed Services \nCommittee for their hard work to craft and pass this bill. I look \nforward to casting my vote to support it. I also want to take a moment \nto congratulate Senator Warner for his work on countless other critical \npieces of legislation in years past. I will miss his wise counsel on \nissues of national and regional importance, I will miss his good humor, \nand I will miss his grace. I wish him only the best in retirement.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise today to speak about the 2009 \nDefense authorization bill. I will vote in favor of this legislation \nprimarily because I support pay raises for our troops, but I have some \nvery serious concerns about how this bill came to the floor.\n  This $612.5 billion measure will authorize spending for national \nsecurity programs in the Defense and Energy departments. That includes \n$70 billion to fight the war on terror in Iraq and Afghanistan, and a \n3.9 percent pay raise for military personnel. I proudly support those \nappropriations.\n  In the last year and a half, we have made incredible progress in our \nwar against the terrorists, and in building a sustainable democracy in \nthe heart of the Arab world. Since General Petraeus became the U.S. \nSenior Commander in Iraq. al-Qaida has been swept from its former \nstrongholds in Anbar province and Baghdad. Roadside bomb attacks and \nfatalities in Iraq have fallen by nearly 90 percent. The Iraqis--\nthrough organizations such as ``The Sons of Iraq''--are taking more \nresponsibility for their security.\n  General Petraeus recently left his position as Commanding General in \nIraq to become the Commander of U.S. Central Command. The task of \nleading U.S. forces in Iraq now rests in the capable hands of GEN Ray \nOdierno. I commend General Odierno on his promotion, and on behalf of \nall America, I wish him success in completing the ``surge strategy.''\n  We must resist calls for premature withdrawal from Iraq and maintain \nour presence there until victory is secure. Today's appropriations bill \ngives us the resources to continue that mission. However, the U.S. \nSenate has a long history of allowing members of both the majority and \nthe minority to offer amendments, debate changes, and ensure that the \nconcerns and ideas of every Senator are addressed. Traditionally a \nmajority of Senators will decide an issue after bipartisan \ndeliberation. But in this case, the Senate majority leader decided the \nissue with no input from the minority.\n  The 110th Congress has experienced a record number of cloture votes--\ndue in no small part to the tactics employed by the majority. The \nmethods by which this bill came to the floor are not in the best long-\nterm interests of the Senate. They are not in the best interests of the \nAmerican people. The citizens of our country deserve better.\n  I am glad that our brave service members will have the armaments and \nequipment they need, and that our veterans will have the health care \nand other benefits they deserve.\n\n[[Page S8933]]\n\n  Once again, I will vote for this legislation because the risk to our \nsoldiers and veterans is too great. Time simply ran out. But we should \nall be concerned by the manner in which this bill was presented.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I regret that again this year I must vote \nagainst the National Defense Authorization Act. I support many of the \nprovisions in this bill, which authorizes the activities of the \nDepartment of Defense, including important research, development and \nprocurement funding to improve our Armed Forces and the operations and \nmaintenance funding necessary to ensure the smooth running of the \nmilitary services over the coming year. I support these activities, \nwhich not only benefit those servicemembers currently serving overseas \nin Afghanistan and Iraq, but also help build a strong and effective \nmilitary for the future. I applaud the fine work of Senator Levin and \nSenator Warner and the staff of the Committee on Armed Services for \ntheir efforts in putting together a bill that is, in most ways, a good \npiece of legislation.\n  However, S. 3001 also provides authorization for the funding of \ncontinued operations in Iraq at levels requested by the Bush \nadministration and without any provision to either transition the \nmilitary mission in Iraq or to bring our troops home. In my view, \nproviding this funding without conditions, without strings attached, is \nunacceptable.\n  In my view, the Congress should not continue to write blank checks \nfor the prosecution of this apparently endless war in Iraq. In effect, \nthis bill also provides a congressional authorization to fund the \ncontinuation of President Bush's policy in Iraq into 2009, without any \nstrings attached. Amendments filed that would have limited the mission \nof U.S. forces in Iraq were not even considered during debate on the \nbill. That is truly unfortunate.\n  Continuing to prosecute this war at the current rate is straining our \nmilitary to the breaking point. Many units and individuals are enduring \ntheir third and fourth rotations to Iraq, and because no limits have \nbeen placed on the mission or force levels, there is no end in sight, \ndespite efforts to declare the surge a success in bringing stability to \nIraq. More and more military analysts are warning that the U.S. Armed \nForces are at risk for becoming a ``hollow force,'' as happened after \nthe Vietnam conflict, putting our entire Nation at greater risk.\n  Our military commanders in Afghanistan are urgently requesting \nadditional and substantial numbers of troops to counter the rising \nviolence there, but there are few troops to spare for them. As a \nresult, we risk losing whatever gains have been made there, in the \nactual central front of the war on terror and the hunt for Osama bin \nLaden and the al-Qaida organization. We must win that fight, there, or \nface more attacks like the one that took place today against the U.S. \nembassy in Yemen.\n  I support our troops and I will not let them to lack for anything \nneeded to do their job or to keep them safe. But I cannot countenance \nleaving them in Iraq forever, with no limits placed on their mission \nand no assurances by our commander in Iraq that this war is making the \nUnited States any safer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, all postcloture time \nis yielded back, the pending amendments are withdrawn, and the clerk \nwill read the title of the bill for the third time.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this bill is the 47th consecutive national \ndefense authorization bill that has come out of the committee and been \nbrought to the Senate floor for debate and passage. Every year since \n1961, the Senate has met the challenge, overcome obstacles, and \nnegotiated ourselves to the point of final passage. Because of the \nvital importance of this bill to the men and women of our Armed Forces \nand to the Nation, this was a bill that was worth fighting for for \npassage. It is part of the rich tradition of the Senate. We all can be \nproud of that tradition.\n\n[[Page S8934]]\n\n  It is also part of our custom to thank our staffs and Members. For \nsome this sounds routine, but it never should be.\n  My thanks go to the ranking member, Senator McCain. His leadership \nhelped forge this bill through the committee.\n  I next acknowledge our former chairman particularly, Senator Warner, \nbecause of everything he did to make this bill possible and to get to \nthe point where we are today. Working within arm's reach of John Warner \nfor the past 29 years has truly been one of the highlights, if not the \nhighlight, of my Senate career. He is truly a good friend, not just to \nme and my wife Barbara but also to this institution and to the Nation. \nHe has stood watch over national defense for almost three decades, with \nunwavering dedication. Before that, he stood watch because of his being \nSecretary of the Navy. Because of his being in the Navy, the Marines, \nhe is truly a profile in courage. Next year, we promise we will pick up \nhis banner. We will carry on in his honor, just as he has always done \nfor the Nation.\n\n  I thank our majority leader, Senator Reid, and his floor staff and \ngive them a special word of thanks for giving us the time to get this \nbill to the Senate and through the Senate.\n  To our committee members, thanks for your great work on a bipartisan \nbasis the entire year. This bill could not have gotten to this point, \nwith all of our problems, all the bumps in the road--and there are many \nthat lie ahead--but we could not have gotten to this point without the \nbipartisan support of the Armed Services Committee and our staff.\n  We have one-quarter of the Senate on our committee. We have worked \ntogether in committee, and our differences on this bill did not divide \nus, as we reported the bill by unanimous vote.\n  To Charlie Armstrong in the Office of the Senate Legislative Counsel, \nthank you for drafting about 300 amendments. We wish more of them could \nhave been adopted, but, nonetheless, they had to be drafted, and we had \nto do what we do, which is to do everything we can to get Members' \namendments passed.\n  To our committee staff members, thank you. That is about all we can \nsay. You have earned our thanks and the recognition of the Senate for \nthe time and dedication you have shown on this legislation. Rick \nDeBobes, who is our staff director, and Mike Kostiw, who is our \nRepublican staff director, and their talented staffs worked amazingly \nhard.\n  We have a lot of work ahead of us to get to the point where we can \npass a bill in the next couple of weeks. We have a huge amount of work. \nI hate to tell them that, but they know it. They also know, I hope, how \nappreciated they are. They work 24/7, and they work magic, and they \nalways seem to believe that sleep is overrated. It is not. I hope they \ncan get some in the next few days. So thank you to our staff. They \ndeserve tremendous recognition for their professionalism.

Mr. President, since I took office last year, I have held \nmore than 115 roundtables in nearly all of Ohio's 88 counties--from \nAshtabula to Cincinnati, from Bryan the Gallipolis--as I bring together \n15 or 20 people from a community and listen to them talk about their \nhopes and their dreams and what we can do together to make Ohio a \nbetter place and to move this country\n\n[[Page S8935]]\n\nforward. But more than anything else, as I listen to people in \ncommunities such as Bucyrus and Mansfield and Wauseon, I hear about \nwidespread economic anxiety and a betrayed middle class.\n  Ohioans have understood that for years, especially in the first 6 \nyears of the Bush administration, this government allowed the drug \ncompanies to write the Medicare laws, allowed the oil industry to \ndictate energy policy, had allowed Wall Street to push through job-\nkilling trade agreements through the House and the Senate.\n  They feel the middle class was betrayed by our Government. I hear \nfrom Ohioans worried about record high gas prices, worried about food \nprices, worried about good-paying jobs continuing to move overseas, \nworried about health insurance that costs more and covers less.\n  Some of these worries can be blamed in part on our current recession, \nbut that misses the larger point. For the last 7 years, the labor force \nworkers have worked harder and harder, leading to huge gains in \nproductivity. The productivity of workers in our economy has gone up \nlike this. Yet CEOs' salaries and bonuses went through the roof while \nmiddle class Americans' wages stagnated and more families slipped below \nthe poverty line. Again, productivity has gone up like this, meaning \nworkers are creating more wealth for their employers, but wages have \nbeen stagnant for 80 or 90 percent of the workforce.\n  In other words, as workers have produced more, as workers have been \nmore productive, as workers have made more money for their bosses, if \nyou will, they simply have not shared in the wealth they created. They \nare not getting raises. They are paying more for health insurance, they \nare seeing their pensions begin to disintegrate, as they are making \nmore and more money for their employer.\n  At the same time, while China manipulated its currency and ignored \nlabor and environmental standards, corporations took the bait and \nabandoned American communities. While hedge fund managers irresponsibly \nleveraged real estate holdings, millions of Americans lost their homes \nto foreclosures. In other words, while Wall Street enjoyed an inflated \nstock market and a so-called economic expansion, most Americans \nactually became worse off.\n  In the last few weeks, we know things have gotten worse. The \nGovernment has been forced to seize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Lehman \nBrothers, an institution on Wall Street for 150 years, filed for \nbankruptcy on Monday. It is also reported that for the 8th straight \nmonth, our Nation has lost jobs. The national unemployment rate is now \n6.1 percent--a 5-year high. We know what happened to AIG today.\n  Mr. President, 9.4 million Americans are officially unemployed, 2.2 \nmillion more than a year ago--tens of thousands in my State of Ohio. In \nfact, you have to go back more than 15 years, to December 1992, to find \na time when more Americans were forced to rely on the Government for \ntheir income.\n  In my State of Ohio, middle class workers are facing even more bad \nnews. DHL, the cargo express carrier, has announced that more than \n8,000 workers at Wilmington Air Park, the largest privately owned \nairport in the United States, will lose their jobs. Norwalk Furniture \nhalted operations earlier this month, sending 500 employees home. \nGeneral Motors is closing its plant in Moraine, a decision that will \ncost 1,200 Ohioans their livelihoods.\n  Do you know what. The worst part is this: The administration is proud \nof this record. They are proud of the free trade agreements that have \nprotected corporate interests, that have eliminated good-paying \nmanufacturing jobs, that have brought unsafe food, drugs, and toys into \nAmerican homes. They are proud of these free trade agreements, and they \nwant more of them.\n  They are proud of the tax cuts that went overwhelmingly to the \nwealthy and ignored the plight of the middle class. We know what that \nhas meant. It has meant budget deficits as far as the eye can see. It \nhas meant more money for the wealthiest people in this society, paid \nfor by the middle class, and paid for by our children and our \ngrandchildren of the future. Yet they are proud of these tax cuts that \ngo overwhelmingly to the rich. The administration is proud of the \nfinancial deregulation that allowed greed on Wall Street to run amok.\n  These days, Republicans respond to critics by saying: Things aren't \nso bad. John McCain, our colleague from Arizona, said: The foundations \nof the economy are strong. Former Senator Phil Gramm, the mentor of \nSenator McCain, the chief economic adviser to Senator McCain, said: The \nrecession is in our heads. It is a mental recession, he said.\n  I guess if you think things are going well, you advocate for more of \nthe same, which is why Republicans continue to push for more tax cuts \nfor corporations that outsource jobs overseas, pushing more energy \npolicies that enrich oil companies and reinforce our dependence on \nforeign oil, pushing for more subsidies for private HMOs participating \nin Medicare, pushing more antiunion policies that undercut workers' \npower to bargain collectively and join the middle class, pushing for \nmore hypocrisy that says we can afford to spend $10 billion a month in \nIraq; we just cannot find the money to help uninsured children in \nColumbus or Zanesville or Dayton or Chillicothe or Springfield or \nXenia.\n  In fact, since we had our last vote, about an hour ago, we have spent \nsome $19 million on the war in Iraq. In the last hour, we have spent \nabout $19 million on the war in Iraq. Think what that could do for \nhealth care, for education, for rebuilding our infrastructure in Lima \nand in Portsmouth and in Chillicothe. Perhaps most troubling of all, \nRepublicans are still, unbelievably enough, pushing for the \nprivatization of Social Security. Can my colleagues imagine--Senator \nSanders and I were talking about this a moment ago--if 3 years ago, \nwhen George Bush, Dick Cheney, and John McCain were fighting to \nprivatize Social Security, and people in this institution, including \nLeader Reid and Senator Sanders, when he was in the House of \nRepresentatives, and many of us fought against that privatization of \nSocial Security--can my colleagues imagine if that had passed in early \n2005? If the President and Senator McCain had had their way on the \nprivatization of Social Security, can my colleagues imagine what this \nweek would look like? Can my colleagues imagine, if 50 million retired \nAmericans had had their entire life savings locked up in the stock \nmarket--can my colleagues imagine 50 million Americans opening their \nSocial Security records, their mailing they get from Social Security \nand looking at what happened to their private accounts; money they had \nput in the stock market because George Bush and John McCain insisted on \nthis risky scheme to privatize Social Security? Can my colleagues \nimagine what that would do to seniors in our society? Can my colleagues \nimagine what that would do to their future--if you are 65 and already \non Social Security, if you are 50 and your mother is on Social \nSecurity, if you are about to join the ranks of Social Security? Can my \ncolleagues imagine what one would think with food prices going up, with \ngas prices going up and all of a sudden, because you have these John \nMcCain-George Bush privatized Social Security accounts, can my \ncolleagues imagine what would be happening to their lives this week and \nthe weeks ahead?\n\n  Despite 7 years of this tired thinking and of the wrong-headed \neconomic policies that betray our middle class, American workers are \nstanding strong and continuing to fight for a better future.\n  At my roundtables--as I mentioned, I have done some 1,500 roundtables \nin most of Ohio's 88 counties, in Cambridge and in Steubenville and in \nDefiance and in Miami County, all over--I still hear the hope and \ndetermination that defines this great Nation. I hear from community \nleaders. I hear from entrepreneurs with exciting plans for the future. \nWhat is happening with the incubator in Youngstown? What is happening \nwith small business in Delaware? I hear about what people in Mansfield, \nmy hometown, are doing to fight back. I hear from small business owners \nwho are continuing to do the right thing. I hear from their loyal \nworkers who take pride in their work and are valued by their employers. \nThey tell us we need a government that similarly values loyalty and \nwork ethic.\n\n[[Page S8936]]\n\n  For too long, those in power have simply turned their back on \nAmerican workers. They have ignored their needs and their dreams--the \ndreams of the middle class. They have instead catered to the wealthiest \nAmericans. We know that a strong middle class builds a prosperous \nsociety and is the engine that makes this country go. But it doesn't \nhave to be the way we have seen in the last few years where this \nGovernment in Washington--that allowed the drug companies to write the \nMedicare law; that allowed the oil industry to write energy policy; \nthat allows Wall Street to push through job-killing trade agreements--\nall of this betrayal of the middle class from George Bush to Dick \nCheney to John McCain, to far too many of my colleagues in this body \nand down the hall in the House of Representatives--people have had \nenough of this betrayal of the middle class. It doesn't have to be that \nway. The sooner we change direction, the sooner our economic woes will \nbe behind us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me begin by concurring with Senator \nBrown. He raised a very important issue, and that is: In the midst of a \nmajor economic crisis, when people today--especially senior citizens on \nfixed incomes--are wondering about how they are going to heat their \nhomes, how they are going to purchase the food they need--I wonder \nabout 3 years ago, had we listened to President Bush, if we had \nlistened to John McCain, if we had listened to the Republican \nleadership and we had privatized Social Security--can one begin to \nimagine the anxiety that would be existing all over this country in \nterms of senior citizens wondering what kind of retirement they would \nhave, what kind of funding would be there for their remaining years? So \nthank goodness we did not follow the advice of President Bush and John \nMcCain and the Republican leadership; thank goodness we kept Social \nSecurity strong.\n  Yesterday I came to the floor to discuss the interconnection of the \ntwo great crises that are currently facing our country. The first, of \ncourse, is the financial crisis--the collapse of major Wall Street \nfirms--and secondly is the very serious problem of high and volatile \nenergy prices, whether it is $3.70 for a gallon of gas to put in your \ncar, or whether it is very high oil prices this coming winter to heat \nyour home. Both of these problems clearly are having a major impact on \nmiddle-income families from one end of this country to the other.\n  In terms of the financial crisis, the American people are finding it \nharder and harder to get a mortgage or a home equity line of credit. \nThey are seeing the equity in their homes going down, and they are \nseeing the values of their savings, including their 401(k) savings, \nplummeting. What anxiety is existing all over this country. People have \nput money into their 401(k), the stock market is going down rapidly, \nand people are wondering what is going to take place for their economic \nfuture.\n  In terms of the energy crisis, the American people have been forced \nto pay tens of billions of dollars more in inflated energy prices \nbecause of the outrageous price levels caused by speculation occurring \nin unregulated energy markets. We have heard testimony from energy \neconomists who are telling us that between 25 percent to 50 percent of \nthe cost of a barrel of oil today has nothing to do with supply and \ndemand, it has nothing to do with marketplace fundamentals; it has to \ndo with speculation on the part of financial institutions that are \ndriving oil prices higher, and now, by the way, with that money coming \nout of oil futures, driving prices down, creating a lot of volatility.\n  I laid out yesterday the connection between those two crises. Both of \nthese crises are tied to the same extreme economic ideology--an \nideology which says the Government should play no role--or a minimum \nrole--in protecting consumers; that we should put all of our trust in \nthe honesty and the integrity of the heads of large multinational \ncorporations.\n  I should mention that both of these crises are also tied to the work \nof one former Member of the U.S. Senate, and that is the former \nchairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Phil Gramm of Texas. To a \nsignificant degree, a lot of what we are experiencing today is related \nto the disastrous changes to Federal law that deregulated both the \nenergy industry and the financial industry, and that effort was led by \nformer Senator Gramm.\n  To recap, as chairman of the Senate Banking Committee in 1999, then-\nSenator Phil Gramm, spearheaded legislation that bears his name, and \nthat is the so-called Gramm-Leach-Bliley bill that broke down critical \nregulatory safeguards that the Government put in place after the Great \nDepression to prevent exactly what we are experiencing today. Having \nlaid the groundwork for our crisis in the financial sector, the very \nnext year, amazingly enough, Senator Gramm is credited with slipping \nlegislation into a largely unrelated bill that deregulated the \nelectronic energy market. Shockingly, when he slipped this measure into \nthe law, a measure we now know as the Enron loophole, Senator Gramm's \nwife, Wendy Gramm, had recently been on the board of directors of--you \nguessed it--the Enron Corporation.\n  This deregulation of the energy markets has allowed speculators to \ndrive up the price of a barrel of oil to as high as $147 and, as I \nmentioned earlier, there are many economists who believe the volatility \nand the high price of oil today is not supply and demand primarily, but \nit is because of speculation on the part of financial institutions and \nhedge funds.\n  Now, as bad as things were yesterday, last night they got even worse. \nLast night, the Bush administration nationalized the world's largest \ninsurance company: AIG. The Bush administration claimed it had to put \n$85 billion of taxpayer money at risk because AIG's collapse would have \nbrought down perhaps our entire economy--the entire economy of this \ncountry--and had a major impact on the entire world's economy. Let me \nask the same question about AIG today that I asked yesterday about the \nenergy and financial crises this country is facing, and that is: Is \nthis bad luck? Why is this happening? We need to understand that, \nbecause the risks are enormous and the amount of money we are dealing \nwith--trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars--is literally \nbeyond comprehension. I think very few people can understand the scope \nand the magnitude of what we are dealing with.\n\n  Well, it turns out the AIG situation is closely tied to the same \nrightwing economic ideology that has been pushing us toward economic \ndisaster, and the responsibility for AIG's near collapse lies, again, \nwith that same philosophy which has been led by former Senator Phil \nGramm.\n  As a very recent online article from Time magazine explains, AIG's \ntraditional insurance business seems to be doing well in what they have \nbeen doing for many years. They are, in fact, making money. But what \nAIG got involved in was more than the traditional insurance business. \nThey got involved in risky derivative schemes that about three people \nin the world understand called credit default swaps, or CDS's that \nallow big companies to guarantee each other's risky lending practices. \nThis is extremely complicated stuff--a long way away from where we were \n10 or 15 years ago.\n  Now in order to give the American people a full understanding of the \nrisks posed by these unregulated credit default swaps--unregulated \ncredit default swaps--I wish to read a short September 15 article by \nProfessor Peter Cohen, a graduate of the Wharton School, that deals \nwith the full scope of the problem we face and the role that Senator \nGramm had in its creation. I apologize to anybody who is listening. \nWhat is following is technical, it is a bit boring, but when we are \ndealing with trillions of dollars, I think it is important that we try \nto understand this. This is what Professor Cohen writes:\n\n       Lurking in the background of this weekend's collapse of two \n     of Wall Street's biggest names is a $62 trillion segment of \n     the $450 trillion market for derivatives that grew huge \n     thanks to John McCain's chief economic advisor, Phil \n     ``Americans are Whiners'' Gramm.\n\n\n[[Page S8937]]\n\n\n  Let me just go through these numbers again, because these numbers are \nso huge. When the Presiding Officer and I represent our State, we fight \nfor a few million dollars here and a few million dollars there, and \nthat makes a lot of difference to the people of Colorado or the people \nof Vermont. What we are dealing with is so incomprehensible: It is a \n$62 trillion segment of the $450 trillion market for derivatives. Who \ncan even understand what that means? A $450 trillion market, what does \nthat mean?\n  Now, all of this occurred, all of this deregulated activity, of which \nthe Government plays no role, took place because in December of 2000, \nSenator Gramm snuck in--snuck in--a 262-page amendment. That is what \ngoes on around here. We can sneak in 262-page amendments to a \ngovernment reauthorization bill that created what is now the $62 \ntrillion market for credit default swaps, or CDS's.\n  Continuing to quote:\n\n       I realize it is painful to read about yet another Wall \n     Street acronym, but this is important because it will help us \n     understand why the global financial markets are collapsing. \n     CDSs are like insurance policies for bondholders. In exchange \n     for a premium, the bondholders get insurance in case the \n     bondholder can't pay. . . . In the case of the 1.4 trillion \ndollars' worth of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds, the Government's \nnationalization last Sunday triggered the CDSs on those bonds. The \npeople who received the CDS premiums are now obligated to deliver those \nbonds to the ones who paid the premiums.\n\n  Professor Cohen continues:\n\n       Gramm's 262-page amendment, dubbed ``The Commodity Futures \n     Modernization Act''--\n\n  We have heard that term--\n\n       ``The Commodity Futures Modernization Act,'' according to \n     the Texas Observer, freed financial institutions from \n     oversight of their CDS transactions.\n\n  That is the important thing, they became deregulated. The Government \nno longer was able to see what was going on.\n\n       ``Prior to its passage, they say, banks underwrote \n     mortgages and were responsible for the risks involved.''\n\n  You went to a bank, you got a mortgage, the bank took responsibility, \nthey lost money, they made money, that was the transaction.\n\n       ``Now, through the use of CDSs--which in theory insure the \n     banks against bad debts--those risks are passed along to \n     insurance companies and other investors,'' wrote the Texas \n     Observer.\n\n  Still, in Professor Cohen's article:\n\n       How does this relate to Lehman's bankruptcy? ``CDSs were a \n     key factor in encouraging lenders to feel they could make \n     loans without knowing the risks or whether the loan would be \n     paid back.''\n\n  When you and I were younger, Mr. President, banks knew the people to \nwhom they made loans. They didn't give a loan to somebody they knew \nwould not be able to pay it back. But that is no longer the case.\n\n       ``The Commodity Futures Modernization Act freed them of \n     Federal oversight . . . '' And it was due to these CDSs that \n     Wall Street held an emergency session yesterday to try to \n     minimize the damage of Lehman's CDSs and other derivatives. \n     Unfortunately, the session did not produce much, thanks to \n     the built-in lack of knowledge of the risks in these \n     transactions that Gramm's legislation ensured. You are going \n     to be reading more and more about CDSs over the months ahead.\n\n  Professor Cohen continues:\n\n       It will become as familiar as the phrase subprime \n     mortgage--\n\n  Which, unfortunately, many of us now are familiar with--\n\n     was in the year 2007. Unfortunately--\n\n  Get this, this is quite amazing--\n\n     there were ``only'' $1.3 trillion worth of subprime mortgages \n     and the CDS market is 48 times bigger than that.\n\n  Forty-eight times bigger than the subprime market--\n\n     and more than four times bigger than the U.S. GDP. And since \n     nobody has ever had to deal with this volume of CDS \n     unwindings, it is impossible to calculate how much they will \n     cost.\n\n  In other words, what has happened as a result of Senator Gramm's \nlegislation is, unbelievable amounts of money have been traded, \naccumulated without anybody really knowing what is going on. Now we are \nleft trying to pick up the remains of those problems.\n  Professor Cohen's article is compelling because it tells us how huge \nthis crisis is and why we have every reason to fear that AIG may well \nbe just the first of many companies involved in risky investments that \nthe American people will have to bail out.\n  The time for hand wringing is over. This Congress needs to put an end \nto the radical deregulation that was pushed by Senator Phil Gramm and \nmany other Republicans, and there were Democrats who went along with \nthat as well. We need to put the safety walls back up in the financial \nservices sector. We need to regulate the electronic energy markets. We \nneed to end the use of unregulated credit default swaps. In other \nwords, what we need to do once again is have the U.S. Government play \nan important role in protecting the people of this country against the \ngreed of large corporate interests.\n  Unfortunately, the response from the administration and Wall Street \nis not to do that but to push for further consolidation in the \nfinancial services sector. Here is just an amazing thing. The argument \nwe are hearing over and over again is that AIG was too big to fail, and \nwhat we are now creating are institutions that are even larger than \nAIG. And 10 years from now, when these institutions are threatened with \ncollapse, there will be people coming up saying: Oh my goodness, we \ncan't allow those to fail; we have to bail those out as well.\n  This country can no longer afford companies that are too big to fail. \nIf a company is so large that its failure would cause systemic harm to \nour economy, if it is too big to fail, then it is too big to exist. If \nit is too big to fail, it is too big to exist. We need, as a Congress, \nto assess which companies fall in this category. Bank of America is \ncertainly one of them. Those companies need to be broken apart. We \ncannot have companies so huge that if they go under they take the world \neconomy with them.\n  Then once we break them up, if a company wants to act in a risky \nmanner, if they want to take risks in order to make some quick bucks, \nthat is OK. If they want to take the risk and they want to lose money, \nthat is OK. The American people should not have to, and would not be \nunder those circumstances, be left to pick up the pieces.\n  Finally, in terms of dealing with this unfolding disaster, we need to \nmake sure working Americans, the middle class, do not foot the bill. If \nthe economic calamity requires a Federal bailout, it should be paid for \nby those people who actually benefited from the reckless behavior of \npeople empowered by the extreme economic views of Senator Gramm, \nPresident Bush, Senator McCain, and many others.\n  In other words, the point I am making is that in the last 10 years, \nmany of these people have made billions and billions of dollars. It is \nunfair to simply ask the middle-class working families who are trying \nto figure out how they are going to pay their fuel bills, how they are \ngoing to send their kids to college, to bail out these large \ninstitutions from which many people made huge amounts of profits.\n  We don't talk about this too often, but today the wealthiest one-\ntenth of 1 percent earns more income than the bottom 50 percent. The \ntop 1 percent owns more wealth than the bottom 90 percent. And the \nwealthiest 400 Americans in this country have not only seen their \nincomes double, their net worth has increased by $640 billion since \nGeorge W. Bush has been in office.\n  Can you believe that? Four hundred families, four hundred people, \nless than the Congress, have seen a $640 billion increase in their \nwealth since President Bush has been in office. And, amazingly, these \n400 families are now worth over $1.5 trillion--400 families. On \naverage, they earn over $214 million a year.\n  As a result of President Bush's policies, amazingly enough, their tax \nrates have been cut almost in half to only 18 percent on average. \nAmazingly, the wealthiest 400 Americans pay a lower tax rate than most \npolice officers, teachers, firefighters, and nurses. So if you are one \nof the very wealthiest people in this country, if you are earning $214 \nmillion a year on average, you pay a lower tax rate than somebody who \nis a police officer, a teacher, a firefighter, or a nurse.\n  That may make sense to somebody; it does not make sense to me. What \ndoes it say about us as a nation when\n\n[[Page S8938]]\n\nthe middle class pays a greater percentage of their income in taxes \nthan the wealthiest 400 Americans?\n  It is this very small segment of our population that has made out \nlike bandits--frankly, some of them are bandits--during the Bush \nadministration. We have to recognize that when we talk about who is \ngoing to pay for the bailouts.\n  In my view, we need an emergency surtax on those at the very top in \norder to pay for any losses the Federal Government suffers as a result \nof efforts to shore up the economy. It should not be hard-working \npeople who are trying to figure out how they are going to keep their \nfamilies economically above water, people who are working longer hours \nfor lower wages, people who have lost their health care, people who \ncannot afford to pay their fuel bills this winter. Those are not the \n     people who should be asked to pay for this bailout. If \n     there is a bailout that has to be paid for, it should be \n     the people, the segment of society that has benefited from \n     Bush's economic and tax policies over the last 8 years.\n  Before I complete my remarks, I would like to step back for a minute \nand examine this current crisis in the context of whom our Government \nrepresents.\n  What does it say about an administration that is prepared to put $85 \nbillion at risk to bail out AIG but fights tooth and nail against \ndealing with the economic crises facing working families in this \ncountry? Mr. President, $85 billion at risk for AIG, some $30 billion \nfor Bear Stearns, perhaps trillions for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. For \nthose folks there seems to be an endless supply of money. Don't the \nAmerican people deserve a Government that views their economic needs as \nbeing as important as the health of large corporations and Wall Street \nexecutives?\n  Since President Bush has been in office, nearly 6 million Americans \nhave slipped out of the middle class and into poverty. What was the \nadministration's response? Was there a bailout for those people who \nlost good-paying jobs and are now working for significantly lower \nwages? Did President Bush come and say we have to protect those kids in \na society which has the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major \ncountry? Are we going to bail out those families? I didn't hear that \nfrom the White House.\n  Over 7 million Americans have lost their health insurance. More than \n4 million Americans have lost their pensions. Over 3 million \nmanufacturing jobs have been lost. Total consumer debt has more than \ndoubled since President Bush has been in office. Median income for \nworking-age Americans has gone down by over $2,000 after inflation. \nWhere has the Bush administration been in bailing out those families? \nWhere has the Bush administration been in saying we are going to \nprovide health care to all Americans? I didn't hear them come forward.\n  But when it is AIG, when it is Bear Stearns, my goodness, how quickly \nthey respond. If you are a CEO of a large insurance company, they are \nthere for you. But if you are a working mother whose kid does not have \nany health insurance: I am sorry, we can't afford to take care of you.\n  I can go on and on about the priorities established by this \nadministration. The American people should know this President wanted \nto cut emergency food assistance for nearly a half million seniors, \nmothers, and children. He wanted to cut job training for 161,000 people \nand cut childcare assistance for 200,000 children. There is not enough \nmoney to take care of those people. I guess they don't make a whole lot \nof campaign contributions.\n  The President wanted to raise fees on veterans getting health care, \nwhich we, of course, stopped. He fought giving 3 million children \naccess to health care. He wanted to cut $1 billion from rural housing \nwhen we have a major housing crisis in rural America.\n  No money for children who don't have any health insurance, no money \nfor people living in dilapidated housing, no money available for \nveterans health care. We can't do that. But if you are AIG, if you are \na large corporation, this Government is there for you.\n  These people, working families, seniors, veterans, the unemployed--\ntheir problems do not warrant, apparently, an urgent response from the \nPresident. But big insurance companies, big investment houses, \ncompanies that get engaged in risky subprime lending and credit swaps, \nmy, my, how quickly we respond to them.\n  The American people deserve better. We need to reject the failed \neconomic policies and priorities of George W. Bush and John McCain. \nAmericans need a Government that is not going to let the rich and large \ncorporations loop our economy. Americans need a Government that will \nput regulatory firewalls back up in the financial sector and end the \nuse of unregulated credit swaps. Americans need a Government that is \ngoing to prevent speculators from robbing them at the gas \npump. Americans need a government that breaks up companies that are too \nbig to fail. Americans need a government that is going to view their \nproblems as seriously as they view the problems of corporate America. \nOur job is to give the American people that kind of government.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/17/senate-section/article/S8938-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              PHILIP CLAPP\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Mr. President, the debate over the legal drinking age \nhas continued for decades.\n  As a physician and surgeon, I have repeatedly dealt firsthand with \nthe traumatic results of underage drinking.\n  Recently, a number of college presidents from across the country \nsigned a public statement petitioning that the current legal drinking \nage be lowered to age 18.\n  I believe changing this law would pose a danger to our youth and \ncommunities.\n  Wyoming's First Lady, Nancy Freudenthal, wrote an important editorial \naddressing drinking on college campuses. It was printed in the Wyoming \nTribune Eagle and the Casper Star Tribune. I believe Mrs. Freudenthal \npresents a compelling argument for keeping the minimum drinking age at \n21.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the editorial to which I referred \nprinted in the Record. There being no objection, the material was \nordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n              Lowering the Drinking Age Is Not a Good Idea\n\n                         (By Nancy Freudenthal)\n\n       When the leaders of our nation's institutions of higher \n     learning have something to say, we naturally assume that it \n     will be well-reasoned, responsible and grounded in factual \n     evidence. That is why it was disappointing to see more than \n     100 college presidents and chancellors have signed on to what \n     is now being called the Amethyst Initiative, which seeks to \n     lower the legal drinking age from 21 to 18 because, as its \n     proponents claim, ``Twenty-one is not working.''\n       I am very pleased the University of Wyoming has not signed \n     on to this initiative, and in fact is addressing drinking on \n     campus on many fronts, including ``education, training, \n     enforcement and changing the environment around alcohol \n     use,'' according to Dean of Students Dave Cozzens.\n       By viewing this issue through the narrow lens of alcohol-\n     related problems on campus, these college presidents are \n     ignoring the broader societal implications of throwing in the \n     towel on the health and well-being of our young people.\n       The Amethyst Initiative's solution for reducing binge \n     drinking and preventing underage drinking is to make alcohol \n     more readily available to young people, which will only\n\n[[Page S8939]]\n\n     exacerbate the public health concern of underage drinking.\n       We believe that such an approach is irresponsible and would \n     lead to more of the tragic consequences associated with \n     underage alcohol use documented in the U.S. Surgeon General's \n     2007 Call to Action to Prevent and Reduce Underage Drinking.\n       Teen deaths and injuries, traffic accidents, physical \n     assaults and other violent acts, risky sexual behavior, and \n     school failure, among other potentially lifelong \n     consequences, would increase as a result.\n       Lowering the drinking age also runs counter to scientific \n     research that shows underage drinking can affect brain \n     development, which we now know continues into the mid-to late \n     twenties. Scientific evidence further shows that underage \n     drinking is related to future alcohol dependence and other \n     substance abuse.\n       Approximately 96 percent of alcohol-dependent adults \n     started drinking before the age of 21.\n       For the past 20 plus years, so many have worked tirelessly \n     and diligently to keep our youth and our communities safe and \n     healthy by reducing the prevalence of alcohol use among those \n     under 21, with the current legal drinking age limit a large \n     part of our success.\n       Although we are under no illusion that problems persist, we \n     must continue to confront them head on, vigilantly and \n     responsibly, and resist easy efforts to turn back the clock \n     and undo years of steady progress.\n       Seventy-eight percent of Americans oppose lowering the \n     drinking age from 21 to 18, so the public gets the message.\n       We recognize that colleges have a tremendous problem with \n     binge drinking.\n       Young people are drinking more aggressively than ever \n     before. The solution is really about changing the culture of \n     alcohol consumption. In many respects, we have achieved this \n     change in culture for youth tobacco use. We must now change \n     the culture as it relates to underage drinking.\n       The bottom line is children who are connected to family, \n     community and society are less prone to drink alcohol.\n       It's just a shame that some college administrators didn't \n     do their homework, and our children are the ones who would \n     pay the price.\n       When children drink, America loses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/17/senate-section/article/S8939-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8939-S8940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering over 1,000, are heartbreaking \nand touching. To respect their efforts, I am submitting every e-mail \nsent to me through the e-mail address set up for this purpose to the \nCongressional Record. This is not an issue that will be easily \nresolved, but it is one that deserves immediate and serious attention, \nand Idahoans deserve to be heard. Their stories not only detail their \nstruggles to meet everyday expenses, but also have suggestions and \nrecommendations as to what Congress can do now to tackle this problem \nand find solutions that last beyond today. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave today's letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The increased energy costs have had a profound effect on my \n     ability to meet the needs of myself and my family. My oldest \n     son broke his leg in June 2007. It was a life-threatening \n     break, he is not healing properly and will continue to be \n     unable to work for another six months at a minimum. The \n     family was evicted from their home and are struggling to \n     survive. They receive food stamps and medical assistance, but \n     nothing else. Fortunately I have a trailer house, which they \n     were able to move in to. I currently pay their electricity \n     and transportation to and from medical appointments, getting \n     groceries, etc. not to mention extracurricular activities for \n     the children, as well as my own utilities and gasoline. I \n     have paid nearly $500 per month during the winter months for \n     our electricity and am still paying over $300 each month. My \n     job requires me to travel daily, and I average 500 miles per \n     week in mileage. With the excessive costs of gasoline and \n     electricity, I am currently working 45-50 hours each week and \n     still falling behind on my bills. I do not have credit card \n     debt, but have a student loan I cannot pay and one other \n     small loan. My only other debts consist of a house payment, \n     car payment, and property taxes. I am at risk of losing my \n     house in a year because I cannot pay the taxes. My ex-husband \n     is threatening to take the property away because I cannot \n     afford to pay him $100 per month to finish buying him out. I \n     will be 51 this month and am not in the best of health--but I \n     do what I have to in order to provide for myself and my \n     family. I take medication but am not able to get my \n     prescription filled because I owe the doctor $44 and he will \n     not call in a new script until he is paid. That payment to \n     the doctor is one tank of gas--that is all--and I could die, \n     or worse have a stroke, without my medication. Something \n     needs to change, and soon.\n     Barbara, South Central Idaho. \n                                  ____\n\n       I received your email asking for Idahoans' stories related \n     to the increase in gas prices, and I appreciate that these \n     prices are affecting everyone and that you are working to \n     fight them. Further, I support that you fought the Warner-\n     Lieberman bill, though probably not for the reasons that you \n     did. However, I am writing to ask that you do, in fact, \n     seriously consider Representative Ed Markey's new bill, \n     ``Investing in Climate Action Policy Act.'' While I admit \n     that I am unsure of the impact that this bill will have on \n     gas prices, I seriously believe that we must begin to enact \n     bills that combat climate change. Being from Idaho, I am sure \n     that we both appreciate the outdoors and how beautiful places \n     like the Sawtooths and the Frank Church Wilderness are. \n     However, I feel that the beauty that we are currently able to \n     find here is threatened by global warming, and I entreat you \n     to do something about it. Representative Markey's bill is a \n     good start.\n       You asked about the priorities that Congress should set in \n     resolving the oil crisis, with ``increasing domestic oil \n     production'' at the top of your list. However, I do not \n     believe that this is a reasonable option. The U.S. hit peak \n     oil years ago, there simply is not that much more to get out \n     of here. Also, when you think of domestic oil, please think \n     of ANWR. Imagine if, instead of in ANWR, oil was found in the \n     Sawtooths. Could you really, in good faith, support taking \n     oil out of the Sawtooths?\n       Instead, I believe that one of the options you suggested is \n     by far the best. There should be incentives for conservation \n     of oil. Ultimately, the incentive will be more money in your \n     pocket, because quite honestly, I believe the oil prices will \n     keep going up until it becomes too expensive for people to \n     use so freely and they begin to conserve it in order to save \n     money. However, a good short term idea would be to set up \n     incentives and to invest in alternative fuels. Ultimately, we \n     will run out of oil and I only hope that when that time comes \n     we are prepared for it, and prepared to switch entirely to \n     renewable energy sources.\n       Thank you for your time.\n           Sincerely,\n     Samantha, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am married, with three young kids, ages 9, 7, and 5. I am \n     a detective for the Ada County Sheriff's Office, and I make \n     just over $60,000 a year. My wife works part-time out of our \n     house as a Pampered Chef consultant, and probably makes about \n     $10-15,000 per year, after taxes and deductions.\n       We have a strict cash budget, and have no debt except for \n     our house. We own a 7-year-old Dodge Durango, and a 14-year-\n     old Chevy Camaro, both gas guzzlers. We are actually in a \n     pretty good financial position, and are blessed.\n       We currently budget $100 every two weeks for fuel. This \n     increased from about $60 recently. Part of the increase was \n     because we sold our Toyota Corolla (good gas mileage), and \n     got our Camaro (not so good). However, I would blame most of \n     the increase on the rising gas prices. (We sold the Corolla \n     because it was our last debt that we wanted to pay off, and \n     start over debt free.)\n       We are able to survive on this $100 because we have reduced \n     our driving dramatically. We put a lot more thought into our \n     daily errands, etc. We have been riding our bicycles as much \n     as possible, but only for short distances because of our \n     young kids.\n       Unfortunately, all of this ``thinking'' about our driving \n     limits our freedom. I have not felt this limited by fuel \n     costs since I was in high school, and barely had a couple \n     bucks to put in my gas tank. This past weekend I took my boys \n     camping. I wanted to go to a favorite place I went to as a \n     kid, but it is four hours away. Because of gas prices, I was \n     not able to do that, and settled on CJ Strike Reservoir, \n     which must be similar to ANWR, a mosquito paradise, so we \n     left a day early after my son got bit 31 times.\n       We regular citizens are frustrated at the lack of action by \n     our Congress. I am not an economist, but I believe the very \n     statement by our government that we are going to begin using \n     our own natural resources for energy, would potentially \n     reduce gas prices. I realize that the liberals in Congress \n     are the problem. In Idaho, we are blessed by some pretty good \n     representatives.\n       I appreciate all you can do for our families.\n       Take care, and God Bless.\n     Matt, Meridian. \n                                  ____\n\n       You have got to be kidding!! Only $50 more per month? My \n     fuel bills have doubled in the last year and you only think \n     they have gone up $50? What world are you living in? The fact \n     of the matter is, for a farmer in Idaho, our fuel bills have \n     nearly doubled. My fuel bill to deliver my fish has gone from \n     $800 per week to over $1500 per week.\n       To answer your question, I believe the CEO from Shell when \n     he said to the Senate, the real cost of oil should be between \n     $35 and $60 per barrel--all costs over and above that amount \n     are because of government.\n       You do not listen, you do not know, and you pretend to \n     care. (There are many issues that have come before Congress \n     that have not taken the public's best interests to heart, and \n     have caused us more expense and trouble. Among those issues \n     are the Public Employees investment funds, domestic oil \n     drilling, Chinese allowed to drill right off our own coast \n     when we cannot, NAFTA, nuclear power support, devaluation of \n     the dollar, terrorists given rights by the Supreme Court.)\n\n[[Page S8940]]\n\n       (Given my frustration with Congress, you can imagine how I \n     feel about your last statement, ``together we can spur some \n     real action?'' The only thing that seems to happen is the \n     Congress spends more money and expends a lot of hot air.)\n       It ought to be interesting when fuel gets to $6.\n       I doubt anyone on your staff will read this; you certainly \n     will not, but have a nice day anyway.\n     Don, Buhl.\n                                  ____\n\n       I, being a retired person on a fixed income, [find] it is \n     very hard to get by.

Eat your oil!\n       Ought to go well with a nice thick grilled filet of camel \n     (steak).\n           Unsigned.\n                                  ____\n\n       Since you asked for our energy stories I will submit this \n     one. My wife and I own three vehicles, a 2000 Buick, a 1992 \n     Ford Bronco and a 2006 Suzuki motorcycle (an on-off road \n     type). I ride my bike everywhere I can and my wife takes the \n     car. I scrape the frost off my bike seat some mornings \n     because, for every trip I take the Bronco to work, I can take \n     the bike three times. We have to drive and it takes 30 \n     gallons to fill the Bronco. At $3.94 a gallon, it really adds \n     up. I rode my bike into December last year and broke it out \n     in March this year. If the roads were bare and there was not \n     a threat of snow, I rode it. I remember the 1980s when the \n     speed limit was lowered to 55 mph to conserve fuel so that is \n     what I do now again. If it helped then, I hope it will help \n     now. This is not a noble plan to conserve energy; it is a \n     trial to spend so much on fuel and I can cut costs this way.\n       Maybe you can explain why our ``friends'' who supply us the \n     oil need to gouge us so badly. Maybe $120.00 for a barrel of \n     wheat would make the point in all export sales going to oil \n     producing nations. And speaking of the high price of gas, do \n     we export wheat and other food grains cheaper than we can buy \n     it here at home? Are our shortages caused by or aided by \n     sales to export markets? If so, that is wrong! We need to \n     take care of American needs first. I really do not mind \n     sharing what I have with my neighbors but I'll feed my kids \n     first.\n       Thanks for listening,\n     Mark.\n                                  ____\n\n       I do appreciate your concern about gas prices for those in \n     Idaho. I lived in Idaho last year when I signed up for your \n     newsletters, I now live in Washington, Tri Cities, where we \n     pay approximately 25 cents more per gallon than most do in \n     Idaho. I am writing because my daughter lives in Sandpoint \n     where gas prices are about the same as here. She has a \n     disabled daughter that requires my daughter to take her to \n     Spokane, Washington, about 70 miles one way. Due to the \n     increase in gas prices, she has had to miss some of her \n     doctor's appointments.\n       I believe that we have enough domestic oil to keep this \n     country going for at least enough years to allow us to \n     develop an alternative energy source. So I do not understand \n     why that we are paying such high prices, except that the Big \n     Oil Companies are making a fortune off the American People \n     that can hardly afford to feed their families now due to the \n     increase in cost. Also from what I can see, the prices are \n     going to continue to rise and run our economy into the ground \n     due to the greed of the Big Oil.\n       Put a windfall profit tax on them and they will rethink \n     what they are doing. We cannot afford to keep paying higher \n     prices for gas, which is increasing the cost of everything \n     that is delivered by truck. Our economy is in a downward \n     spiral and, if Congress does not stop it, then there will be \n     no economy left in a couple of years.\n     Arnold, West Richland, Washington.\n                                  ____\n\n       As a United States citizen and fellow Idahoan, I feel the \n     need to share my financial pain with you about what it is \n     like to pay for high fuel (gasoline, diesel) prices. Like \n     anyone with an automobile, I pay more at the pump to the tune \n     of around $50-$100 more per month. I think this pales in \n     comparison to how much more I am paying for any commodity \n     sold through any retail outlet. Nearly everything in the good \n     old U.S.A. travels down our highways, and the extra costs of \n     these goods is eating away at any disposable income I might \n     have had for, let us say, dinner out one night, a night at \n     the movies, etc. My income did not see this exponential rise \n     to help combat the higher cost of living. Therefore I spend \n     less on other things, which in turn, does not help my local \n     economy. Multiply my woes by the hundreds of thousands like \n     me, or worse off than myself, and we will continue to see our \n     economy in decline.\n       As for a fix, I will give my opinion on this as well. Why \n     is an energy source like crude oil any different from \n     electricity and natural gas? Am I going out on a limb by \n     saying, although my heating and cooling bills have gone up, \n     they haven't quadrupled in the last eight years. Why? Well as \n     you know the government does not allow the companies that \n     sell us power or natural gas to just raise prices whenever \n     they feel like it. Should not we treat big oil companies the \n     same way? What is the difference between the need for one \n     source of power and another?\n       The U.S. economy is so incredibly dependent on petroleum \n     products, I think it is irresponsible of our government \n     officials to not step in and provide some long term relief \n     for the U.S. consumer/citizen. Step it up and take control of \n     this situation before we all are made to suffer through a \n     multi-year recession.\n       Thank you for your time.\n     Tom, Lewiston.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for your e-letter of this date. In the Big Lost \n     River Valley, mass transit will not be efficient, but \n     neighbors can be increasingly efficient. We and our neighbors \n     are beginning a neighborhood plan whereby we coordinate \n     medical, pharmacy, dental, shopping and other errands, mostly \n     to Idaho Falls, nearly 90 miles distant, to reduce individual \n     gasoline purchases. By previewing times and schedules, we can \n     accomplish numerous tasks in the destination city with fewer \n     vehicles/travel. My neighbors and I agree substantially with \n     the points made in your e-letter: aggressively promote \n     increased domestic production and refining of gas and oil \n     products, nuclear power/electricity production and electric \n     and hydrogen power for automobiles. The unintended \n     consequences of the ethanol program will lead us to proper \n     caution about alternative fuels. Thank you for your good \n     works.\n           Most respectfully,\n     David, Darlington.\n                                  ____\n\n       I think the current U.S. government may be on the way to \n     causing civil war!!! You hear it on the streets, how [angry] \n     people are getting at [the inaction. The environmentalists \n     seem to hold undue influence over decisions and legislation \n     from Congress. I do not believe that global warming is a \n     threat. Both political parties have not been able to address \n     the public's concerns about energy, and the federal \n     government just keeps spending more and more taxpayer \n     dollars.]\n       Drill here, drill now.\n       Secure the border.\n     Dwayne.\n                                  ____\n\n       My husband and I are seniors; we are in our 70s. We are not \n     suffering as much from the high gas prices as our \n     grandchildren are. Our youngest grandson is 17, and we have \n     grandchildren who are 26. Boise wages are not the greatest, \n     so it is really putting a dent in their budgets when gas \n     prices are so high. I have wanted a decent transit (bus) \n     system in Boise and Ada County forever. We have lived in \n     Boise since June 1970. I came from Portland, Oregon. That is \n     a city that can be very proud of their transit system. The \n     buses run day and night, seven days a week.\n       I do not know why Boise has to be so slow with progress. A \n     good bus system would be invaluable now. There has to be a \n     transfer system so you can get where you need to go. I wish \n     some of the ``powers that be in Boise'' would go to Portland \n     and study their bus (transit) system.\n       I have a sister who lives in Salem, Oregon, the state \n     capital, and they have a wonderful bus system also. Boise is \n     a state capital and our bus system is tragic. Look at the gas \n     that could be saved if people could ride buses and could \n     depend on buses. A street car system downtown is not going to \n     help very many people! I do drive, and I drive a large car. I \n     never go downtown, but if there was a good bus system that I \n     could use, I would bus downtown a lot. I live out by 5 Mile \n     and Victory and where I live there are no buses.\n           Sincerely,\n     Sally.\n                                  ____\n\n       This probably does not fit your agenda, but actually, \n     gasoline prices have been a lot worse. I paid a much higher \n     percentage of my income when I was stationed overseas. The \n     Energy Information Administration says we were reaching much \n     deeper into our pockets to pay for gasoline in 1980 than last \n     year. The real difference is that today's money buys less \n     value. So, the best way the government can keep gasoline \n     affordable is to stop creating inflation. The next thing you \n     could do is require automobile makers to deliver cars that \n     get better mileage. USA cars need to be more competitive.\n     Jim.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/17/senate-section/article/S8940-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8940-S8941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             BROOKLYN-GUERNSEY-MALCOLM COMMUNITY EDUCATION\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

Mr. President, today I mourn the passing and pay \ntribute to a great Georgian. Broadcaster Skip Caray passed away in his \nsuburban Atlanta home on August 3, 2008, leaving a tremendous void in \nthe hearts of Atlanta Braves fans nationwide.\n  After years of calling basketball and hockey games in St. Louis and \nAtlanta, Skip Caray began broadcasting for the Braves in 1976. Baseball \nwas in his blood, and while their styles were different, Skip brought \nthe same warmth and humor to his calls as his famous father, Harry, \ndelivered to the Chicago Cubs for years. Skip Caray passed his love for \nthe game on to his sons, Chip and Josh, both of whom found careers in \nthe same profession as their father.\n  As a broadcaster for TBS, Skip Caray's voice was not only familiar to \nbaseball fans in the South, but millions around the country. Whether it \nwas the many years that the Braves spent in the depths of their \ndivision or the 14 consecutive seasons at the top, Caray provided the \nvoice of a friend who shared the same passion for ``America's Team'' \nthat the fans did. No Braves fan will ever forget Skip urging Sid Bream \naround third base and into the World Series in 1992 or his elation as \nthe Braves won it all in 1995.\n  In 2004, Caray was elected to the Atlanta Braves Hall of Fame. At his \ninduction, his mentor, Ernie Johnson, Sr., said that Caray ``had a \nbigger heart than anyone can imagine.'' Skip Caray will be sorely \nmissed and will remain in Atlanta Braves fans' hearts forever.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/17/senate-section/article/S8945-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING CONGDON'S DOUGHNUTS\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as our Nation and our world become \nincreasingly complex and fast paced, it may seem easy to lose track of \nthe simple but essential ties that bind us to those in our communities. \nIt is with pleasure that I recognize a small family business from my \nhome State of Maine that has succeeded in ushering a timeless classic \ninto the modern world. Congdon's Doughnuts in Wells has been a York \nCounty institution for well over 50 years, providing tasty treats and \ncommunity support for generations of locals and tourists.\n  For the early riser among us, few indulgences are more appealing than \na sticky sweet doughnut and a fresh-brewed cup of coffee. Congdon's \nDoughnuts has provided just that to thousands of customers as it has \nchurned out up to 10,000 homemade doughnuts a day for three \ngenerations. Founded in 1945, and located at its current site since \n1955, the company has undergone many of the trials and tribulations \nthat often challenge America's small businesses. Yet through the hard \nwork and unwavering dedication of the Congdon family and their \nemployees, the business has transformed itself from a small wholesale \ndoughnut operation to a three-meal-a-day restaurant and bakery. Under \npresent managers Gary Leech, son of Eleanor Congdon, and his wife Diane \nLeech, Congdon's also added a convenient drive-thru in 2002 for those \non the go. The firm has been so successful that this past March, the \nBest Independent Restaurants Association awarded Congdon's Doughnuts \nits highest level of recognition, the prestigious Best Family \nRestaurant Platinum Plate Award.\n  While known for providing plentiful options for breakfast, lunch, and \ndinner, the centerpiece of the Congdon enterprise remains its timeless \nand highly acclaimed doughnuts. With dozens of tempting and delicious \nvarieties of the traditional breakfast morsels, from cinnamon and \ncoconut to chocolate honey and apple fritter, Congdon's has something \nto satisfy any doughnut eater and has garnered acclaim both locally and \nnationally. Indeed, Portland Magazine, a regional publication, has \nplaced Congdon's doughnuts on its list of ``101 of Maine's Guiltiest \nGuilty Pleasures,'' and in 2007 Congdon's was included on the Doughnut \nHonor Roll of seriouseats.com, the Web site of famed food critic Ed \nLevin.\n  While Congdon's has long been involved in local charitable and \ncommunity efforts, for the last 2 years it has institutionalized the \ncommitment to its neighbors by joining other local businesses to host \nweekly benefit barbeques. Every Wednesday in July and August, community \nmembers come together for fun-filled tropical-themed parties. Ticket \nsales for these popular events have raised money for local and national \ncharities and organizations including the American Heart Association, \nSouthern Maine Parent Awareness, and Trolley for Togus, which provides \ntransportation for York County veterans to Maine's VA hospital. \nAdditionally, last December Congdon's offered its guests holiday cards \nto sign for our Nation's soldiers, and then sent over 500 of them to \nmen and women serving in Iraq.\n  Congdon's Doughnuts exemplifies the best qualities of being both a \nprosperous business and a caring neighbor. It is with great pride that \nI congratulate Condgon's on its decades of successes and I wish them \nthe best of luck for the future as they continue to reach new heights \nas a purveyor of delectable treats and old-fashioned American \ncuisine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/17/senate-section/article/S8945-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8945-S8946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  At 11:24 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nsigned the following enrolled bill:\n\n\n[[Page S8946]]\n\n\n       H.R. 5938.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mrs. LINCOLN (for herself, Ms. Snowe, and Mr. Isakson):\n  S. 3505. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for the coverage of home infusion therapy under the Medicare \nProgram; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I join my colleague, Senator Lincoln \nof Arkansas, to introduce the Medicare Home Infusion Coverage Act, \nwhich will help us improve care and reduce costs. Today we know that \nthe average Medicare beneficiary must shoulder nearly half their health \ncare costs. At the same time Medicare faces serious fiscal challenges. \nCurrently, the Part A, hospital, Trust Fund faces insolvency in 2019, \nwhen expenditures will exceed projected contributions and require \nadditional taxpayer support to maintain the care our seniors and so \nmany disabled Americans require.\n  There is another way, and that is to reform care delivery to \nemphasize high quality, lower cost care. Today the many serious \nconditions--including some cancers and drug-resistant infections--\nrequire the use of infusion therapy. Such treatment involves the \nadministration of medication directly into the bloodstream via a needle \nor catheter. Specialized equipment, supplies, and professional services \n(such as sterile drug compounding, care coordination, and patient \neducation and monitoring) are part of such therapy. The course of \ninfusion treatment often lasts for several hours per day over a six-to-\neight week period.\n  The unfortunate fact is that Medicare patients requiring infusion \ntherapy must either bear that cost themselves, or endure \nhospitalization in order to receive coverage. Though Medicare pays for \ninfusion drugs, it does not pay for the services, equipment, and \nsupplies necessary to safely provide infusion therapy in the home. Not \nsurprisingly, even though home infusion therapy may cost as little as \n$100 a day, too few seniors can bear that cost.\n  The result is that patients are hospitalized needlessly, driving \ncosts of treatment as much as 10-20 times higher than treatment in the \nhome. That is wasteful to Medicare and may even place the patient at \nrisk. That is because unnecessary hospitalization places individuals at \nrisk of acquiring a health care-acquired infection--one which is \nfrequently drug resistant and can be life-threatening.\n  Private health plans have long understood that home infusion therapy \nis not only less costly, but safer as well. Thus private coverage for \nhome infusion therapy is common. Private plans also recognize that \npatients benefit from avoiding hospitalization. At home they have \nfamiliar, comfortable surroundings, and family conveniently at hand--no \nsmall concerns when fighting a serious illness.\n  It is clear we must change the status quo, and achieve safer, most \ncost-effective treatment. By extending coverage of infusion therapy to \nthe home, we will correct this unintended and unnecessary gap in \nMedicare coverage.\n  I hope my colleagues will join us in support of this legislation so \nwe may further the goals of improving patient safety and reducing our \nescalating health care costs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Baucus, Ms. Stabenow, \n        Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Obama, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Brown, \n        Mr. Durbin, Mr. Levin, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Biden, \n        Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 3507.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Education to make \ngrants to support early college high schools and other dual enrollment \nprograms; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I am doing my part to end the growing \ncrisis of high school dropouts. I am introducing the Fast Track to \nCollege Act, a bill to increase high school graduation rates and \nimprove access to college through the expansion of dual enrollment \nprograms and early college high schools. Such programs allow young \npeople to earn up to 2 years of college credit, including an \nassociate's degree, while also earning their high school diploma.\n  As we work to reauthorize the No Child Left Behind Act, we must find \nsolutions to the growing dropout crisis facing our Nation's high \nschools and provide opportunities for young people to pursue higher \neducation. Recent reports have illustrated the enormous challenge: the \nnational graduation rate is only 70 percent and is significantly lower \nin many large urban school districts. For example, my home State of \nWisconsin has a relatively high graduation rate of 86 percent, but that \nrate drops to only 46 percent in the urban schools in Milwaukee. Such \nan achievement gap cannot continue.\n  For America to remain a leader in today's increasingly global \neconomy, we must ensure that all young people obtain not only a high \nschool diploma, but a postsecondary education as well. High dropout \nrates and low college attendance rates hurt individuals, families, and \nsociety. Young people who drop out of high school are at increased risk \nfor unemployment and incarceration, and they are more likely to depend \non public assistance for healthcare, housing and other basic needs. \nConversely, adults with a bachelor's degree will earn two thirds more \nthan a high school graduate over the course of their working lives and \nare much less likely to experience unemployment or rely on social \nprograms.\n  For these reasons, I ask my colleagues to support this bill, which \nprovides competitive grant funding for dual enrollment programs that \nallow low-income students to earn college credit and a high school \ndiploma at the same time. The Gates Foundation has been funding and \nevaluating such programs for several years now, and they have found \nthat these programs work. Students can be motivated by a challenging \ncurriculum and the tangible rewards of achievement, including free \ncollege credit and exposure to career opportunities. These programs \nhave shown incredible promise as a tool for increasing attendance, \ngraduation, and college enrollment rates, particularly among low-income \nhigh school students. Dual enrollment puts students on the fast track \nto college and increases the odds that they will not only graduate, but \ngo on to continue their education and secure higher-paying jobs.\n  Specifically, this bill authorizes $100,000,000 for competitive 6-\nyear grants to schools, with priority given to schools that serve low-\nincome students. The funding will help defray the costs of tuition, \ntextbooks, transportation, and other associated costs for students in \nearly college high school and other dual enrollment programs. The bill \nalso includes an evaluation component so we can measure the program's \neffectiveness.\n  I believe this investment in our schools will help solve the dropout \ncrisis and secure America's future by ensuring that all young people \ncan compete in today's global economy. Further, I believe that all \nchildren, regardless of income or other factors, deserve equal \nopportunities to fulfill their potential, and it is both morally and \nfiscally responsible for this Congress to invest in high-quality \neducational programs that help them reach that potential.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3508\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fast Track to College Act of \n     2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto remove social security account numbers from Medicare identification \ncards and communications provided to Medicare beneficiaries in order to \nprotect Medicare beneficiaries from identity theft; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation with \nSenator Bingaman and Senator Kohl to remove Social Security numbers \nfrom Medicare identification cards.\n  Government agencies and private businesses have begun to recognize \nthe danger of displaying Social Security numbers. A person's Social \nSecurity number can unlock a treasure trove of personal and financial \ninformation.\n  If your Social Security number falls into the wrong hands, you are at \nrisk of becoming a victim of identify theft and fraud. In 2006, the \nFederal Trade Commission reported that more than 8 million Americans \nwere victims of identity theft in the prior year.\n  Thirty-one states have enacted laws that limit how public and private \nentities use and display Social Security numbers. Social Security \nnumbers are being removed from driver's licenses, and most private \nhealth insurance cards no longer display your Social Security number.\n  Federal agencies are taking steps to reduce the threat of identify \ntheft. Last year, the Office of Management and Budget called on federal \nagencies to establish plans to eliminate unnecessary collection and use \nof Social Security numbers and to explore alternatives to Social \nSecurity numbers.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs no longer displays Social Security \nnumbers on new veteran identification cards. And the Office of \nPersonnel Management has directed health insurers participating in the \nFederal Employees Health Benefit Program to eliminate Social Security \nnumbers from insurance cards.\n  Unfortunately, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is \nlagging behind other agencies.\n  The same Social Security number that the Social Security \nAdministration believes is so sensitive that it should not be carried \nin your wallet is found on the Medicare cards that 44 million \nbeneficiaries carry with them at all times to access health care \nservices. CMS expressly instructs Medicare beneficiaries to carry their \nMedicare card in their wallet or purse as proof of insurance, making \ntheir Social Security numbers readily available to any thief.\n  In 2005, I offered an amendment to the fiscal year 2006 Labor-HHS-\nEducation appropriations bill to require CMS to report to Congress on \nwhat steps would be necessary for them to remove Social Security \nnumbers from Medicare cards.\n  CMS issued the report in 2006, but it has not yet begun to remove \nSocial Security numbers from Medicare cards.\n  Earlier this year, the Inspector General of the Social Security \nAdministration took CMS to task for its inaction. The Inspector \nGeneral's report confirmed that displaying Social Security numbers on \nMedicare cards places millions of people at risk for identity theft and \nconcluded that ``immediate action is needed to address this significant \nvulnerability.''\n  The bill that I am introducing today, the Social Security Number \nProtection Act of 2008, establishes a reasonable timetable for CMS to \nbegin removing Social Security numbers from Medicare cards and a date \ncertain by which CMS would be required to complete the process.\n  Not later than three years after enactment, CMS would be prohibited \nfrom displaying Social Security numbers on newly issued Medicare cards. \nCMS would be prohibited from displaying the number on existing cards no \nlater than five years after enactment.\n  In addition to Medicare cards, the bill would prohibit CMS from \ndisplaying Social Security numbers on all written and electronic \ncommunications to Medicare beneficiaries, beginning no later than three \nyears of enactment, except in cases where their display is essential \nfor the operation of the Medicare program.\n  Removing Social Security numbers from Medicare cards and \ncommunications to Medicare beneficiaries is long overdue. Medicare \nbeneficiaries should not be placed at greater risk of identity theft \nthan people with private health insurance. If other federal agencies \ncan remove Social Security numbers, so can CMS.\n  I am pleased that Consumers Union, the Medicare Rights Center, and \nthe Center for Medicare Advocacy have endorsed this bill.\n  This is an issue we should all be able to unite behind. I urge my \ncolleagues to cosponsor this important legislation and work with me to \nenact it next year. Medicare beneficiaries deserve to be protected from \ncriminals who seek to steal their identities in order to defraud them.\n\n[[Page S8955]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3512\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
