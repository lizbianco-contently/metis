Mr. President, on occasion the Senate must turn to \nlegislation we know will cause controversy: abortion, Social Security, \nalways the war in Iraq, to name a few things that always cause \ncontroversy. Sometimes we find common ground on these; other times, \nafter thoughtful, earnest debate, the two sides cannot converge in the \nmiddle.\n  That is okay. But that is how this body was designed to work by the \nFounding Fathers. So I offer the words that will follow with an \nunderstanding that as majority party we cannot expect the Republicans \nto agree with us on everything. And when the legitimate pursuit of \ncompromise eventually leads to a dead end, we accept that outcome and \nmove on to the next challenge.\n  But again and again this session our Republican colleagues have \nrefused to work with us at all. They have rejected the difficult but \ncritical job of legislating in favor of the easier but hollow path of \nobstruction and political gamesmanship.\n  Sixty-eight times and counting since the beginning of this session \nthe Republicans have filibustered legislation. That means that 68 times \nthe Republicans have stopped us from even debating, even negotiating, \neven working on legislation for the American people. Think about that, \n68 times. That is about once a week if you consider the days and the \nweeks we are out of session.\n  Filibustering is far different from voting against a bill. I have no \ngripe, we have no gripe, with any Senator\n\n[[Page S3736]]\n\nwho objects to legislation and votes against it. But time after time, \nRepublicans have blocked us from even voting on a bill but, even more \nthan that, from even getting to the point where you can negotiate on a \nbill, even allowing us to legislate on a bill.\n  Republicans are acting like the kid on the playground who does not \nlike his teammates but owns the ball, and he takes it home to his \nmother. What is even worse are the bills our Republican friends choose \nto block. Many of these bills are not major controversial issues. They \nare not even political hot potatoes. They are fairly straightforward, \nnoncontroversial ideas that can make our country safer, healthier, and \nmore prosperous.\n  We are now seeing yet another example of this. Earlier this week the \nCommerce and Finance Committees reported the Aviation Investment and \nModernization Act to the floor of this body. Any American who has taken \nan airplane over the past few years understands we have a problem with \nour aviation system, and if they knew everything that was going on, \nthey would be even more concerned.\n  Almost 800 million American passengers took to the skies last year, \n800 million, twice the number of 20 years ago. But as the number of \npassengers was steadily rising over those years, investment in \ntechnology and infrastructure did not nearly keep pace. Anyone can see \nthat as a potential for disaster. Thankfully, the aviation industry has \nseen relatively few disasters, but all of us can see the problem. All \nof us can see the result of the problems in longer lines, more frequent \ndelays and, I might add, the financial brink these airline companies \nare on, as to whether they can even stay in business. That is all \nAmerican airlines. The number of passengers will continue to increase. \nIn 10 years the number will probably reach a billion each year. Las \nVegas-McCarren International Airport, the fifth largest in America in \nthe number of passengers coming in and out of that facility, now hosts \n4 million every month.\n  Traffic through the Las Vegas airport has increased so much that it \nwill reach a maximum capacity in the next few years. This growth in air \ntravel, not only in Nevada but throughout America, presents both an \nopportunity and a major challenge.\n  If we legislate with foresight and make the necessary investments, it \nrepresents an enormous opportunity for the airlines, tourism, and our \neconomy. But if we fail to take the necessary steps today, travelers \ncan be put at greater risk, our economy can suffer, and air travel \nwould grind to a halt.\n  Chairman Rockefeller, Chairman Baucus, Senators Inouye, Stevens, \nGrassley, and Hutchison worked in earnest and sent an FAA modernization \nbill to the floor. They were a model of how the legislative process \nshould work, Democrats and Republicans working through their \ndifferences to come up with solutions.\n\n  The chairman of the Commerce Committee is Senator Dan Inouye. There \nis not a nicer person in the world, not a better legislator in the \nworld. I have been working on an issue with the Speaker for several \nweeks, the supplemental appropriations bill. One of the issues in that \nbill was what we are going to do for funding the war in Iraq. She said: \nYou have Senator Inouye working with our people who have jurisdiction \nover that aspect of the bill. They will work with him. Everybody loves \nSenator Inouye over here. To think that this bill has been stopped when \nyou have someone such as Senator Inouye as chairman of the committee is \nhard to comprehend.\n  All these Senators I have mentioned are a model of how the \nlegislative process should work, Democrats and Republicans working \nthrough their differences to come up with solutions. That is how they \ncame up with this bill we are dealing with on the floor now. When the \nbill reached the floor, though, our Republican colleagues apparently \ndecided this was an opportunity to filibuster again. That is what they \nhave done. This week we have had basically no votes. We had one vote. \nIt was a vote to go to the bill--one vote.\n  Amendments are considered, debate follows, votes are taken. That is \nwhat you do ordinarily. Not here, not with the Republicans in the \nminority. They have been in a snit ever since we took the majority.\n  I have made it clear to the minority leader here on the floor many \ntimes, Democrats would welcome amendments from both sides of the aisle. \nWhat we initially said was: Give us a list of amendments you want to \noffer. No. Then they said: Well, Senator Bunning wants to offer an \namendment. Fine, let us see it, offer the amendment. We finally learned \nwhat it was about yesterday. It was about taking coal and processing \nthat so the fuel from that could be used in jet airplanes. I don't know \nif it would work, but let's debate the issue here. No. I said: You are \ncomplaining about the fact that we want to have some idea of what the \namendments are going to be. Why don't we have it so that not myself \nalone but Senator McConnell and I would look at the amendments. We \nwould together. If he didn't want an amendment to come up, if I didn't \nwant an amendment to come up, we would work together. No, won't do \nthat. I said yesterday: OK, we will take out all the blockage. We will \ntake down the so-called tree. You can offer any amendment you want. \nThey don't want to offer any amendments. I spoke to the Republican \nleader. I said: We learned you are displeased with the bill because \nthere is a provision in it that gives New York the final payment for \nthe money promised to the State of New York after 9/11. It is in the \nPresident's budget. I explained that to my friends over here. It is in \nthe President's budget. They said: We are still against it. So here it \nis, Friday. We have accomplished nothing.\n  I don't know how we could make it any clearer that we want to debate \nand pass this bill fairly and openly. We have reached out to the \nRepublican side every step of the legislative process. Our overtures \nhave gone ignored. On a bill as critical and noncontroversial as making \nair travel safer and more efficient, Republicans have obstinately \nrefused to negotiate. I don't want to frighten the public, but we have \nall been told, you can go here to the parking lot and one of the new \ncars in the last 4 or 5 years has a GPS system in it. That is better \nequipment than they use to handle all the 800 million airplanes flying \naround America today. Our equipment is antiquated, inefficient, and \nunsafe. That is why last week I had come to my office, when we knew we \nwere going to bring the bill up, all the unions representing people who \nwork for airlines--the mechanics, flight attendants, air traffic \ncontrollers, on and on. They are concerned. Then an hour or two later, \nI meet in another building on the same floor with the operators of \ncommercial airlines in America. They are frightened to death. They are \ngoing broke. Major airlines--we only have five or six left in America--\nare on the verge of going broke. Right now their fuel costs equal \nalmost half of their costs. You pay 70 cents for a gallon of flight \nfuel in Europe. You pay more than a dollar here in America. You can't \ncompete on that basis.\n  This is a bill that should whip through this body, no problem \nwhatsoever. But the Republicans won't even allow us to reach a point to \ndeal with one of their amendments. If there is something they don't \nlike, tell us what it is. They aren't just blocking the bill, they are \nblocking even a discussion that could lead to compromise on a bill \nwhere they won't tell us what their concern is. It is the amendment \nrelating to New York getting money. It is in the President's budget. I \ndon't know how you negotiate that.\n  The most serious failure doesn't lie with my Republican colleagues in \nthe Senate. There is plenty there. But it lies with the leader of the \nRepublican Party, the President of the United States, George Bush. Here \nis what a responsible President would do. First, he would acknowledge \nthe critical importance of legislation to modernize the Federal \nAviation Administration; next, possess the political skill and fairness \nto see that members of his own party are having difficulty reaching \ncompromise on the bill with the majority party. I am being nice by \nsaying reaching a compromise. He should call these people over here and \nsay: Get this bill done. But he is now giving a speech in St. Louis \nabout how great the economy is going. That is where he is today.\n\n  One would think the President of the United States would set an \nexample of leadership by bringing the sides to the\n\n[[Page S3737]]\n\ntable to forge a compromise, reach a solution. Using the office of the \nPresidency to break down barriers and bring sides together is powerful \nand important. It is one of his most important responsibilities. \nUnfortunately, tragically, it is a responsibility that President Bush \nhas ignored. He has left his party rudderless. Is it any wonder a poll \ncame out yesterday that shows President Bush as low as President Nixon \nwas in favorability at the height of the Watergate crisis. It is in the \n20s. Is there any reason not to believe that is not totally valid? With \ncritical legislation at hand and only one side wanting to pass the law, \nwe are left in a situation where the airline companies, the people who \nwork for the airlines, and the consuming public--this bill has a \nconsumer bill of rights in it so people have some idea what to expect \nwhen they are on a runway for hours at a time; what rights do they have \nwhen flights are canceled; what information are they entitled to. That \nis in this bill. No chance. Republicans are holding it up because of a \nprovision in the President's budget.\n  It is difficult to comprehend why the Republicans in the Senate would \ngo along with this President. I can't understand why they would do \nthat. The American people obviously can see this. They are going to \nreact in November. The challenges we face in our country are too \nimportant to do business the way it is being done. I renew my call to \nmy Republican counterpart Senator McConnell to do the right thing, to \nignore the President. Let's move on. The status quo in this and many \nother areas is not a good place to be.\n  I say to President Bush: If you believe, as we do, that the future of \naviation may well lie in the decisions we make now, get off the \nsidelines and get involved. Urge your Republican colleagues in the \nSenate to work with us. We stand ready to do the job. The American \npeople deserve no less.\n  We will have a vote on cloture on the bill on Tuesday. My Republican \ncolleague, my friend Senator McConnell, has said: You are wasting your \ntime. We are all going to vote to block this bill.\n  I hope the next few days will give them the opportunity to come to \nreality and understand we need to do something with this bill. If they \ndon't like the new provision, the provision regarding New York, and \nthey want to vote against that provision, even though it is in the \nPresident's budget, offer an amendment to get rid of it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Monday is a \nlong-established no-vote day. But it is not fair to Members to have to \nworry about being back here when there is nothing being done on the \nbill--they have other things they can do--based on the Republicans' \nrefusal to let us legislate on this most important piece of \nlegislation.\n  So we are not even going to be in session on Monday, I announce to \nall the Senators and their staffs. We will be out of session Monday and \ncome back on Tuesday, and, hopefully, the Republicans will see the \nlight of day. Maybe they will get a call from the White House saying \nthe air traffic situation in this country is important. He should \nnotice what is going on in the Senate and make a call to the Republican \nleadership in the Senate and let us move this bill.\n  But we will start legislating on Tuesday, hopefully.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to make sure the \nAmerican people know that Democrats want to make sure that oil markets \nare policed. Democrats want to make sure the oil markets are not being \nmanipulated, and Democrats are going to make sure the oil markets, in \nfact, are going to be policed by the Federal Government.\n  Over the last several years, several energy companies, including \nAmaranth, Marathon Oil, and British Petroleum have been under \ninvestigation for the manipulation of petroleum and natural gas \nmarkets. As a result of that investigation, British Petroleum now must \npay approximately $373 million for conspiring to corner the market and \nmanipulate the price of propane carried through the Texas pipeline.\n  In another example, in 2006, a manipulative scheme to game the \nnatural gas market by the now defunct hedge fund Amaranth, cost \nconsumers upwards of $9 billion. In July of last year, Marathon Oil \nagreed to pay $1 million in fines to the CFTC to settle charges that \nMarathon's petroleum subsidy had attempted to manipulate crude oil \nprices.\n  So we have examples of natural gas and oil markets being manipulated, \nand Democrats want to make sure that oil markets are going to be \npoliced. We want to make sure there is not manipulation of supply. We \nwant to make sure there is not false reporting of information. We want \nto make sure there is not cornering of the market. We want to make sure \nthere is not rogue trading.\n  That is why I am pleased the FTC has taken at least a first step in \nissuing a rule that I think will help establish the framework by which \nthese markets can be more thoroughly investigated.\n  The FTC is recognizing in its rule--the rule that it issued last \nnight--that they need to base this on a law that is about manipulative \npractices or using manipulative devices. There is a large body of case \nlaw starting with the Securities and Exchange Commission now being used \nby the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, that has become, as the \nSupreme Court said, ``a judicial oak which has grown from little more \nthan a legislative acorn.''\n  What they are talking about is just the simple concept put into \nFederal statute that you should not have manipulative devices or \ncontrivances as it relates to the stock market, as it relates to \ncommodities, as it relates to now the natural gas and electricity \nmarkets, and now, after the FTC's action last night, as it relates to \nthe oil markets.\n  But Democrats are going to make sure the FTC does its job. I am \ncalling on our leadership to have oversight hearings of this FTC \nrulemaking process. The American public needs to be in on this process \nof deciding exactly how this rule is going to be developed. We are \ngoing to protect consumers in making sure there is a strong statute on \nthe books. We want to make sure that in this final rule the impact of \nany kind of manipulative, planned reductions by refineries as a scheme \njust to reduce supply is covered under this law; that any kind of false \nor misleading reporting is covered under this law; and that the FTC \nrecognizes the great work that was done by the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission in their adoption of this rule.\n  In fact, the rule that is being put out by the FTC actually discusses \nin detail the cases of Amaranth and Enron, which I think is a good sign \nbecause it is in those cases that we learned exactly how the \nmanipulation of these markets takes place.\n  In fact, what we saw with Amaranth and what they did is they ended up \nselling shares to try to crash the market to lower the price after they \nalready had contracts for a higher price. So they made money by \nbasically getting people to sign up for contracts at a higher expense \nand then forcing the market to lower the price so they had a higher \nprofit margin. They ended up having a huge position in the natural gas \nmarket and, as I said, it cost consumers over $9 billion.\n  The interesting thing is, when they got out of the market and there \nwas\n\n[[Page S3738]]\n\nthe pursuit by the Federal Regulatory Commission of this issue, natural \ngas prices dropped 38 percent--38 percent because we had a bad actor \nout of the marketplace.\n  So it is critical that we have this aggressive action and probe of \nthe oil markets. It is critical that we give the Federal regulators--\nthe FTC and the FERC, if they need to be involved, the CFTC, as well as \nthe DOJ whom I have called on to be involved--the tools they need. But \nDemocrats are going to make sure we police the oil markets.\n  If you think about that and you think about the fact that oil prices \nare 100 times over what they were a year ago, and if you had some sort \nof activity that was driving up that price--I am saying it is not \nsupply and demand, it is not basic supply and demand. We haven't had a \nsupply disruption. We haven't had that big of a change in the demand. \nSo something is going on in the marketplace.\n  If we would do our job of investigating, we would make sure there is \na bright line there for the consumer, for the American people who are \npaying too much at the pump right now, to say that these kinds of \nmanipulative behaviors will not be tolerated.\n  The challenge we have is, when we don't have some of these markets \nhaving the transparency and the oversight, or people who are supposed \nto be the policemen on the beat, as well as the FTC not doing its job, \nthen these markets have a lot of activities that can actually drive up \nthe price. When we think about the Amaranth case, just imagine what \nwould happen if you could actually lower the price because you get bad \nactors out of the market.\n  That is what we are simply saying. Let's do our job here and have the \noversight hearings of this FTC rule and investigation of the oil \nmarkets. Let's do our job in making sure the consumer is represented in \nthe development of this rule and a tough Federal statute so that \nconsumers can have a little relief at the pump.\n  I noticed last night this was the first time gas prices didn't rise \novernight. I also took note in the paper this morning of the CFTC \nChairman's comment which was an indication of the fact that oil prices \nmight have moved because, instead of investing in commodities, people \nhave taken money out of those commodities and put them in other places \nin the stock market. People should be aware that Congress and the FTC \nare looking into any kind of manipulative practices when it comes to \nthe oil market. Even if the rule isn't in final adoption today, the \nfact that we are going to be aggressive at protecting consumers and \nlooking into this kind of manipulative practice, I believe, can help \ngive consumers relief at the pump.\n  So let's get about doing our job.

Mr. President, I know we are ready to wrap up for the \nweek. First, I want to make a couple points about a news item in \ntoday's paper.\n  I was looking at the Washington Post this morning, page A4. There is \na story about the President seeking $770 million more in world food \naid. At first glance, that sounds like very good news, and it is, to a \ncertain extent. But, unfortunately, it is good news about the future in \nterms of a commitment for 2009, but it doesn't do nearly enough to meet \nthe crisis that has enveloped large parts of the world with regard to \nthe food insecurity we are seeing all over the world.\n  Here is the point. I and others have asked the President to increase, \nfor this year, our food aid from the $350 million he has proposed \nearlier by adding another $200 million to that. In the short run, we \nwanted to go from $350 million to $550 million. This $770 million is \ngreat, but it is in 2009. When you think about when the food would hit \nthe ground, so to speak, the difference is that if the President's \npolicy stays in place for the near term, what you are going to have is \nfood hitting the ground, totaling $350 million, in the next couple of \nmonths, when we could be adding a lot more to that. The demand really \nrequires that we add $200 million. Even if we add the number the \nPresident put on the table, which is $770 million, that food won't hit \nthe ground, at the earliest, until November 2008, maybe December, or \nmaybe not even until January 2009.\n  We are at a point now where we have news story after news story about \ninstability across the world--governments that are not just at risk of \ncollapse because of the food insecurity, and we have seen all the \nreports about rioting--but this becomes not just a humanitarian crisis, \nnot only a government instability problem, but it really becomes \nfertile ground, unfortunately, for terrorism. So food insecurity is \nbecoming a national and international security problem.\n  We know from our history--world history especially--that in places \nsuch as Afghanistan, where there is instability, terrorism flourished. \nWe know the stories in the last couple of years, since before 2001, \nabout the rise of the Taliban and the rise of terrorist elements all \nover the world.\n  So I hope the President, as much as he has heralded his announcement \nfor 2009 of $770 million, I hope he will reconsider for the short term \nso we can add another $200 million in food aid--not a lot of money in \nthe scheme of the aid the United States generously provides to the rest \nof the world--add another $200 million in the near term so food can hit \nthe ground in these countries maybe at the end of this month or in June \nor July instead of waiting until November, December, or even January of \nnext year. Not just the hunger pangs and the trauma that this causes to \nreal people across the world but the security implication here is very \ngrave.\n  I hope the President will bring the same urgency to this funding as \nhe does to his call for more war funding, frankly. I think we need a \nsense of urgency because of the humanitarian, moral question here but \nalso because of the security implications.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey).

Mr. President, for much of last year, as many of us \nwill remember, the Senate Judiciary Committee was engaged in a very \ntroubling inquiry. We were trying to determine whether the Bush \nadministration had fired several U.S. attorneys for political reasons; \nnot because they were not good U.S. attorneys but because they were not \nloyal ``Bushies,'' to use the phrase a Department of Justice official \nused.\n  That inquiry continues at the Department of Justice, but over its \ncourse, we already know the incompetence and misjudgments that it \nuncovered have cost numerous Department of Justice officials their \njobs, and properly so, including former Attorney General Alberto \nGonzales who made clear that he put loyalty to the President before the \nfaithful exercise of that important office.\n  Unfortunately, it also cost that proud Department the morale of its \nofficials and, to a sad degree, the trust of the American people, many \nof whom have been left to wonder whether Federal prosecutions in this \ncountry arise from the pursuit of justice or whether under the Bush \nadministration they arise from the pursuit of political advantage.\n  Here we go again, perhaps. This morning, we awoke to the news that\n\n[[Page S3739]]\n\nthe Environmental Protection Agency's regional administrator for the \nMidwest, Mary Gade, was forced to resign in the midst of a heated \ndebate over dioxin contamination in waters near Michigan.\n  Dioxin is an extremely dangerous chemical. According to a report by \nthe Chicago Tribune, Ms. Gade invoked emergency powers last year to \nforce Dow Chemical, headquartered in Michigan, to clean up several \nareas saturated with this toxic chemical, a dangerous carcinogen which \nwas a byproduct, among other things, of Agent Orange, with which we are \nsadly familiar.\n  Ms. Gade later broke off negotiations with Dow Chemical on a more \ncomprehensive cleanup, citing concerns that Dow had been reluctant to \ntake steps to protect health and wildlife. That put the company in a \ntough position.\n  At that point, the Tribune's report says the company asked EPA \nofficials in Washington to intervene, although Dow said it had nothing \nto do with Ms. Gade's dismissal. The paper wrote that Ms. Gade said \nthat high-ranking EPA officials ``repeatedly questioned her aggressive \naction against Dow.'' It quoted Ms. Gade as saying, ``There is no \nquestion that this is about Dow.''\n  We do not yet know all the details of Ms. Gade's firing or everything \nthat may have gone on between her office and Dow Chemical. But from \neverything we have heard and seen so far, it looks like deja vu all \nover again from an administration that values compliance with its \npolitical agenda more than it values the trust or the best interests of \nthe American people.\n  Last year, we learned this is an administration that would not \nhesitate to fire capable Federal prosecutors when they would not toe an \nimproper party line. Today it seems the Bush administration might have \nonce again removed a highly qualified and well-regarded official whose \nonly misstep was to disagree with the political bosses.\n  Unfortunately, the story of Mary Gade is not only a distressing \nsignal that the Bush administration may again be making hiring and \nfiring decisions based on political loyalty, it is also a piece of \nevidence in a growing pile of evidence of a troubling and destructive \nforce at work within our Government, one with serious consequences for \nour environment, for our natural resources, and for the health of \nAmericans, for us, for our families.\n  We have also known that the Bush administration was no friend to the \nenvironment. Over and over again for 7 long years, this administration \nhas put forward under false flags policies that would do great harm to \nthe environment. Remember the Clear Skies Initiative that would \nincrease air pollution? Remember the national energy policy written \nwith Dick Cheney by oil industry lobbyists? The Bush approach to \nenvironmental protection has not only been wrong, it has been \nOrwellian. That pattern continues even to this day.\n  Not long ago, President Bush stood in the White House Rose Garden and \nannounced what his administration characterized as a ``new strategy'' \nto address climate change. As the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania well knows, Americans all over this country are crying out \nfor a bold and visionary plan to tackle the looming threat of global \nwarming, a problem that threatens to engulf this Nation and the entire \nworld within generations if nothing is done.\n  So we looked to the Rose Garden for leadership from our President. \nAnd what did we find? We found a proposal that was neither new nor even \na strategy. Instead, the President announced what he called a new \nnational goal: voluntary action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by \n2025.\n  Let me say that again. Voluntary action to reduce emissions by 2025, \n17 years from now, 17 years of increases.\n  There are a couple of problems with this approach. First, the obvious \nproblem is if you are allowing greenhouse gas emissions to continue to \nrise for 17 years, you are not doing much effectively about them, even \nthough overwhelming scientific evidence indicates that unless we take \nimmediate action to cut global warming pollutants, we might be too late \nto prevent the most serious impacts of global climate change.\n  Mr. President, you and I are in our fifties. We may be gone when it \ngets bad. I have met your girls. I have a girl and a boy of my own. I \nlook at the young pages here who are gathered in the well. This will be \ntheir world, and the responsibility is on us to take action now while \nwe can to protect the world in which they will live.\n  On that score, President Bush failed again. He literally offered zero \ninitiatives, none, that might reduce emissions now or in the future. He \nmade it clear that, on what is left of his watch, the U.S. Government \nwill never require polluters to make such reductions. As every American \nwho is not working in the Bush administration understands, voluntary \naction without strength of will or force of law simply is not enough to \ntackle a problem of this magnitude.\n\n  Finally, even if the President announced this empty so-called renewed \ncommitment to fighting global warming, his administration indicated it \nwould oppose a specific detailed plan for addressing the climate change \nproblem the Senate will likely take up after our Memorial Day recess, \nthe Warner-Lieberman plan Chairman Boxer has worked so hard to get out \nof our Environment and Public Works Committee.\n  This trifecta of failure from the White House would be laughable if \nit were not that the problem itself is so serious. It raises, actually, \nthe distasteful possibility, given this administration's long and \ndestructive history of disregard for environmental concerns, that the \nPresident's new strategy is not just a complete failure, a complete \nnothing, it is actually a stalking horse, intended to prevent real \nprogress on climate change, a way to leave this problem, similar to so \nmany others, for the next President to have to solve.\n  Regrettably, the President's announcement is also a stunning failure \nof leadership in a world community that is quickly growing unaccustomed \nto American leadership--not a good habit for the world to adopt.\n  We have known for a long time that politics of special interests is \nat the bottom of this and the Bush White House has repeatedly \ninterfered with the decisionmaking process of the Environmental \nProtection Agency and other agencies, in thrall to the checkbooks of \nthe oil companies, the gas companies, the chemical companies, the \ntimber companies, the coal companies, the auto companies. If you have a \ncorporate checkbook, they are for you.\n  A couple of weeks ago, we saw new evidence of how deeply this \ncorrosive political influence has seeped within EPA, the primary \nFederal agency charged with protecting our environment and our people's \npublic health. A report issued April 23 by the Union of Concerned \nScientists, entitled ``Interference at the EPA,'' is a truly scathing \nindictment of the decisionmaking process at EPA from those who know it \nbest, the scientists inside the Agency. The report consisted largely of \na survey of EPA scientists. It found that 60 percent of those surveyed \nhad personally experienced at least one instance of political \ninterference during the past 5 years--60 percent of the scientists. The \nreport documents, among many other things, that many EPA scientists \nhave been directed to inappropriately exclude or alter information from \nEPA science documents, or have had their work edited in a manner that \nresulted in changes to their scientific findings. The survey also \nrevealed EPA scientists have often objected to or resigned or removed \nthemselves from EPA projects because of pressure--pressure to change \ntheir scientific findings.\n  The conclusion could not be much clearer: EPA is an agency in crisis. \nOnce upon a time, anyone working at EPA could be proud of their \nagency's reputation. It was the international gold standard in the area \nof environmental protection. Indeed, for most of its 40-year history, \nall Americans could place their trust in EPA's independent, science-\nbased leadership to safeguard our natural resources and our public \nhealth.\n  If you go back to the founding of the Agency, in a 1970 press release \nby its first administrator, William Ruckelshaus, he stated this role \nunequivocally:\n\n       EPA is an independent agency. It has no obligation to \n     promote agriculture or commerce, only the critical obligation \n     to protect and enhance the environment.\n\n  Administrator Ruckelshaus was a Republican appointed by President\n\n[[Page S3740]]\n\nNixon. Yet both he and the President who appointed him intended EPA to \nbe immune from political pressure; to be guided by the twin lodestars \nof law and science in discharging that critical obligation to protect \nand enhance the environment.\n  In recent years, and especially during the tenure of Administrator \nJohnson, we have seen the EPA's leadership, in cahoots with its White \nHouse allies, despoil these basic principles of independence and \nscientific integrity. Here are only a few examples from the long bill \nof particulars that indicts the leadership of this once-vaunted agency.\n  The George Bush Environmental Protection Agency falsified data and \nfabricated results of studies regarding the safety of the air around \nthe site of the collapse of the World Trade Center on September 11.\n  The George Bush Environmental Protection Agency selectively edited \nGovernment reports, including the EPA's 2003 report on the environment, \nto support uncertainty in climate change science, placing the \nimprimatur of the Government of the United States on fringe views, \nsoundly rejected by the vast majority--essentially the entire world \nscientific community.\n  The George Bush Environmental Protection Agency has routinely \ntampered with regulatory and scientific processes to achieve results \nsought by, guess what, industry--at the expense of our public health \nand the environment. For example, in 2004, EPA allowed North Dakota to \nalter the way it measured air quality. That is the way they brought the \nTheodore Roosevelt National Park in compliance with national air \nquality standards, not by cleaning up the air but by allowing them to \nchange the way they measured air quality. The George Bush Environmental \nProtection Agency has hidden, suppressed and delayed the release of \nscientific findings in order to affect the impacts of EPA decisions. If \nthey have two things going on, if you can slow one down and get the \nother out first, if it is helpful to industry, there they are--as in \nthe case of a 2002 report on the effects of mercury on children's \nhealth that EPA delayed for 9 months and released only after it had \nbeen leaked to the media.\n  The George Bush Environmental Protection Agency has disregarded \nlegally mandated scientific and administrative procedures, as in the \ncase of the Agency's failure to abide by the Supreme Court's recent \ndecision on regulating greenhouse gas emissions.\n  The George Bush Environmental Protection Agency has stacked the EPA's \nleadership and its advisory committees with industry allies, removing \nrespected scientists who argued for stronger public protections. A \nprime example of this is the removal, at the request of the industry \nlobbying group the American Chemistry Council, of toxicologist Deborah \nRice from an EPA toxics advisory committee. Dr. Rice had argued for \nmore stringent EPA standards for regulating certain chemicals used in \ncommercially available plastic products. Not only was Dr. Rice removed \nfrom the panel, but her remarks on the panel were retroactively \nstricken from the record. EPA essentially took the fact that Dr. Rice \nhad ever been on the panel and struck it from the panel's records. \nThey, I guess, administratively ``disappeared'' her. It is not the kind \nof thing that happens in the country I know.\n  The George Bush Environmental Protection Agency has ignored the \nrecommendations of career staff and scientists when they collide with \nWhite House political imperatives, as in the case of the Agency's \ndecision on the so-called California waiver--first time ever not to \ngrant the waiver.\n  The George Bush EPA has reduced enforcement of environmental \nregulations by opening fewer criminal investigations and filing fewer \nlawsuits against corporate polluters.\n  The George Bush EPA has not only failed to protect but sought \nreprisals against agency employees who pointed out problems, reported \nlegal violations, and attempted to correct factual misrepresentations \nmade by their superiors.\n  Amazingly, the EPA's Office of General Counsel has invoked the \ndoctrine of sovereign immunity against whistleblowers suing the agency \nbecause of actions taken by the agency in reprisal for their \nwhistleblower activity. And, as a lawyer, as somebody who spent a good \ndeal of his life as a government lawyer, it pains me to see how the \nGeorge Bush EPA has had its lawyering literally mocked, mocked by the \nU.S. Circuit Courts of Appeal, which, in one case, condemned the EPA's \ndefense of its regulation as possible ``only in a Humpty-Dumpty \nworld,'' and in another case accused the agency of ``deploying the \nlogic of the Queen of Hearts'' from ``Alice in Wonderland'' in the \nagency's interpretation of the law.\n  It makes one's skin crawl to see the ways in which EPA's leadership \nunder the Bush administration has put the interest of big business and \ntheir lobbyists before the health and welfare of our environment and \nthe American people. This has dire consequences.\n  First, in a world that presents complex challenges to our public \nhealth, to our environment, and to our national security, the elevation \nof corporate interests over independent, science-based decisionmaking \nthreatens America's very ability to respond effectively and to provide \nthe kind of leadership on complex problems that the world expects and \nthat Americans deserve.\n  Second, the administration's conduct has demoralized EPA's \nprofessional workforce--the scientists, the lawyers, the regulatory \nexperts to whom EPA owes its reputation as a champion of environmental \nprotection. And time and time again during this administration they \nhave seen their expert counsel set aside in favor of a partisan \npolitical agenda.\n  Third, President Bush and this administration have compromised the \nfaith of the American people in the integrity of their Government. We \ncan disagree. This is a Chamber that is built for disagreement. We can \ndisagree on policy considerations; we can argue about what the right or \nthe wrong decision is to make. But it is a tragedy when we doubt the \nintegrity of the process of America's agencies of Government.\n  The President's eagerness to do the bidding of the special interests \nand the Administrator's willingness to kowtow to the White House, to \nthe detriment of sound public policy, only confirms what too many \nconsider fear that the United States of America is no longer governed \nby and for the people.\n  When policy is made for special interests and not for public good, \nAmerica is left weaker. No matter our partisan or ideological \nstandings, no one in this great Chamber, I hope, would want to do such \na thing to this great country.\n  The Bush administration has done lasting harm both to our environment \nand to the confidence of the American people. Next Wednesday, May 7, at \n9:30 a.m., I will join Senator Barbara Boxer, the chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, for an oversight hearing to \nlook into the actions by this Bush administration and the EPA \nAdministrator which seem to be so badly at odds with the \nrecommendations of the agency's scientists and the best interests of \nthe American people.\n  Chairman Boxer--we can be so proud of her--has been dogged, \nrelentless in her pursuit of the truth behind the screen of \nmachinations of the EPA's leadership and the Bush White House. And her \nleadership will continue to be critical as we try to get to the bottom \nof this issue. We plan to ask the tough questions, and we will expect \nhonest answers because the American people deserve an Environmental \nProtection Agency that lives up to that name.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Would the Senator yield for a comment and a \ncouple of questions?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I will yield.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island for his extraordinary, eloquent, and very insightful \ncomment into some of the machinations behind closed doors that we have \nseen going on in this administration that absolutely perplexes the \nmind; that governmental agencies that are set up for the purpose of \nserving the people and protecting the public and, indeed, the EPA is \nsupposed to be the Environmental Protection Agency, that they go off on \nthese half-cocked ideological ideas.\n  The Senator has said it so eloquently. I thank him for it. I thank \nhim for his leadership. I thank him for calling attention to the \nhearing that is\n\n[[Page S3741]]\n\ngoing to be held next week. And as the Senator has been speaking--and I \nhave been mesmerized by what he said--completely off the top of my head \nI remember, for example, 3 years ago the EPA decided that it was going \nto do a study in my State, in Jacksonville, FL.\n  Now, get this. You will not believe this. It was going to expose \ntoddlers to pesticides to see what the effects were. And, of course, \nwhere do you think those toddlers were going to be? They were going to \nbe in a minority neighborhood. It was going to be in a low-income \nneighborhood. And the EPA had concocted this scheme. It was sending out \nthese flyers.\n  In order to get a household to participate, it said: We want you to \nparticipate in this study. I cannot remember the amount of money they \nwould pay, but they were going to give them a T-shirt; they were going \nto give them a certificate that they completed this process over \nseveral months; and they were given a camcorder that then, at the end \nof the study, if they successfully completed it, they would keep. And \nthe study was, they were going to put pesticides all over this house \nand see what the effects were on these toddlers. This was the purpose \nof the study.\n  You could not believe it. I happened to discover it about the same \ntime that the chairman of the environment committee--she was not the \nchair then. Senator Boxer was the ranking member. And the two of us \ncollaborated. We had a press conference. We blew this thing sky high. \nAs a matter of fact, now that it is coming back to me, Senator Boxer \nheld up the nomination of the newly appointed EPA Administrator until \nhe finally relented and said he was not going to have this study before \nshe would allow the confirmation. Yet he ``bumfuddled'' around and \ntried to dodge and weave and not even answer the question. I mean, it \ndefies description.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island has given a number of examples, and \nthat one leapt to my mind. I want to give the Senator from Rhode Island \nanother example.\n  In the little agency that I cherish so much, the National Aeronautics \nand Space Administration, can you believe that one of the most \ndistinguished and noted scientists in that institution of NASA, Dr. \nHansen, little underlings in the PR department of NASA--and when I say \nlittle underlings, I don't remember what their job description was, but \nI think they were in their twenties. They had the audacity to go in and \nchange the wording on Dr. Hansen's conclusions with regard to a climate \nchange study.\n  Finally, this came out. Ultimately, his words were restored.\n  I will give you another example in that little agency. They have an \ninspector general in NASA who is just running amok. There was a theft \nof a $2 billion rocket design in the NASA computers, and he refused to \ninvestigate. Then when the rest of us tried to get him dismissed, the \nbuddy-buddy club wouldn't allow him to be fired.\n  I will give you another example. This will just blow your mind. For \nyears, the Florida Everglades have been on the endangered list in a \nlist that is kept by the United Nations, a list of the most \nenvironmentally endangered sites in the world. A third-ranking \nDepartment of State employee took it upon himself, in a conference in \nNew Zealand, to speak and to have the Florida Everglades stricken from \nthe list of the most endangered environmental sites, something we work \non every day in Everglades restoration, in combination, the Federal \nGovernment with the State of Florida, in trying to restore the \nEverglades to something of what Mother Nature intended.\n  These are things that have popped into my mind of what we have seen \nover and over again, of the ideological rigidity, the excessive \npartisanship, which, when you combine the two, is lethal to common \nsense and to protection of the public. Yet that is what we have seen. \nThen when some of us, in our role of oversight, try to start changing \nit and get accountability and responsibility in the executive branch, \nthey won't do anything about it. The NASA IG is still there. That \nthird-tier Department of State employee was there until he finally \nretired. The EPA Administrator is still there. So here we are.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding. I thank him again for his eloquence \ntoday and for his service to our country in representing his State.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank my good friend from Florida.\n  I will close with the following point, which my friend Senator \nNelson, the distinguished Senator from Florida, calls to mind, because \nof his extraordinarily distinguished service to our country. He was \nwilling to put himself at great risk in the extraordinarily challenging \npursuit of becoming an astronaut for the United States of America. I \nmean, talk about the best and brightest. As we know from many \ntragedies, it is not only an extraordinarily challenging pursuit, it is \none where you do put your life very much at risk on behalf of the \nprogress of this country. He, in that very important way, and I, in a \nmuch slower way, share an important belief, which is that the \nGovernment of the United States of America, our American system of \ngovernment which has been passed down to us after a revolutionary war, \na civil war, two great world wars, the Great Depression, essentially \nintact and, indeed, improving through the decades and generations, is \none of God's great gifts to humankind. It is now in our hands, \nparticularly as we represent our States in this body. It is to be \ntreasured. It is to be viewed with respect. It is, indeed, to be viewed \nwith reverence.\n  The thing that, to me, is worst of all from his politics, from his \ncorruption, from his debasement of public service, is the lack of \nrespect, the lack of reverence for what we have been given, for what we \nhold in trust for ourselves and future generations. It has never been \nas low as it is now. But the light still burns, and we will continue to \ncall attention to the miscreancy that we find. Soon, in January, it \nwill be over.\n  I thank my friend from Florida and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/02/senate-section/article/S3741-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3741-S3742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FOREIGN CONTRACT PERSONNEL\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I came to the floor to discuss \nanother matter. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island. As a matter of \nfact, before the Senator from Rhode Island departs the Chamber, he \nmight want to hear what I came to talk about. It is actually a little \nsuccess story, but it is borne on another failure we have seen. This, I \nam sad to say, is a failure for American women who are contractor \npersonnel serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, when sexually assaulted, \nwhen raped. They have not been able to have their assailants \nprosecuted, as contractor personnel.\n  We dramatically brought this to light in a hearing about 3 weeks ago. \nTwo very courageous Americans stepped forward, one for the first time \npublicly. In her particular case, she had been drugged and then gang-\nraped by not only fellow American contractor personnel, KBR, a \nsubsidiary of Halliburton, but in that case also participated in by \nmembers of the military. When she tried to seek help, it was all swept \nunder the rug, and in her particular case, she did not even get any \nmedical attention until 3 weeks later.\n  Well, the little success story we have, Mr. President, is that in the \npassage of the Defense Authorization Act, which occurred on Wednesday \nin the Armed Services Committee, there is inserted a new requirement \nunder law. That requirement is that contractors to the Department of \nDefense--and, mind you, we have tens of thousands of those contractors \nin Iraq and Afghanistan--No. 1, will be required to report the offenses \nof sexual assault to the appropriate investigative authorities; No. 2, \nthey will have the responsibility of providing victim and witness \nprotection and assistance to contractor employees.\n  If we can maintain that position in the Defense authorization bill as \nit works its way here to the floor of the Senate and then to work out \nthe final product with the House--and I think we will be able to \nprotect this because who is going to vote against it--that is one \nlittle happy victory that will give some additional protection to \nAmerican women who are serving in harm's way, who are not members of \nthe military but, in fact, are Americans serving overseas as \ncontractors to the military.\n  Over and over, the testimony was they are assaulted, they cannot find\n\n[[Page S3742]]\n\nsomeone who will investigate; if they have any evidence--in other \nwords, they have been able to get to a doctor and have the evidence \nfrom a rape kit--indeed, that evidence is lost, the counseling is not \nthere, and they are left on their own.\n  The United States military actually has done a pretty good job of \nthis for military personnel, not so with contractor personnel. There \nare laws on the books that protect contractor personnel. But out of the \n26 known cases we know of, of raping American women--contractor \npersonnel--not one of them has been prosecuted.\n  So the amending of the Defense Authorization Act with this new \nrequirement will require--you would think common sense would tell you \nthe contractors would do this. But, no. In 26 alleged cases, there has \nnot been one prosecution, and certainly no conviction. So it is my hope \nthis will mandate to the contractors they have to report the offenses \nand they have to provide the victims and witnesses protection and \nassistance.\n  In this one case, which was so dramatic, Mrs. Dawn Leamon had come \nforth for the first time when she testified to our subcommittee. The \nintimidation of her not doing anything about this gang rape was so \nsevere that when she finally left the forward operating base to go to \nanother forward operating base, where she could first seek assistance, \nshe was given a thumb drive of photographs. Normally, these would just \nbe photographs of the fellow contractors and so forth.\n  But let me tell you what one of those photographs was. And one day I \nam going to bring that photograph over here in its blown-up form, which \nwe showed in the committee, so that the Senate can see how dramatic \nthis is. There are three of her male contractor personnel. As they are \nall three facing the camera, one of them is like this, another one is \nlike this, and the third one is like this: Hear no evil, see no evil, \nspeak no evil--a message that there is no sense in her trying to do \nanything, that they do not know anything.\n  This is the kind of lack of protection that is allowed to have been \ngoing on that has to stop. I thank Senator Levin, the chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee, and Senator Warner, who is the acting ranking \nmember of the Armed Services Committee, for letting this Senator bring \nthat to the attention of our committee when we marked up and amended \nthe Defense authorization bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would ordinarily ask consent to proceed to \na bill prior to filing a cloture motion on the motion to proceed. But I \nwill not do so today because there is no one on the other side to \nobject.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/02/senate-section/article/S3742-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nFLOOD INSURANCE REFORM AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2007--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Recod.\n  There being on objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2970\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Climate Change Drinking \n     Water Adaptation Research Act.''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the consensus among climate scientists is overwhelming \n     that climate change is occurring more rapidly than can be \n     attributed to natural causes, and that significant impacts to \n     the water supply are already occurring;\n       (2) among the first and most critical of those impacts will \n     be change to patterns of precipitation around the world, \n     which will affect water availability for the most basic \n     drinking water and domestic water needs of populations in \n     many areas of the United States;\n       (3) drinking water utilities throughout the United States, \n     as well as those in Europe, Australia, and Asia, are \n     concerned that extended changes in precipitation will lead to \n     extended droughts;\n       (4) supplying water is highly energy-intensive and will \n     become more so as climate change forces more utilities to \n     turn to alternative supplies;\n       (5) energy production consumes a significant percentage of \n     the fresh water resources of the United States;\n       (6) since 2003, the drinking water industry of the United \n     States has sponsored, through a nonprofit water research \n     foundation, various studies to assess the impacts of climate \n     change on drinking water supplies;\n       (7) those studies demonstrate the need for a comprehensive \n     program of research into the full range of impacts on \n     drinking water utilities, including impacts on water \n     supplies, facilities, and customers;\n       (8) that nonprofit water research foundation is also \n     coordinating internationally with other drinking water \n     utilities on shared research projects and has hosted \n     international workshops with counterpart European and Asian \n     water research organizations to develop a unified research \n     agenda for applied research on adaptive strategies to address \n     climate change impacts;\n       (9) research data in existence as of the date of enactment \n     of this Act--\n       (A) summarize the best available scientific evidence on \n     climate change;\n       (B) identify the implications of climate change for the \n     water cycle and the availability and quality of water \n     resources; and\n       (C) provide general guidance on planning and adaptation \n     strategies for water utilities; and\n       (10) given uncertainties about specific climate changes in \n     particular areas, drinking water utilities need to prepare \n     for a wider range of likely possibilities in managing and \n     delivery of water.\n\n     SEC. 3.

and\n       (iii) increasing ranges of pathogens, algae, and nuisance \n     organisms resulting from warmer temperatures; and\n       (B) on mitigating increasing damage to watersheds and water \n     quality by evaluating extreme events, such as wildfires and \n     hurricanes, to learn and develop management approaches to \n     mitigate--\n       (i) permanent watershed damage;\n       (ii) quality and yield impacts on source waters; and\n       (iii) increased costs of water treatment;\n       (2) impacts on groundwater supplies from carbon \n     sequestration, including research to evaluate potential water \n     quality consequences of carbon sequestration in various \n     regional aquifers, soil conditions, and mineral deposits;\n       (3) water quantity impacts and solutions, including \n     research--\n       (A) to evaluate climate change impacts on water resources \n     throughout hydrological basins of the United States;\n       (B) to improve the accuracy and resolution of climate \n     change models at a regional level;\n       (C) to identify and explore options for increasing \n     conjunctive use of aboveground and underground storage of \n     water; and\n       (D) to optimize operation of existing and new reservoirs in \n     diminished and erratic periods of precipitation and runoff;\n       (4) infrastructure impacts and solutions for water \n     treatment facilities and underground pipelines, including \n     research--\n       (A) to evaluate and mitigate the impacts of sea level rise \n     on--\n       (i) near-shore facilities;\n       (ii) soil drying and subsidence; and\n       (iii) reduced flows in water and wastewater pipelines; and\n       (B) on ways of increasing the resilience of existing \n     infrastructure and development of new design standards for \n     future infrastructure;\n       (5) desalination, water reuse, and alternative supply \n     technologies, including research--\n       (A) to improve and optimize existing membrane technologies, \n     and to identify and develop breakthrough technologies, to \n     enable the use of seawater, brackish groundwater, treated \n     wastewater, and other impaired sources;\n       (B) into new sources of water through more cost-effective \n     water treatment practices in recycling and desalination;

A bill to provide additional funds for affordable housing \nfor low-income seniors, disabled persons, and others who lost their \nhomes as a result of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak on \nbehalf of some of our most in need gulf coast residents impacted by \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita. As you know the gulf coast was devastated \nin 2005 by two of the most powerful storms to ever hit the U.S. in \nrecorded history--Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. We also experienced the \nunprecedented disaster of having a major metropolitan city--the City of \nNew Orleans--under up to 20 feet of water for two weeks when there were \n28 separate levee failures which flooded 12,000 acres, or 80 percent of \nNew Orleans, following Katrina.\n  In particular, I am speaking on behalf of our elderly and disabled \nresidents impacted by these disasters. Many of these people are too \nfrail or fragile to live on their own, yet they do not belong in a \nhospital. We have many people who been in seen homes or apartments for \ndisabled and elderly residents, for adults who are not older but \ninstead disabled through an accident or injury. In many cities, this \ntype of housing is run by such organizations as Catholic Charities or \nother nonprofits. Right now in the gulf coast region, we desperately \nneed more of this type of housing to take care of the most fragile \npeople who either are without shelter or are without safe, affordable \nshelter with appropriate supportive services. One can imagine the \nchallenges of providing sufficient housing for this group under normal \ncircumstances. But here we find ourselves, dealing with the aftermath \nof a catastrophe, trying to provide additional housing for thousands of \npeople now returning to the region.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, 88,000 persons aged \n65 or older were displaced by Hurricane Katrina--of that group 45,000 \nwere 75 years of age or older. Furthermore, almost 15 percent of all \ndisplaced seniors had incomes below the poverty line. While recovery \nhas primarily focused on restoring owner-occupied and rental housing, \nU.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, assisted housing \nfor our elderly and disabled residents has not received a great deal of \nattention. In particular, 123 properties of Section 202 housing, which \nserves elderly residents, and Section 811 housing, which serves \ndisabled residents, were impacted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in my \nState alone. This includes 5,261 total units of 202/811 housing. As of \nFebruary 2008, 602 of these units were still offline and I am aware \nthat, for every unit of 202 housing, there are 10 eligible low-income \nseniors on the waiting list.\n  To further highlight the ongoing needs of the gulf coast, let me \nprovide a snapshot of one community in my State--New Orleans East. In \nour Vietnamese community in New Orleans East, 6,000 people--or \napproximately 95 percent of the pre-Katrina population--have returned \nto the area. Of this 6,000,\n\n[[Page S3745]]\n\nit is estimated that 2,400 are seniors. The average age of these \nseniors is 72 years of age and 98 percent are considered extremely low-\nincome according to HUD standards. This means that they earn below 30 \npercent of the area median income a year, or less than $12,550 a year. \nOf these seniors 82 percent receive supplemental security income as \ntheir only source of income--approximately $637 per month for a single \nhousehold.\n  Prior to Katrina, there were six retirement communities in New \nOrleans East, consisting of about 735 units, serving this community. \nPresently none of them are in operation. This is not just a short-term \nrecovery problem as the demand for age-restricted housing will continue \nto increase in the next few years, particularly in New Orleans East.\n\n  Given the ongoing needs in the southern part of my State in regard to \ndamaged multifamily and senior/disabled housing, as well as all across \nthe Gulf Coast, I am proud to introduce today the Gulf Coast \nMultifamily and Assisted Housing Recovery Act of 2008. I am joined on \nthis bill by my colleagues Senator Thad Cochran and Senator Roger \nWicker. This legislation includes some key provisions which should \ntarget assistance where it is most needed. The bill will also help to \ncut through some Federal red tape stalling redevelopment efforts in the \nregion.\n  To address the affordable housing needs in my State, as well as \nacross the gulf coast, our bill authorizes $125 million for additional \nSection 202 housing and $75 million for new Section 811 housing. This \nprovision would create almost 1,500 new 202/811 units. The bill would \nalso authorize $4 million to cover gaps for the redevelopment of former \nSection 202 housing in the City of New Orleans and St. Bernard Parish.\n  Another major problem in New Orleans East is that 50 seniors were \nliving pre-Katrina at Versailles Arms, a project-based Section 8 \nhousing development which has not reopened. I understand that a few \nweeks ago the community boarded up the development. While this property \nis sitting vacant--but vacant with a project-based contract still \nattached to it--Mary Queen of Viet Nam Community Development \nCorporation, MQVN, and Providence Community Housing have begun work on \nPhase I of the Mary Queen of Viet Nam Retirement Community. This \nproject would provide 84 units of affordable senior housing. Their \nproblem, however, is with the downturn in the tax credit market in the \nlast 4 months, the equity investment will not be sufficient to cover \nthe development costs. For example, the current rent structure, which \nis below the market rates, is not sufficient to support a mortgage to \ncover the development gap, so they are in need of a project-based \nsubsidy to complete the project.\n  MQVN have been trying to work with our local housing authority, the \nHousing Authority of New Orleans, HANO, to secure project-based \nassistance for this project. However, as many of our developers have \ndiscovered, HANO has exhausted its 20 percent maximum set aside for \nproject-based subsidies. This is troubling for those of us in Congress, \nespecially for my colleagues and I who are members of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee. Last year, via the fiscal year 08 \nSupplemental Appropriations bill, we provided HANO with additional \nvouchers by allowing HUD to utilize pre-Katrina population figures in \nallocating Section 8 vouchers, rather than post-Katrina population \nfigures. While there certainly are increased demands for such \nassistance, the fact that so many developments are in need of this type \nof assistance and that HANO lacks the necessary resources to fully \naddress needs on the ground raises many questions. For my part, I do \nnot have all the answers but I can provide a commonsense solution to \naddress the need for project-based assistance in New Orleans and the \nrest of the gulf coast.\n  Each year, in the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development \nAppropriations bill, there has regularly been legislative authority for \nHUD to transfer some or all project-based assistance associated with \none or more multifamily housing projects to another multifamily housing \nproject or projects. In the fiscal year 06 Appropriations bill, Public \nLaw 109-115, Section 318 addressed this issue, and in the fiscal year \n08 Omnibus Appropriations bill, Public Law 110-161, which passed the \nCongress in December 2007, this language was contained in Section 215. \nWhile this language is discretionary, not mandatory, it does provide \nHUD with the legislative authority to transfer project-based assistance \nfrom a damaged or vacant property to another property, with certain \nrestrictions. However, as I mentioned, this annual language is \ndiscretionary so HUD is not required to review and approve transfer \nrequests. This has proven to be the main obstacle for housing \norganizations. Some of these properties have been destroyed and, rather \nthan asking for new project-based contracts, the developers simply want \nto transfer the existing ones to new buildings. This would maximize \nexisting resources, and in many cases, could help communities build \nhousing which could better resist future disasters.\n\n  While HUD currently has this transfer authority, there have been \nnumerous instances post-Katrina where HUD has failed to quickly \nimplement such transfers. For example, Mississippi Methodist Senior \nServices, MMSS, is a nonprofit which, despite testifying before \nCongress last year, ended up having its Section 318 transfer request \nrejected by HUD. It subsequently lost 65 units of elderly housing. This \nis even more troubling as MMSS was the first non-profit in Mississippi \nto provide affordable housing for seniors. So this is a group with \nextensive experience in senior housing--one with deep roots in the \ncommunity. The nonprofit had seven properties throughout the State, \nserving 1,800 seniors daily. One of its properties in Biloxi had \nsignificant wind damage and suffered 2 feet of Gulf water on the first \nfloor. Upon further inspection, there was additional damage found and \ntheir insurance company determined it would only cover repairs on the \nfirst floor. This left MMSS with an uninhabitable building and a $1 \nmillion gap between insurance and the amount that was necessary for \nrepairs.\n  To redevelop the property and provide badly needed housing, MMSS \nintended to transfer the 65 units of project-based assistance to a new \nsite further inland. The new site would be in a better position to \navoid gulf coast waves and weather patterns. As with most gulf coast \ngroups in this situation, MMSS submitted a Section 318 request and \nstarted working with HUD to prepay the existing mortgage, sell the \nproperty, and transfer the Section 8 contract. However, in December \n2006, HUD eventually refused the transfer, forcing MMSS to abandon the \ncontract and sell the property. This resulted in the loss of housing \nfor 65 elderly families. Our observation of these failures has led us \nto believe there is a need for Congress to enact stronger legislation \non this issue.\n  To address this issue, the legislation I am introducing would tackle \nthis problem in three important ways. First, this bill would require \nHUD to maintain project-based contracts in declared Katrina and Rita \nareas until the date specified in the contract or not less than 3 \nmonths after the property is made habitable. This provision would \nensure that there is no loss of current project-based contracts. Next, \nthe bill would require HUD to review and approve any feasible transfer \nproposal made by owners of damaged/destroyed multifamily housing. The \nlanguage in this bill tracks Section 215 language from the fiscal year \n08 Omnibus, except that we limit this requirement for Alabama, \nMississippi, and Louisiana and sunset it on October 1, 2009. These \nrestrictions are to ensure that it is strictly for recovery purposes. \nLastly, to get a full picture of the number of units that may have been \nlost, the bill requires that HUD report to Congress on the number and \nlocation of project-based contracts which have been cancelled since the \nstorms. These key provisions would make a real difference not only for \nMQVN in New Orleans East but for countless providers of multifamily \nhousing across the gulf coast.\n  As chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Disaster \nRecovery, I have been working with my Senate colleagues to push for \nbetter Federal Government disaster preparedness. Therefore, in addition \nto addressing current needs on the gulf coast, the bill also looks \nforward to future disasters. This bill requires that, not later than \nJune 1, 2008--the start of the 2008 Atlantic Hurricane season--that HUD\n\n[[Page S3746]]\n\nprovide Congress with a disaster response plan for HUD-assisted Section \n202/811 properties. A number of recommendations have been made to HUD \nby the affordable housing community on regulatory waivers and funding \ngaps that the agency will face in future disaster situations. There is \nno reason that HUD, or Congress for that matter, should have to expend \nfuture resources, time, and energy to address some of the similar \nissues which this bill is attempting to address for Katrina and Rita \nareas. Lessons learned from Katrina and Rita have been well documented \nby Congress. It is now time that HUD improves its preparedness and \nresponse to disasters which could impact assisted properties.\n  In closing, let me reiterate that this bill addresses one of the most \nfundamental needs following a disaster: the need to return home. For \nour elderly and disabled residents, a safe and affordable home is even \nmore essential. Many gulf coast residents lost homes, family members, \nand pets, among other things. It is our obligation as a city, county/\nparish, State, and as a nation to help. So I am here today, for my \npart, to try to put forward legislation which I strongly believe will \nmake a real difference for those most in need in the gulf coast region. \nI urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan recovery legislation as \nthese disaster victims are counting on the United States Senate for \naction.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nsupplemental material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2975\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

I am Alan Brown, the Vice President of Operations and \n     Chief Operating Officer of Mississippi Methodist Senior \n     Services (MMSS). Mississippi Methodist Senior Services has 11 \n     campuses across the state of Mississippi and we serve 1,800 \n     seniors on a daily basis. Our organization was one of the \n     first in Mississippi to provide HUD housing for seniors and \n     have been for 40 years. Currently, seven of our campuses have \n     HUD subsidized housing communities, serving very low-income \n     seniors.\n       Our organization is a member of the American Association of \n     Homes and Services for the Aging (AAHSA), a 5,700 member \n     association representing not-for-profit providers throughout \n     the continuum of senior care: adult day services, home \n     health, community services, senior housing, assisted living \n     residences, continuing care retirement communities, and \n     nursing homes. AAHSA members serve as many as two million \n     people every day through mission-driven, not-for-profit \n     organizations dedicated to providing the services people \n     need, when they need them, in the place they call home.\n\n\n              Demographics and Need of Seniors in the Gulf\n\n       A Congressional Research Service report from November 2005 \n     found that the ``the aged may have been especially affected \n     by Katrina'' and estimated that 88,000 persons age 65 or \n     older were displaced by the storm and of those, 45,000 were \n     75 and older. Almost 15% of all displaced seniors had incomes \n     below the poverty line. Approximately 48% of the displaced \n     seniors reported having at least one disability, and 26% \n     reported two or more types of disabilities, including those \n     that require an array of supportive and health services.\n       An estimated 70% of seniors throughout the Gulf owned their \n     own homes and most had lived in their homes for 20 or more \n     years. Among the elderly renters that were living in \n     unsubsidized housing, 55% had lived in their rental \n     properties over 20 years. According to HUD there are 1,054 \n     assisted properties, over 47,000 units, in the areas affected \n     by the hurricanes. Of the assisted properties, 228 are \n     Section 202 elderly housing communities with almost 11,000 \n     units. Among those, one hundred properties, with 12,559 units \n     suffered severe damage. Seniors need these affordable, \n     supportive housing communities to be restored and functional \n     before they can return to the Gulf.\n\n\n           Mississippi Methodist Senior Services' Experience\n\n       On August 29, 2005, five of our campuses were damaged by \n     Hurricane Katrina. Our Seashore Retirement Community campus \n     in Biloxi, MS received the most damage. Seashore was located \n     on Beach Blvd. (Hwy 90) and consisted of 124 market rate \n     apartments, 42 assisted living units and a 65 unit HUD 202 \n     project with project based Section 8 rental subsidies. All \n     of the buildings had substantial damage but none more so \n     than the HUD building, Gulf Oaks Manor. In addition to \n     significant wind damage, Gulf Oaks had 2 feet of gulf \n     water on the first floor. Fifty-five of our residents \n     refused to leave the campus and rode out the storm with \n     the campus Executive Director who refused to leave them. \n     We were able to evacuate them on August 31, 2005 and \n     provided housing on our other campuses in North \n     Mississippi.\n       MMSS had what we considered to be good, comprehensive \n     insurance coverage, including flood overage. We immediately \n     began the process of restoring the campus. We deployed \n     resources from across the state and within three weeks had a \n     complete damage assessment of the property. We were able to \n     restore the market rate buildings and assisted living units \n     by mid October. Little did we know that our challenges with \n     our HUD 202 project were just beginning.\n       Inspections of the HUD building revealed that there was \n     water damage on the upper floors in addition to the flood \n     damage on the first floor. The heat and humidity following \n     the hurricane coupled with days of no utilities and air flow \n     had created a major mold problem. After weeks of inspections \n     and professional opinions, our insurance carrier determined \n     that the damage on the upper floors was pre-existing, not \n     related to the hurricane and would not be a covered loss. Our \n     insurance coverage would only cover the repairs to the first \n     floor. MMSS was left with an uninhabitable building and a $1-\n     million dollar gap between what the insurance covered and \n     what it would take to repair the building. In our initial \n     conversations with HUD representatives about how we could \n     solve this problem, we were told that:\n       HUD would not loan MMSS the money to cover the insurance \n     gap;\n       MMSS would not be permitted to borrow money from any other \n     source;\n       HUD would not forgive any of the debt in our original \n     Section 202 loan;\n       HUD would not allow MMSS to prepay the mortgage.\n       In spite of these restrictions, HUD informed us that they \n     did not want to lose the assisted housing units. The \n     Department recommended that MMSS find a buyer for the damaged \n     property and stated that any new buyer must continue the \n     property as a 202 project.\n       In addition, to our discussions with HUD to save the \n     property, MMSS researched additional resources to meet the \n     funding gap to repair the property. Our FEMA request for help \n     was denied because we were classified as a ``non-essential \n     service.'' With that status, we were advised to seek a Small \n     Business Administration loan, an option that was not \n     available to us because of our HUD financing. Essentially, we \n     had no options.\n       Eventually, we contacted the American Association of Homes \n     and Services for the Aging (AAHSA) and asked for help. AAHSA \n     immediately contacted senior HUD officials who made us aware \n     of a provision in the FY2006 appropriations legislation, \n     Section 318, which allowed for the relocation of project \n     based Section 8 contracts from non-viable, obsolete HUD \n     projects that had been damaged to new buildings. It seemed to \n     us that the provision was tailor made for our situation and \n     many other hurricane damaged properties. In March 2006, I met \n     with Hank Williams, Deputy Assistant Secretary for \n     Multifamily Housing and he encouraged us to apply for a \n     Section 318 transfer.\n       On March 31, 2006, we notified our Mississippi HUD office \n     that we would be requesting a Section 318 transfer of the \n     project-based Section 8 contract and provided our\n\n[[Page S3748]]\n\n     initial responses to the Section 318 requirements. About this \n     time, we received an unsolicited offer from a local developer \n     to purchase the entire campus. We accepted, contingent upon \n     our being able to obtain a relocation or release for the \n     property from HUD. We believed it was in the best interest of \n     our residents to build a new campus further inland that would \n     not be affected by future hurricanes. This offer would also \n     give us the opportunity to rebuild the HUD building in a \n     safer location at no additional cost to HUD. We planned to \n     have a new campus with a new HUD building and we could \n     restore 65 subsidized apartments for seniors on the Gulf \n     Coast which had been in existence since 1984.\n       On July 5, 2006, we submitted our formal Section 318 \n     request to HUD headquarters, outlining our plan and asked HUD \n     for dialogue on how we could make this happen. Weeks passed \n     and we heard nothing from HUD. On August 8, 2006, we once \n     again contacted AAHSA staff and asked for their help. On \n     August 17, 2006 AAHSA had a series of conversations with a \n     senior HUD staff member who assured them they were going to \n     make this happen. On August 29, 2006, after no contact from \n     HUD, we contacted Senator Thad Cochran's office and asked for \n     help. Our business interruption insurance coverage was ending \n     and financially we were fading fast. We needed to complete \n     this process to save the HUD project as well as the entire \n     campus. Senator Cochran's staff responded immediately and HUD \n     assured them that we were a priority. Weeks passed with no \n     response from HUD. At times when MMSS would request an update \n     from HUD, we were told that they were not sure what desk it \n     was on. On one occasion we were told they were waiting \n     because we did not send a hard copy of our paperwork and they \n     only had an electronic copy. We had submitted a hard copy and \n     it was electronically elevated by HUD staff according to \n     their own protocol. Senator Cochran's staff intervened again \n     in mid-September. They were assured our application was in \n     process.\n       On October 2, 2007, more than six months after our \n     notification of intent to pursue a Section 318 project based \n     Section 8 transfer and almost three months after our formal \n     request was submitted to HUD headquarters, we received a \n     letter form HUD notifying us that our Section 318 request had \n     been denied. I have attached correspondence outlining things \n     that would have to be done for the request to be \n     reconsidered. The items had not been communicated to us \n     previously and were either economically infeasible or \n     incapable of being completed for many months. At this point \n     our request had been denied, our insurance coverage was \n     exhausted and we were in jeopardy of losing the sale of the \n     entire property.\n       Throughout this process the Jackson, Mississippi HUD office \n     was very helpful. Thanks to that office we learned that our \n     contract, a pre-1984 HUD 202 contract, could actually be pre-\n     paid with 30 days notice and without HUD approval. After much \n     consideration, we felt this was our only option to continue \n     providing senior housing on the Gulf Coast. However, we \n     wanted to make one last effort to save the 65 Section 8 rent \n     subsidies and transfer them to a new building. We notified \n     HUD of our intent to pay-off the 202 mortgage and they gave \n     us the process to follow, including the notification letter \n     that we needed to send former residents to notify them of the \n     sale. In numerous phone conversations with HUD officials \n     in Washington, D.C., we repeatedly asked for permission to \n     transfer the Section 8 rental subsidies to a new building \n     so we could preserve those subsidies and continue serving \n     low-income residents at the new property. HUD informed us \n     that it had never been done before and despite having the \n     legal authority, they would have to get a legal opinion \n     and call us back. The next day they called back and told \n     us the Section 8 subsidies could be moved and they would \n     let us know the process. We were ecstatic that this would \n     allow us to restore the low income units on the Gulf Coast \n     and most importantly, offer our previous residents a \n     chance to return to MMSS on the new campus.\n       As we got closer to closing on the sale, HUD notified us \n     that the letter used to notify residents of the property sale \n     did not use the correct language. We reminded HUD that we had \n     used the exact letter that they had provided. Just before \n     closing, we inquired again about the process for moving the \n     Section 8 subsidies to a new building as HUD had said we \n     could do. We were told that HUD never agreed to that and that \n     the subsidies had to stay with the damaged building. In the \n     end, despite their insistence that HUD was committed to \n     preserving units and having the authority to transfer the \n     contract to a new, safer building, HUD essentially forced \n     USSM to give up project based Section 8 contract to complete \n     the sale of the campus.

Res. 550\n\n       Whereas, since 1993, the territorial integrity of the \n     Republic of Georgia has been reaffirmed by the international \n     community and 32 United Nations Security Council resolutions;\n       Whereas the Government of the Republic of Georgia has \n     pursued with good faith the peaceful resolution of \n     territorial conflicts in the regions of Abkhazia and South \n     Ossetia since the end of hostilities in 1993;\n       Whereas President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili has \n     offered a clear plan for resolving the conflict in Abkhazia \n     and securing legitimate interests of the Abkhaz and South \n     Ossetian people within a unified Georgia;\n       Whereas, for several years, the Government of Russia has \n     engaged in an ongoing process of usurping the sovereignty of \n     Georgia in Abkhazia and South Ossetia by awarding subsidies, \n     the right to vote in elections in Russia, and Russian \n     passports to people living in those regions;\n       Whereas the announcement of the Government of the Russian \n     Federation that it will establish ``official ties'' with the \n     breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia and further \n     involve itself in aspects of their government appears to be a \n     thinly veiled attempt at annexation;\n       Whereas the statements and counter-productive behavior of \n     the Government of the Russian Federation in these regions has \n     undermined the peace and security of those regions, the \n     Republic of Georgia, and the region as a whole; and\n       Whereas the consistent effort to undermine the sovereignty \n     of a neighbor is incompatible with the role of the Russian \n     Federation\n\n[[Page S3749]]\n\n     as one of the world's leading powers and is inconsistent with \n     the commitments to international peacekeeping made by the \n     Government of the Russian Federation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns recent decisions made by the Government of the \n     Russian Federation to establish ``official ties'' with the \n     breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, a process \n     that further impedes reconciliation between those regions and \n     the Government of Georgia and violates the sovereignty of the \n     Republic of Georgia and the commitments of the Government of \n     the Russian Federation to international peacekeeping;\n       (2) calls upon the Government of the Russian Federation to \n     disavow this policy, which gives the appearance of being \n     motivated by an appetite for annexation;\n       (3) affirms that the restoration of the territorial \n     integrity of the Republic of Georgia is in the interest of \n     all who seek peace and stability in the region;\n       (4) urges all parties to the conflicts in the Republic of \n     Georgia and governments around the world to eschew rhetoric \n     that escalates tensions and undermines efforts to negotiate a \n     settlement to the conflicts; and\n       (5) commends the Government of Georgia for acting with \n     restraint in the face of serious provocation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/02/senate-section/article/S3749-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4654.
