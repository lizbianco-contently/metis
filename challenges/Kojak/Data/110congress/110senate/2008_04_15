Mr. President, this week we welcome his Holiness, Pope \nBenedict XVI, for his first visit to America as Pope.\n  Here in Washington, Pope Benedict will meet the President at the \nWhite House, marking only the second time in America's history that a \npontiff has visited the White House. He will offer Mass at the newly \nopened Nationals Park, and deliver an address at Catholic University.\n  Pope Benedict will then travel to New York, where he will address the \nUnited Nations, visit Ground Zero, site of the devastating 9/11 \nterrorist attacks, and say Mass at Yankee Stadium.\n  During his visit, the Pope will also champion a brotherhood of faith \nbetween the religions, by meeting with leaders from the Buddhist, \nMuslim, Hindu, Jewish, and other faiths.\n  The Pope's visit observes some important anniversaries. Wednesday, \nApril 16, will be his 81st birthday, and Saturday, the 19th, will mark \nthe third anniversary of his election as Pope.\n  His visit also coincides with the 200th anniversary of four of the \noldest dioceses in the United States, one of which was established in \nmy own State of Kentucky. Two hundred years ago this month, Pope Pius \nVII carved the Diocese of Bardstown from one of the oldest dioceses in \nthe New World.\n  The territory of the Bardstown Diocese once covered a giant swath of \nland, including what are now the States of Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio, \nIndiana, Illinois, Michigan, Iowa, Wisconsin, Missouri, and half of \nArkansas.\n  The Bardstown Diocese was established alongside the dioceses of \nBoston, Philadelphia, and New York. Its seat was eventually moved to \nLouisville, KY, and made an archdiocese. But its place in the history \nof American Catholicism continues to be a point of pride across \nKentucky.\n\n[[Page S2986]]\n\n  Kentuckians celebrate this bicentennial throughout the year at the \nSt. Thomas Church, considered the ``Cradle of Catholicism'' in the \nBluegrass State and still located in Bardstown. A two-story log house \nthat stands on St. Thomas' property is the oldest structure related to \nthe Catholic faith in our region of the United States.\n  Built in 1795 by Thomas and Ann Howard, the property was willed to \nthe church by Mr. Howard in 1810, and it became the first home of the \nSt. Thomas Seminary, the first seminary west of the Alleghenies. It \nlater served as the residence of Bishop Benedict Joseph Flaget, first \nbishop of the Bardstown Diocese.\n  Bishop Flaget and others who worked to establish the Bardstown \nDiocese were pioneers of the land as well as of the spirit. Kentucky \nwas the western frontier of the young United States at that time, and \nfrontier life posed many hardships.\n  Yet Bishop Flaget successfully made his work and presence felt \nthroughout the diocese, and the St. Thomas Church still cites his \ninfluence today, two centuries later.\n  The resolve and faith displayed by the founders of that Bardstown \nDiocese are the same resolve and faith that have enabled so many other \nCatholic missionaries to attract more than 1 billion adherents to the \nCatholic faith.\n  As the Bishop of Rome, the Pope's leadership inspires millions with \nconfidence that mankind can find God's will amidst the chaos of this \nworld.\n  Yet, for all the obvious affection people show him, Pope Benedict \nwould be the first to recognize that he is merely ``a simple, humble \nlaborer in the vineyard of the Lord.''\n  We are honored by his visit. And in Bardstown, Washington or \nelsewhere, we welcome Pope Benedict VXI to bring his labors to America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, most Americans view April 15 as a sort \nof national anti-holiday, when they are forced to take a hard look at \nhow much of their money goes into a Washington spending machine instead \nof their childrens' education or their gas tank.\n  It is worth noting that most people don't dread tax day as much as \nthey used to; as much as they did before Republican policies \nsignificantly reduced the share of the family budget that goes from \ntaxpayer wallets to the Treasury Department.\n  According to a recent Gallup poll, 43 percent of middle income \nearners say they are paying too much in taxes--43 percent, but still \nfar fewer than the 59 percent who thought they were being overtaxed 7 \nyears ago.\n  The reason for the drop-off isn't too hard to figure out: The reason \na lot fewer people think their tax burden is too high is that their tax \nburden is a lot lower than it was 6 years ago.\n  Married couples and families with children have benefited from tax \ncredits, tens of millions of Americans have benefited from tax cuts on \ndividends and capital gains, including more than 250,000 people in \nKentucky.\n  And that is why it's critical that middle class Americans understand \nthe path that Democrats are headed down.\n  At a time when the economy is slowing and Americans are paying record \nprices for food, gas, and healthcare, our Democrat friends are \npreparing the largest tax hike in U.S. history--nearly three times \nlarger than the previous record.\n  We saw the plan last month in a budget that only one Democrat in the \nSenate voted against, a blueprint that raises taxes on middle class \nfamilies by $2,300 a year.\n  Our friends won't admit this is a tax hike; they won't say they're \nraising taxes; they plan to do it quietly, by letting all the recently \nenacted tax cuts and credits that Americans have benefited from over \nthe past several years expire.\n  If you ask about it, they will tell you these tax cuts were only for \nthe rich anyway.\n  Don't listen to them--unless, of course, you think 43 million \nAmerican families with children who will pay thousands more in taxes \nunder the Democrat budget are rich, and should be taxed more; or that \nall 18 million seniors who will pay thousands more in taxes under the \nDemocrat budget are rich and should be taxed more; or that every owner \nof the 27 million small businesses in the U.S. who will have to pay \n$4,100 more in taxes under the Democrat budget are rich and should be \ntaxed more.\n\n  Under the budget that every Democrat in the Senate but one voted for \nlast month, taxes will go up on anyone who makes more than $34,000. Are \nthese people rich? Should they pay more in taxes?\n  The first-year teacher in Louisville who makes $35,982--is he or she \nrich? Does he or she need to be taxed more? I will bet they don't think \nso.\n  How about the veteran teacher with a Ph.D. who maxes out at $73,418--\nis he or she rich? Does he or she need to be taxed more? I will bet \nthey don't think so.\n  Our Democrat friends have their own answer to these questions: they \nvoted for an amendment last month that extends tax breaks on married \ncouples and children.\n  The problem, of course, is that they voted for a similar amendment \nlast year, and then they didn't do a thing about it. They had no \nintention of making it into law.\n  So if past experience is any indication of future events, our friends \nwon't act on the amendment this year either. They cast a vote that's \nintended to appeal to working families, but their record shows they \nwon't follow through by actually doing anything about it.\n  As Americans struggle to pay the bills and millions worry about \nfalling home values and whether they will even be able to keep their \nhomes, they should be able to expect more from Congress than political \ncover votes and class warfare rhetoric.\n  All the recently enacted tax cuts will soon expire. These cuts have \nhelped tens of millions of American families and seniors. These folks \nshould know what is coming. And Democrats in Washington should relent \non their plans to return to the bad old days when 60 percent of them \nthought their tax bills were too high.\n  That is the road our friends on the other side are taking us down. \nThey\n\n[[Page S2987]]\n\nhave shown us the blueprint. It certainly was not written with working \nfamilies in mind.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/15/senate-section/article/S2987-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today millions of Americans are reminded \nabout Ben Franklin's poignant observation: Nothing is certain but death \nand taxes.\n  Today families across the Nation are being forced to tighten their \nbelts as the Federal Government takes more and more of their hard-\nearned money. For working families, the tax bill that comes due every \nApril 15 is often a tremendous burden. In fact, the average American \npays more in taxes than it spends on food, shelter, clothing, and \ntransportation combined.\n  For American families, tax day is a real eye opener. This year, \nfamilies will work the first 113 days of the year to pay their Federal, \nState, and local taxes. Unfortunately, this year tax day has come \naround when families are facing spiking energy, housing, and health \ncare costs, runaway college tuition, and high rising prices for \nconsumer goods.\n  While the Senate has acted to help these families in the short term, \nthe stimulus and housing relief bills, a long-term fix is a long way \noff and badly needed. We should support long-term economic growth \npolicies that lower taxes, create more jobs, and grow our American \neconomy.\n  Our distinguished minority leader, the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. \nMcConnell, has outlined the dangers of going back to a high-tax era. We \nall know that the tax reductions adopted by Congress in 2003 which gave \nrelief for capital gains taxes encouraged more small businesses to \ninvest, gave them the resources to grow, and small businesses are the \ndynamic engine of this country.\n  That tax relief provided some 8.4 million new jobs. But as Senator \nMcConnell said, my friends on the other side of the aisle have proposed \na budget that includes the largest tax increase in American history and \nwould raise taxes on every American taxpayer by doing nothing, \nintentionally doing nothing.\n  The plan of the Democrats raises taxes on the average American family \nby $2,300 a year. A $2,300 increase in taxes will be a devastating hit \nto American families. For families in Missouri and across the Nation, \nthis is $2,300 they will no longer be able to use to buy groceries, put \ngas in their car, pay tuition, or purchase prescription drugs. And, as \nSenator McConnell pointed out, there will be an even larger tax \nincrease on small businesses--small businesses that we expect to create \nthe new jobs we will continue to need as our economy and technology \nevolves.\n  Unfortunately, not only are taxes getting higher, they are getting \nmore complicated. According to the President's panel on tax reform, \nthere have been more than 14,000 changes to the Tax Code since 1986. \nWith all of these changes, it is no wonder that the average time burden \nfor all taxpayers filing a 1040 is 30 hours, and now more than 6 in 10 \nAmericans hire someone to help prepare their returns every year.\n  So in addition to taking 113 days in wages, the Federal Government \nrequires you to spend an initial day and even more money to hire a \nprofessional to make sense of what you owe. It is a daunting task for \nanyone, particularly if they have a family and business activities to \nmake sense of what they owe.\n  In January, I introduced a radical solution, and I think the time has \ncome for a radical solution to bring some common sense to this process. \nMy bill, the Fair and Simple Tax Act, will simplify the Tax Code and \nhelp American families keep more of their paychecks. It will get rid of \nthe AMT and the double calculations middle-income taxpayers must make. \nIt will eliminate higher tax rates, get rid of the myriad targeted \nreductions, credit givebacks, phase-ins, phase-outs, and other special \ninterest provisions.\n  The Fair and Simple Tax Act will provide a simpler, lower, flat \nincome tax option, as well as offer historic tax relief for families \nand businesses to create jobs for American workers.\n  This bill will reduce the tax rate on families and the employers who \ncreate jobs, make permanent existing tax relief, keep current \ndeductions for home mortgage interest and charitable deductions, but \ngive Americans more control over their health care by providing tax \nrelief to individuals and families who do not now have access to \nemployer-provided health care.\n  Also, my bill will eliminate the death tax which is a significant \nburden for farmers and small businesses.\n  The best fiscal policy is economic growth, job creation, and keeping \ntaxes low for middle-class families. And the best economic or fiscal \npolicy is also the best social policy. There is no better policy than \nassuring a good-paying job for hard-working Americans.\n  The last thing our economy needs right now is a tax increase, which \nis what Americans will receive when the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts expire. \nAnd you know what will happen. It will not only be a tax increase on \nindividual families; by increasing significantly taxes on small \nbusiness, it is going to curb job growth, it is going to cut the \nability of people to find a job.\n  Let me be clear. Unless we stop this looming tax hike, which would be \nthe largest in history, more than 2 million Missouri families will face \nhigher tax bills. My bill would prevent the family-budget-killing tax \nhikes. My bill would simplify the tax rate for millions of Americans. \nMy bill would mean tax relief and real money back into the pockets of \nAmerican families.\n  Let's get real about taxes and bring back some common sense to a Tax \nCode that is too complex, too confusing, and too costly. This plan will \ngive American taxpayers what they need: a fairer system that puts more \nof their own money back in their pocketbooks and takes off their back \nthe hassle of April 15.\n  I ask for the support of my colleagues in bringing a radical but \nsimple commonsense reform to our Tax Code.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, 20 years ago today, Senator Malcolm \nWallop of Wyoming came to the Senate floor to speak about the tax \nburden Americans face. He came to the floor because it was April 15, \ntax day. He came to extend his sympathies to the many, as he called it, \n``frustrated taxpayers who were probably at this minute,'' he said, \n``sweating bullets over a form 1040 while gnawing through yet another \npencil.''\n  He spoke 2 years after Congress enacted the landmark 1986 tax reform \nbill, legislation intended to reform and simplify the Code and make the \nchaos of past April 15s mere memories. That legislation did not reform \nthe Tax Code, and it fell far short of tax simplification.\n  Senator Wallop voted against final passage, and he knew that history \nwould be on his side.\n  The same day, he introduced into the Congressional Record a 1988 \nguest editorial from the Casper Star Tribune, a newspaper in Wyoming. \nThe editorial reflected the sentiments similar to those expressed by \nSenator Wallop. Less than 2 years after enactment of that 1986 law, tax \nreform and simplification spawned 2,704 changes in the Internal Revenue \nCode, 42 new regulations, 65 announcements, 32 revenue rulings, and 48 \nnew tax forms.\n  The changes were so complicated that in a nationwide study of 50 tax \npreparers who were given hypothetical identical pieces of information \nabout what a family would do in trying to figure out their taxes, none \nof the 50 tax preparers came out with the same\n\n[[Page S2988]]\n\nresult in terms of how much that family would owe. The system was that \ncomplicated.\n  Senator Wallop said that guest editorial summed up the feelings of \ntaxpayers across the Nation. The author of that guest editorial \nsubmitted 20 years ago today into the Congressional Record was a \nWyoming physician named John Barrasso. That is right, the current \noccupant of Senator Wallop's Wyoming Senate seat.\n  The reform envisioned by Congress failed miserably to achieve its \ndesired result. Today, Americans continue the painful experience of \nfrantically attempting to complete their tax returns and write their \nchecks to the Government before the clock strikes midnight.\n  The Tax Code is even longer today, 6,000 pages and over 2.8 million \nwords, and it is growing. Provisions within the Code regularly expire, \nand then they are extended on an irregular basis. The IRS estimates \nthat the average amount of time an American taxpayer is going to take \nto fill out their tax returns in this year is over 30 hours. More than \n6 in 10 Americans hire someone to help prepare their returns for them. \nHundreds of billions of dollars are spent annually trying to comply \nwith our complicated tax laws.\n  Many post offices across America will be staying open until midnight \ntonight. Why? To give taxpayers one last shot to meet the deadline.\n  It is no wonder that more than 10 million Americans will request an \nextension this year. The future does not look much better for American \ntaxpayers, both in terms of tax simplification and in terms of tax \nrelief.\n  Americans work day in and day out to pay for Washington programs that \nthey would not wish on their worst enemy. In too many families, one \nparent works to put food on the table and the other parent works to pay \nfor the Washington bureaucracy.\n  The Government is too big. It spends too much. Americans get it. \nAmericans have to balance their own budgets. They have to balance their \nown checkbooks. The Government should do the same. And the Government \nshould do it the same way that American families do it--by controlling \nspending.\n  The current tax system is a mess, it is too complicated, it is \nantigrowth, and it discourages additional investment in America. The \nAmerican taxpayer rightfully deserves a system that is simple. The \nAmerican taxpayer deserves a system that provides certainty. The \nAmerican taxpayer deserves a system that encourages success and \ninnovation, and the American taxpayer deserves a system that is based \non what is in their best interests and not the best interests of \nGovernment.\n  Have you ever wondered why tax day is April 15 and not, say, 6 months \nlater, October 15? Imagine, if you will, if tax day were right before \nelection day. Then the voices of the taxpayers would register loudly \nand clearly. Maybe this is the solution necessary to ensure that \npeople, not the Government, come first because, after all, the money \nbelongs to the people, the hard-working people of Wyoming and every \nother State in this country, not to the Government. It is the people's \nmoney; it is not the Government's money.\n  The American taxpayer deserves better, the American taxpayer deserves \ntax simplification, the American taxpayer deserves tax relief, and the \nAmerican taxpayer deserves action.\n  Change the system? Well, it is not an easy undertaking but a \nnecessary one. Four criteria are necessary to make the effective \nchange. It must be fair so people pay their fair share. It must be \nsimple so people can quickly file their own returns. It must be \nuniform. No matter who you are, the system must be applied equally to \nevery taxpayer. And, No. 4, it must be consistent. Changing the system \nevery year is not good for the economy and is not good for taxpayers.\n  During his floor speech on April 15, 1988, 20 years ago today, \nWyoming Senator Malcolm Wallop said that his vote against the tax \nreform conference report, as he said, ``was one of the best things I \nhave done since I have been in the Senate.'' He was right on target. \nHis words have survived the test of time. Let us hope that 20 more \nyears--20 more years--do not pass before we get it right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, how much more time remains for business on \nour side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Fourteen and a half minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, recently, I noted a story in the Wall Street Journal \nthat preceded the primary date of March 4 in Texas, and Ohio as well. \nNot to pick on our friends in Ohio by any means, but I was interested \nto see the story discussed of why it is jobs and people were leaving \nOhio and why people were moving to Texas. We have had 3 million people \nmove to Texas since 2000.\n  Basically, the journalist said it boiled down to three things: He \nsaid, No. 1, Texas is a State that believes in free trade. We believe \nNAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, has actually increased \njobs in our State and in the United States by creating jobs for those \ngoods that are manufactured here and then sold in Canada and Mexico.\n  No. 2, the article pointed out Texas is a right-to-work State. In \nother words, you don't have to join a labor union in order to get a \njob. You can if you want to, but you are not required to do so as a \ncondition of employment.\n  No. 3, this article pointed out Texas did not have a State income \ntax, and I assure you we never will. The people in my State like \ngovernment as small as possible. They like to keep taxes low, and they \nrealize the decisions we have made in our State have made it a \nconducive environment for job creators to move to our State to create \nopportunity for people to move there, to get a job, to raise their \nfamily, and to seek to achieve their dreams.\n  Today, we are talking about tax day for the Federal taxpayer, and I \nthink we ought to learn something from the lessons we have found \ndemonstrated in places such as Texas, where we have kept taxes low. \nHaving lower tax rates is perhaps the best stimulus package you could \never pass. We have passed a couple stimulus packages so far this year. \nFirst, the bipartisan package, which will result in a check being \nwritten to many taxpayers that they will receive in the next few weeks, \nand then we also passed a housing bill last week. But I submit the best \nstimulus we could pass is by keeping taxes low.\n  This first chart I have demonstrates an uncomfortable fact, and that \nis the American taxpayer has to work until April 23 of this year in \norder to pay their taxes. In other words, here we are on April 15, and \ntaxpayers still have another few days, another week or so to work to \npay their tax bill before they can begin to work for themselves and for \ntheir families and for their small business.\n  This is another revealing chart, I think, because it points out how \nmany days of the year an individual works, or the average taxpayer \nworks, to pay for essentials such as housing, which is very much a part \nof our agenda recently because of the housing crunch; health care, \nhealth care costs are a significant portion of every family's budget, \nand the average taxpayer works 50 days a year to pay for their health \ncare; food, equating to 35 days; and transportation, 29 days. As you \ncan see, to pay Federal taxes, an individual has to work 74 days; to \npay the State, local, and other taxes, it is another 39 days.\n  Particularly at a time when the economy is not doing as well as we \nwould like, Congress seems to be acting inconsistently, first of all, \nin passing a stimulus package which is sending checks to taxpayers \nbecause we are worried taxpayers don't have enough money to spend to \nhelp stimulate the economy. Yet at the same time, both the House of \nRepresentatives and this body passed a budget that raises taxes, \nimposing almost $2,400 more in taxes onto my constituents in Texas.\n  Now, it may not seem like a lot of money to some here in Washington, \nbut I can assure you that to many of my constituents, this is real \nmoney and money they would prefer to have to invest in their businesses \nand spend according to their own desires rather than to have Uncle Sam \ntap them for an additional $2,400.\n  I would also note this has an antistimulus effect--raising taxes--and \nis inconsistent with what we are doing with regard to trying to get \nmore money in the hands of the American\n\n[[Page S2989]]\n\npeople to help us boost and stimulate the economy. To turn around and \nimpose an additional almost $2,400 per person in taxes is inconsistent, \nto say the least, and is antistimulus.\n  The Heritage Foundation has estimated that if in fact this tax \nincrease goes into effect--the one contemplated by the 2009 budget--\nmore than 70,000 Texans will likely lose their jobs because the budget \nassumes higher taxes, which will harm job creation and reduce economic \noutput.\n  I know there is a lot of revisionist history in Washington about what \nthe last 5 or 6 years has been like in terms of the economy, but the \nfact of the matter is the economy has been very good, by and large. At \nleast 8 million constituents of mine in Texas benefitted from the tax \nrelief we have passed since 2001. I would note, roughly, that same \nnumber of new jobs was created across the country--roughly 9 million \nnew jobs--since the tax relief we passed in 2003. In 2007, at least 6.9 \nmillion Texans benefitted from the new low 10-percent tax bracket \ncreated back in 2001, and more than 2 million Texas families used the \n$1,000 child tax credit, all of which are timed to expire in 2011, \nunless Congress acts to make that tax relief permanent.\n  If there is one thing we could do that would have the surest impact \nof bolstering the economy, giving people more money to spend as they \nsee fit, it would be to make the tax relief permanent--the relief that \nwas made temporary back in 2001 and 2003. The dividends and the capital \ngains reductions we passed in 2003 will also expire as well. These, of \ncourse, most often impact people when they buy and sell things they \nown--when they buy stock in their retirement plans, the dividends tax \nrelief in particular. We are going to see that increase dramatically, \nunless Congress acts to stop the antistimulative effect I mentioned a \nmoment ago.\n\n  Today, of course, as I said, is an important day for every American, \nbut it is certainly not a day for celebrating. This is not a holiday \nfor most Americans. Today is a day of observance that is mandated by \nthe Federal Government and an observance which is universally dreaded \nby the American people--tax day. One of the biggest reasons people hate \ntax day is because it reminds them of the complex, incomprehensible \nsystem through which a faraway agency, known as the Internal Revenue \nService, sends them a pile of forms they have to navigate to figure out \nhow much they owe the Federal Government.\n  They may ask: Do I get a W-2 or a \nW-4? Can I fill out the 1040EZ or should I get the schedule D form? Do \nI fill out the 1099 miscellaneous and the 1099 dividend form? What is \nform 5498 for or 1065 or 4562?\n  Well, you get my point, hopefully. Our tax laws continue to \nproliferate and become increasingly complex and increasingly \nincomprehensible to most Americans. That is why so much money is spent \nby average Americans getting someone else to help them figure out how \nto comply with the law. The only thing going down is our comprehension \nand our understanding of the tax system; all other costs associated \nwith this unnecessarily complex and impenetrable system are going up.\n  Families and entrepreneurs, as I said, spend a lot of money--billions \nof dollars--and thousands of hours each year trying to figure out how \nto do the right thing and how to comply with the Internal Revenue Code. \nIn fact, they will spend more than 6 billion hours complying with the \nFederal income Tax Code, with an estimated compliance cost of more than \n$265 billion. This has more than doubled since the mid-1990s. Estimates \nare it will continue to increase at an even faster rate.\n  Every year, the National Taxpayer Advocate highlights this complexity \nin one way or another as one of the top 10 problems taxpayers face. We \nknow the Tax Code is full of special interest loopholes and that with \neach year the American taxpayer spends more and more time and more and \nmore money to try to figure out how to comply with its burdensome \nprovisions. Taxpayers, as I indicate, are working longer each year to \npay for Government--a total of 113 days this year. I think most \nAmerican taxpayers, if you asked them the question: Do you like the \nsystem as it exists now or would you like tax reform, something \nsimpler, flatter or fairer? they would say: Whatever our Tax Code, \nwhether it be a flat tax, a sales tax or an income tax, it should be \nbased on three fundamental ideas: simplicity, fairness, and \ntransparency.\n  I have to tell you our Tax Code does not, as currently written, meet \nany of those three requirements--of simplicity, fairness or \ntransparency. I think these simple standards ought to guide us in \nreforming and simplifying the income tax code. I have heard several \nproposals made in the last couple days. Senator Wyden, from Oregon, has \ntalked about a flat tax he has proposed. Senator Alexander, from \nTennessee, likewise has proposed a tax return you could fill out in one \npage. Wouldn't that be great, to have a single page, something so easy \nto understand you could send in a single sheet of paper and know you \nhave complied with your obligations to pay and report your income taxes \ndue?\n  While comprehensive tax reform may not be right around the corner, \nthe last thing we should do is to raise taxes on families and \nentrepreneurs by letting the tax relief passed by Congress in 2001 and \n2003 expire. I have already talked about the budget and its impact on \npeople in my State, but the budget passed last month would now require \n27 million small businesses all across the country to owe an additional \n$4,100. That is, if, in fact, the revenue projections in that budget \nare kept, 43 million families will owe an extra $2,300 each, and 18 \nmillion seniors will each owe an additional $2,200.\n  Amazingly, these tax hikes and increased Federal spending come weeks, \nas I pointed out, after Congress actually voted to send money back to \nthe taxpayers in order to get them to spend it so it would stimulate \nthe economy. We did this at the same time we are raising taxes and \nbasically taking that same money away and more. If we agree that \nputting more money in the pockets of the American people is the best \nway to stimulate the economy, why are we still looking to take more \nmoney from them during tax season?\n  One of the most effective tools for combating this and wasteful \nspending, in general, is more information, and I think a proposal I \nmade yesterday, which I would talk like to talk briefly about, will \nactually help us hold the Federal Government more accountable for the \nmoney it spends and give the American taxpayers more information so \nthey can make sure their voice is heard when it comes to tax policy and \nhow much money we take out of their pockets in order to fund the \nFederal Government.\n  Yesterday, I introduced a bill called the Federal Spending and \nTaxpayer Accessibility Act of 2008. This bill creates an online earmark \ntracking system taxpayers can use free of charge to search for earmarks \nby recipient, appropriations bill, State, and Member in real time \nduring the appropriations process. This legislation also directs the \nIRS to provide each taxpayer with a concise and easy-to-read personal \nrecord of the amount of taxes they have already paid, as well as a \nprojection of the taxes they will owe into the future, up until the \ntime they retire. If this sounds familiar, that is because the Social \nSecurity Administration sends a similar statement of Social Security \ntaxes paid and how much you can expect, upon retirement, to receive in \nbenefits. I think it can play an important role when taxpayers are \nplanning their future, to provide them with a better idea of how much \nthey will owe in the future so they can take that into account.\n\n  These statements would provide taxpayers with a reminder of how much \nour Government is spending and give them even more reason to keep track \nof how their money is spent, along with the political accountability \nthat would flow from that. This legislation would also build on the \nFederal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006, which \ncreated a one-stop, searchable Web site for all Federal contracts and \ngrants. This legislation would expand the Web site by including the \nexpenditures of all Federal agencies, including salaries, rent, \nsupplies, and transportation. I know not every American is going to be \ninterested in that level of detail, but I think it is important it be \nmade available to everyone who is interested and particularly for the \npress who can report on it and let the American people know what the \nfacts are.\n  On this tax day, I urge our colleagues in the Senate to take a new \nstand\n\n[[Page S2990]]\n\nagainst growing Government, growing spending, and growing taxes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I extend my appreciation to my good friend, \nthe senior Senator from the State of Illinois.\n  Today is April 15. It is a big, red-letter day for people because it \nis the last day to file your income tax returns. As we send in our \ntaxes--and some, as will happen tonight, will wait in line to file \ntheir tax returns--it is a good time to give thought to the economic \nstate of our families and our economy, generally.\n  Since President Bush took office, the cost of gasoline has gone up \nmore than 100 percent, more than doubled. The cost of home heating has \nskyrocketed. The price we pay for groceries has never been higher.\n  The head of the World Bank said, 3 days ago, that 31 countries will \nbe in desperate need of food within a matter of months, and there could \nbe riots in those countries. We are very fortunate in America, we don't \nhave a shortage of food. But people are having trouble paying for the \nfood they would like to eat. The same is true for health care, for \nprescription drugs--for college tuition. At the University of Nevada, \nwe have a new law school. I was happy to see in the latest rankings it \ncame out ranked 78th--a new law school ranked 78th in the Nation. That \nis remarkable. They have done such a good job.\n  But they also announced they are going to double the tuition at that \nnew small law school--double the tuition. The cost of going to State \ninstitutions is going up. Why? Because the economies of our States are \nso desperately bad. In the State of Nevada, because of the downturn in \nthe economy, the Governor, with the State legislature, has had to cut \nalmost $1 billion in programs that are there in the State--road \nconstruction, new buildings, new programs--and cutting some of the old \nprograms. Of course, they have a program to let prisoners out of our \nprisons more quickly, not because it is good for the people of the \nState of Nevada but because they are desperate for money.\n  We are paying record prices for nearly everything. Yet the average \nhousehold income has dropped. American families are earning less and \npaying more. The Republican answer, for 7 years, has been to slash \ntaxes for the ultrawealthy, to side with big business, oil companies, \nutility companies, and let the little guy fend for himself.\n  We have worked hard, as the Democratic Party--first in the minority, \nnow in the majority--to cut taxes for the middle class, to end the \ndependence on oil that keeps our gas and heating bills sky high, to \nmake health care and college tuition more affordable for families. We \nhave now tried for days to quickly pass a highway bill that takes care \nof some of the problems we had in the massive bill we had before. There \nare corrections we would like to make on that. Last Thursday evening, \nthe distinguished assistant leader was on the floor, as was the \nassistant leader for the Republicans. We talked about: Why are we \nhaving another filibuster on this? My friend, the junior Senator from \nArizona, said: Oh, there will be no filibuster on this, everything is \ngoing fine--words to that effect. We had to vote last night to invoke \ncloture, and rather than being able to legislate on the bill, we are \ntalking on the bill, stalling, wasting time.\n  We could have started on this legislation Thursday night. We could \nhave legislated all day yesterday and all day today. But, no, we are \nnot going to be able to do that. We are going to use the full 30 hours.\n\n  This is a number--it is probably higher than this, but let's assume \nthis is right. The last time we came out and said there were 70-plus \nfilibusters, they came out and said: Oh, no, not that many, not that \nmany. So say 65, for purposes of this discussion.\n  In the history of this country previously--and I am going to use \nleader time, not morning business time, Mr. President, during my \npresentation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in the entire history of the country, no \nmatter what has been going on in this country--and we have been through \nsome difficult times--the most filibusters we ever had were 61 or 62 \nduring a 2-year period of time, during an entire Congress. But now, in \nthe first year of this Congress, they broke that record--stalling, \nslowing things down so we cannot legislate the people's business. That \nis because they are protecting the status quo.\n  Can you imagine filibustering a bill that is correcting technical \nmistakes made by the two Houses in passing this legislation previously? \nThey are filibustering that--commas, semicolons, dotting an ``i,'' \ncrossing a ``t,'' that is what we are doing, that is what this \nlegislation is all about, technical corrections--supported by the \nranking member, Senator Inhofe, and the chairman, Senator Boxer. They \nare filibustering this, making us use all the time.\n  Some may ask why they are doing this. The main reason is they are \nprotecting the status quo. Time after time, Republicans seemed intent \non obstruction only for obstruction's sake. They pursued this course on \nlegislative matters large and small. It doesn't have to be, as they \nhave done many times, stopping us from moving forward on matters \nrelating to Iraq--many times. Let's consider that a big issue. But \nlet's consider what we are doing today a small issue--technical \ncorrections on a bill.\n  Look what is going on in the country today. Look what is going on in \nthe world today. We listen to the news or find it in the newspaper. \nToday in Iraq--scores of people killed in Iraq. Bombs here, bombs \nthere, two American soldiers killed in Iraq yesterday. We have learned \n2.7 million people are displaced in Iraq. That is Iraqis. The \npopulation is only 25 million people to begin with and 2.7 million of \nthem are wandering around trying to find a place to live in Iraq. About \n3 million have left the country. They have blocked us from doing \nanything about that.\n  We had General Petraeus talk about what is going on in Iraq. He \ndidn't answer the question: Are we any safer now than we were before \nthis Iraq war started, before the surge started? No answer to that. \nWhen are we going to get our troops home? No answer to that. They have \neven gone forward on tactics delaying matters on legislation they \nultimately came to support--stalling for time.\n  The most unfortunate aspect of Republican strategy is real people \nsuffer because of it. Why do I say that? There are a lot of things we \nneed to do as a country. We have, now, a big merger that took place \nmaking big business even bigger. Delta Airlines has joined with \nNorthwest. They will have 75,000 or 80,000 employees. Now there is talk \nof United joining with other companies. We have heard Southwest \nAirlines--they were flying airplanes that were in bad shape, but they \ndid it anyway.\n  We have learned in recent weeks the Federal Aviation Agency is \nprotecting the airlines and not the consumer. We have a bill we need to \ndo, FAA reauthorization. We need to do that bill. We would like to \nbring up that bill, but we cannot because we are being stalled on a \ntechnical corrections bill--only stalling for time.\n  Veterans health care--Senator Akaka has asked for months: Why\n\n[[Page S2991]]\n\ncan't I bring up my bill? Every time, I say to him: Senator Akaka, we \nare doing our best, but they stalled us on this and they stalled us on \nthat. That is something we want to do this work period, as we do the \nFAA legislation.\n  There is an important piece of legislation--genetic \nnondiscrimination. A lot of things are happening in medicine. We have \nthe ability to look at people and find out what their genes are going \nto forecast for the future. But we don't want, as a result of advances \nin medical care and treatment in this regard, to have someone who may \nbe prone to getting some disease 10 or 15 years from now be \ndiscriminated against in the workplace. This is an important piece of \nlegislation, and it is being held up; we can't get to that.\n  Flood insurance--we want to be able to do this. It is important to \nthe American people. We hear a lot about the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency. What they deal with more than anything else--more \nthan earthquakes, tornadoes, fires--is floods. Flooding is the most \ndevastating natural disaster we have every year in America, and we want \nto do something to have the flood insurance program in this country \nmean something. We saw the never-ending litigation in Louisiana and \nMississippi and Alabama as a result of Katrina. One of the reasons for \nthat litigation is the legislation was not clear. It was not good \nlegislation. We need to change that.\n  Food safety? My friend from Illinois has been working for a long time \nto do something about food safety--what can we do to make it better, so \nthat when you go to a fast-food restaurant, you don't get salmonella; \nif you get a steak, it is OK. Has it been inspected? We have not been \nable to legislate in that regard.\n  It is disheartening to recognize and realize what we are not able to \ndo, as a result of the Republicans wanting to maintain the status quo. \nWhy can't we go through this piece of legislation, let Senator Boxer \nmove forward on completing it, and then go to one of the other matters. \nThere are a lot of other matters we need go to. I have only mentioned a \nfew of them.\n  When I go home, people ask: Why aren't you getting more done? I tell \nthem the Republicans are stalling, they want the status quo. Here is a \nperfect illustration, I say to my friends who have asked that question. \nWhy are we being asked to waste valuable Senate time--that is all we \nhave is time--valuable Senate time on something that is so unnecessary. \nWe are waiting here. We came in at 10. The Republicans say we can't go \nto the bill; they want to go to their caucus and discuss what they want \nto do on the technical corrections bill.\n  I hope that my friends on the other side of the aisle, the \nRepublicans, would let us start legislating. After we passed the \nstimulus bill for housing, I thought we could enter into a program \nwhere we would start doing that. I do not know what they could talk \nabout in their caucus about how difficult this particular technical \ncorrections bill is. I said we are not going to fill the tree, which \nmeans they can offer amendments. Let them offer amendments. We invite \nthem to offer amendments. But let's move forward on this legislation.\n  The Republican filibusters of this Congress, 65, is recordbreaking. \nThey should be proud of that. We invoked cloture on more than 65 of \nthose issues. We are still counting. Today is one of those counts that \ncontinue. I am very disappointed that we are being stalled again on \nsomething as insignificant as a technical corrections bill on highways.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will you alert me when I have spoken 10 \nminutes in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. DURBIN. A filibuster is a way to stop the Senate from acting. A \nfilibuster is an effort to make sure the Senate does nothing. You saw \nthe movie with Jimmy Stewart, ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.'' He took \nto the floor as a freshman Senator and stood there speaking in a \nfilibuster until he collapsed in physical exhaustion.\n  Well, it does not quite happen that way anymore. What happens, of \ncourse, is someone says: I am going to stop the Senate, and you are \ngoing to have to come up with 60 votes to stop me.\n  Well, Democrats have 51 votes in this current Senate; the Republicans \nhave 49. So anytime we want to move forward with a piece of legislation \nto which a Republican Senator objects, we need their help to stop a \nfilibuster. They know that.\n  So their strategy this year has been to slow us down to a crawl so \nnothing happens and to make sure when something comes up that they \nthink might be a delicate vote for them to face, they start a \nfilibuster. Then we cannot come up with 60 votes, and we move on to \nsomething else.\n  The net result of this filibuster strategy from the Republican side \nof the aisle is that critically important issues, such as the ones \nmentioned by the majority leader, cannot be addressed in the Senate. \nThe House passes important and timely legislation and sends it over, \nand the Republican strategy on this side is to stop anything from \nhappening.\n  Look at the issues we are facing in this country. The Senator from \nCalifornia is here. She is the chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, and this committee is considering critical legislation \non the question of global warming. This is important for us as a \nnation. It is important for our planet. And we know when this critical \nlegislation which has now been reported from her committee comes to the \nfloor, we will face a string of filibusters.\n  That is part and parcel now of the procedure in the Senate. But you \nsay: Well, wait a minute. That is a big issue. Global warming is a \ncontroversial issue with some. You expect some political controversy. \nRight?\n  Well, accepting that argument, I then have to ask you: Why were we \ninvolved in a filibuster until last night by the Republicans on the \nbill before us today? This is a technical corrections bill. When we \npassed the highway bill, the Federal highway bill years ago, it was a \nhuge bill affecting the entire United States of America. Then, as we \ncombed through it, word for word, line for line, page for page, we \nfound there were technicalities that needed to be changed: punctuation, \nreferences to a road instead of a trail. You find them in here. They go \non for hundreds of pages.\n  But they are technical in nature; it is not a big policy debate. This \nkind of bill usually passes in the Congress by a voice vote late at \nnight and no one notices. It is housekeeping. That is ordinarily what \nwe do when we try to catch up and make sure everything is done just \nright.\n  Senator Boxer has worked long and hard to bring it out of her \ncommittee and bring it to the Senate floor, and the Republicans \ninitiated a filibuster against the technical corrections bill. That is \nlike having a resolution to salute motherhood and having them initiate \na filibuster. Where is the controversy? There is no controversy in this \nbill. If they want to offer amendments, we said on this side: If they \nare germane amendments to the bill, have at it. That is what the Senate \nis all about, after all.\n\n  But the Republican strategy of filibusters, as indicated by this \nchart, in the history of Congress, the minority party has initiated no \nmore than 57 filibusters in any 2-year period of time. That is the \nrecord, 57 in 2 years.\n  So far in this Congress, we are barely a few months into the second \nyear. The minority party, the Republicans, has initiated 65 \nfilibusters, and we are still counting.\n  You say to yourself: Well, they must have been some pretty \ncontroversial issues they had to filibuster. A technical corrections \nbill? So why do they filibuster? So that we burn the clock and eat up \ndays so we cannot address the issues that are even more important to \nthis country.\n  Would it not be great for us as a Senate to consider and debate a \nnational energy policy to bring down the price of gasoline in the \nUnited States? No way. The Republicans insist on filibustering a bill \nthat focuses on punctuation. Would it not be timely for us to consider \nthe cost of health insurance to businesses and families across America \nand find a way to make it more affordable and accessible? No way. The \nRepublicans want to debate a bill which changes the word ``trail'' to \n``road'' and filibuster it.\n  That is the reality. And time and again when we have brought up \nissues,\n\n[[Page S2992]]\n\nthe Republicans have initiated a filibuster in this Congress. You \ncannot read this; I can barely read it. It is a list of the Republican \nfilibusters so far in this Congress, 65 and still counting.\n  Let me give you a couple of examples, if I can, of the egregious \nRepublican filibusters in this Congress. We had a bill to implement the \n9/11 Commission Report to fight terrorism in America--filibustered by \nthe Republicans.\n  We had a bill authorizing the intelligence agencies to make America \nsafer--filibustered by the Republicans.\n  We had a bill for court security so that judges and their families \nwould be safe when they are at work or at home--filibustered by the \nRepublicans.\n  We had a water resources bill to deal with the infrastructure of \nAmerica and create good-paying jobs right here at home--filibustered by \nthe Republicans.\n  The Clean Energy Act, an effort to use renewable, sustainable energy \nto reduce pollution and stimulate the needs of our economy--\nfilibustered by the Republicans.\n  The CHIP reauthorization bill, a bill for health insurance for poor \nchildren across America, not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid, not \nlucky enough to have health insurance--filibustered by the Republicans.\n  The economic stimulus package to get this country out of the \nrecession and moving--filibustered by the Republicans.\n  A Consumer Products Safety Commission overall to stop toys with lead-\nbased paint from coming into this country from China--filibustered by \nthe Republicans.\n  GOP used to stand for Grand Old Party. That is what the Republicans \ncalled their party, the Grand Old Party. But when it comes to the \nRepublicans in the Senate, GOP stands for ``Graveyard of Progress.'' \nThey want to stop this Senate from making any progress on critical \nissues for this country. They want to run out the clock by \nfilibustering a technical corrections bill.\n  There is only one remedy for this. It comes in November. The American \npeople will have a chance to speak then. They can initiate a filibuster \nwhich the Republicans will hear. They can speak long and loudly and \nclearly that it is time for change in this Senate. The old ways of \nWashington dominated by special interest groups really hidebound to the \npartisanship that will not even let us bring up these technical \ncorrection issues has to change.\n  Voters in this country have the last word in November to elect agents \nof change, people who will make a difference for improving this \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask that you notify me when I have gone \n10 minutes in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I, too, rise in strong support of the \ntransportation technical corrections bill. First, I commend my friend \nand colleague, Senator Boxer, on her hard work and leadership in \nputting in these corrections.\n  I thank Leader Reid for his determination to get this act through the \nbody. Yet it seems our colleagues across the aisle will stop at nothing \nto obstruct our efforts which will improve the lives of working \nAmericans who struggle to make ends meet and filibuster a comma, \nfilibuster an exclamation point, filibuster the name change of a road \nto a way.\n  What is going on here? What is going on? Well, I have two points I \nwould like to make. But first I ask my colleagues across the aisle, is \nthere any topic that you will not filibuster? If you will filibuster a \ntechnical corrections bill, name changes, punctuation changes, \ncorrections in terms of where the miles were supposed to be and where \nthey are, what will you not filibuster?\n  Now, let's talk about two things. First, this bill is a win-win for \nthe American people. We are entering a recession. We all know we need \nto prime the pump. Many of us believe we should have a large public \nworks spending program. But the question is, Should we pay for it or \nshould we not?\n  But in the SAFETEA-LU bill, this technical corrections bill, the \nmoney is already allocated. It cannot be spent because of some \nnonpolitical small error in the drafting. So this bill makes those \ncorrections and hundreds of projects can sally forth and employ people \nwith no particular cost to the Federal Government. Who could object to \nthat? Do my colleagues want to tell the construction workers and those \nwho have little diners and lunch places and restaurants where \nconstruction workers eat, and those who supply the construction \nindustry: Heck with all of you, we are filibustering.\n  So on the merits it makes no sense to block this bill--on the merits. \nI have to say this to our minority leader: I know there are probably \nMembers on his side who say: I want something else. I do not want to \nlet this bill go through. There is a larger obligation. If we let every \nsingle Member of the other side of the aisle paralyze this body, then \nwe are doing America a disservice.\n  I would plead with the minority leader to tell his individual \nMembers: You do not have--each one of you does not have veto power over \nanything, particularly something as trivial as this.\n  So why is this happening? That is the second point I wanted to \naddress. I will tell you why. The other side is basically paralyzed. \nThey have no program for America. They have no agenda for America. They \ndo not know what to say except the old nostrums that were rejected \nyears and years and years ago. They cannot say yes and so they try to \nshow some kind of position. They just say no. That is what is going on \nhere. It is the internal problem on the other side of the aisle, the \nhard right versus the right, versus the mainstream versus the \nmoderates. They are all in a knot, and they cannot come to an agreement \non anything, even a technical corrections bill that everyone has agreed \nto on the substance.\n  So the only thing that can unify them is a two-letter word: N-o.\n  Well, let me say that to allow any single Member to obstruct this \nbill is not living up to what the Senate is all about. It is not living \nup to what America is all about. It is not living up to what democracy \nis all about. Our leader has not said you cannot amend. Our leader has \nnot said you cannot debate. I know there are a few Members on the other \nside of the aisle who believe there may be changes made. Let them \ndebate it and let's vote.\n  But, no, the answer is only no. It has not been only on this bill. My \nfriend and colleague from Illinois went through a long list of bills \nthat are even more consequential than this one. Now, this one is not \ninconsequential. The changes are inconsequential, but the results are \nconsequential. Again, it will employ thousands of people and release \nmillions of dollars that have already been paid for to do worthy \nprojects.\n  That, nobody disputes. But instead we have 65 filibusters already; 57 \nis the record--65 and going up. The filibuster used to be used on \nissues of major importance. It is now being used for everything, even \nthe changing of punctuation and spelling, misspellings. Why? Because \nthe only thing that unifies the other side is the word ``no.''\n  Well, the American people, come November 2008, are going to say \n``no'' to the other side.\n  They are going to say: No more of this obstruction. We are going to \ngive our side the number of votes we need to move forward, because 50 \nvotes is not enough. Sixty is the need. This temporary refuge in the \nword ``no'' of a false unity will only be temporary.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor, along with the \nmajority leader and my colleagues, to express our extreme frustration \nwith what the minority, the Republicans are doing to block basic bills \nfrom getting through the Senate. We are trying to move to debate and \noffer amendments on a basic bill that needs to be done, called a \ntechnical corrections bill for transportation projects, changing minor \nthings in the law so it can move forward. Normally this bill is done \nlate at night; everyone agrees to it; there is no objection; it moves \non; it takes only a few hours of time. It has gone through a lot of \nwork in committee, which Senator Boxer chairs. They have done all their \nhomework. It has passed on a bipartisan basis, and it was approved by \nthe Senate late last night as a procedural move. But we are here today, \nspending hours and hours with no ability to move forward, no ability to \noffer\n\n[[Page S2993]]\n\namendments, no ability to pass it, because the Republican minority has \ndecided to filibuster this bill.\n  I go home every week, 2,500 miles away from here to the State of \nWashington. People come up to me and say: What are we going to do about \nthe rising cost of health care? What are we going to do about the fact \nthat fewer and fewer doctors are seeing seniors going into Medicare? \nWhat are we going to do about veterans waiting in line to get the care \nthey have been promised? What are we going to do about the housing \ncrisis? What are we going to do about Iraq and the President's request \nfor $109 billion more? In Washington, Boeing workers come up to me and \nsay: What are we going to do about a procurement process that has \nallowed our military to send $40 billion to a European-owned company, \nour tax dollars, at a time when our economy is struggling, to a \nEuropean-owned company to start producing the backbone of our military, \nour air tankers? What are we going to do about that?\n  These are issues that we as Democrats want to bring to the floor and \nhave major debates on, move legislation forward. They will take time. \nThere is disagreement. Growing up in Washington State, when somebody \nsaid there is a filibuster, I assumed it was a major argument of the \nday. We would rush to find out what it was about and see which Senators \nwere arguing which way and wonder in what direction this would change \nour country in the future.\n  We are a long way from that today. The filibuster is now being used \nas a delaying tactic so we won't get to those critical pieces of \nlegislation, those critical debates we ought to be having in the \nSenate.\n  Republicans have engaged in an historic, record-setting level of \nobstruction over the last 14 months. They haven't filibustered the \nbills themselves, but they have filibustered motions to proceed to \nbasic bills that we need to pass to keep Government running. They have \ndelayed us from moving forward even after voting in favor of these \nbills. That is where we find ourselves today. Once again, Republicans \nhave decided to keep us from moving forward simply to delay progress. \nThey don't oppose the legislation. In fact, after filing cloture on the \nmotion to proceed last Thursday and waiting the obligatory 30 hours, \nlast night the Senate voted, and 93 Senators wanted to move this \nlegislation forward. So why are we sitting here today delaying 30 more \nhours before Senators can even start to offer amendments, if they so \nchoose, so that we can then move the bill to final passage, unless, of \ncourse, we have to file a motion to end debate and get to another \nfilibuster of 30 hours, which will take a lot more time.\n  We have seen this before. It is about delaying. It is about not \nallowing America to move forward. It is about not allowing progress. \nThe word ``filibuster'' gets thrown around a lot here. People think of \n``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' and the movie appears in their head. \nThat is the most celebrated version of a filibuster. But there are all \nkinds of filibusters. We have learned that firsthand, because at the \ncore a filibuster is any procedural move to delay the Senate. Any one \nSenator has the power to delay us. The majority and the minority have \nthe power to talk to Members and say: This is important to enough of us \nthat we need to move past those objections and begin to move this \nforward. We need to work toward an agreement so we can move forward.\n  Time and time again we have seen people use delays on motions to \nproceed, and then the Senate has to wait 30 hours, 30 long hours with \npeople such as me sitting out here talking on the floor on \nmiscellaneous subjects until we can finally get through 30 hours so we \ncan then be on the floor for hours waiting for Senators to offer \namendments. That kind of delay has forced this Senate in this Congress \nfor over a year now into weeks and weeks and weeks of wasted time. No \nwonder the American people think nothing is getting done in Washington. \nWe are seeing delay after delay. Believe me, we are all frustrated that \nwe cannot get to those important topics of the day, to be able to have \nperhaps a real filibuster on a real issue that is important, that would \nchange the direction of this country. That is what a filibuster ought \nto be about. But here we have to file cloture on the motion to proceed \nto basic bills. We have had to file procedural motions on whether to \nfollow the 9/11 Commission recommendations, which then passed 97 to \nnothing, once we got through all of those hours of waiting around. On \nthe intelligence authorization bill, we had to file a motion to proceed \nto the bill, had to wait the 30 hours, and then the vote was 94 to 3. \nSo a couple of Senators forced an entire Senate to wait 30 hours and \nnot get anything done. Bill after bill I could list a desire on the \npart of the minority to delay progress.\n  What we are seeing is Republicans who are united for obstruction on \nissue after issue. Month after month, Republicans have put delay before \ndebate, procedure above progress, and obstruction before solutions.\n  The American people, certainly in my State of Washington, want us to \nmove forward and deal with the issues critical to their families. They \nare struggling today with the economy. They are worried about their \nability to retire. They are worried about being able to send their kids \nto college. Certainly, our men and women who have gone to fight the war \nin Iraq are coming home and facing delays. Yet we can't get a veterans \nbill up on this floor because of the delays we are seeing.\n  Here we are today, waiting around to vote on a technical corrections \nbill to a transportation bill that ought to take a few minutes.\n  It is a sad day in the United States. I hope our colleagues will talk \nto their leaders and say: We need to move on. It is time to get the \nbusiness of this country done. That is our job.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, could the Chair tell me what the current \nstate of the parliamentary situation is right now?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/15/senate-section/article/S2993-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to H.R. 1195, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to consideration of Calendar No. 608, a \n     bill (H.R. 1195) to amend the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, \n     Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users, to \n     make technical corrections, and for other purposes.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very hopeful we can move this bill. \nWhen my kids were a little younger, they used to say: Mom, it is a no-\nbrainer.\n  This is a no-brainer. This is something we need to do. We passed a \nvery important bill several years ago that funds our highways and our \ntransit. As often happens--because the years pass and the studies take \nplace and you find there were errors in such a big bill that \nencompasses so many programs--there were certain very important \ntransportation projects, highway projects that got stymied because of a \ntechnical problem. We also had one account that was oversubscribed and \nwe need to make some fixes there because that particular account funds \nresearch into the state of our bridges, our highways, our transit \nsystems, and we all know with bridges collapsing in America today, we \ncan't short ourselves on the funding. We need to find out exactly what \nis the state of our fiscal infrastructure.\n  In a great economy, you can't move people and you can't move goods \nwithout a transportation infrastructure. That means roads that are not \nfalling\n\n[[Page S2994]]\n\napart, bridges that are not falling apart, transit systems that work. \nEspecially in this time of more awareness of being efficient, energy \nefficient, all of this works together as we look at global warming and \nthe best ways to combat that.\n  This is a very simple bill. Why are we standing here without actually \nvoting on a few amendments that we know some of my Republican friends \nhave? It is because there is a move by some Republican Senators to slow \nus down, slow down our work. My colleagues heard about it previous to \nmy taking the floor today. Several colleagues talked about the \nunprecedented number of filibusters.\n  But I have to say on the bright side, this is a bill that Senator \nInhofe and I have worked very closely on. We agree on it. It is \nbipartisan in nature. There are a couple of colleagues who don't like a \ncouple of things in here. We will deal with that. We will deal with it, \nbut let's get moving. It seems a shame to have the Presiding Officer \nsitting in the chair in front of an empty Chamber while the time clicks \naway and we can't get anything done on a technical corrections bill.\n  I might say everyone is quite aware that we are in an economic \nslowdown. I look at this bill as a little bit of a ministimulus \npackage, because it will unleash about $1 billion for very important \nprojects already approved. It will unleash those funds. For every \nbillion dollars, tens of thousands of new jobs are created in the \nconstruction industry. We have a very long list of people supporting us \non this bill. Again, I call on my friends and colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle who for some reason are holding up this bill: Please. \nWe are willing to have votes on your objections in the form of an \namendment. We are willing to work with you. We want to get this bill \ndone. The American people need this bill done. There is no reason to \nget it caught up in other political arguments and questions.\n  I hope I can come out here in short order with the news that my \nRepublican friends have decided to let us go to the amendment process \nso we can move forward and complete our work on this bill.\n  At this point I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to \ncongratulate Boston College Eagles men's ice hockey team on their \nDivision I National Championship and to offer a Senate resolution with \nmy colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry, to recognize the team's \nextraordinary accomplishment.\n  This past Saturday, in Denver, Boston College defeated the University \nof Notre Dame four goals to one to claim their third national \nchampionship and their second since 2001. For the Eagles and their \nlegion of supporters, known as the ``Super Fans,'' this victory marks \nthe culmination of years of hard work in which they reached the Frozen \nFour's championship game in 3 consecutive years. Junior Nathan Gerbe \nwas named the Frozen Four's Most Outstanding Player.\n  Led by head coach Jerry York, Nathan Gerbe, captain Mike Brennan, and \nassistant captains Matt Greene and Dan Bertram, the Eagles compiled an \nimpressive overall record of 24 wins, 11 losses, and 8 ties during the \n2007 to 2008 season, which also included Boston College's 14th victory \nin the historic Beanpot Championship.\n  With their work ethic and dedication, the Eagles have made the entire \nBoston College community and all of us in New England proud. We \ncongratulate the entire team, its coaches, and fans.\n  We also thank Father William P. Leahy, president of Boston College, \nwho has proved that you can foster a collegiate environment in which \nboth academic and athletic excellence are the order of the day. The \nteam deserves great credit for its extraordinary achievement, and I \nurge my colleagues in the Senate to approve this resolution.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from the \nBoston Globe be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, Apr. 14, 2008]\n\n                        At BC, a Moment To Savor\n\n                      (By Nancy Marrapese-Burrell)\n\n       Denver.--When Boston College won its NCAA championship in \n     2001, Bobby Allen was one of the team captains. So it seemed \n     fitting that it was Allen who gave the 2007-08 Eagles a \n     crucial pep talk last week just prior to their departure for \n     the Mile High City and this year's Frozen Four.\n       In essence, Allen told the players to live in the moment, \n     to revel in the joy of the event and remember that hockey is \n     a labor of love.\n       The team took that message to heart. After beating Notre \n     Dame, 4-1, in the title game Saturday night at the Pepsi \n     Center, the seniors in particular felt the weight of the \n     world lifted off their shoulders. They were the ones who most \n     acutely realized it was their last chance after two \n     consecutive failed attempts at the crown. Senior center Dan \n     Bertram said they were determined it wasn't going to elude \n     them a third time.\n       ``I think [the experience factor] helped us a lot,'' said \n     Bertram. ``I know with our senior class here, we were all \n     pretty tight. We didn't know exactly what the feeling was \n     like to be on the other side and we sure as heck didn't want \n     to have that this year. Everyone else really saw the passion \n     from our captain [Mike Brennan] all the way down and you \n     can't say enough about just this feeling and the \n     achievement.''\n       When Allen and his teammates were celebrating their \n     victory, John Muse was only 12 years old. The Falmouth \n     native, who backstopped the Eagles in all 44 games this \n     season, allowed only two goals in the Frozen Four, one each \n     to North Dakota and Notre Dame.\n       ``He's been unbelievable,'' said Bertram. ``I think \n     everyone is going to know who John Muse is now. We're so \n     proud of him and we had so much confidence in him. That's a \n     hard thing, to come in as a freshman, and the whole year he \n     has played solid, consistent hockey. The way he played in the \n     Frozen Four is unbelievable. These guys are lucky to have him \n     for another three years.''\n       While Muse was keeping out goals in his end, neither the \n     Fighting Sioux nor the Fighting Irish could do a thing about \n     junior left wing Nathan Gerbe, who tallied 4 points in each \n     game (five goals, three assists) on the way to being named \n     the tournament's most outstanding player. It's as if Gerbe \n     was playing on an entirely different stage than anyone else. \n     All they could do was watch.\n       ``In our eyes, he's the best player in the country,'' said \n     Bertram. ``To show up in the biggest games, I think that's \n     the best [praise] someone can give you. He's a big-game \n     player. To lead this team and score those big goals, he's \n     going to be a great player at the national level, too, but \n     it's just so nice to experience and play with him here and \n     just see that talent first-hand. He's a game-breaker and if \n     you give him some chances and loosen up a little bit, he's \n     going to make you pay. The last two games, he was \n     unbelievable.''\n       The seniors provided strong leadership throughout the \n     season, which was not always very smooth. There were winless \n     streaks, injuries, and player dismissals. But the steady \n     upperclassmen helped right the ship for the stretch run and \n     none allowed themselves to get too excited until practically \n     the final seconds ticked off the clock.\n       ``I wasn't exhaling until I looked up with six seconds left \n     and said, `All right, I don't think they can score three \n     goals with six seconds left,' '' said Bertram. ``It's almost \n     surreal when you're sitting there and kind of watching the \n     clock go down, 30 seconds at a time. I guess when it got to \n     1:30 [left] and I'm thinking, `This is really in out of reach \n     now.' Six seconds was the only time I was like, `OK, start \n     enjoying it a little bit.' ''\n       Senior Matt Greene said in his 22 years of living, the \n     feeling of accomplishment is unmatched.\n       ``I can't say this is the best feeling I'll ever feel, but \n     this certainly is the highlight of my life so far,'' he said.\n       Greene acknowledged, however, it hadn't quite hit him that \n     although the seniors went out on the ultimate high, his \n     collegiate career is over.\n       ``I've got a couple more weeks to stick around the BC \n     campus,'' said Greene. ``It's the last time I'll stare across \n     and give [Andrew] Orpik a wink or maybe throw a tape ball at \n     [Brian Gibbons] or maybe a little bit of ice at [Kyle \n     Kucharski]. That's all a part of being a team.\n       ``Hockey is a special sport because you grow in \n     relationships more than I think in any other sport. We deeply \n     mean what we say and it's going to hit me for sure.''\n       Bertram said as devastated as they were to lose in the two \n     title games prior to this one, that's how incredible the \n     feeling is to win.\n       ``You never want to lose,'' said Bertram. ``It's nice as \n     senior, you're remembered for your last game. There is no \n     better feeling than leaving Boston College, which has been so \n     good to us, on top and winning. It's something I'll never \n     forget and it's something forever I will be proud of.''\n\n[[Page S2995]]\n\n       The Eagles will hold an autograph session at Conte Forum at \n     5:30 this afternoon, followed by a victory celebration at \n     6:15 p.m.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, I am very hopeful that our Republican \nfriends had a good meeting about this SAFETEA-LU technical corrections \nbill and that they decided to work with us to get this job done. This, \nas we say, is definitely not rocket science. It is a bill that is going \nto correct some mistakes we made in this enormous highway \ntransportation bill that was passed several years ago. It is going to \nmake very important corrections so the Department of Transportation can \nproceed to investigate the status of our highways, our bridges, and our \ntransit systems.\n  The bottom line is, as we get ready for our next highway bill--and, \nMr. President, you are such a key player on our committee. You know \nthis as well as I do. We see bridges collapsing. We need to know the \nextent of the problems we are facing.\n  Because of a problem in the bill, the account that we need to fund \nthese investigations and studies is oversubscribed, which is a fancy \nway of saying we need to figure out another way to complete our work. \nThat is taken care of in this bill.\n  We need colleagues to help us. We are not adding one dime to the \nspending on transportation systems and highways. All we are doing is \nmaking technical corrections to make sure some of the projects that \nhave been stymied--let's say because the environmental report came in \nand said we can't do alternative 1, we have to do alternative 2, and \nalternative 2 was not authorized--will be allowed to move forward.\n  I did a press conference today with both management and labor of the \nbuilding trades. The construction workers are hurting out there. We \nknow we are in a recession. This is a mini-economic stimulus bill. We \nare not suggesting it is a cure-all by any means. It is a small bill, \nbut it will unleash $1 billion across this great Nation of ours. When \nyou unleash $1 billion of spending, what it means is tens of thousands \nof workers will get jobs. They are doing important projects--fixing \nbridges, fixing roads, building transit systems--all the good work that \nmakes our Nation work.\n  I am here. It is about 2:20 in the afternoon. We have been on the \nfloor of the Senate since early Monday. Frankly, this bill could have \nbeen done in an hour or two. We are very willing to take the few \namendments there are and work with the authors of those amendments. We \nmay have to have just an up-or-down vote because, frankly, we are not \ngoing to entertain anything that changes the law. This is just a \ntechnical corrections bill. But if there are things we can do to \naccommodate our colleagues, we are happy to do them.\n  When I say ``we,'' I not only mean the Democratic members of the \ncommittee but the Republican members of the committee. Senator Inhofe \nhas been working very closely with me, and we feel very good about our \nwork together. We managed to get our WRDA bill through, the Water \nResources Development Act, in 7 months after it languished 7 years. We \ncan do it on this too. On that we had to override the President's veto. \nThe President sent us a little note that he doesn't love this bill; \nthere is one thing he doesn't like. The fact is, the one thing he \ndoesn't like was signed off on by Republicans and Democrats on the \nBanking Committee. It has to do with how we prioritize transit \nprojects. The desire of the committee to put this in the bill is a \nreiteration of SAFETEA-LU. It really doesn't change anything, it just \nstresses it. The President does not like it, but I am hopeful he is not \ngoing to veto. He didn't say he is going to veto. He just said he \ndidn't appreciate the guidance we are giving him. We don't believe it \nis a veto threat. We believe we can get this to his desk.\n  Think about how good we will feel to know that people who are hurting \ncan get jobs right now--that is really what\n\n[[Page S2996]]\n\nit is about right now--and, frankly, companies that are hurting can get \ncontracts.\n  Again, this is a no brainer, for want of a better term. This is \nsomething we should do. We should do it quickly. I stand by ready, \nwilling, and able to get this work done.\n  I do not see anyone else on the Senate floor wishing to speak. Mr. \nPresident, I will be back when I have to be back.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, here we are. It is 2:15, 2:20. The caucus \nhas ended for the Republicans, and there is still no decision on the \nmomentous decision on whether we can legislate on a technical \ncorrections bill. It is too bad that we cannot move forward; we have so \nmuch to do in this body to meet the needs of the American people. We \nneed to do something about the reauthorization of the Federal Aviation \nAgency. We have an equal pay issue we have to deal with. We have a \nveterans health matter we have to deal with. We have to deal with a \nlong list of legislation, and we are being stopped from doing that \ntoday. We were stopped from doing it yesterday. We were stopped from \ndoing it on Thursday.\n  I want to be spread on the record that this obstructionism of the \nRepublicans has been carried to a fine art. They are doing a great job. \nThey are basically obstructing everything, stalling for time to \nmaintain the status quo. We have had 7-plus years of this \nadministration which has brought this country down, not up. We have an \neconomy that is staggering. We have a housing crisis like we have \nrarely seen--maybe during the Great Depression but not since then. We \nhave a war that is costing us $5,000 a second, and the Republicans want \nto maintain the status quo.\n  The only thing they talk about is let's have the Bush tax cuts go on \na little bit longer. Let's do tort reform. It is no longer a serious \ndebate on legislation. It is a serious debate on how to keep attention \naway from the failed Presidency of George Bush.\n  We can have a vote at 11:30 tonight, approximately. It takes a \nmajority vote. That is all it takes to move forward on this \nlegislation. Until then we can do nothing. We cannot legislate until \nthe 30 hours is used. In the 65 or 70 filibusters they have conducted \nin the Senate--my math is not good enough instantaneously to tell you \nhow many hours we have eaten up on days like this just doing nothing, \njust letting the statutory 30 hours run out--but during that period of \ntime we really can't do anything. They know that. But I believe the \nAmerican people will recognize in November what has happened in the \nSenate.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I ask unanimous consent that I speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Tax Reform\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an issue that \nis very important to the hard-working men and women of our great \ncountry; that is, tax reform. I believe the Federal tax burden is \nexcessive and overly intrusive. Reform of the IRS and the current tax \nsystem is long overdue.\n  If our Democratic colleagues have their way, the Tax Code will \ncontinue to be excessive and overly intrusive. In recent years it has \nbecome abundantly clear to me that we have lost sight of the fact that \nthe fundamental purpose of our tax system is to raise revenues to fund \nour Government.\n  In its current application, the U.S. tax system distorts the economic \ndecisions of families, of businesses, leading to an inefficient \nallocation of resources and hindering economic growth.\n  Our tax system has become unstable and unpredictable. Frequent \nchanges to the Tax Code have caused volatility that is harmful to the \neconomy and creates additional compliance costs. The tax system was \noriginally intended to be an efficient and simple system designed to \nraise revenues for our national defense, social programs, and vital \nGovernment services. However, the current tax system is now so complex \nthat approximately $150 billion is spent each year by taxpayers and the \nFederal Government to make sure that taxes are tallied and paid \ncorrectly. This is an enormous expense and a waste of resources. At \npresent, the United States has instituted a tax system that thwarts \nbasic economic decisions, punishes wise and productive investments, and \nrewards those who work less and borrow more.\n  As it stands, the quagmire that is our existing Tax Code penalizes \nsavings, contributes to the ever-increasing cost of health insurance, \nand undermines our global competitiveness. More disturbing is the fact \nthat Americans spend more than 3.5 billion hours doing their taxes, \nwhich is the equivalent of hiring almost 2 million new IRS employees; \nmore than 20 times the agency's current workforce, I might add.\n  On average, Americans spend the equivalent of more than half of one \nwork week; that is, 26 hours, on their taxes each year, not to mention \nthe amount of time they work to pay the taxes themselves. At the end of \nthe day, despite our lengthy codified tax law, there is no evidence to \nsuggest that Americans know how much they should be paying in taxes in \nany given year or why.\n  Our Tax Code should aspire to be clear and transparent, rather than \nmultifarious and convoluted. Everyone should be able to have a basic \nunderstanding of the Tax Code, knowing how and why they are taxed. The \nTax Code's constant phase-ins and phase-outs are a nuisance at best and \na negative force, at worst, in the daily economic lives of American \nfamilies and businesses.\n  Moreover, taxpayers with the same incomes, family situation, and \nother key characteristics often face different tax burdens. This \ndiffering treatment creates a perception of unfairness in the Tax Code \nand has left many Americans discouraged.\n  At present, how much or little taxpayers pay in taxes is sometimes \ndependent on where they happen to live and the choices made by their \nemployers.\n  In 1986, President Ronald Reagan, a true visionary in this area, \nsigned the Tax Reform Act of 1986 which reduced top marginal individual \nrates from 50 percent to 28 percent, increased the standard deduction, \nand reduced the top corporate tax from 50 percent to 34 percent. In \ndoing so, this reform act simplified the Tax Code, broadening the \nincome tax base, allowing for lower marginal rates, and curtailing the \nuse of individual tax shelters.\n  While the 1986 act was a step in the right direction, unfortunately, \nit did not produce a long-lasting transformation of our tax system. \nToday, our tax system bears little resemblance to the simple low-rate \nsystem promised by the 1986 reform. This is due to constant tweaking \nover the years. More than 100 different acts of Congress have made \nnearly 15,000 changes to the Tax Code.\n  Public opinion polls indicate that Americans believe taxpayers should \nnot have to pay more than one-fourth of their income to the Government. \nThe current Tax Code hardly reflects this perspective. Depending on the \nlevel of income, the amount of deductions, and the type of family, \none's income can be taxed at 25 percent, 28 percent, 33 percent, or 35 \npercent.\n  I support broad-based tax reform and a simplified tax system. It is \nmy belief that any reform to the current tax system should benefit the \nmiddle class. The vast majority of taxpayers are the middle class, and \nthey have borne the burden of the current system.\n  While I was a member of the Colorado Legislature, we implemented a 5-\npercent flat tax for Colorado. I believe we should take a similar \napproach on the Federal level. While I would be willing to consider a \nflat tax or a sales tax or other plans on the Federal level, it is \nimportant that any replacement\n\n[[Page S2997]]\n\nplan be simple and fair. The replacement system must provide tax relief \nfor working Americans. It must protect the rights of taxpayers and \nreduce our collection abuse. But most importantly, a new system must \neliminate the bias against savings and investment and against economic \ngrowth and job creation.\n  No one can deny that our Tax Code is in dire need of reform. Its \ncomplexity, lack of clarity, unfairness, and disproportionate influence \non behavior has caused great frustration. Our current Tax Code has been \nshaped by goals other than simplicity, by intentions other than helping \nthe taxpayer plan ahead, and by objectives other than expanding our \neconomy. Not only has it failed to keep pace with our economy, frequent \nchanges have made it unstable and unpredictable. Years of hodgepodge \nGovernment interference and ad hoc meddling have left our Tax Code in \nshambles. While we cannot change the past, we can learn valuable \nlessons from the same and remedy our mistakes.\n  If we do not take steps to immediately simplify and reform the Tax \nCode, it will become more complex, more unfair, and less conducive to \nour economy's future growth.\n  Small reforms are not enough. A total overhaul of the existing system \nis the only chance we have of righting this wrong and getting our \neconomy and our deficit back on track.\n  Raising taxes is not an option. Our Democratic colleagues seem to \nbelieve that raising taxes or doing nothing about taxes is the best \npolicy. Just last month, Democrats proposed raising taxes on the \naverage American family by $2,300 per year. Earlier this year, \nDemocrats passed a proposal calling for the largest tax hike in \nhistory. If Democrats continue down this path of tax increases and a \ndo-nothing tax policy, more and more American families will suffer.\n  It is important to point out that to do nothing on the Tax Code means \na tax increase is going to happen within the next several years. A do-\nnothing policy on taxes will allow for the expiration of several key \ntax provisions. It will further the reach of the AMT, the alternative \nminimum tax. We will see a tax increase of more than $1.2 trillion over \nthe next 10 years.\n  At a time of economic uncertainty, raising taxes and taking money out \nof the pockets of the American people should not be the goal of the \nCongress. We must act now. We have a responsibility to our constituents \nand the Nation to resolve the predicament the current tax system has \nput us in. If we do not act sooner rather than later in reforming our \ntax system, it will continue to become more complex and cumbersome.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to speak on \nthe transportation technical corrections bill, which we will be \ndiscussing this week. Later on I will offer a motion to recommit, with \nsome considerations I would like to address now.\n  A lot of us were part of moving this through Congress. It is an \nimportant transportation bill, when roads and bridges are in desperate \nneed of funding for repairs and widening.\n  There were over 6000 politically directed earmarks in the original \nhighway bill. Now, the corrections bill involves 500 of those earmarks. \nI thought we should talk about the bill and what this means, as far as \ntransportation in the United States.\n  First, I want to thank Senators Boxer and Inhofe for all of the work \nthey have done on transparency on this legislation. While I strongly \nbelieve we should put an end to the practice of earmarking, if the \nSenate is going to earmark, it must do it in a transparent manner. I \nbelieve the chairwoman and ranking member have set an example for all \ncommittees in providing information in a way that people can look at it \nand debate it. It is all right for us to disagree on whether we like \nearmarks. In this case, we can do it with full disclosure of what is \nactually in the bill.\n  The American people deserve to know how their elected representatives \nare spending their money, and the way this bill handles earmark \ndisclosure helps us do just that. The Senators from California and \nOklahoma have disclosed the sponsor, the recipient, and the purpose of \nthe earmarks in this bill, in addition to letters disclosing that the \nsponsors have no financial interests in the particular earmark. I was \nalso pleased to see that disclosures were made in a timely manner so we \ncould review them before we began consideration of the legislation. \nThey have gone beyond the requirements of the Senate rules, and I \napplaud them for their commitment to transparency. I hope the other \ncommittees are equally committed to transparency.\n\n  My colleagues have suggested on the floor that this bill is needed so \nStates can move forward with planning and construction of authorized \nprojects from the last highway reauthorization bill. As with all large \nbills, there were typos and other errors in this bill, and the \ntechnical corrections bill we are discussing this week was designed to \ncorrect those technical errors and problems. I think that is something, \nobviously, we need oftentimes to do with most of our legislation. But \ninstead of correcting the errors from the last reauthorization bill, \nthe committee decided to rewrite public law and add contract authority \nas well as add to spending levels for certain projects, essentially \nadding new earmarks to the bill.\n  The President's statement of administrative policy regarding this \ntechnical corrections bill contains strong language critical of this \nlegislation, and let me quote some from that SAP.\n\n       The administration notes with strong concern that the \n     majority of the bill is devoted to earmarks. The bill \n     modifies hundreds of earmarks from a bill that passed in \n     2005, effectively creating new earmarks, including a stand-\n     alone section that would provide mandatory funding for \n     magnetically levitating rail. The effort through H.R. 1195 to \n     modify these earmarks from an authorization that passed only \n     three years ago is a further reflection of those \n     inefficiencies. Therefore, the Administration urges that \n     these provisions be removed from the bill.\n\n  That is effectively what my motion will address when we offer it \nlater in the week.\n  Again quoting from the administration's position on this bill:\n\n       The administration urges Congress to restrict the bill to \n     true technical changes. For example, in addition to those \n     noted above, both the Senate-proposed substitute and the \n     underlying bill contain substantive changes to statutory \n     provisions regarding waiver procedures for Buy America \n     requirements that should be removed from the bill because \n     they are not technical corrections. In addition, section 104 \n     of the substitute would repeal section 111(d) of title 23 of \n     the U.S. Code, which allows idling reduction facilities at \n     public rest areas in Interstate rights-of-way. This provision \n     is a policy change, not a technical amendment. Repealing this \n     section of the U.S. Code would eliminate a beneficial \n     initiative first proposed by this administration.\n\n  We have heard for the past months, and will continue to hear today, \nthat Members of Congress know what is best in their districts--know \nbetter than some unelected Federal bureaucrat. If a Member of Congress \nknows what is best for their district, then why are we debating a 138-\npage so-called technical corrections package? I suppose some of these \nare drafting errors, and I do not deny there should always be room for \nsome error in the legislative process. But page after page of \ncorrections does not speak well for our whole earmarking process.\n  The 1982 highway bill had only 10 earmarks. That number rose to 538 \nin 1991, and 1,800 in 1998. The SAFETEA-LU highway authorization bill \nwe are talking about today contained an inexcusable 6,000 earmarks, at \na cost of well over $20 billion and now nearly 500 changes in the \ntechnical corrections package. A 2007 report by the Department of \nTransportation Office of Inspector General, requested by Senator Tom \nCoburn, found that DOT earmarks have increased in number by 1,150 \npercent from 1996 to 2005--an incredible increase--and, as we can see, \na number that has been very difficult for us to manage effectively here \nin the Congress.\n  This administration has projected that the highway trust fund will \nhave a negative balance of $3.2 billion by 2009 if we continue on the \npath of outspending the receipts in this account.\n\n[[Page S2998]]\n\nSo piling on the additional authorization levels to projects in this \ntechnical corrections bill will only further deplete the highway \naccount and cause the highway trust fund to be bankrupt sooner than \nprojected.\n  I know the case has been made that this technical corrections bill \ndoes not increase the overall amount, but as we went back through this \nand found numerous earmarks that were no longer needed or even wanted, \ninstead of moving that money to savings, we moved it to earmarks, and \nnew earmarks, and to add to additional earmarks at a time when we need \nto be trying to save money to overcome the projected deficit. Congress \nneeds to take a timeout and examine the country's infrastructure \npriorities instead of relying solely on Members of Congress \ntransportation earmarks.\n  Of most concern is that many of the earmarks requested and funded in \nhighway authorization bills are neither the most effective nor \nefficient use of funds. Many of them, such as an earmark for renovating \nthe Apollo Theater, have nothing to do with transportation. Senators \nand House Members have picked particular projects for funding that they \nknow will result in their gaining political support. They will get more \nvotes in their reelection campaigns for bringing home the bacon, but \nfunding will be redirected from highway projects where it is most \nneeded.\n  This is why I have proposed this motion to recommit, that will send \nthis bill back to the committee and require that the bill be reported \nback to the Senate with an amendment that eliminates any provision in \nthe bill that increases spending for earmarks that are contained in the \nSAFETEA bill. Increasing spending for existing earmarks is simply not a \ntechnical correction, and such provisions do not belong in this \nlegislation, that is intended to only correct the technical aspects of \nthe bill.\n\n  Here are a few examples of provisions in this bill that are not \ntechnical corrections but are actually inserting new earmarks into law \nor significantly increasing funding for existing earmarks.\n  Page 18 amends an earmark in current law that provides $800,000 for \nan intersection project in Pennsylvania by striking the $800,000 \ndesignation and increasing the earmark to $2.4 million. That is not a \ntechnical correction.\n  On page 19, we amend an earmark in current law that provides Federal \nfunds for widening two blocks of Poplar Street from Park Avenue to 13th \nStreet in Williamson County, IL, by striking that description and \ninserting the following new earmark, which is to construct a connector \nroad from Rushing Drive north to Grand Avenue in Williamson County. It \nis not a technical correction. It is a new project and it is the \nelimination of another one.\n  Page 22 amends an earmark in current law that provides $800,000 to \nwiden State Road 80 in Henderson County, FL, by striking the $800,000 \nfigure and inserting $1.6 million. We double the earmark amount.\n  Page 29 amends an earmark in current law that provides $2.7 million \nfor upgrades to an interchange in Pennsylvania by striking the $2.7 \nmillion amount and increasing the earmark to $3.2 million.\n  Page 35 amend a New York earmark in current law that provides $4 \nmillion for Miller Highway improvements by striking the existing \nearmark and inserting the following new earmark: pedestrian paths, \nstairs, seating, landscaping, lighting, and other transportation \nenhancement activities along Riverside Boulevard and at Riverside Park \nSouth. This is not a technical correction, and it is one of the reasons \nwe are not rebuilding and improving and maintaining bridges in America, \nbecause we are focused on things that are not basic infrastructure.\n  Pages 63 and 64 amend a New York earmark in current law that provides \n$500,000 for design and construction of an access road to Plattsburgh \nInternational Airport by striking this description and inserting the \nfollowing new earmark: preparation, demolition, disposal, and site \nrestoration of Alert Facility on Access Road, Plattsburgh International \nAirport.\n  So we found we didn't need the money in one area, but we found a new \narea, instead of saving it, as we apparently need to do to keep the \nHighway Trust Fund on the path of solvency.\n  The most glaring example of a nontechnical correction made by this \nbill is the MAGLEV section, which provides $90 million over 2 years in \nmandatory spending for a MAGLEV rail project from Nevada to California. \nUnder current law, this project was simply between two cities in \nNevada, but this technical corrections bill paves the way for extending \nthis project all the way to California and leaves the Federal \nGovernment on the hook for paying the price tag.\n  How will this project expand Federal spending? Well, first, it jams \nall the funding into the last 2 years, which increases the baseline \nfrom $30 million in 2009 to $45 million. The way we fund things here is \nbased on year-to-year baselines. It turns the funding from an \nauthorization to direct spending. In the original bill, it allows the \nfunding of a project. Now it requires the funding of a project. It \nextends the Federal project from Primm, NV, to Anaheim, CA, and it \ninvolves the Federal Government in a dubious construction project that \nwill create an unwanted transportation mode, the cost of which will \nlikely expand considerably.\n  Along this same route, a private company has raised billions of \ndollars to build a high-speed rail corridor from Nevada to California \nwithout any taxpayer money. Our role in Government should be to make \nthe private sector work, not to replace it and to compete with it with \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  In addition to increasing Federal funding, this provision inserts the \nGovernment into a business that appears to need no propping up from \ntaxpayers. Press reports indicate that the MAGLEV route is nearly \nidentical, as I mentioned before, to a completely privately financed \nrail project, which is estimated to cost between $3 billion and $5 \nbillion. This legislation would use taxpayer dollars to fund a \ngovernment project that is in direct competition with an existing \nprivately funded effort.\n  The Government does not need to be replacing private sector \ninvolvement. In 2005, the Los Angeles Times had this to say about \nMAGLEV:\n\n       The long-running debate over MAGLEV trains is a battle \n     between faith and reason. They have to rely on faith because \n     there is very little evidence of the practicality of these \n     systems. Only one commercial high-speed MAGLEV train exists, \n     covering a 19-mile stretch from Shanghai to Pudong \n     International Airport. Why spend so much money, especially if \n     it's from taxpayers, when you might get more bang for the \n     buck out of cheaper alternatives? That the Primm line has \n     gotten this far is a tribute to the power and determination \n     of the Senate Majority Leader, who undoubtedly sees MAGLEV as \n     promising a new transportation system for pork.\n\n  The Associated Press also reported a few weeks ago that the country \nof Germany has canceled its initiative to build a MAGLEV link to the \nMunich airport, citing escalating costs. Germany's transportation \nminister told reporters that it was ``not possible to finance the \nproject'' since the cost had more than doubled.\n  I guess anything is possible when it is taxpayer money, but, clearly, \nbuilding an unproven experimental project, where private money is \nalready accomplishing the same thing, does not make very much sense. In \nthis transportation bill, not only will this experimental rail \nprovision eventually cost billions in Federal funding and insert the \nGovernment into the private market, where it doesn't belong, it would \nmost likely also be bad for consumers. According to my last check on \nthe Internet, the nonstop flights from Los Angeles to Las Vegas are 1 \nhour 10 minutes and cost only $118 for a round trip. That is $59 each \nway.\n  I ask my colleagues how much these MAGLEV trips will cost. Are we \nabsolutely certain it will cost less than $59 each way? If not, why \nwould not consumers fly?\n  I would hazard a guess here that if we were asking Members of the \nSenate to invest their own personal money in this project, not one \nwould reach for their wallet. But this is taxpayers' money we are \nspending on something none of us would do as individuals.\n  Even the administration has weighed in on this provision stating that \nthe bill modifies hundreds of earmarks from a bill that passed in 2005, \neffectively creating new earmarks, including a stand-alone section that \nwould provide mandatory funding for magnetic levitating rail. The \nadministration urges these provisions be removed from the bill.\n\n[[Page S2999]]\n\n  We are not talking about technical corrections. These provisions \nincrease funding for existing earmarks and create new earmarks. \nProponents of this legislation will argue that the bill spends no new \nFederal dollars and, in fact, even saves taxpayers a few million \ndollars. While that is true, the bill accomplishes this by rescinding \nfunds left in the Treasury that were never used by a few earmarks \npreviously authorized by Congress. However, it is clear to me that this \nbill is just another way for Congress to create new earmarks, increase \nspending for existing earmarks without actually appearing to be doing \njust that.\n  In addition, by shifting existing funding from one earmark to be used \nfor a completely new earmark, this bill also creates new projects which \nnow rely on the Federal Government to continue their funding in the \nfuture. In the long run, this legislation encourages wasteful \nWashington spending through the broken process of earmarking.\n  Here is an example of a true technical correction included in this \nlegislation. On page 24 of the bill, there is a provision that would \nstrike the word ``country'' and insert the word ``county'' in an \nearmark for ``New County road on Whidbey Island'' in Washington State. \nThe current law refers to this road as ``New Country Road,'' which was \na mistake, and this bill would correct that error by inserting the word \n``county.'' Clearly, this is a true technical correction and represents \nthe spirit of what this bill was intended to accomplish, which is to \ncorrect technical errors contained in current law.\n  Another argument we hear is that earmarking Federal tax dollars is \nour ``constitutional obligation.'' Our colleague, Dr. Coburn, wrote an \nexcellent article entitled ``Founders vs. Pork'' addressing this bogus \nclaim. I will not read the article in its entirety, but I commend it to \nall my colleagues. It contains some excellent quotations which I will \nshare.\n  Thomas Jefferson, in a 1796 letter to James Madison regarding \nfederally funded local projects, said that ``[O]ther revenues will soon \nbe called into their aid, and it will be the source of eternal scramble \namong the members, who can get the most money wasted in their State; \nand they will always get the most who are the meanest.''\n  In a 1792 letter to Alexander Hamilton conveying what he believed to \nbe the public's perception of government, George Washington cited \nworries about the ``increase in the mass of the debt,'' which had \n``furnished effectual means of corrupting such a portion of the \nlegislature, as turns the balance between the honest voters[.]'' \nHamilton, who famously clashed with Jefferson and Madison on fiscal \nmatters, responded that ``[e]very session the question whether the \nannual provision should be continued, would be an occasion of \npernicious caballing and corrupt bargaining.''\n  The importance of transparency in Government operations was also \nrecognized by Jefferson. In 1808, he wrote:\n\n       The same prudence, which, in private life, would forbid our \n     paying our money for unexplained projects, forbids it in the \n     disposition of public moneys.\n\n  As I said before, I doubt very seriously any Member of this Senate \nwould invest their own money in an unproven technology over a route \nwhere there is already going to be private competition.\n  Jefferson also astutely recognized that large amounts of spending \nwould inevitably lead to outside efforts to redirect that money. He \nwrote in 1801 about the need ``to reform the waste of public money, and \nthus drive away the vultures who prey upon it[.]''\n  George Washington noted in 1792 that no mischief is ``so afflicting \nand fatal to every honest hope, as the corruption of the legislature.''\n  Congressional approval ratings, as we all know, are now at record \nlows because taxpayers do not believe we are being honest or open about \nhow we spend their money.\n  One might argue that earmarking is a simpler system. There is really \nno meddling by bureaucrats, no cost-benefit analysis, no hearing just a \nbig pie that is sliced up into pieces of varying sizes, with the senior \nMembers getting the biggest slice. But this is no way to run a \ngovernment or a country.\n  This bill proves that the so-called simplicity of the system is not \nall it is cracked up to be. One of the changes in this bill involves \nremoving an earmark that was not even wanted but was secretly put into \na bill after the bill had already passed. Now, that is the sort of \ntechnical correction we should be passing right now. Why did it take so \nlong to identify an earmark that was not wanted or needed? Fortunately, \nin this bill, we could remove it. Senator Coburn has an amendment that \nwill force an investigation of this bizarre process by which an earmark \nfinds its way into a bill that already has passed. I look forward to \nthe findings. I encourage my colleagues to support it.\n  I applaud the committee for providing earmark disclosure, more \nearmark disclosure than we have seen out of most committees. Senators \nBoxer and Inhofe are to be commended for their effort they have made to \ncomply with the letter and the spirit of the law. As I said, I hope all \nthe committees will follow example. However, this bill does not have a \ncommittee report. In that sense, Senators have been denied the tools we \ncustomarily rely on to decipher massive catchall bills such as this. \nFor example, without the ``changes in existing Law'' document, which is \ncontained in all committee reports, we are theoretically supposed to go \nthrough each earmark and try to figure out what it is amending. Since \nit is almost certain that few Members will actually do this beyond \nprojects they inserted in the bill personally, the bill is largely a \nseries of meaningless paragraphs. For example, section 105 of the bill \nis 63 pages containing 386 earmarks. These earmarks contain such \nilluminating descriptions as ``In item number 753 by striking \n$2,700,000 and inserting $3,200,000.'' That is all we know unless we go \nback to the original bill to figure it out. The earmark description for \nthis one simply says it is from Bill Shuster and gives the SAFETEA-LU \nsection it amends. Even with the list of earmark descriptions, one has \nno idea what this amendment does without going to the underlying bill. \nWhen you look at the law, you see that it has to do with ``Widening of \nRt. 22 and SR 26 in Huntingdon. Upgrades to the interchange at U.S. Rt. \n22 and SR 26.'' I still have no idea why this project needs a $500,000 \nplus-up, but at least I have a general idea what the project is. But, \nagain, I do not expect that any of my colleagues actually looked up \nthis earmark.\n\n  This bill highlights the fact that this is a terrible way to write \nlegislation, where we all decide the different projects we want and \nforce them in a single bill. This bill demonstrates to me and the \nAmerican people that earmarking is out of control and that the process \nis inefficient.\n  We are spending time on the Senate floor to pass 138 pages of \n``fixes'' to mistakes and errors relating to existing earmarks. I say \nto my colleagues, we have much more pressing needs that deserve our \ntime and attention, such as providing health insurance to the millions \nof uninsured across this Nation, making health care more affordable, \nand passing the FISA reauthorization bill to protect our homeland. \nInstead, we are spending precious time fixing earmarks--hardly a high \npriority with taxpayers who are disgusted with the way their hard-\nearned tax dollars are being wasted now.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Again, it does not \nstrike any earmarks that are in law. It allows all the technical \ncorrections that are included in this bill, but it simply says we would \neliminate any new earmarks in this bill and any increases in existing \nearmarks. I think that is what a technical corrections bill should be.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I intend to speak for a few minutes on \nbehalf of the committee in response to the comments made by the Senator \nfrom South Carolina. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nGeorgia then be recognized for up to 5 minutes to talk as in morning \nbusiness and then followed by the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I first thank my colleague from South \nCarolina for acknowledging that the process that was used on this \ntechnical corrections bill was a very open process, one in which all \nthe changes were open for\n\n[[Page S3000]]\n\npublic review and scrutiny, well identified, and a process in which any \nMember or any person could evaluate the merits or demerits of what we \nwere attempting to do.\n  Second, let me point out that this is a technical corrections bill--\nand I am going to respond to one of the projects specifically that the \nSenator from South Carolina has talked about--but that it is a normal \nprocess when we pass a large bill to go through a technical corrections \nprocess in order to correct mistakes that were made or clarify or, as \npriorities change, to deal with the regions to make sure the Federal \nprograms are properly targeted to the needs. This is a technical \ncorrections bill.\n  Third, let me point out that the regions have come to us to ask for \nclarifications or modifications of projects within the area, not \nincreasing the costs. I thank the Senator from South Carolina for \npointing out that this legislation does not increase costs; in fact, it \nwill save some money. I appreciate him pointing that out.\n\n  So we are in agreement on all those points. We are going to save \nmoney. It corrects mistakes that were made, and it deals with regional \npriorities that have been requested of us, consistent with prior \nauthorizations of Congress.\n  I point out one project, and that is the maglev project. I do not \nwant to debate the merits or demerits of the maglev project because I \ndo not think that would be appropriate on a technical corrections bill. \nBut where the Senator from South Carolina is incorrect is that this is \na technical correction of prior actions of Congress. It provides \ncontract authority. That is what we intended to do in the SAFETEA-LU \nAct. So this is not anything new in maglev. The areas that are involved \nwere the same areas that were previously identified. It does not expand \nthe project and makes technical corrections as far as contract \nauthority.\n  What the Senator from South Carolina is debating is the merits of \nmaglev, and this is the wrong bill on which to debate that. By the \nSenator's own admission, this is a technical corrections bill, and we \nshould just be talking about whether the language is what was intended \nby Congress in its previous actions, and clearly it was, to make sure \nwe do it right based on previous actions.\n  I hope the Senator from South Carolina will heed his own advice; that \nis, let's make the technical corrections bill deal with those types of \nissues. And I am afraid his amendment would not. As now explained to \nus, he wants to eliminate some of these projects, and that is not the \npurpose of a technical corrections bill. I can understand Members being \nconcerned about that approach. I am proud of the work of the committee. \nThe committee did identify those--and it is relatively few when you \nconsider how many authorizations are in the SAFETEA-LU Act--to clarify \nand, in some cases, to make typo corrections and things such as that.\n  It is vitally important to move this bill forward so we can move \nforward on vital transportation projects that affect every one of our \nStates. I urge our colleagues to support the committee and support the \nprocess, the very open and fair and transparent process that was used \nby the committee in developing the changes that are in this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                            Jackie Robinson\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate a seminal \nmoment in our Nation's history. On this day in 1947, Jackie Robinson \nbroke the color barrier to Major League Baseball after years of \nsegregation.\n  Jack Roosevelt Robinson was born in 1919 to a family of sharecroppers \nin Cairo, GA. Cairo, the home of the syrup makers, is a small town in \nsouth Georgia located about 35 miles from my hometown of Moultrie.\n  As you can imagine, Jackie was very talented and did extremely well \nat sports. At UCLA, Jackie became the first athlete to win varsity \nletters in four sports--football, basketball, baseball, and track. He \nwas even named All-American in football.\n  Jackie enlisted in the U.S. Army in World War II, and following his \ndischarge in 1944, he played the season in the Negro Baseball League \nand a couple of years in minor league ball.\n  In 1947, following Jackie's outstanding performance in the minor \nleagues, Brooklyn Dodgers vice president Branch Rickey decided it was \ntime to integrate Major League Baseball, which had not had an African-\nAmerican player since 1889. When Jackie first donned a Brooklyn Dodgers \nuniform, he led the way to the integration of professional athletics in \nAmerica.\n  In his first year, he hit 12 home runs and helped the Dodgers win the \nNational League pennant. That year, Robinson led the National League in \nstolen bases and was also selected Rookie of the Year. Robinson \nsucceeded in putting racial conflict and prejudice aside to show the \nworld what a talented individual he was. His success in the major \nleagues opened the door for other African-American players.\n\n  Jackie Robinson himself became a vocal champion for African-American \nathletes, civil rights and other social and political causes. After \nbaseball, Robinson became active in business and continued working as \nan activist for social change. He was the first African-American \ninducted into the baseball Hall of Fame and, in 1997, his number was \nretired by Major League Baseball.\n  I can recall, as a small boy, being a Brooklyn Dodgers fan. The main \nreason was because my older brother was a New York Yankees fan and the \nperennial World Series game was between the Dodgers and the Yankees, so \nit was a natural rivalry that my brother and I have. I have very vivid \nmemories of watching Jackie Robinson play ball on TV and having great \nadmiration and respect for him as an athlete. It was Jackie Robinson \nwho paved the way for so many great athletes today.\n  Little did he know, back then in 1947, that he would be followed by \nthe likes of Larry Doby, Willie Mays, and my good friend, Hank Aaron. \nBut what a great inspiration he has been for all of America. Today, I \nhonor the man who stood boldly against those who resisted racial \nequality, and I acknowledge the profound influence of one man's life on \nthe American culture. Jackie Robinson's life and legacy will be \nremembered as one of great importance in American history.\n  I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from North Dakota \nis recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, if people are by any chance watching the \nproceedings of the Senate this afternoon, they may wonder what on Earth \nis happening or more likely what is not happening. It has become \ncustomary, when we try to do business in the Senate in recent months, \nthat we discover there is a filibuster that requires a cloture motion \nto be filed on almost anything. On the Senate floor today, as I \nunderstand it, we are on a 30-hour postcloture period on a motion to \nproceed to a technical corrections bill. That is almost unbelievable to \nme.\n  It is not unusual. We have had 65 filibusters in this Congress. Why \nwould someone require a cloture motion to be filed in order to break a \nfilibuster on a motion to proceed to a technical corrections bill? The \nonly conceivable reason to do that is to stop the Senate from doing \nanything. I guess those who have been doing this in the minority party \nhave been pretty successful.\n  Today is tax day, April 15. One might ask, if we were not doing \nthis--standing around and gnashing our teeth and wiping our brow, \nwondering why we can't move this--what would we be doing? If we didn't \nhave a minority that insists on a motion to proceed, a filibuster, a \ncloture motion and 30 hours postcloture, what would we be doing?\n  We would probably be doing some worthwhile things. It is not that the \nunderlying bill is not worthwhile, it is. It should be done quickly and \neasily. It is a technical corrections bill. But what, for example, \ncould we do?\n  I thought, because it is April 15, a day a lot of people recognize as \na day of obligation to pay their taxes, I would mention perhaps a few \nof the things we could be doing on the floor of the Senate if we had a \nbit of cooperation and if we could get the minority party to agree--and \nin every one of these cases, certainly we could not. But let me \ndescribe what we might do, just on the Tax Code.\n  The Government Accountability Office found that 59 of the 100 largest\n\n[[Page S3001]]\n\npublicly-traded Federal contractors--that is companies that did work \nfor the Federal Government in 2001--had established hundreds of \nsubsidiaries located in offshore tax havens to avoid paying taxes to \nthe United States of America. They want all the benefits you can get \nfrom being a contractor for the Government, but they do not want to pay \ntaxes to this country.\n  I discovered this some long while ago. It actually comes from an \nenterprising reporter named Dave Evans with Bloomberg News. I mention \nthat because it is important. He discovered that in this building in \nthe Cayman Islands, a 5-story white building on Church Street, there \nare 12,748 corporations that call it home. They are not there. It is \ntheir post office mailing address for the purpose of saying they are in \nthe Cayman Islands to avoid paying U.S. taxes.\n  If we were not spending our time at parade rest, or posing as potted \nplants because the minority doesn't want to move ahead on anything, not \neven a motion to proceed on a technical corrections bill, are there \nother things we can do? We could solve this, couldn't we? We could say: \nIf you are going to run your income through a subsidiary in a tax-haven \ncountry to avoid your obligation to the United States, maybe you don't \nneed to contract with the Federal Government. Maybe you don't need to \nget the Federal Government's business. Or perhaps on tax day, we might \nsay we will close this tax loophole--just like that. If you are not \ndoing substantive business in a tax-haven country, we will not \nrecognize you as having gone to a tax-haven country, and you will pay \ntaxes as if you never left our country.\n  If we were not seeing all these interminable delays, perhaps we would \npass legislation that I have offered previously, and that is to say to \nAmerican companies: If you shut your manufacturing plant, fire your \nworkers and move your operations overseas, you are not going to get a \ntax break anymore. Someone might say: Do they get a tax break for \nthat? They sure do. Let me give an example. I assume that almost \neveryone has ridden in a Radio Flyer Little Red Wagon. It was made for \n110 years in Illinois, in Chicago, IL. Radio Flyer Little Red Wagon was \ncreated by an immigrant who came here and created a big business.\n\n  The thing is, after 110 years the Radio Flyer Little Red Wagons are \nnot manufactured here. They are all gone. They are in China. Every \nRadio Flyer Little Red Wagon is now manufactured in China. By the way, \nthe company got a tax break to move the jobs to China.\n  I have spoken often on the floor about Huffy bicycles--20 percent of \nthe American bicycle market and made in Ohio by workers who were \nearning $11 an hour plus benefits. Not any more. They all got fired in \nOhio and all these jobs were moved to Shenzhen, China. Huffy bicycles \nare made by people who work 12 to 14 hours a day, 7 days a week, for 30 \ncents an hour.\n  Do you know what the workers at Huffy bicycle did the last day of \nwork, as their plants were closed down? As they pulled out of their \nparking spaces, the workers left a pair of empty shoes where their car \nused to park. It was their poignant way to say: You can move our jobs \nto China, but you are not going to fill our shoes. This company \nreceived a tax break for moving jobs to China.\n  Fruit of the Loom underwear--everybody knows about Fruit of the Loom \nunderwear. You remember, they used to do commercials with the dancing \ngrapes. I don't know who would dress up as a grape and dance, but I \nguess they got paid to do that, so you have commercials of dancing \ngrapes advertising Fruit of the Loom underwear. The problem is, there \nis no Fruit of the Loom underwear made in America anymore because they \nall went offshore to be produced and the company got a tax break to do \nit. Why? Because this specific company did that? No, because companies \nthat shut down their American manufacturing plants and move their jobs \noverseas get a tax break from this country. It is the most pernicious \nthing I have ever seen. I tried four times to correct it on the floor \nof the Senate. I ask people to look up the votes and see who is \nstanding up for American jobs and American workers.\n  Perhaps we could do that on tax day, maybe fix that problem and say: \nAt the very least, let's stop subsidizing, through the Tax Code, the \nshipping of American jobs overseas.\n  Here is another thing we could probably do if the minority weren't \nrequiring cloture motions and engaging in 65 filibusters, which take up \ndead time.\n  I should point out for anybody watching or listening, nothing can be \ndone during this period. We are in a 30-hour postcloture period on a \nmotion to proceed--not even on the bill, on a motion to proceed to a \ntechnical corrections bill. So this 30 hours is dead time, designed by \nthe minority because they do not want us to do anything we probably \ncould do on this tax day.\n  We have a Tax Code that allows almost unbelievable tax breaks to some \ncompanies. This happens to be a streetcar in Germany owned by an \nAmerican company. Why? Because they are experts in streetcars in \nGermany? No, because they get big tax breaks when they do this.\n  This is a sewer system in Germany. Wachovia Bank, a U.S. company, was \nbuying sewer systems in Germany. Think of that--do you think it is \nbecause they are experts in sewer systems? No. Do you think they wanted \nto buy a sewer system and move it to America? No, not at all. They want \nto buy sewer systems in Europe so they can avoid taxes in the United \nStates, because if you buy a sewer system from a European city and you \nnow own it, you can actually depreciate it and then lease it back to \nthe city and everybody makes money--except the American taxpayers and \nthe Federal Government loses money. Maybe, since it is tax day, we \ncould shut down this tax scam, although the President has threatened to \nveto legislation that shuts down these kind of tax scams, for reasons I \ndon't understand.\n  But we could try. We could decide, you know, if working folks pay \ntaxes, maybe everybody else can pay taxes. Perhaps we can pass a piece \nof legislation that says those on Wall Street who are getting what is \ncalled carried interest, some of the wealthiest people in the United \nStates, should pay a higher income tax rate than 15 percent. Almost \neverybody pays a higher income tax rate than 15 percent, but those who \nare making the biggest money on Wall Street in the form of what is \ncalled carried interest, they are laughing all the way to the bank. \nThey get a 15-percent tax rate. Perhaps we could change that.\n  Perhaps another thing we could do this afternoon, if we were not \nforced to 30 hours of dead time, is we could deal with what the \nInternal Revenue Service is doing by farming out tax collections that \nneed to be made--these are people who owe taxes--to debt collection \nagencies in the private sector. This is going to be hard for anybody to \nbelieve or understand, but here is what they have done. This \nadministration is so anxious to privatize and farm out everything, they \nhave gone into the Internal Revenue Service and said let's farm out \nthese collections of taxes owed, so they have contracted with a couple \nof companies. The problem is that this privatization program lost $50 \nmillion in its first year and is expected to lose more this year.\n  The IRS's private revenue collection target for the current fiscal \nyear was $88 million. But they now project that the program will \ncollect only $23 million. After excluding commissions, ongoing \noperational costs and capital investments, the IRS will still be $31 \nmillion in red this year.\n  It is unbelievable. How can the Internal Revenue Service contract \nwith a company that is going to lose money collecting taxes? I have a \npiece of legislation that says stop it. Maybe we could work on that and \npass that legislation today--see if we could find some deep reservoir \nof common sense. The National Taxpayer Advocate who works at the IRS \nhas said: Had that money been spent for collectors at the IRS, they \nwould have raised $1.4 billion. Instead, they invested $71 million to \nuse private collectors and returned just $32 million in 2007. So they \nmissed it by about $1.368 billion. Isn't that incredible?\n  Does anybody care? Apparently not. We are in 30 hours dead time on a \nmotion to proceed to a technical corrections bill, guaranteeing nothing \ncan be done on the floor of the Senate.\n  There are a couple of other things we might consider when we are \nthinking what could we do this afternoon in this dead time.\n\n[[Page S3002]]\n\n  This is a photograph of Mr. Efriam Diveroli. He is the chief \nexecutive officer of a firm that received $300 million in U.S. Army \ncontracts. He's 22 years old. His dad actually started a shell company \nback in the 1990s, and then he took it over. He said he was the only \nemployee, except it lists a vice president. The vice president is a \nmassage therapist. He is 25 years old.\n  So here we have a 22-year-old chief executive officer and a 25-year-\nold massage therapist running a company in Miami. They got $300 million \nfrom the U.S. Department of Defense to provide ammunition to the Afghan \nfighters.\n  Let me describe where they are. They are in this building. No, they \ndo not own this building; they are in a little part of this building \nwith an unmarked door. So you have a 22-year-old and a 25-year-old \nmassage therapist working out of an unmarked office in Miami, FL; Miami \nBeach, FL, and they are supposed to, with $300 million, provide \nammunition to the Afghan fighters on behalf of the U.S. Defense \nDepartment.\n  Here is a picture of the ammunition. Some of it is ammunition from \nChina from the 1960s. You can see what it looks like. And the Afghan \nfighters were saying: Wait a second. What are you sending us? Bullets \nthat do not fire? Now, I must say, the New York Times deserves some \nreal credit. Three people wrote this story. The New York Times, I can \ntell from the story, they traveled around the world to get the details.\n  Now, we did not do it. We should have. We should have done it in \nsomething called a Truman committee. The bipartisan Truman committee \nwas created in the Second World War, run by Harry Truman. By the way, \nit started with $15,000 and has saved the American taxpayer $15 billion \ngoing after waste, fraud, and abuse in defense contracting.\n  Three times we have voted on a Truman committee in the Congress, and \nthree times it has been turned back by the minority.\n  Now, I will come later and give a longer presentation about defense \ncontracting and the most unbelievable waste, fraud, and abuse in the \nhistory of this country. But we do not need more than the picture of \nthe president of this company who got $300 million.\n  The question I started with today is, What could we be doing in 30 \nhours of dead time, if the minority had not required that there be a \ncloture petition and had not effectively filibustered on a motion to \nproceed to a bill that is going to get overwhelming support? I do not \nunderstand it.\n  Finally, we probably could do something about the price of oil or \ngasoline while we are on the Senate floor during this dead time if we \nwere not prevented by the minority, prevented by a President's \nthreatened veto pen.\n  Oil and gas. Well, look, today is Tuesday, and oil is at $113 a \nbarrel. Some are going to the bank with a big smile on their face, \nparticularly the large major integrated oil companies because they are \nmaking a massive amount of profit. Then other people are wondering: Do \nI have enough in my gas tank to be able to drive to work tomorrow? How \nam I going to do that?\n  So while all of this is going on today, the Federal Government is \nputting 70,000 barrels of sweet, light crude oil underground in the \nStrategic Reserve. And they are going to do it every single day all \nyear long, 70,000 barrels a day, stuck underground.\n  Now, the Strategic Reserve is a decent idea. It is 97 percent filled. \nWhy on Earth would we, when oil has hit $113 a barrel, continue, \nthrough this Bush and Cheney administration, to put oil underground and \nthereby put upward pressure on gasoline prices and oil prices? It makes \nno sense at all.\n  So, perhaps, were the dead time not required by the minority, we \ncould work on that, or perhaps with respect to the price of gasoline \nand oil, we could work on increasing the margin requirements for those \nwho are speculating in the futures markets.\n  The commodities futures market, especially for oil, is an \nunbelievable carnival of speculation. Do you know that when you buy \nstocks, there is a 50 percent margin requirement. But if you want to \nbuy oil, God bless you, it is only 5 to 7 percent. You want to control \n100,000 barrels of oil tomorrow, $7,000 will do that. That is the \nmargin. So, as a result, you have unbelievable speculation in these \nmarkets driving up the price well above that which the fundamentals of \noil supply and demand would justify.\n  Perhaps we can do something about saying to the exchanges: There must \nbe increased margin requirements to stop this speculation hurting our \ncountry. It is driving up the price of oil, driving up the price of \ngasoline in a manner that is completely unjustified. Stop the \nspeculation, stop putting 70,000 barrels of sweet light crude \nunderground every day. Maybe those would be two things we could do when \nwe are required to file cloture petitions to stop a filibuster on \nissues such as a motion to proceed.\n  I mean it is unbelievable to me that we find ourselves in this \nposition. There is so much to do, and it is such important work. Yet \nhere we find ourselves with the American people looking in on the \nSenate and wondering: What on Earth are they doing?\n  Well, what we are doing is what we are required to do by the rules \nwhen one side decides it wants the Senate to stand at parade rest \nalmost all the time.\n  We have such big challenges in our country. I have mentioned energy. \nI have mentioned the fiscal policy. I have mentioned health care. We \nhave such big challenges that ought to be our agenda. This country \ndeserves better, and our agenda is, in my judgment, something on which \nthe American people expect us to make progress. They do not expect us \nto see every single day, in every way, a filibuster on the floor of the \nSenate, even on motions to proceed. That is the last thing this \nAmerican public should expect from a Congress that ought to come to \nwork ready to go to work on issues that really matter in peoples' lives \nevery single day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                          Middle Class America\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I commend my friend from North Dakota. \nHe is exactly right. The middle class in our country is in deep \ntrouble. Some would argue the middle class is collapsing. And the \npeople of our country are looking to Washington, to us, to get \nsomething done. What they are finding is a filibuster on a corrections \nbill and inaction in every single area that faces working people in our \ncountry.\n  A couple of weeks ago in Vermont we held several town meetings on the \neconomy. I invited Vermonters to respond to our Web site about what the \ncollapse of the middle class means to them personally. I think it is \none thing for those of us to give a speech, to use huge numbers, to \ntalk in an extravagant way; it is another thing to hear directly from \npeople in terms of what is going on in their lives.\n  What I promised that I would do, and continue to do, is read some of \nthese very poignant e-mails I received, mostly from Vermonters, some \nfrom other parts of the country, where people are simply saying: Look, \nthis is what is going on in my life today. I thought I was in the \nmiddle class, but I no longer am.\n  So what I want to do is read a few of the e-mails that I received, to \nput what we are debating and discussing in a very personal tone, in the \nreal words of real Americans. This is the collapse of the middle class \nas described by ordinary people.\n  We received an e-mail from an older couple in the State of Vermont. \nThis is what they wrote. The woman writes:\n\n       My husband and I are retired and 65. We would like to have \n     worked longer, but because of injuries caused at work and the \n     closing of our factory to go to Canada, we chose to retire \n     early. Now with oil prices the way they are, we cannot afford \n     to heat our home unless my husband cuts and splits wood, \n     which is a real hardship as he has had his back fused and \n     should not be working most of the day to keep up with the \n     wood. Not only that, he has to get up two to three times each \n     night to keep the fire going.\n       We also have a 2003 car that we only get to drive to get \n     groceries or go to the doctor or to visit my mother in the \n     nursing home 3 miles away. It now costs us $80 a month to go \n     nowhere. We have 42,000 miles on a 5-year-old car. I have \n     Medicare but I cannot afford prescription coverage unless I \n     take my money out of an annuity, which is supposed to cover \n     the house payments when my husband's pension is gone. We also \n     only eat two meals a day to conserve.\n\n  This is a 65-year-old couple in the State of Vermont in the year \n2008, and I suspect this story is being told all over America.\n\n[[Page S3003]]\n\n  Here is another story about a woman who lives in our largest county, \nChittenden County. She writes:\n\n       First of all, I am a single mother of a 16-year-old \n     daughter. I own a condominium. I have worked at the hospital \n     for 16 years and make a very good salary, in the high $40,000 \n     range. I own a 2005 Honda Civic. I filled up my gas tank \n     yesterday, and it cost me almost $43. That was at $3.22 a \n     gallon. If prices stay at that level, it will cost me $160 \n     per month to fill up my gas tank. A year ago, it would cost \n     me approximately $80 per month. I now have to decide what \n     errands I really need to run and what things I can do over \n     the phone or the Internet.\n       But the other issue is, if I use my cell phone too much \n     during the month, my bill will increase and that will cost me \n     more money. I feel as though I am between a rock and a hard \n     place no matter how hard I try to adjust my budget for the \n     month. I am watching my purchases in the grocery store and \n     department stores more closely because of increased prices.\n       I am not sure that can I afford to take a summer vacation \n     this year. I usually take a day off during my daughter's \n     spring vacation so we can go shopping in New Hampshire \n     somewhere. I have already cancelled those plans for this \n     year.\n       I am hoping that I can take a few days off this summer to \n     go to Maine. We will see how the gas prices are this summer, \n     but I hear it is going to get worse. Not much hope for \n     someone on a tight budget.\n\n  Here we have somebody who asks nothing more than to be able to take a \nfew days off with her daughter to go shopping. Somebody who works very \nhard cannot even do that because the price of gas is soaring.\n  Here is another e-mail that comes from a woman living in a small town \nin Vermont. This is what she writes:\n\n       Yesterday I paid for our latest home heating fuel delivery, \n     $1,100. I also paid my $2,000 plus credit card balance much \n     of which bought gas and groceries for the month. My husband \n     and I are very nervous about what will happen to us when we \n     are old.\n       Although we have three jobs between us, and participate in \n     a 403(B) retirement plan, we have not saved enough for a \n     realistic post-work life if we survive to our life \n     expectancy. As we approach the traditional retirement age, we \n     are slowly paying off our daughter's college tuition loan and \n     trying to keep our heads above water. We have always lived \n     frugally. We buy used cars and store-brand groceries, recycle \n     everything, walk or carpool when possible, and plastic our \n     windows each fall. Even so, if and when our son decides to \n     attend college, we will be in deep debt at age 65. P.S. \n     Please do not use my name. I live in a small town and this is \n     so embarrassing.\n\n  Well, it is not embarrassing. That is the story being told from one \nend of this country to the other. People who thought that after working \ntheir entire lives, they would be able to retire with a little bit of \nsecurity and a little bit of dignity are now wondering, in fact, if \nthey will be able to survive at all.\n  After working your whole life and being frugal, you should not have \nto retire in debt dependent upon a credit card.\n  The e-mails we receive from people who are young, middle age and old, \neach in its own way is a work of poetry because it comes from people's \nhearts. It is poignant. It is true. This is what a younger person from \nVermont writes:\n\n       I am 23 years old. I have about $33K of education debt + \n     $12K of credit card debt and only make about $26K a year + \n     benefits. I barely make enough to support myself and whenever \n     unexpected expenses come up I end up having to use credit to \n     cover them. I feel like I will never catch up and now \n     everything is getting even more expensive; it seems hopeless. \n     Meanwhile I listen to the news and how the rich are getting \n     richer and it is making me hate this country. I am not an \n     economics expert but I know that things could be done \n     differently to help people like me who work hard and get \n     little in return instead of rewarding those who have the \n     ability to use their money to make more money.\n\n  We heard Senator Dorgan talk about huge tax breaks that go to some of \nthe wealthiest people, people who don't pay their taxes because they \nmove to the Cayman Islands and set up phony front offices. This writer, \nwho may not have a PhD. in economics, hit it right on the head. This \nyoung man and these old people are the people we should start worrying \nabout, not the wealthiest people who are having it very good.\n  Let me talk briefly about a woman. This is another piece of reality. \nShe writes:\n\n       As a couple with one child, earning about $55000/year, we \n     have been able to eat out a bit, buy groceries and health \n     insurance, contribute to our retirement funds and live a \n     relatively comfortable life financially. We've never \n     accumulated a lot of savings, but our bills were always paid \n     on time and we never had any interest on our credit card.\n       Over the last year, even though we've tightened our belts \n     (not eating out much, watching purchases at the grocery \n     store, not buying ``extras'' like a new TV, repairing the \n     washer instead of buying a new one . . . ), and we find \n     ourselves with over $7000 of credit card debt and trying to \n     figure out how to pay for braces for our son!\n       I work 50 hours per week to help earn extra money to catch \n     up, but that also takes a toll on the family life--not \n     spending those 10 hours at home with my husband and son makes \n     a big difference for all of us. My husband hasn't had a raise \n     in 3 years, and his employer is looking to cut out any extra \n     benefits they can to lower their expenses, which will \n     increase ours!\n\n  Here is a woman who has to work longer hours in order to try to catch \nup, and she can't spend time with her husband and son, which is what \nher life is about. How many millions of people are in the same boat?\n  What is not usually talked about on the floor of the Senate is the \nfact that here in the United States, our people work longer hours than \ndo the people of any other industrialized country. Not talked about \nterribly often is that to make ends meet now, in the vast majority of \nmiddle-class life, you need both the husband and the wife working long \nhours. Despite those two incomes, people have less disposable income \ntoday than 30 years ago in a one-income family. But when you talk about \nthe collapse of the middle class, one of the manifestations of much of \nit is that people have to claw and scratch and work so hard that their \nfamily lives deteriorate. In this case, a woman cannot even spend the \ntime she would like with her son and husband.\n  Here are a few more e-mails. This comes from a veteran from the State \nof Vermont:\n\n       The real killer is the price of heating fuel.\n       Up here in northern Vermont we need heat in the winter. \n     With a Military Pension I make too much to get any \n     assistance. We got a 2.8% pension increase in January, and \n     the price of heating fuel has increased by about 50%. We have \n     to cut back on food in order to stay warm. Thank you.\n\n  Somebody trying to live on a military pension that goes up 2.8 \npercent, the price of home heating fuel soars, not making it.\n  This is another short e-mail we received:\n\n       The company I work for has just announced a ``raise \n     freeze'' which means not even a cost of living increase can \n     be expected this year . . . this will be tough for us, as we \n     were counting on at least a cost of living increase in a year \n     where the cost of living has surely increased, be it \n     groceries, fuel, wood, gasoline, etc!\n\n  Let me finish by reading an e-mail from another young Vermonter:\n\n       As a graduating law student I am particularly concerned \n     with the potential reduction of jobs available to me. I am \n     leaving school with a great amount of debt in student loans \n     and credit cards and entering the uncertain job market.\n       I currently pay a tremendous amount of money in rent. I \n     would like to work in poverty law but those jobs only pay \n     about 36,000 so it is unlikely going to happen.\n\n  Here is an example of a young man who goes to law school, wants to \nwork in poverty law, but because his debts are so high and the interest \nrate on that debt is so high, he no longer has a choice of careers. \nThis is happening to young people all over the country.\n  The middle class in America is collapsing. Poverty is increasing. The \ngap between the very wealthy and everybody else is growing wider. Today \nwe have by far the most unequal distribution of wealth and income of \nany major country on Earth. We are the only major country on this \nplanet without a national health care program. The cost of college \neducation is very high, while the oil companies make huge profits. Our \npeople cannot afford to fill up their gas tanks.\n  As Senator Dorgan said, the time is long overdue for this Congress to \nstart focusing on the real issues facing ordinary Americans. The time \nis now for us to develop the courage to stand up to the big money \ninterests, the 35,000 lobbyists who surround us every day, the big \ncampaign contributors who want benefits for the wealthy and the \npowerful. We have an obligation to stand up for the middle class. I \nhope we can begin doing that as soon as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                             Tax Filing Day\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, my colleagues on this side of the \naisle have spoken today about tax issues because today is the day for \nfiling income tax. I think it is appropriate that we remind each other \nabout a lot of tax\n\n[[Page S3004]]\n\nissues that are very important that we have to decide this year, next \nyear, and the following, or we are going to have the biggest tax \nincrease in the history of the country. We are taking the opportunity \non April 15 to talk about those.\n  When I was chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I worked to get \nthrough a narrowly divided Senate the biggest tax cut in a generation. \nWe reduced income tax rates for individual taxpayers. We created the \nfirst ever 10-percent bracket for lower income workers so they didn't \nhave to pay as much tax as they would at the 15-percent bracket on \ntheir first dollars earned. We reduced the marriage penalty because we \ndon't think one ought to pay more taxes because they are married. We \ncreated a deduction for college tuition. We also passed a deduction for \nschoolteachers buying supplies for their classrooms. I could go on with \na lot of other provisions in those tax bills, but they have all had \ngood economic consequences. We ought to consider that they should not \nsunset.\n  Now I and others are at work to make sure this tax relief is \nextended. If it is allowed to expire, Americans will be hit with the \nbiggest tax increase in history. That is one thing. But it is quite \nanother thing that this is going to happen without a vote of Congress. \nIn other words, on that magic date of sunset, we go back to levels of \ntaxation as they were before January 1, 2001, and we automatically, \nwithout a vote of Congress, end up with the biggest tax increase in the \nhistory of the country.\n  People say: Well, we are going to continue existing tax law. They \nneed to be intellectually honest and tell people that when they are \ndoing that, they are going to allow the biggest tax increase in the \nhistory of the country.\n  We can intervene. We need to intervene. It is my goal to intervene. \nThe last thing families need, the last thing small businesses need, the \nlast thing investors need is a tax increase. But that is what will \nhappen this year and in 2010, if Congress doesn't act.\n  Last week the Senate demonstrated support for extending current law \ntax relief without offsets, when it voted on energy tax incentives, \nthings that are meant to make the United States more energy efficient \nand less dependent upon foreign sources of energy. That same approach \ndemonstrated last week, extending current tax law relief without \noffsets, should rightfully apply to other expiring tax provisions, \nincluding the research and development tax credit and the individual \ntax provisions I have already mentioned. I will be working hard to see \nthat that does happen so taxpayers don't get hit with even higher \ntaxes. I learned a long time ago that you can't raise taxes high enough \nto satisfy the appetite of Congress to spend money.\n  Stopping the tax increases that people say we are not voting for, we \nare only allowing present law, which means the biggest tax increase in \nthe history of the country will happen without a vote of the people, we \ncan do something about it. We ought to do something about it. Stopping \nthese tax increases ought to be a major goal. Maybe taxes should not be \nlowered. Nobody is talking about lowering taxes. But we ought to keep \nthe present level of taxation, because it has been good for the \neconomy. It has been good for the taxpayers, because we do not see a \nrevolt going on by taxpayers as we have seen in recent years in the \nCongress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. What business is pending before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is under cloture on the motion to \nproceed to H.R. 1195, surface transportation technical corrections.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, under cloture, what it means of course \nis we are doing nothing--good speeches on important topics, but we are \nnot considering legislation. We are not debating a bill. We are killing \ntime, which turns out to be the major occupation of the Senate for the \nlast year and a half. Why? Because the minority party, the Republican \nParty, has a strategy. It is a strategy of using filibusters to slow \ndown or stop any bill from passing in the Senate. Today we are seeing \nthat strategy in the extreme.\n  The bill pending before the Senate is H.R. 1195. In the annals of \nlegislative history in the Senate, this will not go down as a great \npiece of legislation. This is not a bill that was worked on for years \nby Senators and their staffs, conceived with grand ideas to change this \ngreat country. This is a bill which by and large changes punctuation in \nthe Federal highway bill, a bill we passed several years ago. Then when \nwe carefully read it afterwards, we said: We got some of this wrong. \nThis should not have been ``trail.'' It should have read ``road.'' This \nsection you referred to wasn't exactly accurate. It is another section.\n  So we created a technical corrections bill, a bill that cleaned up \nthe Federal highway bill. This technical corrections bill is now being \nfilibustered by the Republican side of the aisle. They want to stop us \nfrom voting on a technical corrections bill. They want to delay our \nconsideration of even this housekeeping bill. You ask yourself why. \nFrankly, because they don't want us to take up legislation of even \ngreater importance. This is an important bill. Don't get me wrong. By \ncleaning up the old Federal highway bill, we can move forward on \nhighway projects. We can spend a billion dollars creating good-paying \njobs right here in the United States, 4 to 500 different projects \nacross our country, 40,000 new jobs. That is good. But these were all \ndestined to occur. We are just making sure the language is clear enough \nto move forward.\n\n  We are really not generating a lot of controversy and debate, are we, \nabout this bill? Two or three little amendments we could take care of \nin a matter of an hour, that is about it. But what has happened is that \nthe Republican minority is trying to stop the majority party--the \nDemocratic Party--from considering and passing important legislation.\n  In the history of the U.S. Senate--this grand body, this deliberative \nbody--in the history of this institution, the record number of \nfilibusters in any 2-year period of time was 57, until the Republican \nminority decided to take on this strategy. So far, last year and the \nfirst few months of this year, there have been 65 Republican \nfilibusters this Congress, and still counting. They have broken a \nrecord. Who cares? Well, I think a lot of people should care.\n  We heard the Senator from Vermont a few minutes ago. He talked about \nhis genuine concern about working people in his State. He talked about \nthe impact of this economy on average working families. He talked about \nthe impact of gasoline prices, $3.50 a gallon and higher. He talked \nabout the impact of food costs going up on families all across America, \nthe cost of health insurance, the cost of college education, the cost \nof daycare for kids. He talked about the fact that the majority of \nfamilies have not seen an increase in real income over the last 7 years \nof this administration. He feels, as I do, that this Senate should be \ndealing with that issue. What is keeping us from doing so? The \nfilibusters from the Republican side of the aisle: 65 and still \ncounting, a record number of filibusters.\n  So Senator McConnell, who is the Republican minority leader in the \nSenate, was asked a question at a press conference today. The reporter \nsaid to Senator McConnell about his Republican caucus:\n\n       Are you and the caucus prepared now to start slowing down \n     work on the floor and legislation in response?\n\n  He answers:\n\n       Well, we are on the highway technical corrections bill. It \n     is open for amendments. We were discussing various amendments \n     at our lunch earlier and I assume amendments are going to be \n     offered and dealt with.\n\n  That was his answer, and unfortunately it is wrong. We are not \nconsidering amendments to this bill because we are still under cloture \non the motion to proceed that doesn't expire until 11:30 p.m. tonight.\n  So if Senator McConnell really wants us to consider amendments to \nthis bill and get it finished, he needs to walk out on the floor and \nagree to a unanimous consent to move to this bill immediately and \nconsider it. Then his statement to the press this afternoon will be \naccurate. But until he does, it is not accurate. We are stuck, stuck on \ncloture, stuck, as we have been time and again by this Republican \nminority. I, for one, believe they have pushed it to the extreme--a \nfilibuster on a technical corrections bill.\n\n[[Page S3005]]\n\n  Can you think of anything else, Madam President, we might be \nconsidering? Well, how about the policy on the war in Iraq, a war that \nclaimed 2 American lives yesterday, a war that has taken over 4,025 of \nour best and bravest, that has injured more than 30,000, that has cost \nthis country over $700 billion, that continues to cost us $10 billion \nto $15 billion a month; a war that claims the lives of our soldiers, \nruins the morale of many troops who refuse to reenlist; a war that has \nstretched our military to a breaking point. Is that worth a few minutes \nof debate here on the floor of the Senate, the policy of this country \ntoward the war in Iraq?\n  How about the war in Afghanistan? A war that was designed to go after \nthose responsible for 9/11, to capture Osama bin Laden; a war which is \nstalled because we have dedicated so many resources to Iraq; a war \nwhich we must win so that al-Qaida and the Taliban do not resume their \ncontrol over this poor country; a war which sadly has not resulted in \nthe capture of Osama bin Laden more than 6 years after the terrible \ntragedies of 9/11. Is that worth a few hours on the floor, maybe a \nresolution, maybe a discussion about policy? I think it is, but we \ncan't get to it because Republican filibusters are stopping us.\n  Maybe we should spend a few moments talking about our dependence on \nforeign oil and what we can do to bring down gasoline prices across \nAmerica; how we can work on a bipartisan basis to find renewable, \nsustainable sources of energy that fuel our economy without killing our \nenvironment. Is that worth a little debate here on the floor of the \nSenate? Most Americans think it is an important issue but, sadly, we \nare stuck with a Republican filibuster again. Maybe we could spend some \ntime bringing the bill out of the Committee on the Environment, the cap \nand trade bill, a bipartisan bill by Senator Warner, a Republican of \nVirginia, Senator Lieberman, an independent Democrat of Connecticut. \nMaybe we could bring that to the floor and talk about a way to clean up \nthis world's environment so our kids have a fighting chance to have a \nplanet they can live on, so that we can devise with American ingenuity \na system using our free market to make this a cleaner planet. Is that \nworth a few hours of debate on the floor?\n\n  Debate on the Children's Health Insurance Program that the President \nhas vetoed not once but twice, a program to extend health insurance \ncoverage to some children in America who are not poor enough to qualify \nfor Medicaid and not lucky enough to have parents with health \ninsurance, is that worth a few hours of debate on the floor? I think it \nis.\n  Those issues and so many others are the ones the American people \nexpect us to be talking about right here in Washington. But instead we \nhave a bill, with grammar and punctuation, trying to clean up a Federal \nhighway bill of several years ago, that is being filibustered by the \nRepublican side of the aisle. This is shameful. It is such a waste of \ntime in this great institution, but it is a specifically designed \nstrategy by the Republicans to slow down the business of the Senate and \nto stop us from considering critically important legislation for \nAmerica.\n  I would say to Senator McConnell, who said that we are on the highway \ntechnical corrections bill and it is open for amendments, it will be \nopen for amendments when Senator McConnell comes to the floor and gives \nus his consent to stop the filibuster and to give us a chance to pass \nthis bill, as we should have last week, and move on to more important \nlegislation--legislation the American people ask us to consider. Sixty-\nfive Republican filibusters this Congress and still counting. The Grand \nOld Party, the Republican Party, the GOP now has a new name. It is no \nlonger the GOP, Grand Old Party. From the Republicans in the Senate, we \nhave learned that it is the Graveyard of Progress. That is their idea \nof their role in the Senate. Any proposal for change, any proposal for \nprogress, they want to kill. This graveyard is going to speak back to \nthem in November.\n  I think the American people have had it with the obstructionism, the \nslowdowns, and the obstacles we are seeing here in Washington. The \nvoters get their chance in November. I hope they will join us. I hope \nthey will send more Senators to Washington who are prepared to not only \ndebate but vote for change, Senators who are willing to say: Put an end \nto these mind-numbing filibusters and get down to work. Roll up your \nsleeves and do something to make life better for working families. Do \nsomething about this energy crisis. Make this planet a safer place for \nour kids to live on. Be responsible when it comes to spending, and \nstart bringing the American soldiers home. That is what we should be \ndoing. Instead, we are stuck in another Republican filibuster.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, today is tax day. People all across \nAmerica are heading to the post office to get that all-important \n``April 15'' postmark. OK, not everybody waits until the last minute, \nbut there are enough procrastinators among us that this is sort of a \nrite of spring. The first week in Washington brings the cherry \nblossoms. The 15th of the month brings long lines near midnight in \nfront of the main post office just a few blocks from the floor of the \nSenate.\n  For some taxpayers, 2007 was a very good year. Huge fortunes were \nmade on Wall Street by people who correctly bet against the housing \nmarket, and some of those of the very wealthiest people were given huge \ntax breaks that the middle class never saw. But for the people who live \nin all of those homes, those homes that Wall Street people were betting \nagainst in some sense, 2007 was a very tough year. The home ownership \nrate has actually fallen over the past 6 years, both nationally by a \nslight amount and close to 2 percent in the Midwest. What is \nextraordinary about this fact is that it came during a period of the \nlowest interest rates since the Eisenhower administration. With the \neconomy expanding, with interest rates at record lows, home ownership \nshould have expanded. Instead, it shrunk.\n  The reason is another trend that has received too little notice by \nthe Nation's newspapers and the Nation's media: economic growth, simply \nput, has not benefited most Americans. Instead, income and wealth are \nmore and more flowing to the most affluent in our country. The middle \nclass, meanwhile, must work harder and longer to try to maintain its \nstandard of living. Real wages have been in decline for the past \nseveral years. The only way a lot of families have kept up is, first, \nthe entry of more women into the workplace--women in greater numbers; \nsecond, workers in this country working longer and longer hours, \novertime if they can get it, two jobs, sometimes even three jobs; and \nthird, the only way families have kept up is by taking on more and more \ndebt. The third strategy can be a recipe for disaster; sooner or later, \nthe bills come due. You can't borrow your way very long to a decent \nstandard of living.\n\n  Economic security begins with economic opportunity. That means good-\npaying jobs. It means the kind of training that enables workers to \ndiversify their skills and take on new challenges. It means high-\nquality primary, secondary, and, yes, higher education.\n  Our Nation is the wealthiest in the world. Overall economic growth \nhas been strong. Working families should be thriving. By and large, \nthey are not. Working families are struggling to find and maintain \ngood-paying jobs to keep their health benefits, to keep their pension \nbenefits if they have them, and those benefits, those health and \npension benefits, are being scaled back. It costs more and more, as \npeople painfully know every day, to fill the gas tank. People are \nborrowing in record amounts just to cover day-to-day costs. So many \nOhioans from Galion to Gallipolis are struggling.\n  The Center for American Progress looked at some key statistics over \nthe past 5 years and found that the average job growth is one-fifth the \nrate of previous business cycles. The average job growth is one-fifth--\n20 percent--the rate of previous business cycles. Wages have been flat. \nOnly 28 percent of middle-class families have the financial resources \nto sustain themselves through a period of unemployment. The average \nfamily took on debt equal to 126 percent of disposable income just to \nmanage its day-to-day expenses.\n  Having witnessed the weakest economic expansion in modern history--in\n\n[[Page S3006]]\n\nother words, the growth in our economy, the expansion in our economy \nwas weaker than the expansion of the economy at any time in recent \nhistory--we now find ourselves in a recession once again. So we didn't \nhave very strong growth when things were supposedly good--when profits \nwere up, when there was economic growth--but it wasn't spread around \nvery well. Now we find ourselves in a recession once again. We have had \nthree straight months of job losses. Consumer confidence in Lima and in \nZanesville and all over my State is understandably shaken.\n  Our Nation cannot afford to take these statistics in stride, just \nhoping that the precarious financial position of working families is a \ntemporary phenomenon linked to the ebbs and flows of our economy, \nbecause it is not. Our economy as a whole is losing ground. As our \ntrade deficit skyrockets, energy and health care costs spiral upward, \ngood-paying jobs are too often shipped overseas, and our Federal \ndeficit climbs higher and higher and higher. Yet, when Congress tries \nto address any of these problems, we find ourselves faced with \nfilibusters, one after another after another, as well as veto threats. \nWhen we tried to react to the Housing crisis last fall, Republicans \nobjected. When we tried to tackle the topic in February, the \nRepublicans objected and we faced a filibuster. Even today, the \nPresident threatens to veto the bill passed by the Senate. Sixty-five \nfilibusters, as Senator Durbin and others have said, 65 filibusters--\nmore filibusters already in the year and 3 months this Senate has been \nin session than in any 2-year period in the history of the U.S. Senate. \nSixty-five filibusters. It means we haven't been able to do what we \nought to do in education, on health care, on infrastructure, and, most \nimportantly, on the war in Iraq.\n  Today, as an example, we are simply trying to pass a technical \ncorrections bill to a highway bill. Yet our Republican colleagues are \nfilibustering and slow walking the legislation once again. Sixty-five \nfilibusters.\n  We spend $3 billion a week in Iraq, with no questions asked. \nHalliburton can rob us blind, but we avert our gaze. But to try to \nbuild a road, a bridge, or some other public works in the United \nStates, and you will meet with filibusters, delays, and obstructionism \nby the Republicans. In other words, taxpayers are paying $3 billion and \nbuilding hundreds of water systems in Iraq--spending that money with \nHalliburton and Bechtel--and the money goes to these contractors \ninstead of that money coming back to local businesses and building \nwater and sewer systems in Defiance, Findlay, Bryan, Napoleon, and \nPerrysburg, OH--places that are being squeezed and are not able to \nafford the reconstruction of the water and sewer systems they need.\n  We should be doing a lot more construction and a lot less \nobstruction. Our roads and bridges, in too many cases, are falling \napart. If my colleagues don't like a project, they can make their case \nand offer an amendment instead of the obstructionism, instead of \nblocking these issues, instead of their 65 filibusters.\n  The American people are tired of this kind of delay. Their taxes \nshould pay for a government that will work on their behalf, rather than \nonly on behalf of the wealthiest and most powerful people in this \ncountry.\n  We cannot continue down a path that undermines the middle class. We \ncannot just hope for real economic recovery. You simply cannot get \nthere from here.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield to me for a question?\n  Mr. BROWN. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend for that, because this bill before us \nis a job producer. There is tremendous support for it. I wanted to make \nsure my friend was aware--because I have to ask him a question--of the \nsupport we have. The thing is, when you unleash a billion dollars for \n500 projects, which have been tied up for technical reasons, it is \ngoing to create jobs. I ask my friend if he was aware of the broad \nsupport we have. I will read the list of organizations supporting this \ntechnical corrections bill, which will free up some 500 highway \nprojects: American Association of Highway and Transportation Officials, \nwhich is the departments of transportation for all 50 States; American \nHighway Users Alliance; American Public Transit Association, which is \nthe transit systems; American Road and Transportation Builders \nAssociation, which is more than 5,000 members of the transportation \nconstruction industry; Associated General Contractors, which is more \nthan 32,000 contractors, service providers, and suppliers; Council of \nUniversity Transportation Centers, which is more than 30 university \ntransportation centers from across the country; National Stone, Sand \nand Gravel Association, the companies producing more than 92 percent of \ncrushed stone and 75 percent of the sand and gravel used in the United \nStates annually; National Asphalt and Pavement Association, which is \nmore than 1,100 companies that produce and pave with asphalt.\n  The point is, when we do this work, in many ways we are creating a \nbit of a stimulus. These are the companies and the workers who are \nsuffering right now because of the economic downturn. Before my friend \nleaves, I wanted to thank him and also ask him if he was aware of the \nstrong support for this bill.\n  Mr. BROWN. Yes, there is strong support. I appreciate the comments of \nthe Senator from California. There is strong support for this bill, but \nnot just in those groups. I had in my office building trades people \nfrom Mansfield, Lima, Cleveland, Dayton, and Columbus. They were \ntalking about the kinds of jobs--good-paying jobs--in our State on road \ncrews, such as the operating engineers and laborers and all kinds of \nworkers that are paid decent wages. It is a stimulus, as the Senator \nsays. It injects money into our economy immediately. These are ready-\nto-go projects. We need to fund them so we can work immediately to \ncreate these jobs, which will spin off and create other jobs.\n  But it is the same old story. We have had 65 filibusters from \nRepublicans to stop us from moving forward on everything from health \ncare, to education, to ending the war in Iraq, to jobs programs such as \nthis. This is the best kind of jobs and economic development program. \nNot only will it create jobs immediately, but it makes it much easier \nfor economic development and for people to bring new business into \ncommunities because the infrastructure is more modern.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to ask something else. The Senator is not on the \ncommittee of jurisdiction, but I know he is interested to hear this. We \ncorrect a real problem in this bill. The organization that does the \nevaluation of our Nation's bridges, highways, and all of our byways, \nhas run out of funds. The funds they had have been oversubscribed. What \nwe do, without adding any new funds, is enable them to get funding and \nto continue their work, as we get ready for the next highway bill, \nwhich is coming to us next year.\n  I wanted to make sure my friend was aware that, as we get ready for \nthe new highway bill, we need to know the condition of our highways. We \nhave seen collapsing bridges. That is another reason it is so \nimportant. I am very hopeful that by this evening we are going to see \nsome relenting. I have been on the floor since Monday morning. I don't \nmind that, but it is wasting time, truth be known. We can have a few \namendments and we can wrap this up. My colleagues can go back home and \nsay we have done something.\n  I want to specifically know if my colleague was aware of this \nparticular account that funds the investigation of the state of our \ninfrastructure--that they have run out of money, and that we fix that \nin this bill?\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the Senator for this information and for all she \nis doing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                              Papal Visit\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senator from \nColorado is in the chair.\n  I will begin by simply extending a word of welcome to the Holy \nFather, who, a few minutes ago, landed in our country for his historic \nvisit. I feel tremendously honored that I will have the opportunity to \nsee his arrival ceremony at the White House tomorrow and, of course, \nthen to be with him and, I presume, with the President as we celebrate \nMass with him at Nationals Park. It is a momentous and historic \noccasion.\n\n[[Page S3007]]\n\n  I know I speak for many of us as I say the Holy Father is welcome to \nthe United States. We are delighted he is here. We hope his message of \nspiritual renewal, hope, and peace is one that will resonate with the \nAmerican people.\n\n\n                     Colombian Free Trade Agreement\n\n  Mr. President, the Colombian free trade agreement is of great \nimportance to me personally. It is something that I believe requires \nthe attention of this Congress, and it is something whose time has come \nfor us to act and make a determination.\n  There has been a great deal of attention focused on the future \nprospects of this trade agreement with Colombia. The core question is \nwhether we think people in the United States should be able to \neffectively compete in Colombia. What is at stake is whether we want to \ncreate jobs here in the United States, create additional wealth in the \nUnited States, and export more goods and services to Colombia.\n  The fact is that a free trade agreement with Colombia benefits all of \nthe stakeholders involved. It is good for the United States, it is good \nfor Colombia, but it also is good for the Western Hemisphere.\n  The United States would reap immediate benefits of a free trade \nagreement with Colombia in our level of exports--one of the strongest \nand more positive areas of our economy today.\n  I know the Senator from Ohio was just speaking about the economic \nhard times in our country. I know and respect him greatly. I am not \nsure he agrees this is a good agreement for us to sign. But what better \nway is there of improving economic circumstances than to export and \nsell more of our goods to a country that wants to be our friend and our \npartner.\n  By leveling the playing field and eliminating the tariffs on products \nwe export to Colombia, this agreement would benefit those responsible \nfor the $8.6 billion in merchandise the United States exported to \nColombia last year.\n  Currently, more than 9,000 United States companies export products to \nColombia. Of those, 8,000 are small and medium-sized firms. In the \nabsence of a free trade agreement, these firms must pay up to 35 \npercent when sending their goods to Colombia. On the other side of the \nequation, more than 90 percent of imports from Colombia coming into the \nUnited States arrive here duty free.\n  This agreement will immediately eliminate tariffs on more than 80 \npercent of American exports of industrial and consumer goods, and then \nreaching up to 100 percent over time.\n  This is an agreement that will bring more business to American firms, \nand it will bring higher demand for products from farmers in Louisiana, \nmachinery manufacturing workers in Alabama, transportation equipment \nproviders in Illinois, and electronics makers in California.\n  My own State of Florida--home to what we think of as the ``gateway to \nthe Americas'' in Miami--was responsible for $2.1 billion in exports to \nColombia in 2007, the second largest export total in the Nation.\n  The free trade agreement would benefit the more than 28,500 companies \nin my State that provided products in areas such as computers and \nelectronics, machinery manufacturing, and transportation equipment.\n  The trade agreement makes sense economically, but also from a \nnational security standpoint, it strengthens our relationship with a \nkey Latin American ally and demonstrates our commitment to supporting \nnations who choose their leaders through free and fair democratic \nelections and who support the rule of law.\n  In fact, the U.S. Southern Command, which oversees our forces in \nCentral and South America, sees the Colombian free trade agreement as a \ncritical component of our Nation's Latin American policy.\n  A few days ago, I saw Admiral Stavridis, head of the Southern \nCommand, who was testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee. \nI asked Admiral Stavridis whether he felt the Colombian free trade \nagreement was an important component of our overall policy for the \nregion and whether it would add to our ability to increase U.S. \ninfluence and security in the area. He wholeheartedly agreed.\n  Recently, a group of SouthCom military leaders, including GEN Peter \nPace, expressed their support of the agreement in an open letter to \nCongress.\n  These officials know of the diplomatic opportunities this trade \nagreement represents, especially given their unique perspective on the \ncurrent climate in Central and South America.\n  In their letter, they affirm that passing this agreement ``will build \nupon [Colombia's] recent advances to enhance the long-term prospects \nfor peace, stability, and development in Colombia.''\n  They also argue that it is in our ``national interest to help \nColombia along the road toward democratic consolidation and economic \ndevelopment.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Open Letter to Congress From Former Commanders of the U.S. Southern \n     Command Supporting the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement\n\n       We are writing to urge your support for the U.S.-Colombia \n     Trade Promotion Agreement. This vital agreement will advance \n     U.S. interests in Colombia, a strategically located country \n     that is arguably our closest ally in Latin America. It will \n     also underscore our deep commitment to stability and growth \n     in the strategically important Andean region, which depends \n     on Colombia's continued progress as a resilient and \n     democratic society.\n       Colombia's transformation over the past decade is a triumph \n     of brave and principled Colombians. It is also a remarkable \n     achievement of bipartisan U.S. foreign policy. Violence has \n     fallen to its lowest level in a generation, and 45,000 \n     fighters have been demobilized as the country's narco-\n     guerrilla groups have lost legitimacy. While drug-trafficking \n     poses a continuing threat, Colombia's leaders have eliminated \n     two-thirds of its opium production, and more than 500 \n     traffickers have been extradited during the Uribe \n     administration--by far the most extraditions from any country \n     to the United States.\n       Colombia's economic resurgence has been a critical factor \n     in its recent progress, Robust investment has boosted \n     economic growth and development. The creation of new jobs has \n     provided tens of thousands of Colombians with long-term \n     alternatives to narcotic trafficking or illegal emigration.\n       The US.-Columbia Trade Promotion Agreement will build upon \n     these recent advances to enhance the long-term prospects for \n     peace, stability, and development in Colombia. Providing new \n     incentives for investment and job creation, this landmark \n     accord will help ensure that Colombia stays on the path of \n     economic openness, the rule of law, and transparency.\n       It is in our national interest to help Colombia progress \n     along the road toward democratic consolidation and economic \n     development. This trade agreement will advance U.S. security \n     and economic interests by forging a deeper partnership.\n       Finally, approving this agreement will meet our duty to \n     stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Colombians as they have stood \n     by the United States as friends and allies. For all of these \n     reasons, we strongly urge Congress to approve the U.S.-\n     Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement.\n           Sincerely,\n     General James T. Hill,\n       Commander in Chief, United States Southern Command 2002-\n     2004.\n     General Barry McCaffrey,\n       Commander in Chief, U.S. Southern Command 1994-1996.\n     General Peter Pace,\n       Commander in Chief, U.S. Southern Command 2000-2001.\n     General Charles E. Wilhelm,\n       Commander in Chief, U.S. Southern Command 1997-2000.\n     General George Joulwan,\n       Commander in Chief, U.S. Southern Command 1990-1993.\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, Colombia remains one of our strongest \nallies within the region. It is the strategic center of Latin America, \nof all of the Andean countries. Geographically, it is in a precise and \nimportant spot in the region. It is a country of 40 million people. It \nis a very significant country.\n  Fostering this important relationship holds strategic importance to \nadvancing our security and economic interests in South America and also \nwith the Colombian Government. Colombia's Congress voted twice in favor \nof passing this trade agreement.\n  It would honor the commitment we made when signing the agreement last \nyear and would provide greater stability and security to the Colombian\n\n[[Page S3008]]\n\npeople as their quality of life continues to improve. I know some \ncritics of the trade agreement point to some of the violence against \nlabor organizers that has occurred over the years as the reason not to \nratify.\n  In doing so, I believe they fail to recognize the progress that has \noccurred in Colombia in recent years. Colombia has had a violent \nhistory. I can recall in younger days when I used to travel to Colombia \nfrequently. It was not only a beautiful and wonderful country, but you \nwere perfectly free to go throughout the country. Over the years, the \nviolence brought upon the people of Colombia by FARC, or the \nRevolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, has wreaked havoc on that \ncountry. It was to the point where the violence was incredible.\n  Six years ago, as President Alvaro Uribe delivered his inaugural \naddress, mortar shells landed near the Presidential palace in Bogota \nand killed 14 people and wounded another 40. That was the level \nviolence had reached in this country.\n  These events and crimes against labor organizers were common prior to \nwhen President Uribe came into office in 2002. Since that time, \nviolence has dramatically decreased in Colombia, and the Colombian \nGovernment's presence is being felt in cities and towns across the \nnation.\n  Let me point out that one death of an innocent civilian or one death \nof a union leader or union organizer is one death too many. Colombia \nhas seen more than its share of violence.\n  I point to this chart which I believe is accurate in pointing out the \nactual figures when it comes to union leader violence. Notice the high \npoint in 2001. This is before President Uribe was President. Then he \ncomes into the Presidency and look at the dramatic drop since his \nPresidency down to where it is today. This is not just violence against \nunion leaders. President Uribe has been effective in pacifying the \ncountry.\n  The violence against unionists has declined 86 percent during his \ntime in office from 2002 to 2007. The reason for this decline is \nPresident Uribe's attention and response to concerns over these \nattacks. The President established an independent prosecutor unit and \ncreated a special program to protect labor activists. They can actually \nseek protection from the Government and be provided with armored \nvehicles, with protection for union halls, and personal protection for \nthem as they go about the country.\n  There has been significant progress in other areas of Colombia as \nwell, which is improving the lives of the Colombian people.\n  It is astonishing to see homicides are down 40 percent, kidnappings \nare down 83 percent, and terrorist attacks are down 76 percent. This is \nas a result of what, in fact, has been a very successful partnership. \nOne of those moments of bipartisan agreement that the President and I \nso often yearn for in this Congress started under President Clinton \nwith support from the Republicans, continued under President Bush with \nsupport from Democrats.\n  We had Plan Colombia. This has been a way of helping the Colombian \nGovernment and the Colombian people to continue to strengthen their \ndemocracy. President Uribe was elected to office with over 60 percent \nof the Colombian vote, and he is a democratically elected leader who is \nfighting an insurgent group that seeks to destroy his Government and \ndemocracy in Colombia by means of violence.\n  When we stand with President Uribe, when we stand with the duly \nconstituted Government elected by the people of Colombia, we are \nstanding on the side of those who respect democracy, freedom, and human \nrights.\n  When we talk about the kidnappings, these kidnappings have now been \nlimited to poor peasants, although that has been part of it, but it has \nalso included Government officials. Miss Betancourt, who has gained \ninternational notoriety because of efforts by the French Government to \nfree her, was a Presidential candidate in the midst of a Presidential \ncampaign when she was kidnapped. Also, members of the Congress of \nColombia, businesspeople--they have shown no mercy. Today it is rumored \nthey maintain about 700 kidnapped victims with them in the jungles of \nColombia. Colombia's Foreign Minister is someone who was a victim of \nkidnapping who escaped 5 years ago, maybe more, from the jungles of \nColombia and has regained his freedom.\n  Public school enrollment in Colombia has increased 92 percent. The \nchild mortality rate has decreased dramatically as the Government \nturned its focus to human rights and also living conditions. The number \nof tourists visiting Colombia has doubled in the last 5 years.\n  Colombia is on the rise. Colombians enjoy a better quality of life \nbecause they have been living in a country that is more peaceful. For \nthat, I think the Colombian people are very grateful to the United \nStates. There is no country in the region that is more pro-U.S, that is \nmore pro-American, and so much wants to interact and work with us. \nEnhancing that relationship will continue to bring prosperity at a time \nwhen Colombians continue to face destabilizing forces of terrorism.\n  There is a second aspect of Plan Colombia. It is not just about \nbuilding the Colombian military, as important as that is. There is a \nsecond phase. It is about people, it is about job generation, job \ncreation. That is why it is important to enter into this free-trade \nagreement so that U.S. investment dollars might flow to Colombia and \nincrease jobs in Colombia as we increase jobs in America as well.\n\n  One of the most prominent narcoterrorist organizations operating \nwithin their borders is the FARC. ELN is another one. FARC is an \norganization that supports a brand of terrorism much like al-Qaida.\n  FARC's greatest enemy is stability, the same sort of political and \neconomic stability provided by trade agreements such as these.\n  They oppose the democratically elected Government, and they would \nlove nothing more than to return Colombia to the days of corruption, \nchaos, murder, and mayhem. It would be unwise to abandon this vital \nalliance in the face of a difficult time for them.\n  A trade agreement with the United States would deal a blow to those \nattempting to hinder Colombia's growth, to those who offer a misguided \nvision of the future of the region to those who hear their cry.\n  The fact is, there is a battle of ideas going on in the hemisphere, \nand this battle of ideas is one we cannot shrink from but must engage. \nBy entering into this agreement, we would join a growing list of \npartners in the region that have demonstrated commitment to human \nrights, free and fair elections, and strengthening trade relations with \nus.\n  We have a very strong partnership. NAFTA, I must confess I find it a \nlittle difficult to understand how NAFTA, which has created jobs all \nover America, could be faulted for jobs going to China. And I cannot \nbelieve, on a serious note, those who seek to be the President of our \ncountry would walk away from that trade agreement. The fact is, this \ntrade agreement is one that would enhance and advance the interests of \nthe United States.\n  I do not believe in a country that would be afraid to compete with \nthose abroad. I believe in the America that is proud and strong and can \ncompete with anyone in the world. We cannot just shelter within our \nshores. We cannot just retreat to fortress America. Those days are \ngone. We created the global trade we live in today and to retreat from \nthat would be a misguided mistake.\n  Over the weekend, both the New York Times and the L.A. Times ran \npieces urging Congress to ratify this important and historic trade \nagreement. According to the New York Times, ``rejecting or putting on \nice the trade agreement would reduce the United States' credibility and \nleverage in Colombia and beyond.''\n  And the L.A. Times characterized the House's decision to halt the \nvote by stating ``it wasn't about the U.S. economy and it wasn't about \nColombia. It was politics.''\n  I don't want to dwell on that issue because I believe the best way \nfor this to take place is for us to continue to work together in a \nbipartisan fashion to try to bring about an agreement that would be \ngood for America, good for the region, good for Colombia, good for the \nUnited States, good for our people, good for their people. This is the \nkind of trade agreement that is a win-win.\n\n[[Page S3009]]\n\n  I was talking about NAFTA. We then moved to Central America and the \nDominican Republic, and we have CAFTA. That trade agreement is creating \nand generating jobs in that region. We have a free-trade agreement with \nPeru and Panama, and if Colombia joins in, that would create a \npowerful, mighty trade alliance creating and generating jobs and \nexports from the United States to this region.\n  I was meeting this morning with a gentleman who is hoping to be the \nnext Ambassador of the United States to Honduras. I asked him how has \nCAFTA impacted our relationship with Honduras. He said there has been \nseveral billion dollars a year of trade between us and Honduras, and it \nhad increased U.S. exports to Honduras by 18 percent. That is good for \nAmerica. That is good for American jobs.\n  So I hope calmer voices will prevail. It would give us a chance to \nvote on this important trade agreement. It was signed by Colombia and \nthe United States well over a year ago. There is never a perfect time \nfor these agreements. I believe the votes are there. I believe it is \ntime to allow the votes to take place instead of utilizing procedural \nmaneuvers that, at the end of the day, are not particularly democratic.\n  Mr. President, I hope we can move forward to consider this agreement, \nto study the elements of it, to see the merits of it. It goes beyond \nstating the obvious: that this is something that not only would help \neconomically, but it would also be a tremendous boost to our \nrelationship in this region of the world that all too often feels \nforgotten, that all too often feels our eyes are focused elsewhere in \nthe world, but are always our closest neighbors, are always our people \nwho each and every day signify more and more to us.\n  A great many people of Colombian heritage live in the State of \nFlorida and in other States of our country. They are great contributors \nto the American experiment. I am proud to have them among my \nconstituents. I know in the southern part of my State, this is a big, \nimportant issue. It is one whose time has come. I hope the Speaker will \nreconsider. I hope we will move forward with this important trade \nagreement.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise in support of passing the bill \nthat is on the Senate floor; that is, the SAFETEA-LU technical \ncorrections bill. When we look at the bill that is of the magnitude of \nthe SAFETEA-LU bill and its extraordinary importance in our economy, \nthere are bound to be some drafting errors and issues. I am glad we are \ntaking the time to correct these errors so we can continue to \nstrengthen our national infrastructure and our economy.\n  As a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I applaud \nSenator Boxer's leadership in getting this bill to the floor. This bill \nis a step in the right direction as this Congress focuses more and more \nattention on our national infrastructure.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, as well as future \nefforts, to strengthen our national infrastructure.\n  The Presiding Officer, being a Senator from Colorado, knows and I \nknow there is a new economy in the future. It is the energy economy. \nBut if we are going to move forward the next century's economy, we \ncannot be stuck in the last century's transportation system.\n  I believe when you invest in infrastructure, you invest in the \nAmerican economy. Rebuilding Main Street means revitalizing Main \nStreet. The Federal Highway Administration estimates that for every $1 \nbillion of Federal highway investment, it creates over 30,000 jobs. So \nwhen we rebuild our roads, we strengthen our economy.\n  As you know, a bridge collapsed one day in the middle of Minnesota. \nIt was something no one could ever believe would happen in the middle \nof our major Interstate Highway System.\n  As I said that day, a bridge should not fall down in the middle of \nAmerica, especially not an eight-lane interstate highway, especially \nnot one of the most heavily traveled bridges in our State, and \nespecially not at rush hour in the heart of a major metropolitan area, \nand especially not in my front yard. As you know, Mr. President, as you \nhave seen, the area of that bridge was only 8 blocks from my house.\n  Unfortunately, it has taken a disaster of this magnitude to put the \nissue of infrastructure investment squarely on the national agenda, and \nit is long overdue.\n  The sudden failure and collapse of the I-35W bridge has raised many \nquestions about the condition and safety of our roads and bridges. In \nfact, we just had a bridge that was similarly designed shut down in St. \nCloud, MN, about an hour and a half away from the bridge that \ncollapsed. It was designed by the same designer, with the same problem \nwith the bent gussets. The investigation is still going on into the \nexact cause and triggering events that led to the collapse of the I-35W \nbridge.\n  The fact a bridge closed down so near, and the State of Minnesota \ndecided to replace that bridge rather than repair it, shows this is not \nan isolated incident. Critical investment in the maintenance and \nconstruction of our Nation's transportation is imperative. \nStrengthening and maintaining our national infrastructure must be a \nnational priority.\n  At the moment, our priorities are not in the right place. We spend \n$12 billion a month in Iraq, with no end in sight, but our bridges fall \ndown in the middle of America. We have tax cuts for the top 1 percent, \nbut it is getting harder and harder for the middle class to get by. We \nneed to better prioritize our national spending.\n\n  Our robust, well-maintained, up-to-date highway system is vital to \nthe continued expansion of our economy. It is, in fact, an essential \ndriver of our economic prosperity. As President Kennedy once said:\n\n       Building a road or highway isn't pretty. But it's something \n     that our economy needs to have.\n\n  And nowhere is this truer than in rural America.\n  In Minnesota, the relationship between highways and the economy is \nmost obvious in our rural areas. Transportation is absolutely essential \nto their viability and to their vitality. Rural Minnesota is now in the \nmidst of an economic revival that promises to grow even stronger. We \nare seeing this all over America with the energy revolution, whether it \nis wind or solar or geothermal or whether it is ethanol or biodiesel.\n  As our Nation demands greater energy independence and security, the \nrural parts of our country are poised to benefit enormously with the \nfurther development of home-grown energy. I believe we need to be \nprepared to maximize the opportunities offered by this renewable energy \nrevolution. It is only beginning to emerge, but it promises major \neconomic and technological changes for our country.\n  Already the development of wind farms and ethanol plants has \nrejuvenated many rural areas in our State. We are third in the country \nwhen it comes to wind energy. But at the same time, these wonderful new \nenergies are placing new demands on our transportation infrastructure. \nHere is one example: Demand for ethanol has increased dramatically. \nThis Congress has pushed it. We are now with corn ethanol, but we know \nwe will also expand into cellulosic, switchgrass, prairie grass, and \nother forms of biomass. For the first 6 months of 2007, ethanol \nproduction in the United States totaled nearly 3 billion gallons--32 \npercent higher than the same period last year.\n  Currently, there are 128 ethanol plants nationwide, with total annual \nproduction capacity nearing close to 7 billion gallons. An additional \n85 plants are under construction. As we know, this is just the \nbeginning. We look at places such as Brazil, which are completely \nenergy independent because of what they have done with sugarcane. We \nknow corn isn't the only answer. We will expand into other kinds of \nethanol. But we do know this is going to place demands--demands we want \nto have--on our Nation's transportation infrastructure.\n  Total ethanol production in the United States is projected to exceed \n13 billion gallons per year by early 2009, if not sooner. What does \nthat mean in terms of transportation? Well, this means an average \nsquare mile of land in southern Minnesota, which now generates the \nequivalent of 80 loaded semitrucks per year, could soon produce double \nthat--160 loads of grain per year. As more homegrown energy is \nproduced, rural roads and bridges will have greater demands placed on \nthem, as will rural rail.\n\n[[Page S3010]]\n\n  I have had members of my own State of Minnesota--constituents--come \nup and show me these old rail ties that are breaking down. I have seen \nmyself the bridges that are in need of shoulders. I have seen the \nhighways that are in need of repair. Some of our roads in Minnesota are \nin such disrepair they have actually been letting them go to dirt. We \nare going the opposite because they do not have the money to repair \nthem.\n  The ethanol plant in Benson, MN, now has over 525 fully loaded semis \nhauling either corn, ethanol or other forms of biodiesel from their \nplant every week. This is a 45-million gallon ethanol facility. Their \nproduction falls around the middle of Minnesota's 16 ethanol plants.\n  SMI Hydraulics is a company in rural southwestern Minnesota that \nmanufactures the bases for the wind towers you see all across southern \nMinnesota. I have visited the company. They basically started in a \nbarn, and they are building these huge wind towers. The heavy trucks \nthat bring the steel to the company put an understandable heavy burden \non the roads they travel and are putting their durability to the test.\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates truck freight in rural \nAmerica is going to double--double--by the year 2020. The continuing \ntrend toward greater reliance on trucking to support these industries \nraises concern about the wear and tear on rural roads and bridges. Many \nof these roads and bridges were built before this trend was evident. \nWhoever thought they would be carrying this huge wind tunnel? No one \never thought it would happen, but it does. They were not designed for \nthis type of traffic.\n  Much of the rural road network in the United States was constructed \nduring an era of slower travel and lighter vehicles. Current traffic, \nwhich is heavier and wider, has accelerated the rate of deterioration \nand made these types of roads less serviceable. In many important \ngrain-producing States, such as Minnesota, more than 40 percent of the \nmajor highway system is rated as being in less than fair condition. Our \ntransportation systems need to support the development of these \nindustries, so we need to look at the full spectrum of transportation \noptions.\n  I truly appreciate Senator Boxer's leadership, looking not just at \ntruck travel, not just at roads but also at mass transportation and \nother ways we can transport our goods to market. With more than half \nour State of Minnesota's total population now living in the seven-\ncounty Twin Cities metro area, the need for more transportation options \nhas become very clear to all of us.\n  It is not just about the rural areas in our State. Increasing traffic \ncongestion has become a major threat to Minnesota's quality of life and \nour prosperity, costing precious time and money for both commuters and \nbusinesses. There is enormous support in our State for something called \nNorthstar rail, which would bring people basically from the Twin Cities \nto the area of St. Cloud--Big Lake, to be exact. St. Cloud is the area \nI explained where the bridge had been closed because of safety \nconcerns. And if you drive that 94 Interstate right now, I can tell \nyou, you waste so much time sitting in traffic you practically feel \nsick to your stomach if you are there in rush hour.\n  We need that mass transit, and legislators and people who were \noriginally completely opposed to this project are now standing up in \nfront of the line because they know how important it is for their \nconstituents. This is a case where I have to tell you the constituents \nwere there before the elected officials and led the way to try to get \nthis Northstar rail in. And because of the Federal help, it is now \ngetting built.\n\n  The bottom line for any business is you lose money when your people \nand your products get stuck in traffic, and you also lose the ability \nto attract topnotch, talented workers if they must contend with \naggravating and time-consuming traffic jams. To combat this threat, we \nmust commit to broadening our transportation options, developing the \nright mix of multimodal solutions to serve our emerging needs, while \nmaintaining our existing systems and highways. This mix, of course, \nincludes not just rail but rapid bus transit, high-occupancy toll \nlanes, and anything we can do to try to move the people to the places \nthey need to go.\n  Our Nation has faced this challenge before, a half century ago, and \nwe succeeded in building a new modern transportation system for a new \nmodern economy. At the heart of it all was the interstate highway \nsystem. In his 1963 memoir, ``Mandate for Change 1953-1956,'' President \nEisenhower famously said this of transportation:\n\n       More than any single action by the government since the end \n     of the war, this one would change the face of America. Its \n     impact on the American economy--the jobs it would produce in \n     manufacturing and construction, the rural areas it would open \n     up--was beyond calculation.\n\n  He was right. It is our responsibility to restore Eisenhower's vision \nof a transportation infrastructure that works for all of America. I can \ntell you this firsthand, from my heart, having seen what happens when \nyou don't invest as you are supposed to; having seen a major bridge \nfall down one day in the middle of America; having seen the promise in \nthe rural parts of our State of the new energy revolution but then \nhearing how they can't get their goods to market because they have a \nbunch of single-road highways, when they have trucks that are trying to \nbring wind towers in, when they are trying to be part of the solution \nto this energy crisis.\n  It is our responsibility to restore that vision that Eisenhower had--\nto build this transportation infrastructure in our country. That is why \nI am so proud to support Senator Boxer and her work on this bill, and I \nhope our colleagues will support this bill and that we get this bill \npassed for the good of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am sitting here and listening to Senator \nKlobuchar, and I am so proud of her work on the committee that I am \nfortunate enough to chair, the Environment and Public Works Committee. \nThis committee is so interesting because we do everything from global \nwarming legislation, protecting endangered species, to rebuilding the \ninfrastructure of our Nation on the public works side.\n  It is kind of an interesting divide, because when it comes to \nrebuilding the infrastructure, we have more bipartisan support right \nnow than for protecting the environment; where Senator Warner, on \nglobal warming, has frankly been our hero on the other side of the \naisle, joining with us. But on the infrastructure, Senator Inhofe and I \nhave worked very closely together, and with the help of members of the \ncommittee, such as Senator Klobuchar, we are making progress.\n  Before the good Senator leaves the floor, I wanted to make sure she \nwas aware of something in this bill that is so crucial and is very much \napropos to her reminding us about the bridge collapse in Minnesota. We \nfix an oversight in SAFETEA-LU that resulted in a particular account \nbeing oversubscribed. That account was the surface transportation \nresearch development and deployment account.\n  Now, what does that do? It is a very fancy name. Basically, that \nparticular account funds research into the status of our \ninfrastructure. It takes a look at our infrastructure, and it tells us \nwhat we need to do to keep up. Do we need to reinforce our bridges, for \nexample. That is one of the aspects they look at. The appraisal of our \nhighways. How do we fund transit? What is the physical condition of our \nroads? How do they operate? What is their performance level? It is so \ncrucial that we have the information.\n  My colleague from Minnesota wrote the carbon registry bill that is \npart of our global warming bill because she knows that before you can \nsolve global warming, you need to know how much carbon and other \ngreenhouse gases are in the atmosphere. We can't write a new bill in \n2009 unless we know the status of our roads, our freeways, our bridges, \nand our highways. So that is why this bill is so important.\n  We have been here for 2 full days now. I have been ready, willing, \nand able to take any and all amendments. We have said the bill is \nclosed. We are not adding anything new because we want to keep this \nbill the exact same cost as the SAFETEA-LU bill. We are not adding \nanything. We are, in essence, making technical corrections to\n\n[[Page S3011]]\n\nmake sure we don't stymie a billion dollars' worth of projects, which \nis going to create tens of thousands of new jobs, and we are going to \nfree up the frozen level of this research because they can't research \nanymore. They can't do any more research on the state of our \ninfrastructure. We want to unfreeze that.\n  So here we are for 2 days, standing on our feet begging our \nRepublican friends not to filibuster this bill. What is the point? \nEverybody wants this bill, except maybe one Senator who doesn't like \none provision in it. We had the vote to proceed. I think it was 93 to \n1. So everyone wants this bill. This bill doesn't add any new spending, \nit unleashes a billion dollars of important projects. That is why we \nhave extraordinary support--and I don't have the chart here--from all \nour construction trades people, the management side, the labor union \nside, the worker side. We have it all. We have the heads of all the \ntransit agencies across the country. They all want this bill. It is \nvery impressive.\n  Oh, good, we have it back. I will show it one more time, because when \nyou hear who is backing us--and they are not backing us quietly, they \nare on the phones, they are calling Members and saying: Let this bill \ngo.\n  When my kids were young, they would call something a no-brainer. That \nis what this bill is, a no-brainer. This bill makes eminent sense.\n  Here is the list: The American Association of Highway and \nTransportation Officials--from all 50 States--support us; the American \nHighway Users Alliance--millions of highway users; the American Public \nTransit Association--transit systems from across the country; American \nRoad and Transportation Builders--that is more than 5,000 members of \nthe transportation construction industry; Associated General \nContractors--that is 32,000 contractors; Council of University \nTransportation Centers--more than 30 university transportation centers \nfrom across the country; The National Stone, Sand and Gravel \nAssociation--these are the companies that produce more than 92 percent \nof crushed stone and 75 percent of sand and gravel used in the United \nStates annually; and the National Asphalt and Pavement Association--\nmore than 1,100 companies.\n\n  These are the folks who are suffering right now. These are the folks \nwho have gotten caught in this recession we are in. These are the folks \nwho are calling Senators and saying: Please, let this bill go.\n  Senator Boxer supports it, Senator Inhofe supports it, Senator \nKlobuchar supports it, Senator Baucus supports it, Senator Isakson \nsupports it. I could list members from our committee--almost all. As I \nsaid, we had a vote of 93 to 1 to proceed to this bill.\n  Calling all Republican friends: Please, please, please, relent. \nPlease, let's get going. People are counting on you. They need the \nwork. They need the jobs. Our country needs the infrastructure built. \nThis doesn't cost a penny more. These are funds that are sitting in the \ntrust fund.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I will be glad to yield to my colleague.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I ask the Senator, how long has she been trying to get \nthis bill through? I know she has been waiting. I know it has been \nmonths.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The House passed it 1 year ago, and we passed it in the \ncommittee in June 2007. This is not something that--this has been \naround. We have been asking Senator Reid. He wanted to bring it up, but \nit is getting caught up in other matters. It has been a long time.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. It seems to me, when there is so much bipartisan \nsupport, the other side of the aisle would try to advance this bill. I \nknow in our State we have had this tragedy. They see this not only as \nyou talk about it--as a way to figure out, do an analysis of what we \nreally need to meet our transportation needs but they also need it as \ninvestment. As you know, we were unable, on the stimulus package, to \nget some of the things we wanted on the Democratic side, so we did get \nthe check in the mail to people. But long after those rebate checks are \ncashed, we need a long-term investment strategy in this country that \ninvests in jobs.\n  I thank Senator Boxer for bringing up that piece of the bill. I was \nvery focused on the nuts and bolts on the roads, the wear and tear on \nthe roads that we all think about when driving on the highway, but we \nalso have to think about this as an investment strategy. I thank her \nfor bringing out that important point.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to do it, I say to my friend, and I am glad \nshe asked me when we passed this bill out of committee--June 2007. June \n2008 is fast upon us. The House also passed it a year ago.\n  This is a long time in coming. You are so right, we all talk about \nthe need to make sure there are good jobs for people. This is a \nministimulus package right here. There are 500 important projects that \nwill move forward. This means real jobs, real jobs in the U.S. of A. \nWhen you are building a road here, you are building a road here. This \nis important.\n  It is unusual to see all of these folks team up together. We had a \npress conference this morning, management and labor together saying: \nPlease, here is an opportunity.\n  There is nothing negative to say about this bill, as far as I am \nconcerned. You may have one or two projects you wouldn't vote for, but \nthe fact is they have come from the Members of Congress who know their \ndistricts and know their States.\n  I was very glad Senator DeMint called and said he was pleased with \nthe way we did our disclosure under the new ethics rule, that our \ncommittee had set the standard. I was very happy to hear from him about \nthat. He said we did it right, we made it public. Everybody signed on \nto whatever project they requested--very open, very transparent, very \nnecessary. This is a very necessary bill.\n  I guess I am talking to colleagues who may be in their offices and I \nam saying, especially to my Republican friends, come join us. Let's do \nsomething good for the people. This is very important for your States. \nYou have the American Association of State Highway and Transportation \nOfficials--that's the department of transportation for all 50 States--\ncalling on us to act. There is no reason to hold this up. We are \nwasting precious minutes. We are wasting precious hours. We are wasting \nprecious days. We have a lot of other work to get done.\n  My goodness, I don't understand filibustering this bill which, again, \nis within the budget. It doesn't add a penny more than we were supposed \nto spend. I am a little perplexed as to why we are sitting here at 10 \nto 6 at night and we can't get anybody to come here to offer an \namendment. But I am ever hopeful, because it is my nature, that people \nwill realize, as they go back to their offices and see their phone \nmessages from all these people, that this is real. This is real. We \nneed to get it done.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. I will be back as \nsoon as I have some news to share with colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, the matter before the Senate now that \nis currently being blocked by the minority is a bill that would permit \nwork to proceed on hundreds of highway and transportation \ninfrastructure projects, creating tens of thousands of construction \njobs, and pouring $1 billion into our economy. This is timely \nlegislation to repair our roads and bridges now, while our economy \nneeds the work. Yet this bill is stalled in this body because \nRepublicans in the Senate will not allow it to move forward.\n  Unfortunately, we have seen this movie too many times. The minority \nhas engaged in no less than 65 filibusters in this Congress--an \nastounding number that lays bare the minority's lack of interest in \nsolving the real problems America faces. What a record--65 filibusters, \nthe most ever. That is what the minority has to contribute to the \nproblems America is facing.\n  A number of our Republican colleagues have come to the floor of the \nSenate to speak today, but we have\n\n[[Page S3012]]\n\nheard very little in the way of substantive or reasonable objections to \nthe highway bill. Instead, what we have heard is a lot of talk about \ntaxes. Of course taxes are on the minds of many Americans today. It is, \nafter all, April 15, filing day, the deadline for Federal and State tax \nreturns to be filed. Today, we should remember that the work of \nGovernment does not just cost money, it costs our money. For that \nreason, we should ask how this Government is spending our hard-earned \nmoney and whether the priorities reflected in the Federal Government's \nspending are truly the right priorities for our people and for our \ntime.\n  These are difficult days. Today, families throughout my State of \nRhode Island and all across this country are reading their bank \nstatements, opening their bills, reading their local newspapers, and \nfinding that the looming downturn in the economy leaves them struggling \nto make ends meet. Everywhere we look, prices are rising, from the \ngroceries that feed our families to the gasoline that fuels our cars. \nEvery day, more Americans face the disaster of foreclosure. Every day, \nmore Americans face the nightmare of catastrophic health care bills.\n  In these days of insecurity, the people of this country are looking \nfor answers, for solutions, for a new direction. Democrats in the \nSenate are working overtime to provide that new direction. We passed an \neconomic stimulus package, legislation to address the housing crisis, \nand a budget plan to put our Government back on the path to surplus and \ncut taxes for middle-class families. We know we need a change of course \nand, most particularly, a change of leadership in the White House to \nget our country back on track.\n  But Senate Republicans today are making it clear that they do not \nagree. Instead of putting working families first, instead of getting \nour infrastructure repaired, they want to protect the massive Bush tax \ncuts for the wealthiest Americans, a fiscally irresponsible policy that \nhas left our country trillions of dollars in debt. Instead of a budget \nthat focuses Federal Government spending on our children and our \nveterans, Republicans want to stick us with the status quo, pouring \nhundreds of billions of dollars into an endless war in Iraq without \nspending a dime here at home to fix the problems that face American \nfamilies.\n  Senate Democrats support tax cuts for middle-class families, \nincluding targeted help for families with children or seeking to adopt \na child. Indeed, the budget resolution this year would provide those \ntax cuts in a fiscally responsible way, without digging our country \ndeeper into debt. But President Bush and his Republican allies in the \nSenate want to extend the extravagant portions of the 2001 to 2003 Bush \ntax breaks that are weighted heavily toward the wealthiest Americans.\n  Mr. President, 71 percent of the value of the tax cuts in 2009 will \ngo to the wealthiest fifth of Americans, and 28 percent of the value of \nthe tax cuts goes to the top 1 percent, a group whose incomes average \naround $1.5 million a year--clearly people who are hurting and need a \nlot of help from our Government right now. Almost nothing at all goes \nto the lowest earning fifth, families who earn $15,000 a year or less. \nThis is the George Bush idea of fair tax policy.\n  The President's insistence on forcing through these cuts without \nmaking up for the lost revenue, to defer that pain to later \ngenerations--to our children, to our grandchildren--was not only \ncowardly leadership, it left our budget in precarious straits. The Bush \ntax cuts of 2001 and 2003 cost a staggering $1.9 trillion, and they \naccount for 25 percent of the $7.7 trillion Bush Debt. The $7.7 \ntrillion Bush Debt is the difference between the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office projections as President Clinton left \noffice compared to the budgetary nightmare George Bush created--$7.7 \ntrillion.\n  I am from Rhode Island. One trillion dollars is an unthinkable amount \nof money in a small State such as Rhode Island. I do not know what $7.7 \ntrillion is. So I have tried to scale it for myself. I have here in my \nhand a simple penny. A simple penny. If this simple penny were $1 \nbillion--now, even in Rhode Island $1 billion is big money--if this \nsimple penny were $1 billion, $7.7 trillion is a stack of these simple \nbillion-dollar pennies that is 39 feet high, takes us right to the top \nof this room with a simple penny being a full billion dollars.\n  It is an astonishing burden for this country to have to bear. It is \nthe responsibility of George Bush and the Republicans, and we have to \nget serious about it. But are the Senate Republicans willing to get \nserious about it? No. If they have their way, the wealthiest Americans \nwill continue to profit to the tune of trillions of borrowed dollars \nwhile those most in need receive virtually nothing. According to the \nCenter on Budget and Policy Priorities, the poorest Americans--the \nlowest 20 percent of income earners would receive less than 0.5 percent \nof the value of extending Bush tax cuts between 2009 and 2018. The top \n20 percent, on the other hand, would receive a staggering 74 percent of \nthe value, a total of nearly $4 trillion over that 10-year period.\n  And, of course, this is Bush tax policy, so the higher the income, \nthe greater the benefit. Close to $1.2 trillion in Bush tax cuts would \naccrue to the top 1 percent of American households. Households with \nannual incomes of more than $1 million a year, those alone receive $834 \nbillion, $834 billion in extended Bush tax cuts.\n  The reckless fixation on tax cuts for our wealthiest folks that the \nBush administration has pursued is driving us to a bad place, to a \ndivided America with two economies, a gilded economy for the wealthy, \nand a worried struggle for everyone else. That is not good for America. \nIn fact, that is not America. But this does not seem to bother our \nRepublican friends. They have hitched their wagons to the big winners \nin the gilded economy: the oil companies, the pharmaceutical companies, \nthe billionaires. The two economies, well, that is fine with them so \nlong as their friends are winning. But that is not good for America.\n  In fact, that is not America, not the one we know. The tool they have \nused over and over and over is the filibuster. With a $7.7 trillion \nBush Debt foundering us, with families across the country in their home \nStates, everyone struggling, you would think they would want their role \nto be more productive than being the biggest filibusters in American \nhistory. You would think they would want a more productive record and \nlegacy than that. But, no, they want to dig a $7.7 trillion hole and \nthen filibuster the folks who are trying to get America out of it. It \nis so clear that Senate Republicans would prefer to engage in \noverheated and overhyped tax rhetoric than they would roll up their \nsleeves, sit down, and get to work on legislation solving the real \nproblems working Americans are facing across our country each day.\n  I will tell you, it is clear and it is disappointing.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the record has been made clear today. We \nwish we had been doing some legislating. We have not been. I have had a \nnumber of conversations with my distinguished counterpart, Senator \nMcConnell.\n  Senator McConnell, following the caucus he had with his Senators, as \nI have with mine every Tuesday, my understanding is a concern was \nraised in the caucus about the number of judges who have been or not \nbeen approved by the Senate in these last few months.\n  As you know, one day last week we approved five judges, one circuit \ncourt judge and four district court judges. We thought that was a step \nin the right direction. What are we going to do the rest of this year? \nYou know, there is a Thurmond doctrine that says: After June, we will \nhave to take a real close look at judges in a Presidential election \nyear.\n  June is fast approaching. I believe that is the time set forth in the \nThurmond doctrine. So today Senator McConnell and I in our \nconversations talked about all of the various judges who could be \nbrought up, should be brought up, may be brought up, and we went over \nthe different circuits and talked in some detail.\n  Following my first conversation with Senator McConnell, I called the \nJudiciary Chairman, Senator Leahy. He\n\n[[Page S3013]]\n\nand I have a wonderful relationship. He defends me on the floor, I \ndefend him on the floor. Our wives are friends. He is a good person. I \nthink the world of him. So I called him so there would be no \nmisunderstanding. He came over to my office following the telephone \nconversation. And after the telephone conversation I called Senator \nMcConnell. Senator Leahy came to my office and we visited again about \nthe judges. We believe we need to make more progress on judges.\n  As we have said before, we do not want the minority to be treated the \nway we were treated during the Clinton years. We have done a pretty \ngood job. At this time we have probably approved 90 percent of \nPresident Bush's judges, lots and lots of judges, well over 100 judges \nwe have approved.\n  The Republican leader asked me: What can you do before our Memorial \nDay recess? What I have told him is we are going to do our utmost, we \nare not going to talk about district court judges, we are going to \napprove district court judges, the exact number of which I do not know, \nand Senator Leahy and I are going to do everything we can to approve \nthree circuit court judges by Memorial Day.\n  I would like to be able to guarantee that. I cannot guarantee it. A \nlot of things happen in the Senate. But I am going to do my very best. \nI want to live up to what I am saying here on the floor right now. \nSenator Leahy knows I am here speaking before the American people today \nand to Senator McConnell. So we are going to do our very best to \napprove three circuit court judges by Memorial Day. That is about the \nbest I can do. Which ones, I have told Senator McConnell. There are a \nnumber of alternatives we can have. He knows some by name, I know them \nby name. I do not want and I do not choose to go over them name by name \nat this time. But we have a number to choose from to get to those \nthree. I will do the best I can, working with Senator Leahy and the \nJudiciary Committee. And when I say ``bring to the floor,'' that means \nconfirm the judges.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, my good friend, the majority leader, \nand I, I think at the beginning of this conference--and I believe this \nis a correct characterization of where we were; I am sure he can \ndisabuse me of the notion if it is not a direct characterization of \nwhere we were--we felt at the very least, President Bush, with regard \nto circuit court nominees, should be treated as well as President \nReagan, President Bush 41, and President Clinton were treated in the \nlast 2 years of their Presidencies.\n  Each of those Presidents found themselves with the following dilemma: \nThe Senate was in the control of the opposing party, so there was a \ncertain symmetry to this President. George W. Bush ends up the last 2 \nyears of his Presidency similarly situated to President Reagan, \nPresident Bush 41, and President Clinton. The average number of circuit \ncourt judges approved for all of those Presidents was 17. President \nClinton was on the low end of that at 15.\n  As of today, April 15, we have approved in this Congress seven \ncircuit judges. Except for last week, there had not been one since last \nSeptember. I am sure the majority leader would agree with me that we \nare running dramatically behind. We know there is an election coming up \nin the fall.\n  The majority leader mentioned the so-called Thurmond rule which at \nsome point here will probably be implemented, indicating there will not \nbe any circuit judges approved.\n  We currently have before the committee two judges, one from North \nCarolina and one from South Carolina. The one from North Carolina has a \nunanimously well qualified from the American Bar Association and has \npreviously been confirmed to his current position as a district court \njudge by the Senate. The blue slips are back on both of these judges. \nWe anticipate there will be a nominee from Virginia who will have blue \nslips returned and, in the near future, two nominees from the State of \nMichigan whose blue slips will be returned. As we all know, in Michigan \nthere are two Democratic Senators and in Virginia there is one \nDemocratic Senator and one Republican. In South Carolina and North \nCarolina, there are two Republican Senators. The chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee has made it clear he is not likely, almost \ncertainly not likely, to move a nominee from a State for which there \nare no blue slips. So we have blue slips in on North and South \nCarolina, and both nominees have been waiting for quite some time. So \nthere are nominations ready to go.\n  What I have said is there is a great interest on my side in seeing \nthree circuit court nominees confirmed by the Senate before the \nMemorial Day recess. The majority leader has indicated he is \ncomfortable with that. We have not picked the candidates, but let me \nsuggest it would be unfair to discriminate against a State which has \ntwo Republican Senators with blue slips in and has had nominees pending \nfor quite some time in favor of nominees only recently with blue slips \nin or only recently nominated. The principle should be the same \nregardless of whether a State is represented by two Republicans, two \nDemocrats or one Republican and one Democrat. If the blue slips are in, \nthe blue slips are in. If the nominee is otherwise qualified and \nnoncontroversial, I would hope, I say to my good friend, the majority \nleader, he would share my view that we should not discriminate against \na nominee from a State with two Republican Senators, the nominees \nhaving been pending for quite some time, in favor of recent nominees \nwho happen to be from States with two Democratic Senators or one \nDemocratic and one Republican Senator. I wonder if my friend, the \nmajority leader, has any observation about that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have a number of places from which the \nJudiciary Committee can move matters to the floor. We have North \nCarolina, South Carolina, Rhode Island, Maryland. We have Pennsylvania. \nThe Pennsylvania situation, we have a Democrat and a Republican there. \nAs I recall the judge's name, the nominee there is a man by the name of \nPratter. We have someone from Virginia. We have, as of today, two from \nMaryland. We have a wide range to choose from. I say to my friend from \nKentucky, no, it should not be because you have two from the same party \nfrom one State and they are not our party, that should not cause them \nnot to have their nominee approved. As I indicated last week when we \ngot into a discussion about this, we should measure the quality of the \nnominees, not the quantity. We are today talking about the quantity of \nnominees. But we also have to be concerned about the quality of these \nnominees. We should confirm capable, mainstream nominees who are the \nproduct of bipartisan cooperation. With this committee, to get \nsomething out of the committee, it has to be bipartisan. I guess it \ndoesn't have to be, but that is the way we would like it.\n  So we have done a pretty good job. Last year, we had a very \ncontroversial judge. One of the Senators on the Judiciary Committee \ndecided she would vote with the minority. As a result of that, a \ncontroversial judge was reported to the floor and ultimately approved. \nSo we are working very hard to arrive at three judges by the time of \nour break, which is 5 weeks from now, I believe. I said when I got this \njob, that if the nominations of judges are important to my friend, the \nRepublican leader, they are important to me. I have some knowledge of \ndifficulties with judges on the floor, having survived, as the \nDemocratic leader, the so-called nuclear option. So I understand how \npeople feel strongly about judges. Democrats feel strongly about them. \nRepublicans feel strongly about them. When Senator Lott was majority \nleader, he said words to the effect: Why should we worry about them in \nthe Senate? People don't care about judges. This is something that is \njust within the Senate.\n  I, personally, don't feel that way. I feel these men and women who \nhave lifetime appointments are extremely important and that we should--\neven though Senator Lott might be right, maybe people outside \nWashington don't care about judges, I care about judges. The Republican \nleader cares about judges. I will try my best to get three judges \napproved by the Senate before the Memorial Day recess.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the only thing I would add with regard \nto my earlier comments, just picking, for\n\n[[Page S3014]]\n\nexample, the North Carolina judge, the Fourth Circuit is a judicial \nemergency. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee has set forward some \nstandards. His first standard: If a vacancy is deemed to be a judicial \nemergency, it should be addressed quickly. That is the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee. In the case of the Fourth Circuit, it has been \ndeclared a judicial emergency. It is one-third vacant. The nominee from \nNorth Carolina, to pick an example, is not controversial, has a \nunanimously well qualified from the ABA. The blue slips are back from \nboth North Carolina Senators. My only point to my good friend, the \nmajority leader, was it would seem not to be fair, when you have a \nnominee pending for a long time who is not controversial, upon which \nthe blue slips have been returned, where there are two Republican \nSenators, for that nominee to be in effect moved to the back of the bus \nwhile you handle nominees nominated more recently from a State with two \nDemocratic Senators or a State with one Democrat and one Republican \nSenator.\n\n  What I am pleading for is a sense of fairness. I believe in the case \nof both North Carolina and South Carolina, with the judicial emergency \nexisting on the Fourth Circuit, you could make a strong case that they \nshould be dealt with first under the standards of the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee. But in particular I cite the nominee from North \nCarolina because he has been declared noncontroversial, had the \nunanimous ABA approval rating, and has been pending for hundreds of \ndays. I don't know why we couldn't meet the goal the majority leader \nhas set out of doing three circuit court nominees before Memorial Day. \nThere is no reason not to. There are enough ready to be dealt with who \ndon't require additional paperwork.\n  So I guess my question of the majority leader is, What is his view as \nto the likelihood that we would get three circuit judges confirmed \nbefore the Memorial Day recess?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first of all, Chairman Leahy understands. If \nthere is an emergency in a circuit, he understands the importance of \ndoing something about that. He has expressed that publicly and \nprivately. Also, in this overall process, let's make sure we \nunderstand, there are vacancies out there in the circuit courts that we \nhave no nominees for. We are waiting for them. I say to my friend, as I \nhave said before, I am going to do everything to work with the \nJudiciary Committee. Senator Leahy said he would do that too. I think \nwe can say we would work very hard to make sure there are no holdovers. \nThat is, if somebody is reported out, we will do our very best to make \nsure they don't waste that week on that. I am going to do what I can to \nfulfill what I have said. I will do everything within my power to get \nthree judges approved to our circuits before the Memorial Day recess.\n  Who knows, we may even get lucky and get more than that. We have a \nnumber of people from whom to choose. Maybe the President can send us \ndown a few more names on some of those vacancies that are there now. I \ndon't know what more I can say than to say what I have said. I have to \nwork with the committee, within the rules they have, and do the best I \ncan.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I guess the only thing I would add, \nwould the majority leader agree with me on the following principle: \nThat a circuit judge from a State with two Republican Senators, who is \ncompletely qualified and upon which two blue slips have already been \nreturned and have been pending for a long time, does the majority \nleader share my view that those type nominees from States with two \nRepublican Senators should not be discriminated against in trying to \nmeet our responsibility? We have only confirmed seven circuit judges \nthroughout this Congress. We are a long way from coming anywhere close \nto what President Clinton got at 15.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I hope the record will reflect the smile on \nmy face because the fact is, we had, for years, two Democratic Senators \nfrom a State and those nominees of President Clinton weren't even given \na hearing. More than 60 weren't even given a hearing. They were pocket \nvetoed, for lack of a better description. So, yes, I think if you have \ntwo Senators from the same party, they should not be discriminated \nagainst. I mentioned their names. Their names are Matthews and Conrad. \nI have spoken to Senator Leahy. The first time I talked to him was \ntoday. Of course, we will take a look at those.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Well, I certainly understand what the intention of the \nmajority leader is. We will need to discuss this further, I guess \nprivately. I certainly understand his intention. I know he is a person \nwho operates in good faith. I trust him. We have had a good \nrelationship over the last period during which we have been in our \nrespective positions. I guess the calculation I have to make, at some \npoint, is what is the likelihood of this occurring, because there is a \ndeep-seated unrest on our side related to this low number of circuit \ncourt judges. I think that is understandable. It is a paltry number in \ncomparison to how President Reagan, President Bush, and President \nClinton were handled in a similar situation. But I understand the \nrepresentations my good friend, the majority leader, has made as far as \nhe is prepared to go today. We will continue to discuss the matter.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the only thing I would say, my good friend \nasked the odds. I am from Las Vegas. I don't bet. I hope they are good \nodds. I am going to do everything I can to live up to what I have said \nthis last 5 or 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield, my leader yield to me for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. REID. Surely.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I was pleased to see this dialog back and forth. Because, \nfrankly, I have been wondering, as chairman of the Environment \nCommittee, what was going on. We have a very straightforward bill on \nthe floor. I didn't understand. We have a few amendments. We are very \nhappy to deal with them. We have every group in the country, every \nconstruction group, management, labor, everyone, we have every State \nasking us to do this bill. I didn't understand, frankly, why we were \nwaiting around. I wonder, I ask my leader--and I would be delighted to \nhear from the Republican leader as well, given this colloquy you had \nback and forth--and I know the Senator from Nevada as well as anyone \nhere. When he gives his word like this and says: I am going to do \neverything I can, listen, I think that is as good as it gets around \nhere. I am hopeful, and I would ask my leader to tell me and the \nRepublican leader as well, Senator Inhofe is here, I am here, we are \nvery anxious to move our bill forward, 500 transportation projects, not \none penny of added spending; it will unleash a billion dollars' worth \nof jobs, I am wondering whether you could let us know tonight what are \nthe chances that we are going to be able to move forward.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, I wish we had moved to this bill \nThursday night, legislated yesterday and today. We haven't done that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/15/senate-section/article/S3014-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3014-S3019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HIGHWAY TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. REID.

I think it is very \nimportant for all of us on both sides of the aisle to understand that \nwhat we are considering here is not the transportation reauthorization \nbill of 2005. That was done. That is history. That is behind us. A \ntechnical corrections bill is common with every bill, every major piece \nof legislation that comes along. Sometimes in the case--I will go ahead \nand say in my case of Oklahoma, we had a major project that was about a \n$200,000 project in Durant, OK in which, according to our \ntransportation commissioner and the Transportation Department of \nOklahoma, that same amount\n\n[[Page S3019]]\n\nof money could be better spent doing the same project but at another \nlocation. Well, that takes a technical change. There is no difference.\n  I say to all of my good friends, there is no one who is more \nconservative than I am by all ratings in my last 22 years in both the \nHouse and the Senate. There are no new projects. There is no new \nspending. The amount of money that was authorized is the same amount of \nmoney that is authorized at the present time in the technical \ncorrections bill. So it is not somehow getting some kind of an earmark \nor something else in it.\n  I have often said that of all of the systems we use in Washington to \naccomplish things, probably the transportation system is the best. I \ndon't know of anyone who complains about paying into the highway trust \nfund when they get gasoline. They want to be sure it is going to go to \nbuilding highways, repairing bridges. But what we do in the State of \nOklahoma is we have eight transportation districts, eight \ntransportation commissioners, all geographically located. They make \nrecommendations. What I do with a transportation bill is I leave it up \nto them to make the determination as to where that goes. The States are \nmaking those decisions. The highway trust fund--there are some States \nwhere the money doesn't go straight into transportation. They have been \nrobbing balances of the highway trust fund for as long as I know. We \nhave corrected that problem in the State of Oklahoma. Instead of having \nit go to other causes, it goes to correcting the crisis we are in right \nnow.\n  I wish to say that for those of us who are conservatives, this is \nsomething that works well. If there is any function of government that \nneeds to be addressed and has to be addressed at the Federal level, it \nis our roads and highways. We have States such as Montana, big States \nthat have very few people. You still have to get across them. You have \nthe congested eastern States that have the opposite situation. That is \nwhy way back in the Eisenhower administration they decided to go in \ntogether and create this system we still have today. It is one that has \nworked fairly well. I don't want people out there to think this is \nsomething that has a bunch of projects and a bunch of earmarks in it. \nIt doesn't. This is something we spent 2 or 3 years intensively working \non prior to its passage in 2005. Now we want to make these corrections \nto make sure the rest of the projects get done.\n  Here is the dilemma we have right now. We have a lot of projects--not \nnearly enough but a lot of projects--that we authorized in 2005. If we \ndon't have technical corrections, we are up against the wall now where \nwe can't get anything more done, and we have given our word to people \nall throughout the country that we are going to improve bridges, we are \ngoing to try to save lives, and it has virtually stopped because we \nhave certain corrections that need to be made.\n  What we dealt with on that very large, what was it, $286 billion over \nthe period of 2005 through 2009, which is a lot of money, that doesn't \ndo anything more--it doesn't even maintain what we already have. We \ndon't even have a lot of new stuff in there. There is not a person in \nAmerica who doesn't know we have a crisis. Some of these Members of \nthis committee or this body, if you don't think it is a crisis, call \nyour wife at home, or your husband, and they will tell you it is a \ncrisis. It is worse every year. It is not something that we can make a \ndecision today and all come to our good senses and get it done and it \nwill be done tomorrow. It is a long lead time. It is a complicated \nprocess. But it is one of the things that has worked well.\n  I know there are a lot of people who want to satisfy some \nconstituency that says you are spending too much money. You tell that \nconstituency to go out and drive in the traffic for a while and see \nwhat kind of serious problems we have.\n  I have often said--and I have followed this myself--we all in this \nbody have different priorities. That is what makes it a representative \nbody. I have often said we need to, No. 1, take care of our Nation's \nsecurity, have a military that can defend our country; No. 2, take care \nof the infrastructure we have and move forward with that; and No. 3, \nwhich is kind of a pet thing with me, and I think everyone who has \npreviously been a mayor of a major city--unfunded mandates is another \narea that I feel this governing body should be paying attention to. But \nwe have a bill. We have a bill that is working now. We are improving \nhighways. We are adding lanes. But we have come to a stop. I think \nanyone who tries to keep this from becoming a reality doesn't want to \naddress a serious problem we are faced with.\n  No one else is going to do it for us. The States can't do it. It has \nto be done by the Federal Government. We passed a bill. We are going to \nbe coming up against another bill next year when this runs out in 2009. \nWe are going to be reauthorizing for the next 5 years or 7 years or \nmaybe even longer. But this has to be done and we need to get it done \nnow.\n  We do have several amendments. I understand the concern of the \nSenator from South Carolina who has made his statements, and he has \ndone so very eloquently. Frankly, I agree with almost everything he \nsays. The only thing I disagree with is that this bill isn't creating \nnew projects, isn't spending new money. We need, in his State as well \nas my State and in all 50 States, to get on with this. I hope people \nrealize these are not new projects; it is not an increase in spending. \nIt doesn't spend at all; it is an authorization bill.\n  Another amendment that is going to be pending is that of my good \nfriend Senator Bond from Missouri. He has a special concern, and I \nencourage him to come down to the floor to bring it up, debate it, and \nlet's vote on it and get that done. Then my junior Senator has a \nconcern over something that is a process that happened--it didn't even \nhappen here, but it happened in the other body. Now, I agree with him, \nit is something that was egregious and needs to be investigated. I \nthink it should be. I think there are a lot of different ways of doing \nit. I want to join hands with him and get this done.\n  So we, to my knowledge, only have those three things that are out \nthere that are holding this up. I would invite those three authors to \ncome down. I think while we are not going to be having votes tonight, \nwe can start debating these tonight, and tomorrow morning we could \nactually vote on some of these. But I agree with the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Boxer, and the majority and the minority leaders in \nthis body that we need to get it done. We are not going to get it done \nuntil we get the amendments down here, debate them, and decide what is \nthe will of this body. That is what we are supposed to be doing for a \nliving around here. That is what happens.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier this month, President Bush sent up \nanother trade agreement to the House of Representatives. This agreement \nis a bilateral trade agreement with Colombia. He calls it a ``free \ntrade agreement,'' a term we use around here--I am not sure why, except \nthat it sounds good, because these trade agreements generally are--I \ndon't have it in front of me, but it was too thick to bind in its \noriginal printing. It is about seven or eight hundred pages.\n  NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement--which the Presiding \nOfficer opposed 15 years ago, as I did--was even longer than that. The \nway they sell these agreements is they say we are eliminating the \ntariffs on the trade relationship between--in this case it is Colombia, \nand Colombia still\n\n[[Page S3020]]\n\nhas tariffs on American goods. We have eliminated tariffs on Colombian \ngoods. If we were to pass a real free trade agreement, it would be \nthree, four, five, six pages long and eliminate the tariff schedule, \nmaking a real free trade agreement.\n  These are not free trade agreements the President sends us, nor are \nthey free trade agreements that Presidents in the past sent. They are \nhundreds and hundreds of pages of protectionism, pages outlining \nprotections for the drug companies, protections for the energy \ncompanies, for financial services companies, banks and others, and \nprotections for the pharmaceutical industry. That is what these \nsupposed free trade agreements are.\n  It is interesting that those of us who oppose these ``free trade \nagreements'' because they don't protect our communities, frankly, are \ncalled ``protectionists.'' If we are going to write these agreements \nand build in protections for the drug companies, the oil industry, and \nthe other energy companies, the financial services companies, the \nbanks, and the insurance companies, we also should build in protections \nfor our workers in New Jersey and in Ohio, protections for our \ncommunities in Lima, and Mansfield, and Tiffin, OH, protections for \nfood safety, and build in protections for consumer product safety.\n  But that is not what they do. What is most curious about these \nagreements that the President has sent up--in this case the most recent \nis Colombia--it reminds me of the old Einstein saying that the \ndefinition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and over \nagain and expecting a different outcome.\n  We have seen, in almost 15-plus years in the House of \nRepresentatives, and now in the Senate--and it is roughly the same \nperiod of the Presiding Officer--we have seen our trade deficit go from \n$38 billion in 1992, to in excess of $800 billion last year. It is hard \nto know exactly what that means. A $38 billion deficit--that means we \nbuy $38 billion more in this country than we sell to other countries. \nIt is $800 billion more that we buy in this country than we sell to \nother countries. That is a huge amount of dollars, obviously.\n  That $800 billion--it was boiled down by the first President Bush, \nwho said that a billion dollar trade surplus, or deficit, translated \ninto 13,000 jobs. So if you have a trade surplus--in other words, if \nyou are selling more than you are buying as a nation, a billion \ndollars, according to President Bush the first, would add up to about \n13,000 new jobs--net gain of jobs in your country. But if you have $1 \nbillion deficit, it means it is a 13,000 net job loss in your country. \nWe have not a billion dollar trade deficit but an $800 billion one. Do \nthe math. What does that mean in lost jobs? It means an awful lot of \nlost manufacturing jobs in my State, from Cleveland, to Dayton, to \nLima, to Canton, to Kent, to Ravenna, to all over our State. It means a \nlot of other lost jobs, not just manufacturing jobs. When American \nStandard shuts down in Tiffin, and when a company shuts down in \nBucyrus, or in Ashland, it means fewer firefighters, fewer \nschoolteachers, fewer restaurant workers, fewer realtors, and fewer \npeople who serve those jobs--those people who had the manufacturing \njobs.\n  So it is pretty clear that the trade agreements, in addition to other \ndamage they have done, clearly--when you have a trade deficit that goes \nfrom $38 billion to $800 billion in a decade and a half, they have done \nsignificant damage to our country and, most importantly, to our \ncommunities and our families.\n  I will close on something specifically unique to the Colombia trade \nagreement. We know that in Colombia they have had a significant number \nof murders committed against union activists. I heard a Member of the \nHouse say today there were more union activists--organizing union \nleaders--murdered in Colombia than anywhere in the rest of the world \ncombined.\n  Although President Uribe of Colombia says union violence has come \ndown and his spokespeople in this body say the same, the fact is that \nunion murders, deaths of union activists in the first 3 months of 2008 \nare almost twice what they were in 2007. Adding insult to injury, we \nhave seen fewer and fewer convictions. Only about 3 percent of these \nmurders have resulted in convictions of the people who have been guilty \nof the murders. To add even further insult to this whole issue, the \nAmerican Government, the State Department has said the paramilitary \nvigilantes who are allied often with the Uribe Government who have \nkilled the union activists are classified by our State Department as \nterrorists. We, in essence, are supporting the Uribe Government that is \nallied with paramilitary vigilantes who are called terrorists by our \nown Government.\n  I don't quite see why we would want to reward that Government. I want \nPresident Uribe to succeed. I think he has done decent works. But I \ndon't think we should reward him with a trade agreement and lose the \nleverage we have to try to get the activist murder rate down and also \nso that the people have the opportunity to join unions in Colombia. \nFewer than 5 percent of the Colombian workforce is unionized. That is \nthe lowest or second lowest in the Western Hemisphere.\n  They are not doing what they need to do to bring working families \ninto the middle class, as we have seen in our country. The reason we \nhave a prosperous Zanesville and a prosperous Springfield, OH, in part \nis because of people's ability to join a union and bargain collectively \nfor better wages, health care, and pensions.\n  In the country of Colombia, they do not have those opportunities. For \nus to put the imprimatur of the U.S. on a free-trade agreement for that \nsocial structure and government to me makes little sense.\n  The House of Representatives delayed the bill for several months. If \nit gets to this body, I am hopeful Members will do the right thing and \nsay to President Bush: It is not time to do a trade agreement. This \ntrade policy in our country has failed. It is not working for our \ncountry, it is not working for our national security, it is not working \nfor our communities, it is not working for our families, and it is not \nworking to build the middle class in this society the way we should.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/15/senate-section/article/S3020-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3020-S3021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO CLARENCE W. DUPNIK\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of \nAmerica's finest, Clarence W. Dupnik, Sheriff of Pima County, AZ, who \ncelebrates 50 years of law enforcement service to his community this \nyear.\n  Clarence Dupnik is known as a man of action, integrity, and \ninnovation. These skills have been invaluable to his 50 years of \nservice to Arizona, and the Nation.\n  Sheriff Dupnik began his career in law enforcement in 1958 as a \npatrol officer with the city of Tucson Police Department, TPD. He held \nvarious positions within the Tucson Police Department, rising to major \nin charge of field operations by the time he retired from the TPD in \nJanuary 1977. From there, he was appointed chief deputy sheriff of Pima \nCounty Sheriff's Department, and later appointed Pima County Sheriff in \n1980.\n  Since 1980, Clarence Dupnik has been elected to seven consecutive \nterms of office as Pima County Sheriff, a position in which he remains \ntoday. Clarence Dupnik's many years of service to Pima County represent \na remarkable achievement and a great responsibility.\n  During his tenure as sheriff, the population of Pima County has \nnearly doubled in size. Today it claims almost 400,000 residents, \nmaking it the second-highest populated county in Arizona. In addition, \nPima County shares 123 miles of border with the nation of Mexico. These \ncharacteristics have brought on special challenges, which Sheriff \nDupnik met head on, with an admirable commitment to crime reduction.\n  Over the last three decades, Sheriff Dupnik has been instrumental to \nthe reduction of the per capita crime rate in Pima County. He has \nfought criminal enterprises, drug trafficking organizations, and gangs. \nHe also worked with former U.S. Surgeon General Richard Carmona to \nimprove law enforcement capabilities by integrating special weapons and \ntactics with emergency medical assistance. Additionally, he had the \nforesight to deploy 350 new mobile data computers in all Sheriff's \npatrol vehicles--both patrol and unmarked--before most other \ndepartments in Arizona. Sheriff Dupnik also participated in the Joint \nTerrorism Task Force and served on the Executive Committee of the FBI.\n\n[[Page S3021]]\n\n  Using his many years of law enforcement experience and leadership \nskills, Clarence Dupnik has worked hard to improve and give back to his \ncommunity in any way he can. He introduced Drug Abuse Resistance \nEducation, DARE, and School Resource Officer programs in Pima County \nschools. In addition, Sheriff Dupnik instituted a countywide community \npolicing program, created the Multi-agency Narcotic Investigations \nUnit, and established the Command Group of the Arizona Alliance \nPlanning Committee. In addition, he founded and chairs a drug-\nprevention group called Arizona for a Drug-Free Workplace.\n  The dedication and service of Clarence Dupnik during his 50-year law \nenforcement career is truly commendable. I thank Sheriff Dupnik for his \nmany years of service and wish him further success in the years to \ncome. I know that these years of public service have sacrificed time \nfrom his family and I would like to take this moment to also thank and \nacknowledge his wife Susie and their family. With Sheriff Dupnik's \ngreat example in mind, I hope that we can all work together to reduce \ncrime in our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/15/senate-section/article/S3021-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING DR.

Mr. President, a recent article in the Washington Post \nhighlights the serious additional harm that is being done to victims of \nstroke each and every day by our failure to get them as quickly as \npossible to hospitals or other treatment centers qualified to provide \nthe timely, appropriate care that can make all the difference between \nrecovery and permanent disability or death.\n  Not all hospitals have this capability, and Massachusetts and a \nhandful of other States have begun implementing systems to make better \nquality care available and to inform the public and emergency medical \nservices of the location of the nearest facility capable of providing \nsuch care. What is needed most, however, is national leadership to make \nprompt and quality care for stroke victims a reality throughout this \ncountry.\n  I believe our colleagues in the Senate and House will be interested \nin this important article, and I ask unanimous consent to have it \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Apr. 1, 2008]\n\n                          New Rules on Stroke\n\n\n                  Care Center Networks May Save Lives\n\n                            (By Alicia Ault)\n\n       In the event of a stroke, time is brain--meaning the more \n     quickly you recognize the problem and get proper medical \n     treatment, the more likely you are to survive and minimize \n     neurological damage. Increasingly, experts are concluding \n     that means getting to the right hospital, and fast.\n       According to the American Stroke Association and many \n     neurologists, the right facility is one that has been \n     designated by a state agency or the Joint Commission (which \n     accredits hospitals for quality and safety) as having the \n     appropriate medical staff, the ability to quickly administer \n     such diagnostic tests as computed tomography, and a \n     potentially lifesaving drug, tissue plasminogen activator \n     (TPA), which dissolves clots.\n       In some states, including Maryland, you don't have to worry \n     about which hospital might be best. Ambulance crews who \n     suspect a stroke are required to seek out a designated stroke \n     center, unless the nearest one is an unreasonable distance \n     away.\n       Now health officials in Virginia and the District say they \n     are considering similar plans.\n       In March, Virginia Gov. Timothy M. Kaine signed a bill \n     requiring local health officials to rush stroke patients to \n     Joint Commission-certified primary stroke centers. Even \n     though that law has not yet taken effect, emergency medical \n     technicians typically route patients to stroke centers, said \n     Paul Sharpe, trauma and critical care coordinator for \n     Virginia's Office of Emergency Medical Services.\n       In Washington, Michael Williams, medical director of Fire \n     and Emergency Medical Services, said he soon will issue a \n     protocol requiring transport of suspected stroke patients to \n     Joint Commission-certified stroke centers. That rule should \n     take effect within a month or so.\n       Until those changes take place, Virginia and District \n     residents might be wise to know the signs of stroke. If they \n     suspect they're having a stroke, they then, directly or \n     through a family member acting on their behalf, might ask to \n     be taken to a specialized stroke center.\n       About 780,000 Americans have a stroke each year. The vast \n     majority of strokes, 87 percent, are ischemic, caused by a \n     clot that cuts off blood supply to the brain, according to \n     the American Heart Association.\n       TPA, when given within three hours of the onset of a \n     stroke, can increase the chances of a full neurologic \n     recovery by at least 25 percent, said Robert Bass, executive \n     director of the Maryland Institute for Emergency Medical \n     Services Systems, or MIEMSS. But the drug's associated risks, \n     which include major bleeding in the brain, make it even more \n     crucial to get care at the right facility, Bass said.\n       Finding a hospital that specializes in stroke care is even \n     more important at a time when most are having trouble finding \n     specialists to ``take call''--that is, to see patients at the \n     hospital.\n       There are no hard numbers on the shortage, but the American \n     College of Emergency Physicians reported in 2006 that three-\n     quarters of emergency departments nationwide had problems \n     finding specialists such as neurosurgeons to take call. The \n     shortage was especially acute in orthopedics, plastic surgery \n     and neurosurgery.\n       Being seen by a neurology specialist doesn't guarantee a \n     good stroke outcome. But it is crucial to have a physician \n     trained in stroke care, said Lee Schwamm, vice chairman of \n     the neurology department and director of acute stroke \n     services at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.\n       ``Many people assume that stroke can be and is treated by \n     anyone,'' he said, which simply isn't true.\n       Massachusetts was the first state to create a stroke care \n     system, in 2004, partly because of the problem of getting on-\n     call specialists. Under the plan, designated hospitals agree \n     to have the appropriate diagnostics and staff (including \n     neurologists on duty or available through telemedicine) and \n     the ability to give TPA within three hours. They also agree \n     to report on the quality of care.\n       In mid-2005, the state began requiring ambulances to take \n     patients to stroke centers. Within a year, the number of \n     stroke patients receiving TPA increased by 20 percent, \n     Schwamm said. Now the goal is to increase the number of \n     patients who get to the hospital in time, he added. Sixty-\n     eight of the state's 72 hospitals have been designated as \n     stroke centers by the Massachusetts health department.\n       Several states have followed Massachusetts's lead, \n     including Maryland (in 2007), New York, New Jersey and \n     Florida.\n       Maryland hospitals that apply for the stroke center \n     designation are evaluated by a state inspection team. \n     Hospitals can also be certified by the Joint Commission.\n       The nonprofit commission began certifying stroke centers in \n     2003. So far, 455 hospitals nationwide have received that \n     designation.\n       Twenty-eight hospitals have received Maryland's five-year \n     stroke center certification. These hospitals can evaluate \n     stroke patients, give the initial treatment and, in most \n     cases, admit patients directly to a special stroke unit in \n     the hospital, Bass said. Since the program's establishment, \n     the number of patients receiving clot-busting therapy has \n     increased 20-fold, said John Young, stroke system coordinator \n     for MIEMSS.\n       Like the District, Virginia does not have its own stroke \n     center certification process.\n\n[[Page S3022]]\n\n       Certification isn't a guarantee of superior care, said \n     Ralph Sacco, chairman of the American Stroke Association's \n     Stroke Advisory Committee and chairman of neurology at the \n     Miller School of Medicine at the University of Miami.

Mr. President, tomorrow, April 16, 2008, marks the first \nanniversary of the horrific incident at Virginia Tech that resulted in \nthe tragic deaths of 32 students and faculty members and serious \ninjuries to many other innocent victims. Our hearts go out to the \nvictims' families as they mourn their loved ones who tragically lost \ntheir lives before their time. Our sympathies also go out to the \nsurvivors of this terrible incident, as well as the entire Virginia \nTech community, whose resilient spirit and courage in the face of \ntragedy over the past year have been truly remarkable.\n  We cannot reverse the senseless violence of one year ago, nor can we \nrepair all of the damage that the heinous acts of one very disturbed \nyoung man caused for an entire community. But one thing we can do to \nhonor the victims and their families is ensure that our schools, \ncolleges, and universities have the support and resources they need to \nprotect our children.\n  Regrettably, 1 year after the tragic events at Virginia Tech, little \nhas been done at the national level to address the dangers our students \ncontinue to face. Over the past 12 months, we have continued to see \nthreatening conduct and, too often, deadly acts of violence involving \nstudents of all ages. Only yesterday we learned that several colleges \nwere shut down as officials assessed graffiti messages threatening \nviolence on campus. School lockdowns are becoming all too common in our \ncommunities.\n  A string of tragedies in just 1 week's time this past February \nreminded us once again that our students face more than merely \nthreatening violent conduct. Between February 8 and February 14, at \nleast four incidents at schools and colleges resulted in death or \nserious injury to students of all ages.\n  On February 8, a female student killed two other students, and then \nherself, inside a classroom on the campus of Louisiana Technical \nCollege in Baton Rouge. Three days later, a student at Mitchell High \nSchool in Memphis, TN, was left in critical condition after a violent \nincident in the school's cafeteria. A day later, a 15-year-old boy at \nE.O. Green Junior High in Oxnard, CA, was critically wounded by a \nclassmate. He was later declared brain dead.\n  Then, on February 14, tragedy struck at Northern Illinois University. \nA former student opened fire in a geology class, killing 5 students and \nwounding 16, before killing himself. As hundreds of mourners remembered \none of the Northern Illinois University victims at a funeral service, \nmore than 1,000 Virginia Tech students--many of the same students who \nwill grieve tomorrow for their lost friends, classmates, and \nprofessors--gathered in solidarity for a candlelight vigil in \nBlacksburg, VA.\n  Eight months ago, the Senate Judiciary Committee took a step to make \nour schools and college campuses safer when it reported the School \nSafety and Law Enforcement Improvement Act of 2007, S. 2084. \nRegrettably, the Senate has failed to take up and pass that bill to \nimprove school safety. The 1-year anniversary of the Virginia Tech \nincident reminds us why this comprehensive legislation should be \nconsidered and passed without further delay.\n  In originating the bill more than 8 months ago, the Judiciary \nCommittee showed deference to Gov. Tim Kaine and the task forces at \nwork in Virginia and sought to complement their work and \nrecommendations. Working with several Senators, including Senators \nBoxer, Reed, Specter, Feingold, Schumer, and Durbin, the committee \noriginated this bill and reported it at the start of the 2007 academic \nyear in the hope that Congress would adopt these critical school safety \nimprovements last fall. We worked hard to get it done.\n  The incidents at E.O. Green Junior High, Mitchell High School, \nLouisiana Technical College, and Northern Illinois University are just \na few of the tragic events that have claimed lives or resulted in \nserious injuries to students since the Virginia Tech tragedy. In the \ntime since this bill was reported out of the Judiciary Committee, we \nhave seen tragic deaths at Delaware State University and the University \nof Memphis and grievous injuries sustained by students and teachers at \nSuccessTech Academy in Cleveland, OH. And there have been numerous \nlockdowns nationwide as a result of threatening conduct in our schools, \nincluding recent lockdowns at Fern Creek High School in Louisville, KY, \nand St. Peter's College in Jersey City, NY.\n  The School Safety and Law Enforcement Improvement Act would address \nthe problem of violence in our schools in several ways. The bill \nauthorizes Federal assistance for programs to improve the safety and \nsecurity of our schools and institutions of higher education, provides \nequitable benefits to law enforcement serving those institutions, \nincluding bulletproof vests, and funds pilot programs to develop \ncutting-edge prevention and intervention programs for our schools. The \nbill also clarifies and strengthens two existing statutes--the \nTerrorist Hoax Improvements Act and the Law Enforcement Officers Safety \nAct--which are designed to improve public safety.\n  Specifically, the bill would improve the safety and security of \nstudents both at the elementary and secondary school level and on \ncollege and university campuses. The K-12 improvements are drawn from a \nbill that Senator Boxer introduced right after the Virginia Tech \ntragedy, and I want to thank Senator Boxer for her hard work on this \nissue. The improvements include increased funding for much needed \ninfrastructure changes to improve security as well as the establishment \nof hotlines and tip-lines, which will enable students to report \npotentially dangerous situations to school administrators before they \noccur.\n  To address the new realities of campus safety in the wake of Virginia \nTech and more recent college incidents, the bill also creates a \nmatching grant program for campus safety and security to be \nadministered out of the COPS Office of the Department of Justice.\n  The grant program would allow institutions of higher education to \napply, for the first time, directly for Federal funds to make school \nsafety and security improvements. The program is authorized to be \nappropriated at $50 million for the next 2 fiscal years. While this \namounts to just $3 per student each year, it will enable schools to \nmore effectively respond to dangerous situations on campus.\n  The bill would also make sworn law enforcement officers who work for \nprivate institutions of higher education and rail carriers eligible for \ndeath and disability benefits and for funds administered under the \nByrne Grant Program and the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program. \nProviding this equitable treatment is in the best interest of our \nNation's educators and students and will serve to place the support of \nthe Federal Government behind the dedicated law enforcement officers \nwho serve and protect private colleges and universities nationwide. The \nleadership of Senator Jack Reed has been vital in this area.\n  The bill also helps law enforcement by making improvements to the Law \nEnforcement Officers Safety Act of 2003, LEOSA. These amendments to \nexisting law will streamline the system by which qualified retired and \nactive officers can be certified under LEOSA. It serves us all when we \npermit qualified officers, with a demonstrated commitment to law \nenforcement and no adverse employment history, to protect themselves, \ntheir families, and their fellow citizens wherever those officers may \nbe.\n  The bill focuses on prevention as well, by incorporating the \nPRECAUTION Act at the request of Senators Feingold and Specter. This \nprovision authorizes grants to develop prevention and intervention \nprograms for our schools.\n  Finally, the bill incorporates the Terrorist Hoax Improvements Act of\n\n[[Page S3023]]\n\n2007, at the request of Senator Kennedy.\n  The Virginia Tech Review Panel--a body commissioned by Governor Kaine \nto study the Virginia Tech tragedy--has issued its findings based on a \n4-month investigation of the incident and its aftermath. This bill \nwould adopt a number of recommendations from the Review Panel aimed at \nimproving school safety.\n  We must not miss this opportunity to implement these initiatives \nnationwide and to take concrete steps to ensure the safety of our kids. \nThe Senate should move forward and act. I hope those who are holding up \nthis legislation will reconsider their position today as we prepare to \nremember and to honor those who so tragically lost their lives, and \nthose who had their lives changed forever, in the most deadly incident \non a college campus in our Nation's history.\n  The Senate should move forward to invest in the safety of our \nstudents and to better support law enforcement officers across the \ncountry by considering and passing the School Safety and Law \nEnforcement Improvement Act of 2007.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/15/senate-section/article/S3023-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CAPITAL AREA DISTRICT LIBRARY 10TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, since the first library society was formed \nin Detroit in 1817, libraries have played a central role in the \ncultural and economic development of the people of Michigan. Nearly 200 \nyears after that first foray into book-sharing, libraries have spread \nacross our State. Today I would like to take a moment to recognize the \nCapital Area District Library in Ingham County, which is celebrating a \ndecade of enriching the Lansing area, and in doing so has continued the \nlong history of libraries making important contributions to our State.\n  The Capital Area District Library system plays a significant role in \nthe early stages of learning for children in Lansing, and provides \nimportant resources for continuing education for adults. The 13 \nlibraries and the book mobile are places where all are welcome to \naccess and pursue a wealth of information. Patrons can work on their \nown, in organized programs, or with the assistance of the highly \neffective library staff, who are focused on promoting learning and \nenjoyment.\n  The resources available through the Capital Area District Library \nalso play a critical role in economic development. Considering that \nmore than half of all American households do not have computers or \nInternet access, the Capital Area District Library resources are more \nimportant than ever to connect our citizens to technology and \ninformation in this rapidly changing world.\n  Thomas Jefferson once wrote to John Adams, ``I cannot live without \nbooks.'' Books and education were a bedrock of life for our Nation's \nFounding Fathers and of our democracy; books and education and new \nlearning resources that the Founding Fathers could not have imagined \nmust be readily available to citizens across the country. The Capital \nArea District Library continues to fulfill this need in Lansing and \nIngham County, and has done so for 10 years with remarkable \neffectiveness. I congratulate all who have worked so hard on this \nventure, and extend my deepest appreciation for their service to the \ncitizens of our State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/15/senate-section/article/S3023-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IRS PRIVATE DEBT COLLECTION ACTIVITIES\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today is April 15, the day when millions \nof Americans are hurrying to file their income tax forms to meet the \nmidnight deadline. Many of my colleagues have spoken today about the \nneed to make more effective and responsible use of Federal tax dollars, \nand I agree that we must do so. One place to start is with the IRS's \nown private debt collection program.\n  Today, the Washington Post reported that the Internal Revenue \nService's use of private debt collection agencies is expected to cost \ntaxpayers more than $37 million this year. Throughout our Nation's \nhistory, the Federal Government had always assumed responsibility for \ntax collection. But in 2004, through legislation that I opposed, \nCongress gave the IRS authority to use private debt collection \ncompanies to collect undisputed tax debts of less than $25,000. The \ncompanies also would receive a 25-percent commission on all receipts. \nAlthough the stated goal was to improve the efficiency of tax \ncollections, it is clear that this plan is not working.\n  In fact, even before Congress adopted this approach, former IRS \nCommissioner Charles Rossotti estimated, in a 2002 report to the IRS \nOversight Board, that if Congress were to appropriate an additional \n$296 million to hire more compliance employees, the agency could \ncollect an additional $9.47 billion. In other words, every dollar spent \non collection would net $31. But rather than increase the number of IRS \nemployees, Congress ignored Commissioner Rossotti's advice and instead \nspent scarce taxpayer funds to privatize IRS functions, with dismal \nresults.\n  In March 2008, Nina Olson, the National Taxpayer Advocate, reported \nto Congress that the program actually is losing money. Testifying \nbefore the House Ways and Means Committee, Ms. Olson said that the IRS \nis losing at least $81 million a year by using private debt collection \ncompanies. The IRS spent $71 million to start the program and it spends \n$7.65 million annually to operate it, plus on average $4.6 million in \ncommissions that are paid to the private collectors. Despite using \naggressive tactics, the companies have collected only $49 million, \nlittle more than half of what it has cost the IRS to implement the \nprogram. By contrast, Ms. Olson testified, and I quote, ``if the \nprogram did not exist and the IRS instead allocated $7.65 million in \nappropriated funds to its automated collection system, ACS, function, \nthe return on investment would be vastly greater. IRS data shows that \nthe average return on investment for the ACS program is about 20:1, \nwhich would mean that an expenditure of $7.65 million would generate \nannual revenue of $153 million.'' Ms. Olson then recommended that the \nprivate debt collection initiative be terminated. I concur.\n  The privatization initiative is also putting millions of Americans' \npersonal information at risk. I do not believe that Americans want \nprivate collection agencies tio have access to their sensitive, \npersonal information that should only be reserved for the Federal \nGovernment and the qualified, trained, accountable personnel who work \nat the IRS.\n  The Ways and Means Committee recently considered legislation that \nwould repeal the IRS's authority to use private debt collection \nagencies. The Taxpayer Assistance and Simplification Act was reported \nout of committee in a bipartisan vote. My distinguished colleague from \nNorth Dakota has introduced similar legislation that would prohibit the \nIRS from using private debt collection companies, and I am pleased to \nbe an original cosponsor of that bill.\n  The private debt collection program also has generated considerable \nconfusion among taxpayers. Under the rules of the program, collectors \ncannot say they are working for the IRS or that they are calling about \na tax matter without first receiving proof of a taxpayer's identity. \nThis has led to numerous complaints from consumers who have received \ncalls from collectors, pressing them to provide Social Security numbers \nand other personal information without first identifying the purpose of \nthe call. Citizens are justifiably fearful of being scammed, and so \nthey refuse to provide the companies with any information. By any \nmeasure, this program is not working.\n  Mr. President, the private debt collection experiment has failed. Tax \ncollection is a fundamental responsibility of Government, and Congress \nshould provide the IRS with the staff and other resources needed to \nfulfill this responsibility, not enrich private companies at the \nexpense of American taxpayers. Today on April 15--Tax Day--millions of \nAmericans are rushing to file their taxes before the midnight deadline. \nMany are writing checks to the IRS, and so it is an appropriate time to \nreconsider the millions of dollars they are spending on the private \ndebt collection program. It is time for this body to pass Senator \nDorgan's bill and end this inefficient use of taxpayer dollars.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/15/senate-section/article/S3023-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3023-S3024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING OUR MILITARY\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the \ncourage\n\n[[Page S3024]]\n\nand selflessness of the men and women serving so bravely in America's \nmilitary and, in particular, to acknowledge those from my home State of \nNebraska. Last week, the testimony of GEN David Petraeus and Ambassador \nRyan Crocker before the Senate on the situation in Iraq reminded \neveryone of the personal sacrifices of the men and women and their \nfamilies who are serving their country in support of Operations Iraqi \nFreedom and Enduring Freedom.\n  The United States is engaged in a protracted war for the first time \nsince the end of the military draft 35 years ago. The strains of this \nprolonged engagement in Iraq and Afghanistan are underscored by the \nburdens placed on our service members and their families. The voluntary \nnature of our military accentuates these burdens, being borne by a \nrelative few. This present situation is unique compared to America's \npast military engagements. World Wars I and II and the conflicts in \nKorea and Vietnam relied on conscription; consequently, the effects of \nthese wars were felt by a broad number of ordinary Americans. Today, \nthe current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have placed our soldiers and \nmilitary families in an extraordinary situation.\n  I have visited Iraq four times and Afghanistan twice since the \ncommencement of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom and have \nmet with countless soldiers and their families. Each of these visits \nand meetings has further elevated my personal gratitude and \nappreciation of these men and women, and consequently, these soldiers \nand their families are constantly at the forefront of my thoughts. Last \nweek, a news story described the battle of Sadr City, a district in \nBaghdad, Iraq, and featured a young man whom I had watched grow up in \nNebraska. This news story evoked those same feelings of deep gratitude \nand immense pride.\n  The soldier featured in the story was Army CPT Logan Veath, of \nChadron, NE. I had last seen Captain Veath 5 months ago at a reunion of \nthe Big Red Battalion, the University of Nebraska's Reserve Officers' \nTraining Corps, ROTC, unit, of which he was a member while attending \nour shared alma mater. I had first met Captain Veath when he was 16 \nyears old, and we reminisced at that reunion of our past experiences \ntogether. Captain Veath was dressed in cowboy attire--because that is \nexactly what he is in Nebraska. In fact, I almost didn't recognize him \nin the news story from Iraq, as he had a Kevlar helmet on his head \ninstead of his usual cowboy hat.\n  Captain Veath's entire family was also at the reunion, and they \nprovided a brief glimpse into how a family copes with a loved one who \nis called upon to serve tours of duty lasting from 12 to 15 months. \nCaptain Veath is unique in that this is his sixth tour of duty serving \nin Iraq or Afghanistan. Less than 1 percent of Army service members \nhave been deployed six times; this speaks to Captain Veath's remarkable \ndedication and selflessness.\n  That day was a vivid reminder of our American soldiers, who must \nleave their loved ones in order to serve in battles nearly 7,000 miles \naway from their homes. Today, I offer my most sincere appreciation and \ngratitude to soldiers such as Army CPT Logan Veath. We must never \nforget these brave men and women, who have valiantly and selflessly \nserved their country, together with their families, who provide them \nwith immeasurable support. Their honor in service must remain a source \nof inspiration for us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/15/senate-section/article/S3024-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      HONORING JENNIFER JOY WILSON\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Jennifer Joy \nWilson. For the past decade, Ms. Wilson has served first as the head of \nthe National Stone Association, and then after the merger of two \nsimilar groups, as the president and CEO of the National Stone, Sand & \nGravel Association, NSSGA. Based in Alexandria, VA, NSSGA is the \nworld's largest mining association by product volume. Its member \ncompanies represent more than 90 percent of the crushed stone and 70 \npercent of the sand and gravel produced annually in the United States \nand approximately 118,000 working men and women in the aggregates \nindustry. During 2006, a total of about 2.95 billion metric tons of \ncrushed stone, sand and gravel, valued at $21 billion, were produced \nand sold in the United States.\n  This year Ms. Wilson has been given the distinguished honor of being \nselected as AggMan of the Year by Aggregates Manager magazine, one of \nthe construction aggregates industry's leading trade publications.\n  During her tenure, the NSSGA led an effort to improve employee safety \nin the aggregate industry by developing new safety procedures, called \nPart 46, for the U.S. Mine Safety & Health Administration, MSHA. The \njoint industry-labor effort produced a proposal ``that would apply \nbetter to our industry and provide managers and workers with effective \nmeans to prevent accidents and fatalities.'' By all accounts, Part 46 \nhas shown remarkable success in reducing employee injuries.\n  On February 11, 2003, an alliance between NSSGA and MSHA was \nannounced. Signed at the NSSGA's Centennial Convention in Orlando, FL, \nthe agreement calls for the two bodies to work closely together on the \npromotion of safe working conditions, the development of effective \nminer training programs, and the expansion of the mine safety and \nhealth outreach and communication. ``For the first time ever, MSHA and \nan industry association have jointly agreed to adopt safety and health \nperformance goals with objective measures,'' then MSHA Administrator \nDave Lauriski said during that meeting. ``This alone is unprecedented . \n. . NSSGA is again showing its leadership.''\n  On the environmental front, Ms. Wilson led the industry in investing \nin a study ``righting an assumption we just didn't believe was right.'' \nThrough the efforts of the association and its members, it was \ndetermined that the aggregates industry is not a major emitter of PM-\n10--a particular type of air pollutant. The final regulations reflected \nthe investment by the industry in recognizing that aggregate operations \nare not a major source of coarse particulate matter.\n  Considering almost half of all crushed stone, sand and gravel \nproduced in the United States is used for building the Nation's \ntransportation infrastructure, Ms. Wilson has led her members in \nestablishing a strong grassroots presence connecting the industry's \nworkforce with their elected officials while increasing their activity \non Capitol Hill. Leveraging the association's resources, Ms. Wilson has \nalso worked closely with industry coalitions to advocate for sound and \nsensible transportation policies.\n  Ms. Wilson has also worked to raise awareness of the public, \nlegislators, and of regulators at all levels to the immeasurably \nimportant role aggregates play in maintaining America's high quality of \nlife. She calls this effort ``romancing the stone'' which includes her \nleadership in establishing The Rocks gallery at the Smithsonian's \nNational Museum of Natural History and creating a permanent endowment \nto support the gallery, all totaling more than $3.1 million.\n  Many people have been able to take credit for industry \naccomplishments, but selection as AggMan of the Year denotes something \nnot everyone can lay claim to--respect of one's peers. For this reason \nI stand here today to take a moment and congratulate a woman who has \ndone so much for America and the good people in the aggregates industry \nall the while earning their respect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/15/senate-section/article/S3024-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3024-S3025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING NORTH SEATTLE COMMUNITY COLLEGE\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I wish today to recognize the \nNorth Seattle Community College, in my home State of Washington, as a \nlocal leader in sustainability practices. The work of North Seattle \nCommunity College, and especially of the North Seattle Community \nCollege Sustainability Committee, has made significant contributions to \nraising awareness of sustainability issues in everyday life on the \ncampus.\n  Created in 2005, the North Seattle Community College Sustainability \nCommittee holds regular meetings to coordinate sustainability practices \nwith faculty, staff, administrators, students, and interested local \nresidents.\n\n[[Page S3025]]\n\nThis committee has helped to create and implement an impressive list of \ncommunity-wide activities including: sustainability curriculum, \ncourses, and service learning opportunities; a Web site with useful \nresources; and an annual Earth Day celebration.\n  The North Seattle Community College Sustainability Committee also \nhelped incorporate new resource management practices into campus \noperations and expanded the campus trail system. By providing these \nservices, the North Seattle Community College Sustainability Committee \nhas done a wonderful job of engaging students, teachers, and local \ncitizens.\n  I believe that in order to truly embrace the opportunities and \nchallenges of tomorrow, the youth of our Nation must have access to \nprograms that foster stewardship and long-term commitment to community \nawareness. Washington State is fortunate to have schools like North \nSeattle Community College, which is a natural arena for the kind of \ninnovation our Nation needs in order to embrace new environmentally \nfriendly practices. Green programs and activities are critical to the \ndevelopment of environmentally aware citizens. I was proud to introduce \nthe Higher Education Sustainability Act to help provide resources for \ncollege and universities to implement sustainability programs, and my \nhope is that schools like North Seattle Community College will continue \nto serve as great role models for other colleges around the Nation as \nthey work on sustainability issues.\n  It is inspiring to see that the issue of sustainability is bringing \npeople together, and I am proud North Seattle Community College is \nempowering the entire campus to work on positive solutions. I am sure \nNorth Seattle Community College will continue to be successful in \ninspiring change and providing continued leadership on this important \nissue.\n Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, with Earth Day just a week away, \nI wish to recognize the steps colleges and universities in my State are \ntaking to increase public awareness about the effect our daily actions \nhave on the environment. Specifically, I would like to applaud the \ncommitment North Seattle Community College has made to incorporate \nsustainable practices into everyday life at the college and local \nlevel.\n  Sustainability, the simple idea that we can meet the needs of the \npresent without compromising the ability of future generations to meet \ntheir own needs is a concept that is relevant to our lives now more \nthan ever. Today, our reliance on fossil fuels is not only exacerbating \neconomic woes, it is driving too many of our foreign policy decisions \nand fueling the detrimental forces of climate change. It is time we \nshift our focus to sustainable practices that encourage a cleaner \nenvironment, healthier communities, a stronger economy, and most \nimportantly, national security.\n  My home State of Washington has always been a leader when it comes to \nenvironmental sustainability. For 75 years we have been on the cutting \nedge of utilizing natural resources to create sustainable, clean \nemissions power. I think that Washingtonians, living next door to some \nof the most pristine river valleys and snowcapped peaks in the world, \nrealize how unfair it would be if our great-grandchildren couldn't do \nthe same.\n  Furthering our State's environmentally conscious tradition, in the \nspring of 2005, North Seattle Community College president Dr. Ron \nLaFayette put NSCC on track to be a leader in the sustainability \nmovement by creating a standing advisory Sustainable Committee to \naddress issues of sustainability at the school.\n  The committee, made up of faculty, staff, administrators, students, \nand interested citizenry, began meeting regularly in 2006. Since then, \nit has spearheaded NSCC's efforts to become a local and national model \nfor sustainability practices.\n  The Sustainability Committee created and has begun to implement goals \nthat include creating and developing a fact sheet, Web site, and other \ninformation-sharing methodology; creating and coordinating curriculum \naround sustainability issues. This includes developing new stand-alone \ncourses, integrated studies programs, service learning and distance \nlearning opportunities; furthering the development of a campus trail \nsystem, including a walking trail and an interpretive nature trail; \nincorporating sustainable practices into campus operations--including \nfood service, waste management, and resource usage; and sponsoring the \nannual Earth Week celebration. In 2007, this festival included guest \nspeakers and over 35 vendors including educational institutions, \nenvironmental nonprofits, and neighborhood businesses.\n  I am personally encouraged by the attention North Seattle Community \nCollege and other Washington State schools have given to advancing \nsustainable practices in our schools and communities. I hope more \ninstitutions of higher education will follow suit in years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/15/senate-section/article/S3025-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/15/senate-section/article/S3025-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/15/senate-section/article/S3025-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4:53 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3548.

A bill to establish the Social Work Reinvestment Commission \nto provide independent counsel to Congress and the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services on policy issues associated with recruitment, \nretention, research, and reinvestment in the profession of social work, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, in honor of World Social Work Day, I \nrise today to introduce the Dorothy I. Height and Whitney M. Young, Jr. \nSocial Work Reinvestment Act. I am proud to sponsor this legislation \nthat will improve the shortage of social workers as we move into an era \nof unprecedented healthcare and social service needs. Social workers \nplay a critical role combating the social problems facing our Nation. \nWe must have the workforce in place to make sure that our returning \nsoldiers have access to mental health services, our elderly maintain \ntheir independence in the communities they live in, and abused children \nare placed in safe homes. This bill reinvests in social workers by \nproviding grants to social workers, reviewing the current social \nworkforce challenges, and determining how this shortage will affect the \ncommunities social workers serve. I am honored to introduce this bill \nnamed after two social visionaries, Dorothy I. Height and Whitney M. \nYoung. Dorothy Height, a pioneer of the civil rights movement, like me \nbegan her career as a case worker and continued to fight for social \njustice. Whitney Young, another trailblazer of the civil rights \nmovement, also began his career transforming our social landscape as a \nsocial worker. He helped create President Johnson's War on Poverty and \nhas served as President of the National Association of Social Workers. \nCongressman Towns introduced the companion bill in the House of \nRepresentatives last month.\n  As a social worker, I understand the critical role social workers \nplace in the overall care of our populations. Social workers can be \nfound in every facet of community life--in hospitals, mental health \nclinics, senior centers, and private agencies that serve individuals \nand families in need. Social workers are there to help struggling \nstudents, returning soldiers, and chronically ill. Oftentimes, social \nworkers are the only available option for mental health care in rural \nand underserved urban areas. The number of adults over the age of 65 \nwill double by the year 2030 and social workers will be at the \nforefront of providing compassionate care to this burgeoning community. \nYet there will not be enough social workers to meet these needs. Today \n30,000 social workers specialize in gerontology, but we will need \n70,000 of these social workers by 2010. I want to make sure that when \nthe aging tsunami hits us, we have the workforce in place to care for \nour aging family members, the Alzheimer patients, the disabled.\n  This bill is about reinvesting in social work. It provides grants \nthat invest in social work education, research, and training. These \ngrants will fund community based programs of excellence and provide \nscholarships to train the next generation of social workers. The bill \nalso addresses how to recruit and retain new social workers, research \nthe impact of social services, and foster ways to improve social \nworkplace safety. This bill establishes a national coordination center \nthat will allow social education, advocacy and research institutions to \ncollaborate and work together. It will facilitate gathering and \ndistributing social work research to make the most effective use of the \ninformation we have on how social work service can improve our social \nfabric. This bill also gives social work the attention is deserves. It \ncreates a media campaign that will promote social work, and recognizes \nMarch as Social Work Awareness Month.\n  As a social worker, I have been on the frontlines of helping people \ncope with issues in their everyday lives. I started off fighting for \nabused children, making sure they were placed in safe homes. Today I am \na social worker with power. I am proud to continue to fight every day \nfor the long range\n\n[[Page S3029]]\n\nneeds of the Nation, on the floor of the United States Senate and as \nthe Chairwoman of the Aging Subcommittee of the Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee.\n  I believe that social work is full of great opportunities, both to \nserve and to lead. Social work is about putting our values into action. \nSocial workers are our best and brightest, our most committed and \ncompassionate. They are at the frontlines of providing care, often \nputting themselves in dangerous and violent situations. Social workers \nhave the ability to provide psychological, emotional, and social \nsupport--quite simply, the ability to change lives. That is why we must \nreinvest in social work--we must recruit, retain and research. I think \nwe can do better by our Nation's troops, seniors, and children, by \nmaking sure we have the social workforce in place to meet their needs. \nI'm fighting to make sure we do.\n  The Dorothy I. Height and Whitney M. Young, Jr. Social Work \nReinvestment Act is strongly supported by the National Association of \nSocial Workers and the Institute for the Advancement of Social Work \nResearch. I want to thank Senators Stabenow, Smith, and Inouye for \ntheir cosponsorship of this bill.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this important \npiece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                               Social Workers,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n       We, the undersigned professional social work organizations, \n     join with the National Association of Social Workers (NASW) \n     in showing our full support for the Dorothy I. Height and \n     Whitney M. Young, Jr. Social Work Reinvestment Act. Social \n     workers provide indispensible services in nearly every \n     community nationwide and to millions of Americans including \n     aging baby boomers, wounded veterans, former prisoners, at-\n     risk students, abused and neglected children, and those \n     diagnosed with cancer, serious mental illness, and those with \n     HIV and AIDS. These essential services have a positive impact \n     on the mental, social, and psychosocial functioning of \n     clients across the country. While professional social workers \n     are more necessary today than at any other time in our \n     history, they are also facing barriers that challenge the \n     profession including insurmountable education debt, \n     insufficient salaries, and serious safety concerns.\n       The Dorothy I. Height and Whitney M. Young, Jr. Social Work \n     Reinvestment Act takes important steps to ensure the future \n     viability of the social work profession. The legislation \n     explores the many successful efforts already undertaken by \n     our nation's social workers, while examining the persistent \n     challenges to these efforts. A Social Work Reinvestment \n     Commission will provide a comprehensive analysis of current \n     workforce trends and develop long-term recommendations and \n     strategies to maximize the ability of America's social \n     workers to serve their clients with expertise and care. \n     Demonstration programs will be funded in the areas of \n     workplace improvements, research, education and training, and \n     community-based programs of excellence. This investment will \n     be returned many times over both in support for effective \n     social service solutions and in direct services to client \n     populations.\n       The Dorothy I. Height and Whitney M. Young, Jr. Social Work \n     Reinvestment Act is a commitment to ensure that social \n     workers can provide indispensable services for years to come. \n     The future of the profession depends on the measures that are \n     taken toward reinvestment today. We thank Senator Mikulski \n     for her dedication to and leadership of the social work \n     profession and urge every member of the Senate to show their \n     support for professional social workers as well as the \n     individuals, groups, and communities they serve.\n           Sincerely,\n         Action Network for Social Work Education and Research, \n           Association of Baccalaureate Social Work Program \n           Directors, Association of Oncology Social Work, \n           Clinical Social Work Association, Council on Social \n           Work Education, Group for the Advancement of Doctoral \n           Education in Social Work, Institute for the Advancement \n           of Social Work Research, National Association of Deans \n           and Directors of Schools of Social Work, Social Welfare \n           Action Alliance, Society for Social Work and Research.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     Institute for the Advancement\n\n\n                                      of Social Work Research,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 12, 2008.\n     Hon. Barbara Mikulski,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Mikulski: As the Institute for the Advancement \n     of Social Work Research (IASWR) celebrates its 15th \n     anniversary, this is an important opportunity to recognize \n     the strides that have been made in knowledge development and \n     research infrastructure development in social work over the \n     past decade and one half. However, the growing demands for \n     social work services, the focus on implementation of \n     evidence-based practices, and the need to address both \n     recruitment and retention of professional social workers, \n     requires that there be enhanced federal investments in the \n     social work profession. As the number of children in foster \n     care rises, as our population ages, as school drop-out rates \n     increase, and as deployed soldiers and returning veterans \n     require expanded access to health, mental health and social \n     services, the need for professional social workers at all \n     levels of practice and in all fields of practice has never \n     been greater.\n       IASWR would like to thank you for standing with your \n     profession in introducing the Dorothy I. Height/Whitney M. \n     Young Social Work Reinvestment Act in the Senate. This Act is \n     one important step in addressing workplace and workforce \n     issues faced by social workers. It will also provide \n     discretionary grants to implement best practice models in \n     social agencies and it provides incentive programs to attract \n     the next generation of social work practitioners and social \n     work researchers. Of particular importance will be the Social \n     Work Reinvestment Commission that will examine critical \n     issues and potential solutions facing the profession today.\n       As a social worker, I know that you recognize the \n     challenges faced by the social work profession, including low \n     salaries, high caseloads, lack of access to the latest \n     technology to facilitate service delivery, shrinking \n     availability of services, and concerns about safety. The \n     Social Work Reinvestment Act begins to address these \n     concerns.\n       Thank you for all of your leadership and commitment to \n     social work and to the millions of vulnerable individuals, \n     families and communities that we work with daily. IASWR and \n     the social work research community stands ready to work with \n     you. If you have questions or need additional information, \n     please do not hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Joan Levy Zlotnik,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today, on World Social Work Day, to \nintroduce the Dorothy I. Height and Whitney M. Young, Jr. Social Work \nReinvestment Act. I am pleased to be joined by my colleagues Senator \nBarbara Mikulski and Senator Debbie Stabenow in supporting this \nimportant legislation to help ensure the sustainability of the social \nwork field. I look forward to continuing our collaboration on this bill \nand other efforts to support the tremendous work of our nation's social \nworkers as they ensure the safety and welfare of our citizens in need \nof guidance and protection.\n  Social workers in America face an array of issues that impact their \nability to stay in the profession. We know that as the U.S. population \nincreases and ages, caseworkers' caseloads continue to increase, \ncausing greater pressure to perform with ever decreasing resources. \nFurther, relatively low wages make it difficult for social workers to \nstay in their profession long-term. These are just a few of the many \nchallenges they face. Those in the social work field need our support \nin creating innovative ways to keep them in the profession they love \nand therefore help the people in our communities who need their \nexpertise and compassion.\n  Unfortunately, my home State of Oregon is not immune to these \nproblems. We all know of the wonderful work that social workers do to \nprotect children from abuse and neglect. Particularly in parts of \nOregon where Methamphetamine abuse has caused widespread suffering, \nsocial workers have risen to the occasion to ensure children get the \nhelp that they need. However, less recognized is the work that they do \non behalf of our elderly. About 13 percent of Oregon's population is \npersons over the age of 65, which is above the national average of \nabout 12.4 percent. This number is expected to increase dramatically in \ncoming years as our population continues to age, our seniors live \nlonger and we see more of our elderly with multiple chronic conditions. \nMany of these elderly will depend on the help and guidance of social \nworkers to ensure their well being.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to join me, Senator Mikulski and \nSenator Stabenow in championing this legislation to support the needs \nof our social workers. I look forward to its swift passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WEBB (for himself and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 2859. A bill to amend the Family Educational Rights and Privacy \nAct of 1974 to clarify limits on disclosure of student health records, \nand for other\n\n[[Page S3030]]\n\npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2859\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n         This Act may be cited as the ``Family Educational Rights \n     and Privacy Act Amendments of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n         Congress finds the following:\n         (1) Federal authorities charged with examining the tragic \n     shootings at Virginia Tech in April 2007 found that confusion \n     and overly-restrictive interpretations of Federal privacy \n     laws, State medical confidentiality laws, and regulations \n     unnecessarily impede the effective transfer of information \n     that could prove useful in averting tragedies. Some school \n     administrators are unaware of exceptions to Federal privacy \n     laws that could allow relevant information about a student's \n     mental health to be appropriately shared.\n         (2) The purpose of this Act is to eliminate ambiguity in \n     Federal education privacy law to ensure that the Family \n     Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) is not \n     interpreted as prohibiting information sharing between on-\n     campus and off-campus health care providers when both are \n     involved in treating a student. Such ``consults'' are \n     generally permitted by State medical confidentiality law, and \n     FERPA should not be interpreted as posing an additional \n     obstacle. The Virginia Tech Review Panel recommended that \n     changes to ``FERPA should explicitly explain how it applies \n     to medical records held for treatment purposes''. The panel \n     reported that misinterpretation of how student treatment \n     records are handled under FERPA as the main source of \n     confusion. FERPA protects the privacy of both student \n     education records and student treatment records from being \n     disclosed generally.\n         (3) The Virginia Tech Review Panel recommended that \n     Federal privacy laws should be amended to include ``safe \n     harbor'' provisions that would insulate a person or \n     organization from the loss of Federal education funding for \n     making a disclosure with a good faith belief that the \n     disclosure was necessary to protect the health or safety of a \n     student or member of the public at large. The Commission \n     further recommended that the Federal Educational Rights and \n     Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) be amended to clarify the ability \n     of educational institutions to disclose information in \n     emergency situations and to facilitate treatment of students \n     at off-campus facilities.\n         (4) Mental disorders frequently begin during youth. \n     Research supported by the National Institute of Mental Health \n     found that half of all lifetime cases of mental illness begin \n     by age 14; three quarters have begun by age 24.\n         (5) In 2004, the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention reported 4,316 suicides among young adults aged \n     15-24, making it the third leading cause of death in this age \n     group. There were an additional 5,074 suicides among those \n     aged 25-34, making it the second leading cause of death in \n     this age group.\n         (6) Depression, mental illness, and suicide are problems \n     on college campuses. In 2006, 44 percent of college students \n     reported feeling so depressed it was difficult to function \n     and 9 percent seriously considered suicide, according to a \n     2006 national survey conducted by the American College Health \n     Association.\n         (7) While most people in the United States with a mental \n     disorder eventually seek treatment, a National Institute of \n     Mental Health study found pervasive and lengthy delays in \n     getting treatment, with the median delay across disorders \n     being nearly a decade. Over a 12-month period, 60 percent of \n     those with a mental disorder got no treatment at all.\n         (8) A 2006 survey sponsored by the American College \n     Counseling Association found that 9 percent of enrolled \n     students sought counseling last year and 92 percent of \n     counseling center directors reported an increase in the \n     number of students with severe psychological disorders.\n         (9) Recent events, including the campus shootings at the \n     Virginia Tech and Northern Illinois universities, have \n     further highlighted the deadly problems of mental illness and \n     violence in American schools. The Northern Illinois shooting \n     resulted in 6 deaths while the Virginia Tech killings left 32 \n     people dead, making it the most lethal school shooting in \n     United States history.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title 38, United \nStates Code, to improvement in quality of life in the objectives \nof training and rehabilitation for veterans with service-connected \ndisabilities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  \n  The online version was corrected to read: S. 2864. A bill to \namend title 38, United States Code, to include improvement in \nquality of life in the objectives of training and rehabilitation \nfor veterans with service-connected disabilities, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am introducing today the proposed \nTraining and Rehabilitation for Disabled Veterans Enhancement Act of \n2008. This measure would make two small but, I believe, necessary \nchanges in the Department of Veterans' Affairs program of Independent \nLiving services conducted under the authority of chapter 31 of title \n38, United States Code.\n  VA's IL Program was first established in 1980 by Public Law 96-466, \nthe Veterans Rehabilitation and Education Amendments of 1980. \nInitially, that law provided for the establishment of a 4-year pilot \nprogram designed to provide independent living services for severely \ndisabled veterans for whom the achievement of a vocational goal was not \nreasonably feasible. The number of veterans who could be accepted \nannually into the pilot program was capped at 500. In 1986, the program \nwas extended through 1989 and then, in 1989, it was made in Public Law \n101-237, the Veterans' Benefits Amendments of 1989. In 2001, the 500 \nannual cap on enrollees was increased to 2,500.\n  The measure I am introducing would remove any cap on the number of \nenrollees in any year. In earlier years, as a pilot project, the cap \nmay have been appropriate in order to give VA an opportunity to manage \nthe program in the most effective manner possible and in 2001, it made \nsense to increase that cap in light of the increased demand and need \nfor the program.\n  Now, however, it makes sense to lift the cap altogether. This is \nespecially so since this important program is designed to meet the \nneeds of the most severely service-connected disabled veterans and more \nand more of those returning from combat have suffered the kind of \ndevastating injuries that may make employment not reasonably feasible \nfor extended periods of time.\n  The VA's Inspector General found, in a report issued in December of \nlast year, that ``the effect of the statutory cap has been to delay IL \nservices to severely disabled veterans.'' This delay happens because VA \nhas developed a procedure that holds veterans in a planning and \nevaluation stage when the statutory cap may be in danger of being \nexceeded.\n  The bill I am introducing today would eliminate the cap entirely as \nrecommended by VA's IG. It would also make the program mandatory rather \nthan a discretionary pilot effort and would include improvement in \nquality of life an objective of training and rehabilitation for \nveterans with service-connected disability who are participating in \nprograms of IL services. For these veterans--with respect to whom it \nhas been determined that employment is not a present, reasonably \nfeasible option but one that may be feasible in the future--it seems \nappropriate to look not only at future employment prospects but also \ntoward improving the individual's quality of\n\n[[Page S3031]]\n\nlife. Such an approach may very well lead to bettering an individual's \nchances of rehabilitation and future employment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2864\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

REPEAL OF LIMITATION ON NUMBER OF VETERANS ENROLLED \n                   IN PROGRAMS OF INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES AND \n                   ASSISTANCE.\n\n       Section 3120 of title 38, United States Code, as amended by \n     section 2 of this Act, is further amended--\n       (1) by striking subsection (e); and\n       (2) by redesignating subsection (f) as subsection (e).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Reed, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lieberman, \n        Mr. Whitehouse, Ms. Collins, and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 2865. A bill to permit qualified withdrawals from a capital \nconstruction fund account under chapter 535 of title 46, United States \nCode, for gear or equipment required for fishery conservation or safety \nof life at sea without regard to the minimum cost requirement \nestablished by regulation; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fisheries \nCapital Construction Fund Enhancement Act of 2008. This bill will help \nalleviate the potentially devastating economic impacts of recent \nregulations on the lobster industry issued by the National Marine \nFisheries Service, and simultaneously encourage conservation in our \nNation's fisheries and enhance the safety of the men and women who make \ntheir living at America's most dangerous profession.\n  On October 5, 2007, the National Marine Fisheries Service, or NMFS, \nissued new regulations that will require ``fixed gear'' fishermen along \nthe Atlantic Seaboard, including lobstermen, to use sinking groundline \nto connect their traps in large areas of the Gulf of Maine beginning \nnext fall. The rules are intended to prevent entanglements of \nendangered whales in fishing gear. By NMFS's own estimates, this rule \nwill impose annual costs of approximately $14 million on our fisheries, \nover 90 percent of which will be borne by the lobster industry. But a \nreport issued by the Government Accountability Office in August 2007 \nfound the agency's economic analysis to be insufficient, and that it \ncould not estimate the extent to which these costly measures would \nprotect whales. While we must protect our endangered species, it is \nsenseless to impose ineffective measures on an already struggling \nindustry.\n  These regulations are particularly concerning given the additional \nhardships our fishing communities currently face, especially down east \nwhere lobster plays an integral role in the regional economy. The \ngroundfish industry, once the lifeblood of this region, is now \nvirtually non-existent, with just one active permit remaining east of \nPenobscot Bay. Lobster has been the lone bright spot in recent years, \nwith annual landings throughout the state in the neighborhood of $300 \nmillion. Unfortunately, early returns for 2007 have declined by more \nthan 20 percent from the record highs of 2005 and 2006, and with fuel \nand bait prices at record highs, the harvest numbers already are \nleading to tightening budgets and dwindling profits. The bottom line is \nthat it is no exaggeration to say that these rules could put many \nlobstermen out of business. The effect on fishing families, and even on \nentire fishing communities, could be devastating.\n  Furthermore, these rules bring additional safety concerns to the \nlobster industry. Many offshore areas in Maine have extremely rocky sea \nfloors. Sinking rope vastly increases the likelihood that the line will \nchaff and snag, wearing the rope to the point that it can suddenly \nsnap, or pulling the boat's rail towards the waterline where it can \nmore easily be swamped and capsized by a large wave.\n  Passage of this bill would be a step toward alleviating the economic \nand safety impacts of these rules by opening fishermen's individually \nheld Capital Construction Funds, or CCF's, to purchases of fishing gear \nrequired to meet conservation measures required within a fishery or for \npurchase of equipment to increase the safety of life at sea. Currently, \nfishermen can deposit a portion of their pre-tax income into a CCF, and \nthat money can then be withdrawn for purchase or reconstruction of \nfishing boats. Expanding the qualified withdrawals from these accounts \nwould reduce the safety and economic impacts of these and other fishing \nregulations. Furthermore, this bill would provide an additional outlet \nfor the $221 million currently held in CCF's nationwide, limiting the \nexpansion of fishing capacity and enhancing conservation efforts by \nreducing incentives to buy or upgrade existing vessels.\n\n  Our fisheries are the only remaining commercial wild capture \nindustries in the Nation; fishermen are the last commercial hunters. As \nsuch, they must strike a unique balance between plying their trade and \nprotecting the resource and the environment that supports it. The \nNation's managers thus strive to balance the two parallel goals of \nsustaining our fish stocks and the viability of our fishing industries. \nThe bill I introduce today will help achieve that balance by making \nfishing gear required for conservation or safety purposes more \naffordable for America's hard-working fishermen.\n  I want to thank my colleagues, Senators Reed, Kerry, Lieberman, \nWhitehouse, Collins, and Kennedy for co-sponsoring this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2865\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fisheries Capital \n     Construction Fund Enhancement Act of 2008''.\n\n     SECTION 2. CERTAIN QUALIFIED CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION FUND \n                   WITHDRAWALS.\n\n       Section 53509 of title 46, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``or'' after the semicolon in paragraph (1) \n     of subsection (a);\n       (2) by redesignating paragraph (2) of subsection (a) as \n     paragraph (3);\n       (3) by inserting after paragraph (1) of subsection (a) the \n     following:\n       ``(2) the acquisition of gear or equipment required for \n     safety of life at sea or to comply with conservation measures \n     within a fishery; or''; and\n       (4) by inserting after ``withdrawal.'' in subsection (c) \n     the following: ``The minimum cost requirements established by \n     such regulations (50 C.F.R. 259.31) shall not apply to a \n     withdrawal described in subsection (a)(2).''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 2867. A bill to authorize additional resources to identify and \neliminate illicit sources of firearms smuggled into Mexico for use by \nviolent drug trafficking organizations, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Southwest \nBorder Violence Reduction Act. This legislation is aimed at addressing \nthe drug-related violence that has plagued parts of Mexico and ensuring \nthat we dedicate the resources necessary to stop the flow of weapons \nthat help fuel this violence.\n  In the Mexican state of Chihuahua, which shares a border with New \nMexico, there have been over 200 killings\n\n[[Page S3032]]\n\nsince the beginning of 2008, an increase of about 100 percent over the \nprevious year. This violence, which is mostly perpetrated by \ninternational drug trafficking organizations, impacts the well-being \nand safety of communities on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border.\n  Recently it was reported that the entire police force in Palomas, a \nMexican town just across the border from Columbus, New Mexico, resigned \nafter repeated threats from drug traffickers. The Chief of Police fled \nto the United States to seek asylum. On another recent occasion, the \nColumbus Port of Entry was shut down after there were several killings \nnearby. As a result, American school children who commute back and \nforth over the border had to receive a police escort. And just \nyesterday, the Department of State renewed a travel advisory warning of \nthe ongoing violence.\n  I have met with Mexico's Ambassador, Foreign Minister, and Attorney \nGeneral to raise serious concerns about the level of violence in the \nregion and to discuss ways to address this problem. I am pleased that \nthe Government of Mexico understands the gravity of this situation and \nI appreciate Mexico's response in sending 2,000 troops to Chihuahua to \nbring it under control. However, both Mexican and U.S. law enforcement \nofficials have stressed the need to more aggressively target the \ncriminal enterprises that are supplying weapons to drug cartels. \nAccording to ATF, about 90 percent of the firearms recovered in Mexico \nare trafficked from the United States because high-powered weapons are \nmuch easier to purchase in the U.S. than in Mexico.\n  The drug cartels operating along the border smuggle illegal narcotics \ninto the United States and use revenue derived from the drug trade to \npurchase the firearms they need to maintain control over drug \ntrafficking routes. According to ATF, about 90 percent of the firearms \nrecovered in Mexico originate from sources within the United States \nbecause high-powered weapons, such as M-50s, are much easier to \npurchase in the United States than in Mexico. The ability to fight drug \ntraffickers is significantly hampered by the fact that these violent \ngroups use smuggled weapons to assassinate military and police \nofficials, murder rival members of drug organizations, and kill \ninnocent civilians.\n  In order to reduce violence in the region and disrupt the drug trade, \nit is essential that we aggressively work to prevent drug trafficking \norganizations operating in Mexico from obtaining these weapons. This \neffort requires that additional resources be allocated to target \nweapons trafficking networks supplying these arms and enhanced \ninternational cooperation in tracing the sources of weapons seized in \nMexico.\n  To this end, the legislation I am introducing today would authorize \nadditional resources to expand a successful ATF initiative, Project \nGunrunner, which is aimed at combating arms smuggling. The bill would \nalso increase the training and support of Mexican law enforcement in \ninvestigating firearms trafficking cases.\n  Specifically, the legislation would enable ATF to hire, train, and \ndeploy an additional 80 special agents to establish and support seven \nmore Project Gunrunner Teams that are solely devoted to disrupting \nfirearm trafficking organizations smuggling weapons into Mexico. The \nbill also would make it possible for ATF to place at least 12 \nadditional special agents in Mexico to support Mexican law enforcement \nin tracing seized firearms. Two Special Agents could be assigned to \nU.S. Consulates throughout the border region, Guadalajara, Chihuahua, \nMatamoros, Hermosillo, Tijuana, and Mazatlan, in conjunction with \nexisting DEA offices. Funds would cover salaries, protective and \ninvestigative equipment, and other costs associated with maintaining a \nforeign presence. And lastly, the legislation would significantly \nincrease ATF efforts to assist and train Mexican law enforcement \nofficers with weapons trafficking investigations. The bill authorizes \n$24.5 million for each fiscal year 2009 and 2010 to implement this Act.\n  I strongly believe that it is essential that the U.S. enhance its \nefforts to stop the flow of weapons being trafficked into Mexico, and I \nhope my colleagues will join me in this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/15/senate-section/article/S3032-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 514--CONGRATULATING THE BOSTON COLLEGE MEN'S ICE \n     HOCKEY TEAM ON WINNING THE 2008 NATIONAL COLLEGIATE ATHLETIC \n        ASSOCIATION DIVISION I NATIONAL ICE HOCKEY CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY (for himself and Mr. Kerry) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 515\n\n       Whereas, between 1975 and 1979, Dith Pran dedicated his \n     life and journalistic career to preventing genocide by \n     exposing the atrocities perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge regime \n     in his native Cambodia;\n       Whereas Dith Pran, the subject of the Academy Award-winning \n     film ``The Killing Fields'', survived the genocide in \n     Cambodia in which up to 2,000,000 men, women, and children, \n     including most of Dith Pran's extended family, were killed by \n     the Khmer Rouge;\n       Whereas Dith Pran assisted many of his fellow journalists \n     who were covering the impending takeover of Cambodia by the \n     Khmer Rouge to escape unharmed from the country when the \n     capital of Cambodia, Phnom Penh, fell to the Khmer Rouge in \n     1975;\n       Whereas Dith Pran was subsequently imprisoned by the Khmer \n     Rouge, and for 4 years endured forced labor, beatings, and \n     unconscionable conditions of human suffering;\n       Whereas, in 1979, Dith Pran escaped from forced labor past \n     the Khmer Rouge's ``killing fields'', a term Mr. Dith created \n     to describe the mass graveyards he saw on his 40-mile journey \n     to a refugee camp in Thailand;\n       Whereas Dith Pran, in the words of New York Times Executive \n     Editor Bill Keller,\n\n[[Page S3033]]\n\n     ``reminds us of a special category of journalistic heroism, \n     the local partner, the stringer, the interpreter, the driver, \n     the fixer, who knows the ropes, who makes your work possible, \n     who often becomes your friend, who may save your life, who \n     shares little of the glory, and who risks so much more than \n     you do'';\n       Whereas Dith Pran moved to New York in 1980 and devoted the \n     remainder of his life and journalistic career to advocating \n     against genocide and for human rights worldwide;\n       Whereas Dith Pran educated people around the world about \n     the horrors of genocide in general, and the genocide in \n     Cambodia in particular, through his creation of the Dith Pran \n     Holocaust Awareness Project;\n       Whereas, in 1985, Dith Pran was appointed a United Nations \n     Goodwill Ambassador by the United Nations High Commissioner \n     for Refugees;\n       Whereas Dith Pran lost his battle with cancer on March 30, \n     2008, leaving behind a world that better understands the \n     tragedy of the genocide in Cambodia and the need to prevent \n     future genocides, largely due to his compelling story, \n     reporting, and advocacy;\n       Whereas Dith Pran said, ``Part of my life is saving life. I \n     don't consider myself a politician or a hero. I'm a \n     messenger. If Cambodia is to survive, she needs many \n     voices.''; and\n       Whereas the example of Dith Pran should endure for \n     generations: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) Dith Pran is a modern day hero and an exemplar of what \n     it means to be a citizen of the United States and a citizen \n     of the world;\n       (2) the United States owes a debt of gratitude to Dith Pran \n     for his tireless work to prevent genocide and violations of \n     fundamental human rights; and\n       (3) teachers throughout the United States should spread \n     Dith Pran's message by educating their students about his \n     life, the genocide in Cambodia, and the collective \n     responsibility of all people to prevent modern-day atrocities \n     and human rights abuses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/15/senate-section/article/S3033-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 516--SOLEMNLY COMMEMORATING THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF \n THE TRAGIC APRIL 1983 BOMBING OF THE UNITED STATES EMBASSY IN BEIRUT \n AND REMEMBERING THOSE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES AND THOSE WHO WERE INJURED\n\n  Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mr. Biden, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. \nCasey) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the 25th anniversary \nof the tragic April 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut. As we \nspeak, thousands of State Department employees are living and working \nabroad, promoting U.S. interests and building stronger relations with \nforeign governments and their peoples. While their work is always \nimportant, it is also sometimes dangerous. The 25th anniversary of the \nApril 18, 1983, bombing of the U.S. embassy in Beirut reminds us of \nthis fact. On that sad day, the lives of 63 people, including 42 \nAmericans and Lebanese members of the Embassy staff, were tragically \ntaken. In addition to those who lost their lives, many others were \ninjured, including 35 embassy personnel.\n  On April 18th, 2008, the State Department will host a commemoration \nceremony. Senior U.S. Government officials will join Ambassador Robert \nDillon, the U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon at the time of the bombing, and \nover 100 family members of the victims to remember their sacrifice. The \nU.S. Senate also joins in honoring the service of those who died, \nmourning their death, and condemning all terrorist acts that \ndeliberately target the innocent. We also reiterate our unwavering \nsupport for the people of Lebanon and their government as they seek to \nbuild a better future free from the threat of terrorist violence.\n  Mr. BROWN.
