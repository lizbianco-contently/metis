Mr. President, we were able late last night to work out \nsomething on FISA, a 15-day extension. There is a path forward. We are \ngoing to try very quickly to get an agreement so that we can move \nforward. I had a meeting in my office at 6 o'clock last night. \nFollowing that meeting, I called the Republican leader, and I think we \nhave a way of moving forward on this legislation, one that would be \nagreed upon by Senators Bond, Rockefeller, Leahy, and Specter, so that \nwe can complete that legislation. I think it will probably take a good \nlong day to do that, but I think that would be all it would take.\n  I hope we can get that done very soon. I do not want to wait. \nWhatever we do, whether we do something or nothing, I do not want to \nwait until the last minute. This is something we need to do. I think it \nwould be in everyone's interests to get it to the House as quickly as \nwe can so that we can move forward on a conference to send something to \nthe President that he can review.\n  Again, we have the stimulus package that we have to deal with, and we \nare going to do that. That is why I made the announcement last night \nthat we are going to have to do some work on Monday. We are going to \nhave votes on Monday. They won't be early in the day, but we will have \nvotes on Monday. Whatever we are working on, we will try to work Monday \nso that we can have some votes Monday night, so there will likely be \nmore than one vote Monday night.\n  Tuesday, we are going to have to work. We really do need to complete \nthis work on the foreign intelligence legislation quickly. Whatever we \ndo on\n\n[[Page S460]]\n\nthe stimulus, we also need to do that quickly. Again, whether we come \nup with our own package here in the Senate, whether we accept what the \nHouse has done, or do nothing, it is not fair to the American people, \nthe other body, and the President not to take action that would be \nfairly quick, and we are going to attempt to do that, both dealing with \nthe FISA legislation and the stimulus package.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/30/senate-section/article/S460-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise in morning business today to talk \nabout the so-called economic stimulus package we will be dealing with \nin this body over the next few weeks. I think the Presiding Officer \nknows that it is very seldom that I come to this floor to speak. I try \nto only speak when I have something to say. I realize that today, I am \nprobably a voice in the wilderness and probably will be over the next \nfew weeks.\n  As are many Americans, all Americans who are familiar with being \naround railroads, I know a freight train when I see it coming. I \nrealize the action taken yesterday in the House, by overwhelming \nmajority sending over to our body a stimulus package to deal with--I \nrealize the winds are blowing, and the fact is that the winds are \nblowing in the direction of a stimulus package.\n  I am honored to serve in this body. I know that, contrary to much of \nwhat the American public thinks, there are many things that happen on \nthis floor that actually show greatness of this body and greatness of \nindividuals.\n  I have seen on this floor both the majority leader and the minority \nleader do things to cause something good to happen for our country. \nWhen I have seen that happen--and most of the time it happens under the \nradar screen--I have tried to go to them and thank them for taking the \npositions they did, even if it was a private position to make something \ngood happen. I have seen other Senators take politically courageous \nvotes that were maybe not in their own best political interests but \nwere in the country's interests, and I have tried, too, on those \noccasions when I have recognized that, to go up and thank them for what \nthey have done. Then, on the other hand, I have also seen occasions \nwhen we in this body just bow to the political winds and do things that \nare expedient because they are expedient, even though in our hearts we \nknow they are really not best for our country.\n  Today, all across America, there are young people, young children \ngathered in classrooms, and they are learning in those classrooms that \nwhich will equip them to be productive in life. They are learning not \njust about facts and figures, but they are also learning about \ncharacter. They have teachers whom they look up to. They have parents, \nhopefully, whom they go home to and look up to, coaches and others, \nSunday school teachers, and hopefully some of the people whom they look \nup to from time to time are us in this body.\n  I know that right now in our country we are going through tremendous \neconomic turmoil as it relates to the markets in general. I think most \nof us know that it is due to excesses that have taken place in the \nmarketplace, that in our country and in this world we have business \ncycles that exist. That is what happens in a free market society such \nas we have. Those excesses work themselves out, and over time, we begin \nbuilding again.\n  I know in the process of these excesses that in some ways they are \nbeyond the control of the average citizen, and there are people in this \ncountry who are hurting. I know they are. My heart goes out to people \nacross this country who find themselves in economic situations that in \nmany cases are beyond their control. They have to do with markets. They \nhave to do with the way we ourselves have conducted ourselves as it \nrelates to fiscal policy. They have to do with things that are \nhappening in other parts of the world. I truly feel for people who go \nhome at night with tremendous economic distress. I am also always \nhappy--just honestly always happy--when I see Americans receive refunds \nfrom the Federal Government. That is a good thing, and I am happy for \npeople when that occurs. I really mean that.\n  But in this backdrop, I must say that I find it so odd that today in \nAmerica we would consider a stimulus package, a package that in essence \nis built on sprinkling money around America and then encouraging people \nto quickly spend that money to ignite an economic stimulus in this \ncountry. I doubt there are many people in this body--there may be some, \nand I don't want to in any way criticize anybody because I know there \nare some who may believe the stimulus package that came from the House \nyesterday really is going to do some good. There are some, and I \nunderstand that, but I bet there are not many in this body who believe \nsprinkling money around America and asking people to spend it is going \nto do much, is going to do much to affect the long-term status of this \neconomy.\n  But what I see happening is, all of a sudden, in the name of \nbipartisanship--and I want to say I have been excited to see \nbipartisanship taken up, and I want to put on the record that I have \nexercised, as the Presiding Officer has, bipartisanship in many cases \nto try to make something good happen. But in the name of \nbipartisanship, what has happened is we have come--what has come out of \nthe House is a bipartisan bill in the name of economic stimulus that to \nme is--and I hate to be this crass--nothing more than political \nstimulus.\n  I hope this body will have the responsibility and the character to \ndeal with our economic situations over the long haul. It may be that \nthis body takes up this stimulus package, and it may be that this body \nmakes changes, and it may be that this body actually passes a stimulus \npackage that is similar to what came out of the House. But what I see \nin this package is nothing but a political stimulus. It is a stimulus \nto make the American people think that we as a body are doing something \nto actually cause the economy to be stronger.\n  So at this moment, I fear we are going through one of those moments \nwhere I am less encouraged about what might happen, but I am hoping \nthat somehow or another, we will deal with this in an appropriate way.\n  I think all of us know in our country that we together have been \nfiscally reckless over the last several years. I think we know that \ngenerations who come after us will be dealing with the brunt of our \nactions. Not to be misunderstood, I am a strong believer in low taxes \nand creating a structure in this country that people can count on to \nmove ahead and to make investments, but with that has to be the reality \nthat spending has to be under control. Yet there is always a reason in \nthis body and in the other body to spend money we do not have. I can go\n\n[[Page S461]]\n\nback and cite example after example, and for some reason I sense that \ntoday we are in another one of those situations.\n\n  I know this package is going to change, and I know some of the \ncomponents of this package cannot be calculated exactly this way, but \nwhat I would like to say is, if you take $150 billion and spent the \nmoney today--I look at these pages on the floor who have come here so \nexcited about their work. I want them to know that actually we in this \nbody will never deal, in my generation, with paying for the $150 \nbillion. The next generation might, but I doubt it. It will actually be \n$329 billion in 20 years at present rates, and in the generation after \nthat, $722 billion.\n  I know my time is drawing to a close. I know I am probably a voice in \nthe wilderness. I am very discouraged about the wind I see blowing at \nthis time. I am very discouraged about a package I think many people, \nif not most in this body, doubt is going to have any long-term effect \non our economy. So I ask that my colleagues consider this, my \ncolleagues with whom I enjoy serving: No. 1, that we call this package \nfor what it is, a political stimulus package; that we begin today \ndealing in a bipartisan way with the tough decisions we have to make, \nand if there are anomalies out there we need to deal with where people \nare truly being hurt, let's deal with them; that we adopt the Conrad-\nGregg bill to truly deal with long-term entitlements; and that we ask \nthe administration, when they bring their budget forth on February 4, \nto bring forth a real budget that lays out to the American people the \ndeficits we will have to deal with in the future.\n  This country has been built on sacrifice. It has been built on us and \ngenerations before us making tough decisions and making sacrifice. I \nhope this body, in a bipartisan way, will do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I begin my remarks this morning by \naddressing the points made at the close of Senator Corker's remarks. \nThe Senator talked about the need to look at some of our long-term \nbudget problems--Social Security, Medicare, and even our tax structure. \nThere are areas where we can see that the Tax Code is not as simple or \nstraightforward as we want it to be, where we know there are imbalances \nin the Medicare program, and where we need to address how we are going \nto pay for future generations who will be retiring.\n  These are tough and long-term important problems with which we need \nto deal. Senator Corker mentioned bipartisan legislation that I have \ncosponsored by Senators Gregg of New Hampshire and Senator Kent Conrad \nof North Dakota to create a bipartisan commission to look hard at these \nissues. The result will not just be another report. Instead, it will \nactually prepare legislative recommendations that will be brought to \nCongress to get an up-or-down vote.\n  Sometimes that kind of an approach is the best way of dealing with \nwhat appear to be intractable problems because such a structure can \ngenerate consensus and in some ways force Congress to take action, even \nif the short-term political issues might discourage action.\n  I hope that this approach will be adopted. I hope it is an approach \nthat will make an impact because, as I have spoken on the Senate floor \nand at home in New Hampshire, these are long-term issues that have to \nbe addressed. It takes leadership, but it also takes consensus.\n  The one point we also have consensus on in the country right now, and \ncertainly in New Hampshire, is that we have witnessed a weaker economy \nover the last 6 to 12 months. In New Hampshire, just as in any other \npart of the country, that is felt first by families, by working \nfamilies who see the slower growth, families who feel the pinch of \nhigher energy prices, families who see credit tightening and are \nstruggling to deal with that slowdown.\n  We are the strongest country in the world, the strongest economy in \nthe world, but that does not make us immune from the economic cycle. \nWhen we see an economic slowdown, we understand we cannot necessarily \nturn the economy around instantly, but we need to take action. We need \nto lay the groundwork for near-term economic growth and the groundwork \nfor long-term economic growth. That is what we need to focus on as we \ndebate an economic growth package in the Senate.\n  We have begun to act with a housing modernization bill, commonly \nreferred to as FHA modernization, that will help States and homeowners \nmodify their mortgages, stay in their homes, deal with the slowdown in \nreal estate prices and reduce the impact of the credit crisis on home \nownership. We passed that bill in the Senate last month. The House has \nalso passed its version. This is an area where we need to act quickly \nto resolve the differences between the two versions and send it to the \nPresident for signature.\n  The issue of timeliness is going to come back on us again and again \nas we debate this economic package because the one thing we understand \nand know about any economic package is that if it is going to have an \nimpact, it needs to be done in a timely way. It should focus on the \nnear term. It should include provisions we believe will have an \nimmediate impact on investment and growth, and it should be temporary.\n  We know that we have to deal with long-term problems about which the \nSenator from Tennessee spoke, but we also understand the impact that \nthe slowdown is having. We can put together a package that meets the \nfollowing criteria: focuses on the next 12 months, encourages \ninvestment and economic growth, and is done in a timely way.\n\n  What should the main provisions of an economic growth package be? It \nshould put money into the pockets of families and do it through a tax \nrebate. People pay taxes. At the end of the day, every dollar of \nrevenue that is collected by the Federal Government ultimately started \nwith an individual, a family, a worker, whether it is excise taxes on \ngasoline or income taxes. Even the taxes we levy on businesses \nultimately are passed through to consumers in the products and services \nthose corporations sell. As I said, people pay taxes. It is not a \nmistake to allow a family to keep a little bit more of what they earn, \nto give them a rebate over the next 12 months to help deal with those \nenergy prices, help deal with their mortgage payments or help invest in \nitems that will make for a better quality of life for them and their \nchildren. This needs to be part of this growth package.\n  Business investment also needs to be a part of this growth package. \nIn New Hampshire, that means small businesses. They are the ones that \nprovide jobs, cover their employees with health care, and are \nresponsible for most of the investment in New Hampshire and across the \ncountry. I think one of the most important provisions that is being \ndiscussed in this growth package is a way to encourage those small \nbusinesses across the country to make new investments in their plant, \nimprove productivity, make investments in their employees, and create \nnew jobs. Jobs are not created in Washington; they are created across \nthe country. Businesses large and small put up capital, take a risk, \nhire that new worker, train that new worker. That is where the \ndifference is made. This package needs to include very real and \nmeaningful incentives for those businesses to spend, build, create new \njobs, and improve productivity.\n  If we are going to have any impact, though, we cannot stand in \nWashington and debate. We need to act in a timely way. This cannot be \ndone over a 4-month, 5-month or 6-month protracted debate. If it takes \nthat long, it will be too late to have any impact.\n  Congress does not often act in a timely way. We know that; we \nunderstand that. The key to getting something done soon is to work in a \nbipartisan way. That means compromise. That means everyone will not \nhave everything in the package they might like to have. We cannot have \n535 Members of Congress all writing their own economic growth package. \nWe do have the basis for a bipartisan agreement in legislation that has \npassed the other body by a very strong bipartisan vote, with Democrats \nand Republicans supporting the two core principles I talked\n\n[[Page S462]]\n\nabout: tax relief for families and individuals and encouraging business \ninvestment for small businesses and larger firms that are creating jobs \nevery day.\n  A bipartisan approach has to be the way this issue is addressed in \nthe Senate. We all understand the rules of the Senate allow unlimited \ndebate and unlimited amendments. This is one case where we need to \nexercise a little bit of discipline, where we need to exercise a little \nbit of common sense. We cannot have every Senator offering three, four \nor five different provisions to this legislation. The bill would \ncollapse under the weight. By delaying passage and implementation, we \nmake it much more difficult for anything we do to have a positive \nimpact.\n  I hope, as the debate moves forward, we work to keep this growth \npackage in line with the bipartisan agreement that has been \nestablished, the framework that has been put together. Such a process \ndoes not mean we will not have an opportunity to debate the package or \neven make some modifications. If we go astray, if we let our own egos \nand personal needs drive this debate, we will not get this legislation \ndone, and the American people will look at the institution of Congress \nyet again and be frustrated at its inability to act in a bipartisan \nway, at our inability to act in a timely way, and our inability to take \nthe steps necessary to make a difference in our economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time remains on our \nside?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 9 minutes 37 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wish to express my agreement with the \nwise words of the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire and expand \non the theme he spoke to, along with the Senator from Tennessee \nearlier.\n  When I was younger and was going to college, I thought I wanted to \nbecome a doctor, but that was until I encountered organic chemistry and \nphysics, and that persuaded me that maybe there was something else out \nthere for me to do. But I did learn about the Hippocratic oath which is \nwhat the medical profession takes, this oath basically to first do no \nharm. I think that ought to be something that guides us as we look at \nhow do we deal with this impending challenge with regard to our \neconomic situation.\n  I do think we have started off in a very strong way, and I express my \ncongratulations to Speaker Pelosi, Republican Leader Boehner, and \nSecretary of Treasury Hank Paulson for the work they have done which \nmet with as close to universal approval on a bipartisan basis as you \ncan get in the House of Representatives for what the Speaker has called \na targeted, temporary, and timely economic stimulus. That will \nhopefully allow us to avoid a recession and, of course, all the fallout \nthat would result from that recession, including people out of work and \nobviously negatively affecting the quality of life for a lot of \nAmericans, including my constituents in Texas.\n  We have to look at this as both a short-term issue and a long-term \nissue. I hope the kind of bipartisan cooperation and the movement we \nhave seen will start a trend. I am encouraged, as my colleagues have \nalready heard, by some of the work that is being done on a long-term \nbasis by Senator Kent Conrad and Senator Judd Gregg, both the chairman \nand the ranking member of the Budget Committee on which I serve, to \ndeal with the impending long-term crisis of entitlement spending. If we \ndo not do anything in the next 30 years, the only programs that we will \nhave money to spend on as part of the Federal Government is Medicaid, \nMedicare, and other entitlement spending, plus the interest on the \nnational debt. That is it. We will not have any money to spend on \nnational defense, research, innovation, education, and other programs \nthat are very important to the continued prosperity and future of our \ncountry.\n  That is a looming disaster out on the horizon I hope we will respond \nto. We cannot afford to take the year off in Congress because we know \nwe are in an election cycle. We have a Presidential election coming up \nin November, and a third of this body will stand for election as \nwell. But as the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, has pointed out, \nwe have had an election every 2 years since 1788 in this country--we \nare going to have another one in November--and we can't use that as an \nexcuse for simply sitting back and becoming spectators rather than \nactive participants in trying to solve the challenges on the economic, \nsecurity, and all other fronts on both a near-term basis and a long-\nterm basis.\n\n  Of course, there are other things we need to do to be able to restore \npublic confidence in the U.S. Congress and Government, and one of the \nthings you will be hearing more about is the proposal that we will be \nmaking for a 2-year budget, the idea being that, as we saw last year, \non an annual budget we basically spend all year in the appropriations \nprocess with very little opportunity for oversight of this huge \nbureaucracy--the executive branch of the Federal Government. And \nwithout oversight, we know bad things can happen. Perhaps with \noversight bad things can happen, but we cannot be asleep at the switch \nwhen it comes to the oversight responsibilities we have for the Federal \nGovernment and Federal spending.\n  One example I wish to point out is something my colleagues have heard \nme comment on before, and it is a Web site called expectmore.gov. I \nhope people who are hearing what I am saying here today will take the \nopportunity to look at this expectmore.gov Web site created to \ndemonstrate the review by the Office of Management and Budget of over \n1,000 Federal Government programs. What they found out is that 22 \npercent of those programs either are ineffective or else--what may be \neven worse--they weren't able to tell one way or the other whether they \nwere effective, as Congress intended. That is 22 percent of 1,000 \ndifferent programs. Yet Congress has done virtually nothing to \neliminate those ineffective programs or to make sure those that could \nbe improved and could be effective are in fact improved and the \nproblems corrected. I hope we would use this as an opportunity to deal \nwith our budgetary problems both in the near term and the long term.\n  I have proposed another initiative, based on the sunset commission \nthat exists in my State, and exists in a number of other States, where \nperiodically we would go back and look at the very reason for the \nexistence of Federal programs. In my State, the sunset commission has \nbeen very effective in allowing the State legislature to look at \nprograms--government programs--to determine whether they are still \nneeded and to start at a zero-based budget and force these agencies to \njustify their budget, rather than what happens here in Washington, \nwhich is that things tend to grow and grow and grow and develop their \nown constituency, and then a bureaucracy that has a vested interest in \ntheir growth and proliferation, and there is very little impetus, very \nlittle pressure on Congress to eliminate ineffective and unnecessary \nprograms.\n  I hope we will continue this early spirit of bipartisan cooperation \non the emergency stimulus package that came out of the House, and we \nwill do more to carry on this trend when it comes to dealing with our \nmid- and long-term economic problems, not for ourselves but for our \nchildren and for our grandchildren.\n  There are things in the economic stimulus package that came out of \nthe House that I have some questions about. But I do agree it is \nimportant for confidence building in the markets and to demonstrate we \nare actually capable of acting when action is required that we act on a \ntimely basis to pass this House-passed measure. I believe there were \nonly 35 votes against the House stimulus package yesterday, and as I \nsaid earlier, that represents overwhelming bipartisan support for this \nnegotiated product.\n  I know there are Members of the Senate, myself included, who have \nsome other ideas about what we might be able to offer to improve that. \nThe problem is, as we all know, under the rules of the Senate it is \nbasically a free-for-all once that bill comes to the Senate floor, and \nthere can be numerous amendments, there can be filibusters and other \ndelays, which I think are dangerous indeed when a timely response is \ncalled for in terms of this targeted, temporary stimulus package.\n\n[[Page S463]]\n\nMy conclusion is I think we are better off and the country is better \noff in the long run showing that we can act on a prompt basis by \npassing the House version.\n  Now, that does not mean we can take the rest of the year off or we \ndon't have to be responsive to other concerns that arise, as I have \nindicated earlier. If there are other things we need to do, then I \nthink there are other opportunities for us to do them. But I do think \nit is important early on in the year to demonstrate our commitment to \nworking together to solve America's problems.\n  I saw a poll the other day that said 98 percent of the respondents \nwere sick and tired of the bickering and the partisanship they see in \nCongress. I am shocked anybody would have to take a poll to conclude \nthat, and why it wasn't 100 percent rather than 98 percent. But here is \na chance for us to act, and I hope we will act in the short term to \ndeal with this economic challenge we face in the markets, but then in \nthe long term to make sure that the prosperity we have enjoyed, thanks \nto our parents and grandparents, will be handed down to our children \nand grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor up to 7 minutes as in morning business and to maintain the existing \n30 minutes for the majority side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I commend Senator Cornyn on his remarks, \nand I want to add that I too think it is important to address the \nstimulus package that has come from the House quickly and decisively. I \nfall in the category of one of those who has some other ideas as well, \nbut I think while the iron is hot and while we do have a surgical and \nstrategic proposal before us, we should act.\n  Immediate action can make a large difference in when the infusion \ncomes back into the economy, when the tax breaks can be taken advantage \nof by business in terms of depreciation and expensing, and in \nparticular for the housing market, the increased loan limits for Fannie \nMae, Freddie Mac, and FHA loans will be essential in saving some houses \nin foreclosure and those ultimately facing foreclosure, because they \nwill be purchased by people who will qualify under the new loan limits \nand who will be able to take that loan and make it a performing asset.\n  It is to that subject I want to talk for a second. Experience is a \ngreat teacher. There is an old saying if a cat sits on a hot stove, it \nwill never sit on a hot stove again. Of course, they never sit on a \ncold stove; they just get out of the business of sitting on stoves. In \nmy experience in the private sector as a businessman, for years I was \nin the real estate business in the 1970s, in particular, in the period \nof time between 1968, as a matter of fact, and 1999. In the mid 1970s, \nthe United States faced a housing crisis almost identical to what is \nabout to happen in this country today. In 1973 and 1974, we had a huge \nhousing boom, with increasing values, where credit got easier, loan \nlimits got higher, and underwriting got lower. What ended up happening \nwas that a lot of bad loans were made. In that particular period of \ntime, many were to homebuilders rather than homeowners. But suffice it \nto say it was the same underwriting problem and the same deficiency in \nterms of loans. A plethora of foreclosures took place, new homes went \nback, and the United States found itself in 1975 in a recession with a \n3-year supply of single-family houses on the market, unsold and with no \nhousing market.\n\n  The President and the Congress took action. They passed a $6,000 tax \ncredit, where a family could collect $2,000 a year for 3 years if they \npurchased any standing new home in inventory and occupied it during \nthose 3 years. Within the course of a year, we had reduced as a country \na 3-year supply of housing to a 1-year supply of housing. We had \nreinvigorated the construction trade, the subcontractors, the building \nsuppliers, those who manufactured carpet, washing machines, dryers, and \nall the components so important in the overall economy that are spurred \nby a home purchase.\n  Yesterday, I introduced, along with Senator Gregg, Senator Craig, \nSenator Allard, and Senator Chambliss, S. 2566, calling for us to \nrepeat history in this country, to reenergize the housing market that \nis so sluggish, at a strategic time. We can save houses in pending \nforeclosure from actually being foreclosed upon and turn them into \noccupied single-family dwellings. Very simply, S. 2566 would do the \nfollowing:\n  It would provide a $15,000 tax credit--$5,000 for 3 years--to any \nindividual, couple, or two people living together filing separately, if \nthey purchased and occupied as their home any single-family dwelling on \nthe market that was: A, a new home permitted for construction before \nSeptember 1 of 2007 and now vacant; B, a home that has been foreclosed \non that was owner occupied and is now in an REO--real estate-owned--\ncategory of any lender, bank, or financial institution; and, C, any \nproperty pending foreclosure that is owner occupied.\n  We all know from reading the paper that foreclosures are going up in \ngeometric proportions. What is about to happen in the first quarter of \nthis year is the largest realm of foreclosures that has taken place in \nthis country in years. What is going to go into the second quarter of \nthis year is those banks being told by regulators they have to get rid \nof that inventory, that they can't keep it on their books, and banks \nand lenders are going to do what they have always done. They are going \nto get rid of them by deeply discounting the prices to try to get \npeople to come and buy those houses.\n  Now, what that does to Mr. and Mrs. America who live in a house \nmaking their payments is it depresses the value of their house, it \nlowers their home equity line of credit available because the value has \ngone down, and it stagnates the very consumer the economy has depended \non over the last decade for the longest protracted period of growth in \nour history.\n  I come to the floor today to ask all the Members of the Senate to \ntake a look at S. 2566, to take a hard look at it, and to make sure \nthey look back at the history of 1975, when we faced almost an \nidentical problem, took the strategic action this bill recommends, and \nhad a result that was absolutely right for the economy and right for \nthe American homeowner.\n  I understand all kind of incentives, I understand giving money back, \nI understand trying to send people to do things, but there is nothing \nbetter than helping to make the No. 1 investment every American family \nwants to make. An incentive to do that, at a time that very market is \nin trouble, is one of the keys to seeing to it that whatever lies ahead \nfor us in our economy is a much lower trough, and maybe even a peak, \nwhere we at the right time strategically invest in the American family, \nin homeownership, and take those houses in ownership by lenders and put \nthem in the ownership of families.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time, and I suggest \nthe absence of quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is almost 2 o'clock. This afternoon, as \nI understand it, the Senate Finance Committee is beginning to convene \nand to gather to debate the economic stimulus package which has come \nover to us from the House and to see what changes, if any, we might \nwant to make in the Senate. I wish them good luck and Godspeed.\n  If you look at the history of stimulus packages in this country--I \ncame to the House in 1982, was here for a while, went off to be \nGovernor of my State, and came back at the beginning of this decade. \nBut the history of stimulus packages is, sometimes we seem to pass \nthem, and we have passed them after some delay. We have passed them \nactually after we have not only gotten into a recession, but we were \nactually coming out of a recession. And rather than being helpful as \nyou go into a recession, turning things around, the stimulus package \ncan be inflationary, an after-the-fact thought, and not all that \ntimely, not all that helpful.\n  When we hear advice from economists and others on putting together a \nstimulus package, we hear the three Ts. The first of those is \n``timely.'' And the House has acted in a very timely way, working with \nthe administration, to put together a package, not a bad package. I \ncommend Speaker Pelosi and Secretary Paulson for the work they have \ndone. It is not a perfect package, but I do not know that any of us \ncould draw up a package that would be.\n  It is timely. It has come to us expeditiously. It has come to us on a \nday on which I believe the Federal Reserve is meeting to discuss \nwhether they might want to lower the Federal funds rate by another \nquarter or half a percent on top of the three-quarters of a point \nreduction they adopted actually a week and a half ago.\n  A second piece of advice we have always gotten from economists and \npolicy wonks on recession stimulus packages is, not only should it be \ntimely, but it should be targeted; that is, the money should go to \nthose places where the money will not simply be taken by whoever \nreceives the benefit of a stimulus package and save more money, but \nwould actually take the money and put it back into the economy to help \nget the economy moving.\n  I heard earlier today some discussions going on in the Budget \nCommittee. One of the witnesses was saying he was rather skeptical and \ndubious of a stimulus package and said it is like the Federal \nGovernment borrowing money and taking that money out of one pocket and \nputting it in the other.\n  If we simply take the money from a stimulus package that the Federal \nGovernment might try to infuse into the economy, we give it to people \nwho put it into their pockets who are just going to save the money, I \ndo not know that we do a whole lot of good in stimulating the economy. \nThat is not to say we do not need to save more money in this country of \nours; we do. But I am not sure in the near term that is going to help \nmove the economy. So the idea behind this stimulus package is, it ought \nto go to folks who need the money, who will spend the money. In some \ncases people are desperate for the money, people who might be desperate \nto feed their families, desperate to pay their heating bills in the \nwinter. But they are going to take that money, whatever it might be, \nand infuse it, put it back into the economy quickly.\n  The third T that we have heard a whole lot about is the T for \n``temporary,'' the notion here being that we face a significant budget \ndeficit. We do not want to prolong that or make it worse long term. We \ndo not want to dig an even deeper hole than we are in as a result. We \nwant the stimulus package to be of a temporary nature, to help us avoid \na dip, avoid a recession if we can. And if we are going to have one, to \nmake it shorter than would otherwise be the case.\n  The package that has come to us from the House has a good deal \nrecommended. I have never been wild about tax rebates, but I think I \nsupported one back in the earlier part of this decade about 3, 4, 5 \nyears ago. But the package that we have on tax rebates from the House \nactually is pretty well targeted.\n  As I recall, there is maybe a $1,200 rebate that would go to folks, \nto a family, if you have two bread winners in the family. For an \nindividual, it would be $600. There is a cap if your income is above a \ncertain level, maybe $150,000 for a family, about half that or so for \nan individual. If your income is above those levels, you don't receive \nthe rebate. We can quarrel whether $150,000 is too high or too low. It \nis what it is. It is better than having no cap at all. There are some \nwho believe we should simply send out a rebate to everybody, $1,200 for \na family and $600 for an individual. The problem with doing that is, it \nis little bit akin to taking money from the Federal Government out of \none pocket and putting it into the pocket of another family who is not \ngoing to spend the money. They are not going to put the money back into \nthe economy. They may save it. That is all well and good, but it is not \ngoing to do much to stimulate the economy.\n  My hope is the Finance Committee will decide we will have a rebate \nand make sure it is targeted to those folks who are the most in need of \nsome financial help and that any tax rebate we do reflects that. We had \neconomists in recent weeks who have said to us, in testimony and other \npublic forums, we can actually gauge what bang for the buck we get out \nof Federal stimulus dollars. We are told that if we actually put money \ninto extending unemployment benefits, we get about a buck 75 for every \ndollar of stimulus we provide. If we put that money toward folks to \nincrease slightly their food stamps, it is about the same. For every \ndollar we put into that, we get about a buck 75. We don't get quite \nthat kind of return on a tax rebate, particularly if there is no cap. \nIf there is a cap and the money is directed toward lower income folks, \nit is a better bang for the buck than would otherwise be the case.\n  My hope is that as the Finance Committee considers what kind of \npackage to put together, they will make sure there is some kind of \nreasonable cap on any tax rebate we send out.\n  With respect to unemployment benefits, it makes a lot of sense to \nextend unemployment benefits, but I would target them. I would \nespecially target them to States where levels of unemployment are high. \nI think about Ohio. My heart is still with the Buckeyes. They are going \nthrough a tough time. As to the folks up in Michigan, I am a huge \nDetroit Tigers fan, but I also care about the people there and other \nplaces where unemployment rates are 8, 10 percent and where people are \nin some desperate straits. I hope we would target the unemployment \nbenefits that we will extend, whether it is 13 weeks or 26 weeks, to \nparticular places such as those States. For States that are enjoying \neconomic good times, where the rate of unemployment might be 2 or 3 or \n4 percent, we ought to be careful about extending unemployment \nbenefits. Certainly, 26 weeks doesn't make a lot of sense to me in \nthose cases. Under current law, people are already eligible for 26 \nweeks of benefits, and in places\n\n[[Page S465]]\n\nof low unemployment, I don't think it makes sense to add another 26 \nweeks on top of that. If we had unlimited dollars, that would be well \nand good. But we have a deficit. It is getting bigger. The idea would \nbe to target it accordingly.\n  The same thing with food stamps. In a perfect world, I would actually \nnot argue for having food stamps as part of a stimulus package, even \nthough we know it is actually a pretty good stimulus, and there is a \nneed out there. Last fall, we debated in the Senate, as they did in the \nHouse, a farm bill. A big part of the farm bill is not just aid to \nfarmers or conservation funding for farmers to conserve open spaces. It \nis not just helping commodity crops or specialty crops. A big part is \nnutrition funding, which includes food stamps. I would not say we are \nclose to reaching a compromise between the House and Senate on the farm \nbill, but my hope is we will get there within a couple months. If we \nare going to end up including in the stimulus package some provisions \ndealing with food stamps, I hope we would not make it a long time. I \nthink you could argue for maybe a 3 months' provision. We could come \nback and extend that if we wanted to, maybe at most 6 months. But I \nwould urge us not to go much beyond that. What we should do is finish \nour work on the farm bill, work out a compromise between the House and \nSenate, something the President will sign, and address nutritional \nneeds as part of the stimulus package we are talking about. With \nrespect to food stamps, do that in the farm bill, not in the stimulus \npackage. If we are going to do it in the stimulus, do it for several \nmonths, not a year or more.\n  The Federal Reserve has already done us a big favor in cutting the \nFed funds rate, the rate of interest banks charge when they lend money \nto one another overnight. They dropped it down by three-quarters of a \npercentage point. That has an immediate effect, a significant effect. \nIt sends a very hopeful signal not just to markets but to households \nand all kinds of folks who are in businesses needing credit. I commend \nthe Federal Reserve. My hope is they take it a little further today and \nlop off another quarter percent. I don't know that they will do more \nthan that, but that would be welcome.\n  In a way, we overestimate the importance of a stimulus package that \nwe adopt. We spend a lot of time wringing our hands and trying to get \nit right, working out a compromise between all the different sides. In \nthe end, the impact of our package from the Congress and the White \nHouse is actually modest compared to the impact you get from a cut in \nthe Fed funds rate by the Federal Reserve of a full percentage point.\n  I close with maybe two or three points to keep in mind. One, in \nputting together a stimulus package, make it targeted, timely, \ntemporary. Two, to do no harm, for us not to do something that is \nfoolish. I would suggest that a tax rebate that goes to Warren Buffett \nand Bill Gates and the wealthiest people doesn't make a whole lot of \nsense in an age when the budget deficit is approaching $250 billion. \nLet's not do anything foolish, do no harm. And three, maybe one of the \nbest things that can come out of a stimulus is to convey to the folks \nwho are struggling or having a tough time making ends meet, maybe \naren't very hopeful, that we can work together. Even in an election \nyear, a lot of politics in the air, we can set differences aside and \ncome together on a package which makes sense, which will be helpful to \na lot of folks and to either help us avoid a recession or maybe make it \nmore shallow and of shorter duration.\n  Among the pieces of the House package that I thought were most \nmeritorious was some stuff people don't think about very much. One of \nthem deals with something called GSEs, government-sponsored \nenterprises. There are about three that I think a fair amount about. \nOne is Fannie Mae. The other is Freddie Mac. The other is the Federal \nHome Loan Bank system which raises money for lending for home \nownership. There is a proposal that would allow the government-\nsponsored enterprises, the big financial behemoths of Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac, to have larger mortgages in their portfolio than they are \ncurrently allowed. I think they are currently allowed roughly $400,000, \nand there is a suggestion that they be able to take on loans to \n$700,000 or so. That is fine to do for a short period. I don't think we \nshould make it permanent. I don't think we should do it even for a \nyear. The reason is, we need to come back and provide a strong \nindependent regulator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. If we simply make \nthis change to allow them to put larger mortgages in their portfolio, \nit is a little bit like saying you, eat your dessert, but you don't \nhave to eat your vegetables.\n\n  That is all well and good. They would like to be able to buy larger \nhome mortgages and put them in their portfolios, high-cost places such \nas California and some places in the Northeast, but at the same time \nthey need to eat their vegetables, and they need to have a strong, \nindependent regulator who will be there to set the right kind of \ncapital standards and to ride herd on these entities to make sure they \ndon't get into trouble and, by doing so, get the rest of us in trouble.\n  The other thing we need to do--and I don't think it is part of the \nbill the House has sent us, but it might be--deals with FHA, the \nFederal Housing Administration. FHA is 75 years old this year. \nSometimes people wonder, where did we ever get this 30-year fixed rate \nmortgage that people could prepay. Where did it come from? It came from \nthe FHA. It has been around a long time. FHA was the birthplace of what \nwe think of as the traditional mortgage. The FHA, as recently as a \ndozen or so years ago, was involved in mortgages that went to maybe 20 \npercent of the homes being bought and sold. Twenty percent used FHA. \nToday it is about 5 percent. The difference between that 20 percent and \nthat 5 percent for the most part is people have gone into the subprime \nmarket, and they have gotten these adjustable ARM mortgages.\n  People have been lured by teaser rates. Now these adjustable ARMs are \nresetting. It might have been a teaser rate of 2, 3, 4 percent. They \nare now going at 7, 8, 9 percent. The folks who got into these exotic \nmortgages are finding they can't refinance, and they are stuck with \nsome kind of significant penalty or maybe being stuck altogether. What \nwe need to do is bring the FHA of the 20th century into the 21st \ncentury and make it relevant for folks looking to buy a house today. We \npassed legislation in the Senate. They are actually not that far apart. \nWe reduced the amount of downpayment from 3 percent to 1.5 percent for \nan FHA loan on a home mortgage. And we do some things. We require folks \nto get the kind of counseling they need. We do a better job on reverse \nmortgages. When people are old and their houses are basically paid for, \nthey can actually live on the equity of their home for the rest of \ntheir lives. The idea would be to make those more readily available to \npeople who could use that kind of help later in their lives.\n  There are a variety of other changes in the FHA that need to be made \nto make it relevant for today. Those are examples of some.\n  As much as anything that we would do in the stimulus package that is \nbeing debated right now in the Finance Committee, we need to come to \nclosure on reauthorizing the FHA and bringing it into the 21st century. \nWhile we are doing that, we need to go ahead and raise the cap on the \namount of loans, the size of the loans and mortgages that can be bought \nand put into the portfolios of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but only for \n6 months, with the idea that between now and 6 months from now, the \nHouse and Senate will hammer out a compromise, signed by the President, \nthat will provide for a strong, independent regulator for Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac, for Federal Home Loan Banks. If we do all that, we \nwill convey not just a sense of hope, but we will do something that \ngoes beyond a mere stimulus for a couple months. We will address the \nunderlying problem that got us into this mess, the subprime lending \nmess in the first place because what we will do is say to the folks who \nhave marginal credit, who otherwise would maybe have to rely on these \nexotic mortgages, these adjustable ARMs, instead of having to rely on \nsomething such as that, they can rely on the FHA, as people have done \nfor a generation, because we have made it relevant for your lives and \nfor your needs.\n  That is the view from Delaware today. My hope is some of that will be\n\n[[Page S466]]\n\nprevailing later today in the Senate Finance Committee, and we will \nhave an opportunity to take it up and debate it tonight and tomorrow.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask to speak as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. We are in morning business. The \nSenator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I think it is clear to the vast majority \nof the American people, if not to the President of the United States, \nthat the middle class in our country is shrinking; tens of millions of \npeople are working longer hours for low wages; workers today are \ngetting into their cars and are paying outrageously high prices for a \ngallon of gas; that senior citizens in the State of Vermont can't \nafford the skyrocketing costs of home heating fuel; and that at this \nparticular moment in our history, with poverty increasing and the \nmiddle class shrinking and our economy in serious trouble, it is \nabsolutely imperative that we pass an economic stimulus package. The \nbottom line is not just passing a package but passing a good package.\n  I think there are some positive aspects of the bill that came from \nthe House. I think from what we are hearing, the Senate Finance \nCommittee is going to make that bill even stronger. But the main point \nI want to make this afternoon is that when we pass an economic stimulus \nbill, we have to get it right. It has to be fair. It has to have the \nimpact of rejuvenating our economy and helping those people in need.\n  Later this afternoon, as the Presiding Officer knows, the Senate \nFinance Committee will be voting on what I believe is, for the most \npart, an improved version of the economic stimulus bill that came from \nthe House. I think it is right that the Finance Committee bill includes \nan extension in unemployment insurance for 13 weeks in all States and \nan additional 26 weeks in States with high unemployment. That is \nobviously the right thing to do, because people who lose their jobs, \npeople whose unemployment compensation expires, are people in desperate \nneed. Those are the people we need to help. From an economic stimulus \npoint of view, those people will take that money, spend it, and help \nstimulate our economy.\n  I am also pleased that the Finance Committee extended the rebates to \n20 million senior citizens who don't earn income, and that was \ncertainly a major lack in the bill that passed the House. There are \nmillions and millions and millions of senior citizens in this country \nhanging on, on low fixed incomes, getting their Social Security check \nevery month, but having a very difficult time making ends meet, \nespecially with health care costs rising, heating fuel costs rising, \nprescription drug costs rising. Those people need help. It is \nabsolutely imperative that if we pass an economic stimulus package, it \nmust include our senior citizens as well. I applaud the chairman of the \nFinance Committee for including that provision in the bill.\n  Furthermore, I am strongly in agreement with the proposed package \ncoming out of the Senate Finance Committee that low-income Americans \nwho pay Social Security and Medicare taxes should also receive the same \nrebate as somebody who is earning $50,000, $60,000, or $80,000 a year. \nIn point of fact, those people are most in need, and I disagree with \nthe House provision that would provide them with a $300 rebate as \nopposed to middle-income or upper middle income people who get a $600 \nrebate. We should not provide a two-tier rebate approach. Everybody \nshould get the same amount. Certainly lower income people have more \nneed of the money than upper income people. So I think that provision \nin the Finance Committee proposal makes a lot of sense.\n  Having said those positive things about the Finance Committee \npackage, there is one area where I strongly disagree. Under the House \npackage, the rebates were capped at incomes of $75,000 per year for \nindividuals and $150,000 a year for couples. As I understand it, the \nFinance Committee would eliminate those caps and they would say to the \nwealthiest people in our society, to the millionaires and to the \nbillionaires, to Bill Gates, to Warren Buffett, that you will be \neligible for a tax rebate. At a time when this country has a record-\nbreaking national debt, at a time when the people on top have never \ndone so well, and the richest 1 percent are doing very well based on \nanyone's analysis; at a time when the richest 1 percent have already \nreceived collectively hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks \nfrom President Bush, the idea that under a so-called economic stimulus \npackage we would be providing $500 to Bill Gates is not only absurd, it \nis laughable. I hesitate to think what the American people will \nconclude if we go forward in that approach, and if we do away with the \ncap at $150,000, which the House appropriately placed in there.\n  It has been estimated that eliminating the income caps for the rebate \nchecks, giving that money to Bill Gates and other billionaires would \ncost about $5 billion. Five billion dollars would, in fact, be enough \nmoney to significantly increase food stamps for tens of millions of the \nneediest Americans in our country. I don't think it is rocket science \nto suggest that it is more important to make sure that kids in this \ncountry get adequate nutrition, that older people be able to get some \nhelp in food stamps, than giving a $500 check to millionaires and \nbillionaires, not to mention that all of the economists agree that if \nyou are talking about an economic stimulus, the fastest way you get \nthat money out into our society is by giving it to people who are most \nin need who will then spend it, not to the wealthiest people in this \ncountry. I hope very much that every Member of the Senate will conclude \nthat giving a tax rebate of $500 a person in a so-called economic \nstimulus package to the wealthiest people in this society makes zero \nsense.\n  In my view, despite the improvements or most of the improvements we \nare seeing in the Senate Finance Committee, I think that, frankly, \nthere is a lot more that must be done in the economic stimulus package, \nand it should be done for two reasons. No. 1, for 7 years, we have had \na President who has turned a blind eye to the middle class and working \nfamilies and lower income people in this country; at a time, in fact, \nwhen poverty is increasing, his contribution to the process was to \npropose major cutbacks in one program after another. I think it is time \nnow that Congress pay attention to the needs of the middle class, lower \nincome people, and start addressing their needs rather than just upper \nincome people who have received so much over the last 7 years. \nSpecifically, we must provide help to those most in need, particularly \nsenior citizens on fixed incomes, low-income families with children, \nand persons with disabilities.\n  We must strengthen the middle class in this economic stimulus \npackage, and we must put Americans back to work at good-paying jobs by \npaying attention to our infrastructure, which has so long been \nneglected with the results being that we have bridges and roads and \nculverts and school buildings that are in desperate need of repair.\n  If we fail to pass an economic stimulus package that does not \naccomplish all three of these goals, we will have missed out on an \nimportant opportunity to strengthen our economy and to help those \npeople most in need.\n  Here are just a few steps that I believe we should be taking. First, \nI believe we should increase the stimulus package by at least $25 \nbillion. I also believe we should reduce the business tax breaks by at \nleast $25 billion. Mark Zandi from Moody's has estimated that the \nbusiness tax breaks contemplated by Congress would yield very little \nstimulus to the economy, much less than increasing food stamps or \nunemployment benefits. In other words, if the goal is to stimulate the \neconomy, the tax breaks being proposed for the business community in \nmany ways would have much less of an impact than many other proposals, \nsuch as increasing food stamps or unemployment benefits.\n  If we did those two things--increase the stimulus package by $25 \nbillion and reduce the business tax breaks by $25\n\n[[Page S467]]\n\nbillion--that would leave us with an additional $50 billion. What can \nwe do, what should we do with this $50 billion? We could complete the \npicture. We can put Americans back to work at decent-paying jobs, we \ncan help those who are most in need, and we could strengthen the middle \nclass.\n  How do we do that? Specifically, I believe we should provide $5 \nbillion for an expansion of the Food Stamp Program. In America today, \npoverty is increasing. We are seeing levels of desperation in the State \nof Vermont and all over this country that we have not seen in many \nyears. Food shelves in the State of Vermont and throughout this country \nare running out of food. I understand that in the agriculture bill, \nthere are proposals to increase food stamps, but we do not know when \nthat farm bill is going to be passed. We have to act now. Let's support \nour neighbors who are having a hard time feeding their families. Let's \nsubstantially increase food stamps and do it in this economic stimulus \npackage.\n  What else should we be doing? I can tell my colleagues, coming from \none of the coldest States in America, at a time when home heating fuel \nprices are soaring, it is absolutely imperative that we significantly \nincrease funding for the LIHEAP program. Many of the people on LIHEAP \nare senior citizens, and the rest are low-income people. With fuel \nprices soaring, with poverty increasing, more and more people are \nhaving a difficult time keeping their homes warm. We must significantly \nincrease LIHEAP funding. The economists tell us that is also an \nimportant mechanism if we are going to stimulate the economy.\n  Including food stamps, LIHEAP, and unemployment benefits in the \neconomic stimulus package is not only the right thing to do in terms of \nstimulating the economy, it is the moral thing to do. We cannot, we \nmust not turn a blind eye to those people who are most in need. That is \nwhat has gone on year after year under Republican rule. It is time we \nturned that around and told those Americans most in need that we hear \nthem, we know what is going on, and this Congress, this Government will \nrespond to those needs, and now is the time to do that.\n  In my State and all over America, our infrastructure is crumbling. \nThere are estimates that we need over $1 trillion to rebuild our \nbridges, our schools, our culverts, and in the process of doing that--\nthis is work which has to be done, and the longer we wait, the more it \ncosts. I speak as a former mayor. When you delay your infrastructure \nrepairs, all it means is it is going to cost you more next year. We can \nput many workers back to work doing this very important task of \nrebuilding our infrastructure, making sure the schools our kids are \ngoing to are updated, and making sure they are energy efficient. If we \nmake our schools and public buildings energy efficient, in the long run \nwe are going to save money. But as an immediate economic stimulus, \nputting money into the infrastructure can create many jobs, and these \nare good-paying jobs. I am talking about schools, bridges, roads, \nsewers, wastewater plants, rails, ports, airports, health delivery \nsystems, and other infrastructural needs. Last year, about 200,000 \nconstruction workers lost their jobs, and this is a good way of \nbringing at least some of them back into the workforce.\n  I will also give two more examples of investments we should be making \nthat can have a very significant impact upon the lives of the American \npeople.\n  When a worker loses his or her job, in all likelihood that worker is \nalso losing his or her health care. We have seen, since Bush has been \nPresident, over 7 million Americans lose their health insurance, and as \nunemployment goes up, surely that number will only increase.\n  If we just provided, for example, $148 million for the expansion of \ncommunity health centers, that would be enough money to create 227 new \nCHCs all over this country. It would provide jobs for health care \nworkers, but even more importantly, when somebody loses their health \ninsurance, they would have the opportunity to access primary health \ncare, dental care, low-cost prescription drugs, and mental health \ncounseling. This is a good investment at any time. It is an especially \ngood investment now. It puts people to work and will provide health \ncare access for millions of Americans.\n  For those who question the appropriateness of including community \nhealth centers in an economic stimulus package, I simply remind them \nthat this is precisely what we did under President Ronald Reagan's \nstimulus package in the 1980s. It worked then, and I believe it will \nwork now.\n  Another important investment we should be making is to provide at \nleast $500 million for the low-income Weatherization Assistance \nProgram. Weatherization is a program that is going on all over the \ncountry. We do not need a new bureaucracy to funnel that money into the \nprojects; it is there already. In Vermont and in many other parts of \nAmerica, the needs for weatherization far outstrip the funds that are \navailable. Many of the community action agencies have long waiting \nlists.\n  Funding weatherization makes eminent sense for a number of reasons. \nNo. 1, the programs are in place. We can put people to work right away. \nThat is an economic stimulus. No. 2, it is absolutely absurd that \nmillions of low-income people continue to live in homes which are very \npoorly weatherized, where insulation is lacking and they have \ninadequate roofs, windows, and doors. They are putting money into their \nheating system, and that money is simply leaking out of their homes, \ncausing, by the way, an increased problem with greenhouse gas \nemissions. So weatherization makes sense in terms of creating jobs, it \nmakes sense in saving people money on their fuel bills, and it makes a \nlot of sense for those of us who want to cut back on greenhouse gas \nemissions.\n  Back in 2001, when both you and I, Mr. President, were Members of the \nHouse, I was an early backer of tax rebates. I strongly support tax \nrebates for middle-class and for low-income families with children and \nfor persons with disabilities. I also believe senior citizens who do \nnot pay income taxes should be receiving this assistance as well \nthrough a bonus in their Social Security checks. But giving someone \n$500 or $1,000 alone will not fix the economic problems the middle-\nclass and working families of our country are facing. Putting Americans \nto work at decent-paying jobs and helping those most in need is also \nextremely important.\n  We must pass an economic stimulus package. We must do it as quickly \nas we can. But we must do it in a way that really has an impact on our \neconomy and an impact on the lives of those people who are most in \nneed. In the coming hours and days, I intend to be actively involved in \nthat process.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business. Senators \nare authorized to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the discussion of how \nwe will handle this economic slowdown. First, it is important to put \nthis economic slowdown in some context.\n  It is very difficult to know how significant it is. In fact, we had \nsome economists testifying today before the Budget Committee, where I \nam ranking member, who said they weren't sure we were going into \nrecession, are people who are highly respected, but they needed further \nnumbers. We have economists who believe we are in a recession who are \nhighly respected. Martin Feldstein from Harvard expressed that view \ntoday before the Budget Committee. Professor Blinder of Princeton, who \nwas a Federal Reserve Board member at one time, expressed the view that \nhe didn't know.\n  Some things are fairly clear. The first is, there is tremendous \nstress on the economy because of the subprime meltdown in the housing \nmarket. In fact, the numbers are fairly staggering. The housing \nsituation is probably as severe as it has been in recent history. That \nhas led to a contraction of credit generally, which is what happens, \nregrettably, in such a situation where\n\n[[Page S468]]\n\nyou have a very significant sector of the economy which has been \nsubject to a bubble situation where there was an expansion which was \nnot supported by the underlying value and which cannot, in this case, \nbe supported by the repayment structure that is in place or the value \nof the collateral. The bubble bursts, and people find themselves unable \nto repay their loans, and the value of their collateral isn't high \nenough to offset the value of the underlying loan. As a result, that \ncredit is contracted.\n  That leads to other credit being contracted because, as those loans, \nunfortunately, dry up and go bad or can't be repaid, you find that the \nbanking community generally has to continue to maintain its capital and \nits liquidity position. So it starts to contract its lending to people \nwho can repay and who are good risks because the banking community \ndoesn't have the resources to continue to expand because it is being \ncontracted by the reduction in the value of the loan portfolio tied to \nhousing. This feeds on itself.\n  Regrettably, I have been through this three times in my professional \ncareer. The worst was when I was Governor of New Hampshire. At that \npoint, in the late 1980s, early 1990s, we had a national crisis \nrelating to housing which translated into a crisis in banking. In fact, \nof the seven major banks in New Hampshire, all were statistically \ninsolvent. Five of them failed. Two of them survived because they were \nowned by outside banks that had the resources and capital to prop them \nup. But it was a regional event, and it was due to a lot of factors, \nprimarily explosive lending in the 1980s which was not supported by, \nagain, underlying collateral. It fed on itself so that people who had \noutstanding loans, who could actually repay, found they couldn't roll \nthe loans over because the banks were not able to give them additional \nfunds because they didn't have it.\n  This time it appears to be a little different in that so much of this \nhousing paper has been sold and resold and is spread liberally across \nthe world. You could have gotten a mortgage in New Hampshire and have \nsomebody in Germany own it now, or some part of it, as a result of this \nresale. So the risk has been spread outside the American banking \nsystem. That has two effects: One, it does spread the risk; second, the \nproblem is that as these subprime loans come up, people who actually \nhave good jobs and can pay a reasonable rate, as these ARMs are coming \nup at such high rates that they aren't reasonable, those folks are \nfinding it difficult to renegotiate because there is nobody at the \nteller window, so to speak. They are dealing with servicing agencies \nwhich have no relationship either to the people who hold the debt. It \nis very hard to renegotiate these loans effectively.\n  This is all compounding on itself and looks as if it is going to lead \nto a fairly significant slowdown or, as has been said by a number of \npeople, potentially a recession. In response, the Federal Reserve has \ncut rates, once by 75 basis points and again today by 50 basis points. \nThose are significant cuts and should have a positive impact on the \nformation of liquidity in the market and also, obviously, on taking the \npressure off the refinancing effort in the area of lending. But it \ntakes 6 to 9 months before that works its way through the system.\n  The question is, what do we do to stimulate the economy now, today, \nin the next 6 to 9 months when we have this window of slowdown which is \nvery difficult to deal with because of the housing market crisis \ncompounding into the general lending area crisis and the fact that some \nof our major banking institutions are under very significant stress.\n  My view is--and I guess it is a minority view--that you focus the \neffort on that which is going to give you not only immediate stimulus \nbut, hopefully, in the long term a stronger economy; in the long term \nan economy that is more efficient and more effective in creating jobs \nand making the American economy stronger. So you value every one of the \noptions that are on the table by the basis of does it give you stimulus \nin the short run but, also, does it give you something in the long run \nwhich is going to produce a stronger economy.\n  The proposals on the table are mostly divided into two categories: \none to give people money to spend and, two, to give businesses \nincentives to go out and buy equipment and invest.\n  The money-to-spend issue becomes fairly problematic in a world \neconomy. You give somebody $500 or $600 to spend and if they actually \nspend it and they don't spend it on goods produced in the United \nStates, it has virtually no impact on stimulating our economy. If you \npurchase a television from China or an iPod--I don't know where they \nare made, but let's say they are made in Vietnam--with the $500 that \nyou receive as a tax stimulus through a stimulus package as a tax \nrebate, that has nothing to do with creating jobs in the United \nStates. It may create jobs in China. It may create jobs in Vietnam. But \nit does not create jobs here, except at the margin, for the retail \neffort in the United States.\n\n  Also, if you give money to high-income individuals as a tax rebate--\nand basically, historically, those dollars do not get spent at all; \nthey do not stimulate the economy in that sense at all--they get saved \nbecause high-income individuals have the discretionary income to spend \nanyway. So if they are going to get a windfall of $500, $600, $1,000, \nit is likely they are not going to spend that in addition to the other \nmoney they already have available to them, and they are probably going \nto save it. That does nothing to stimulate the economy.\n  So as we look at this tax rebate effort, which I understand is being \ndone for the purposes of stimulating the economy--the classic Keynesian \neffort of creating demand in the economy to grow the economy in a \nslowdown period--I think you have to look at what are the practical \nimplications, what are the real implications of putting this money on \nthe table for people.\n  To begin with, it makes no sense at all to give it to high-income \nindividuals. Even though I am a Republican--people may think that is \ncounterintuitive--the simple fact is, it does not make any sense. So \nthere should be a cap. I do not understand why the Finance Committee \ndraft--what they are proposing--has no cap.\n  But, secondly, unless this money can get out fairly quickly, and \nunless you can be fairly confident that it is going to go to purchases \nwhich are going to assist the American economy, then probably all you \nare doing by sending this money out the door in the form of a tax \nrebate is creating an income transfer which will obviously benefit \nlower-income people from a social standpoint but probably will not have \nmuch of an impact on the economic policies of stimulus.\n  It does not look like we can get this money out the door very fast. \nThe fastest track I have heard, which was testified to by the CBO \nDirector, is the IRS could get these checks out maybe by the middle of \nJune. But he also said the practical implications are that those \ndollars will not have an impact on the economy until the end of the \nthird quarter or beginning of the fourth quarter, or, as he said, the \nChristmas season of this year.\n  By that time, the Fed rate cuts will probably also have kicked in and \nstarted having an impact, so you may not be getting what you want, \nwhich is action in these first 6 months of this year as versus action \nat the end of this year to stimulate the economy. In fact, you may have \ntwo stimulative events coming in on top of each other, which might \nactually even be inflationary.\n  It would seem to me that rather than taking this approach, it would \nmake a lot more sense to put money where the problem is. Now, this has \nbeen resisted by the administration, and it is not being talked about a \nlot around here by the folks who are putting together the package. But \nit would seem to me that middle-income people who have these loans that \nare rolling over--these subprime loans--are the people who need the \nability to refinance those loans so they do not get foreclosed on over \nthe next 6 months. There are a number of ways we could do that. There \nare a number of ways we could actually put money into that area as a \nFederal Government which would benefit that group of people who appear \nto be at the essence of the problem--more than just sending the money \nout to everybody and hoping their demand will raise the economy in \ngeneral.\n  A tax credit to those folks, which is refundable, based off their \ninterest payment on the refunded loan, is one option to get them \nthrough this period. A\n\n[[Page S469]]\n\nrestructuring mechanism, which allows them to restructure and get \nassistance through restructuring, by significantly expanding FHA, by \nraising and putting that into the package, which is not in the \npackage--it is being talked about in a separate vehicle, but it is not \nin the package--would help. Giving the State housing authorities more \ncapacity to put money into the market would help. It would help. That \nis being talked about, which is good.\n  Allowing Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to raise their cap--but to do it \nin the context of also underlying reforms so we do not end up, a year \nor two from now, where Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are going under--\nwould help. The first part is being talked about, raising the cap, but \nnot the second part, the reform mechanism. So there are some things we \ncan do that I think would get to the problem more appropriately--and \nthe issue of the economic slowdown would mute that, hopefully--and \nwould also in the long run create a much stronger economy.\n  I have introduced today--I did not introduce it--but Senator Isakson \nintroduced it today; and I am his primary cosponsor--a bill to do this \nin the area of tax credits. But it is not going to be included in the \npackage, which is unfortunate.\n  The second part of the package which is being talked about is \ninvestment incentives for businesses, small businesses. They should be \ndirected at small businesses, by the way, because small businesses \ncreate the jobs in this country. These involve expensing and bonus \ndepreciation, as it is referred to, and net loss operating carryback. \nSo if you have a net loss this year because we have a slowdown, you can \npick it up in years you have had a profit--apply it to years you have \nhad a profit--reducing your tax burden.\n  These are all good ideas, in my opinion, very good ideas, and will \nstrengthen the economy. In the long run, it will make us more efficient \nand create more jobs. And jobs are the bottom line. So I have no \nproblem with that part of the package.\n  But a third part of the package being talked about is extending \nunemployment insurance. If you talk to most of your economists around \nhere who present before the Congress--and many of them do, obviously. \nIn the Budget Committee we have an almost unending stream of economists \nbefore us, and they are always very informative. If they come out of \nwhat I call the Galbraith school of economics, which is sort of the \nHarvard school of economics, which is a stepchild of the Keynesian \nschool of economics of the 1930s, they will basically say if you want \nto get dollars into the economy quickly, you put it into unemployment \ninsurance and food stamps, because that gives you an immediate boost in \nthe economy to people who will spend it because they need it. That is \nprobably a legitimate argument, especially on food stamps.\n  But on unemployment insurance, it is not a legitimate argument if you \nhave full employment. In fact, it is the absolute opposite of what \nhappens when you have full employment. To extend the unemployment \ninsurance benefits by a year, which is what is being proposed, in the \nareas that have essentially full employment means you give a \ndisincentive to people to go out and find a job in an atmosphere where \njobs exist.\n\n  By definition, if you have a full-employment economy, you have jobs \ngoing unfilled. So, for example, in my State of New Hampshire, where we \nhave an unemployment rate which is essentially 3.7, 3.8 percent for the \nState--and the highest level of unemployment we have for any county in \nthe State is 4.4 percent--we have what is known as full employment. \nNow, there are pockets of problems. We have one specific town in the \nState which was a single-factory town and the factory, regretably, has \nrecently closed, so that specific group of individuals has a very \nserious issue, and there is a way to address that in a targeted way.\n  But to extend unemployment insurance for our entire State, when we \nare at actually less than full employment--we are actually below full \nemployment--in other words, we have a lot of jobs going unfilled when \nyou are at 3.7 percent employment--full employment being 5 percent in \nour economy, in the 5-percent range--you essentially create an \nincentive for people to stay on unemployment much longer than is \nnecessary for them to find a job.\n  We know statistically if you have an economy where jobs are \navailable, an economy where unemployment is under 5.5 percent, that \nmeans you have jobs available and that most people find a job in the \nlast 2 weeks of their unemployment. That is human nature: They stay on \nunemployment until almost the end and then find a job. If you extend it \nanother year, those folks who could be productive, procuring a job, \ncreating economic activity by having a job, will stay on unemployment, \neven though there may be a job out there they could take because you \nhave jobs available. So it makes no logic to extend unemployment \ninsurance in areas where you have full employment. And full employment \nin our economy is defined as basically under 5.5 percent. The Nation is \nat 5 percent right now.\n  We have never extended unemployment insurance in this country when we \nhave had an employment rate under 5.7 percent--never. So to do this at \nthis time is counterintuitive to how you make the economy more \nefficient and, as a result, stimulate the economy.\n  One of the economists who testified before the Budget Committee today \nsaid if this would work, you should always extend unemployment \ninsurance and keep everybody on unemployment forever because, \nbasically, if you have a full-employment economy, and you are going to \nget your economy more stimulated by having more people stay on \nunemployment, then leave everybody on unemployment. Obviously, that \ndoes not make any sense. He was saying that tongue in cheek.\n  It is fairly clear, if you have an economy where you have jobs that \nare not being filled, you do not arbitrarily extend unemployment \ninsurance for a uniquely long period because those jobs will never be \nfilled because nobody will ever leave unemployment insurance. So you \nundermine the efficiency of the economy. It is sort of the old French \napproach to do it that way--not the new French approach but the old \nFrench approach.\n  Yes, there may be regions of our country that have an unemployment \nrate where clearly there are no jobs available, and those regions need \nrelief. I would be more than happy to see an unemployment insurance \nextension which was tied to a trigger which said: All right, \nhistorically, we have viewed under 5.5 percent as full employment; over \n5.5 percent we are getting into a serious issue; so let's take the 5.7 \npercent rate--which is where we have historically never gone below to \nextend unemployment insurance--but let's take the 5.7 percent rate and \nput a trigger into the system, so if a State or even a region within a \nState--that is a definable region that is significant--has an \nunemployment rate of over 5.7 percent, they get the extended \nunemployment benefits.\n  That makes sense. But a general national extension of unemployment \ninsurance for the sake of stimulating the economy is going to be \ncounterproductive if you have a full-employment economy in the regions. \nStates such as Michigan may need the extension. States such as New \nHampshire, I am sure, on an individual, anecdotal relations basis, may \nneed it, but as a practical matter it would be counterproductive to our \neconomy to do it because we are at 3.7 percent unemployment. So that \nproposal, which, by the way, the House looked at and said it did not \nmake sense in the context of this economic situation, should not be \ninserted by the Senate.\n  I think the best approach we can take--because I, obviously, have \nreservations about the stimulus package that came out of the House on \nthe demand side. And I have reservations about some of the initiatives \nwithin that package. I would like to see that package, obviously, \ninclude more of a target on the problem which is to address the issue \nof home ownership and the housing stocks, which are so overpriced now, \nand, unfortunately, empty--making sure we figure out some way to move \npeople toward absorbing that housing side. I would like to see more of \nthat, but that is not going to happen. It is not going to happen in the \ncontext of the period we have to act.\n  There is an agreement that exists between the President of the United \nStates and the Speaker of the House of\n\n[[Page S470]]\n\nRepresentatives and the Republican leader of the House of \nRepresentatives. It is agreement that involves tradeoffs. But the basic \nunderlying purpose of the agreement was and is to stimulate the \neconomy. It may or may not do that, but the one positive effect I will \nstipulate it will have is it creates at least a sense that the Congress \nand the Government and the President and the Speaker of the House and \nthe Democrats and the Republicans can cooperate to try to address what \nis clearly a slowing of our economy through some fiscal policy action.\n  Even though it is $150 billion, which is a lot of money--and all that \nmoney is going to have to be borrowed from our children, unfortunately, \nand over 10 years it totals up to being about a $200 billion event \nbecause of interest compounding on it--even though that is a high price \ntag to pay for what you might call a confidence builder, it is still \nsomething you can argue should be done if you have that type of an \nagreement.\n  For the Senate to sort of step in and say: Well, we want to tinker \nwith it, and we want to change it there, well, it is nothing more than \nan execution of Senate prerogative, but it is not going to help the \npolicy because none of the proposals coming out of the Senate committee \nare all that good on the side of policy--especially the unemployment \ninsurance proposal and the lifting of the caps on the benefits \nproposal--what it is going to do is undermine the confidence of the \nAmerican people that we as a government can act.\n  So the high water mark appears to me to have been reached on this \nissue when the President and the Speaker of the House reached \nagreement, working with the Republican leader in the House. I think we \nas a Senate ought to take sort of a mature attitude and say: Well, \nprogress was made. We are confronting a fairly serious situation. Let's \nnot throw out our proposal simply for the sake of putting a proposal on \nthe table. Let's recognize that something needs to be done quickly, and \nthat this is the best we are going to get. Hopefully, that will be the \nresolution of this process as we move toward concluding, and one hopes \nthis can be done within the next week.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, our first Member is a distinguished member \nof our Intelligence Committee, the distinguished junior Senator from \nNorth Carolina. I yield to him.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member, Senator Bond.\n  We have heard some people claim that the Intelligence Committee's \nbill will allow dragnet surveillance that will sweep up communications \nof innocent Americans. Is this accurate?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, that question has been raised. We have heard \nthat on the floor a number of times. I think it is very important that \nwe dispel that myth right now. The answer is no--a flat no. Our \ncommittee bill only allows the targeting of persons outside the United \nStates to obtain foreign intelligence information. It is not dragnet \nsurveillance. The targets of acquisition must be foreign targets and \nthey must be suspected terrorists or spies. The Attorney General and \nthe Director of National Intelligence, whom I will refer to as the DNI, \nmust certify that a significant purpose of the acquisition is to obtain \nforeign intelligence information.\n  For example, if a foreign target is believed to be an agent or a \nmember of al-Qaida, then all communications of that target could be \nintercepted.\n  Only Americans who communicate with suspected terrorists abroad will \nhave those specific communications monitored. If those same \ncommunications turn out to be innocent, they will be minimized, which \nis intel community speak for suppressed, so that Americans' privacy \ninterests are protected.\n  It is very misleading and nonfactual to suggest that the intelligence \ncommunity is spying on parents who are calling their children overseas \nor students who are talking with their friends, or on our own soldiers \nin the battlefield. Our intelligence professionals are far too busy \ntracking real terrorists, members of al-Qaida, than to listen to family \ndiscussions or conversations between classmates. Not only do they not \nhave time that is not permitted under this bill.\n  Mr. BURR. What happens when the intelligence community does become \ninterested in the communications of a person inside the United States?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Carolina, \nbecause that is precisely what our bill, the FISA Act Amendments bill, \ndoes. That information will be turned over to the FBI, which would seek \na title III criminal warrant, or a FISA order, to intercept all of the \ncommunications of that person, not just communications with targets \noverseas.\n  Mr. BURR. We have heard a number of people claim that the foreign \ntargeting authorized under the Intelligence Committee's bill contains \ninadequate protections for U.S. persons. What specific protections are \nincluded for innocent Americans?\n  Mr. BOND. This is where the Intelligence Committee bill goes much \nfarther than any other law we have had in our history in protecting \nU.S. persons; that is, U.S. citizens and others here in the United \nStates.\n  The bill includes express prohibitions against ``reverse targeting,'' \nand reverse targeting is a knowledge that you can target a person \noverseas when the real purpose is to target someone in the United \nStates. This is illegal. The intelligence community does not do it. \nFrankly, it is terribly impractical. They cannot under the law that we \nhave presented to this body target a person inside the United States \nwithout a court order.\n  The bill also requires that all acquisitions comply with the \nprotections of the fourth amendment. In addition, the Intelligence \nCommittee bill requires, for the first time in history, that the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court--and I will refer to that as \nthe FISC--for the first time in history approve any surveillance of a \nU.S. person, or an American citizen abroad. This goes beyond the \nrequirement even in existing American criminal law.\n  Mr. BURR. As my good friend noted, the Intelligence Committee bill \ngives the FISA Court an important role in foreign targeting. The bill \nrequires that any acquisition be conducted pursuant to the specific \ntargeting and minimization processes and procedures. What is the \ncourt's role with respect to these procedures?\n  Mr. BOND. This provision came about as a result of discussions by \nmembers on both sides of the committee who wanted to provide \nprotections for Americans overseas. To do that required a significant \nexpansion and clarification, which is included in the managers' \namendment that Senator Rockefeller and I have produced and have pending \nbefore the body.\n  Under this bill, the FISC must review and approve the targeting and \nminimization procedures used by the Government in conducting its \nforeign targeting operations. The court must find that the targeting \nprocedures are reasonably designed to ensure that the authorized \nacquisition is limited to the targeted persons reasonably believed to \nbe located outside the United States. The court must then find that \nminimization procedures comply with the FISA law.\n\n  The court will also review the joint certification issued by the \nAttorney General and the DNI to make sure that it contains all of the \nrequired elements. If the court finds there is a deficiency in those \nprocedures or the certification--that even for a minor drafting or \ntechnical reason they do not comply with the law--the court can order \nthe Government to correct the deficiency or cease the acquisition.\n\n[[Page S471]]\n\n  Mr. BURR. There is an amendment already filed, and the amendment is \nfiled to the Intelligence Committee bill, that allows the FISA Court to \nassess the Government's compliance with the minimization procedures. \nWhy shouldn't we have the court do this?\n  Mr. BOND. Well, it sounds like a reasonable proposal on the surface, \nbut when you look at the law and the structure that is set up, it does \nnot work. The FISC was created in 1978 simply to issue orders for \ndomestic surveillance on particular targets, but the Congress \nspecifically left foreign surveillance activities to the executive \nbranch and to the intelligence community.\n  FISA minimization procedures--the procedure to suppress information \non an innocent communication with a person in the United States--are \nall about protecting the identities of a U.S. person or American \ncitizen. This comes up all of the time in domestic collections. But \nalmost all of the collection under these foreign targeting acquisitions \nwill be on non-U.S. persons who require no protection under FISA \nminimization procedures.\n  It doesn't make sense to direct the FISC to get involved in assessing \ncompliance with the foreign targeting realm. They have said in their \nopinion regarding sealed matters that they are not set up to do that, \nand they do not have the expertise to do that.\n  As a practical matter, when the court assesses compliance with \nminimization procedures, it would be second-guessing trained analysts' \ndecisions about which foreign terrorist to track and how to do it. They \nsimply are not competent, they are not set up, they don't have the \nexpertise to do that, and they have so stated in their published \nopinion. They can't make these types of operational decisions.\n  Mr. BURR. It is my understanding that the FISA Court recently issued \nan opinion where it commented on the expertise of the executive branch \nover the court in national security and foreign intelligence matters. \nShouldn't we heed the court's own words?\n  Mr. BOND. I am certainly glad the Senator brought that up. The court \ndid issue a published opinion this past December where it noted that \nthe FISA Court judges are:\n\n       Not expected or desired to become experts in . . . foreign \n     intelligence activities, and do not make substantive \n     judgments on the propriety or need for a particular \n     surveillance . . . Even if a typical FISA judge had more \n     expertise in national security matters than a typical \n     district court judge, that expertise would still not equal \n     that of the Executive Branch, which is constitutionally \n     entrusted with protecting national security.\n\n  Those are the words of the judges on the FISA Court, the FISC.\n  The court knows what to look for when it issues a warrant to tap \nsomeone's phone in North Carolina or Virginia. But when it comes to \nanalyzing intelligence leads and deciding which foreign terrorists or \nspies should be surveilled, the court is simply not competent to make \nthese judgments. That is exactly what the amendment would seek to have \nthem do.\n  This bill already contains numerous oversight reporting and numerous \njudicial provisions. Those of us who have gone out to look at the \noperations know how extensive and how carefully supervised they are. \nThere is no reason to ask the FISC to take on the additional authority \nin the context of foreign targeting, especially where it could result \nin operational problems or the loss of intelligence and, as the judges \nhave said, is beyond their competence.\n  Mr. BURR. The Intelligence Committee bill allows the Attorney General \nand the DNI to direct a communications provider to assist the \nGovernment with a foreign targeting acquisition. What protections does \nthis bill give to any provider who believes there is a problem with the \ndirective?\n  Mr. BOND. That is a very good question, because we cannot expect \ncarriers, telephone companies, telecom companies to work with us if \nthey don't have protection. That is why we are seeking retroactive \nclarification of the civil liability for those who have, in the \nexercise of their patriotic duty and pursuant to valid directives, \nparticipated in the President's terrorist surveillance program. Under \nthis bill, the providers may challenge the directive by filing a \npetition to modify or set aside the directive of the court. If the \ncourt finds the directive does not meet specific requirements or is \nunlawful, it can grant a petition. If the court does not modify or set \naside the directive, it will order the provider to comply with it. Both \nthe Government and the provider may appeal any decision to the FISC \nCourt of review and ultimately the Supreme Court.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I see that the senior Senator from Virginia \nis here and I know he has some questions he wishes to ask, so I will \nlimit myself to one more.\n  What happens if a provider refuses to comply with the directive you \njust talked about?\n  Mr. BOND. I would tell my good friend from North Carolina that the \nbill we reported out of our committee provides a mechanism for the \nGovernment to compel a provider to comply with a directive. If the \ncourt finds that the directive was issued properly and is lawful, it \nmust order the provider to comply with the directive and that provider \nis provided immunity for doing so. But a failure to comply by a company \ncould result in a contempt of court. Both the Government and the \nprovider may appeal any decision to the FISC Court of review and \nultimately the Supreme Court.\n  I thank my colleague for his service on the committee and for his \nvery helpful questions.\n  Mr. BURR. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia is here, and I would turn to him if he has some questions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the ranking member \nof the committee. I am privileged to serve on that committee with the \nsenior Senator from the great State of Missouri.\n  I would like to first make a few opening comments, if I might.\n  Mr. BOND. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first, I commend how well the \ndistinguished Senator from Missouri has represented to this Chamber and \nits Members and, indeed, to all those in our Nation who are following \nthis debate, how well he has represented a proper and balanced \nperspective and how a solution to the important questions that have \nbeen raised by all of us can be resolved.\n  In my own case, I have thought long and hard about this situation, \nand I would like to reflect on a bit of history. I was privileged to \nserve in the Department of Defense from the years 1969 to 1974 during \nthe war in Vietnam. At the latter part of my service there, we \noriginated the concept of the all-volunteer force. There was great \nskepticism as to whether this concept would work, and it was a high \nrisk to abolish the draft and to enter into this concept of all \nvolunteer, to be the only persons to be given the privilege of wearing \nthe uniform of the United States of America in the branches of the \nArmy, the Navy, the Air Force, and the Marines.\n  Fortunately, it was adopted by the President, eventually written into \nlaw by the Congress. That concept has worked. It is working at this \nvery moment with brave young men and women all over the world. They are \nthere because each of them raised their right hand and took the oath of \noffice voluntarily.\n  I see a direct analogy to this question that is before this Chamber \nand, indeed, the Nation, the question of whether corporations, which \nalthough they did not raise their hand and volunteer, they have \nnonetheless volunteered comparably to the men and women in the Armed \nForces.\n  The work product of their volunteering is every day saving and \nprotecting the lives of our service personnel and, indeed, many others \nworldwide from the actions of terrorists and others who are trying to \nrip freedom away from our Nation and other nations.\n  So as we reach our decision on this issue, let's stop to think about \nthe United States of America, while not written into the Constitution, \nthe Bill of Rights, or otherwise, has throughout its history adopted a \nconcept of voluntarism by its citizens, by its companies to step \nforward and take on serious problems that confront our Nation.\n  I see a direct analogy, I say to my distinguished colleague, and I \nstand steadfast with our committee which voted 13 to 2 to provide this \nframework which we hope will eventually become the law of the land, to \ngive reasonable\n\n[[Page S472]]\n\nprotections to these companies that are part of the overall volunteer \nforce, be they in uniform or corporations, working to protect our \nNation.\n  Having said that, I say to my distinguished colleague, I think it is \nvery important that we proceed to prepare a complete record for the \nscrutiny of all on these issues. I wish to suggest a question to my \ndistinguished colleague.\n  All of us have heard a number of comments that more time is needed to \nstudy this issue, the issue of carrier liability, carriers being those \ncompanies that stepped up to work on behalf of the cause of freedom and \npreservation of our safety here at home. Hasn't the Intelligence \nCommittee conducted a thorough and bipartisan review of the President's \nsurveillance program? And hasn't the committee determined the providers \nacted in good faith?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nVirginia. The answer to that question is yes. I wish to say what a \npleasure it is to serve with the distinguished representative of \nVirginia, who served his country in the Department of Defense, who \npushed through the landmark decision to have a volunteer military, \nwhich I might say my son was proud to participate in, and to say that \nhis previous experience on the Intelligence Committee and his long and \ndevoted service on the Senate Armed Services Committee has made him an \ninvaluable member of the committee.\n  Mr. WARNER. For purposes of the record, I do not claim the credit. I \nwas but one of many who worked on the concept of that great program. I \nfound in this town, and as I know the Senator does likewise, the less \ncredit you try and take, the more effective one can be in other tasks.\n  Mr. BOND. I say through the Chair, the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia deserves far more credit than he is ever given. I was trying \nto sneak in a little bit to say how much we appreciate his service. \nWhen he needs to correct me, I always stand corrected.\n  To return to the question, I do have an answer, and that is, the \ncommittee conducted a comprehensive and bipartisan review. We \ninterviewed witnesses, we went out to NSA to see how the Terrorist \nSurveillance Program was implemented, examined documents, including the \nDepartment of Justice legal opinions and letters from the Government to \nproviders.\n  The letters were provided to the carriers in regular intervals and \nstated the activities had been authorized by the President. All the \nletters also state the Attorney General had determined the activities \nto be lawful, except for one which stated the determination had been \nmade by the counsel to the President.\n  After conducting this extensive review, the committee concluded the \nproviders that allegedly assisted the TSP acted in good faith and, \nbased on representations of the highest level of the Government, that \nthe program was lawful. Therefore, the committee concluded the civil \nliability protection for these providers was appropriate, and I draw \nupon my experience at the law school at the University of Virginia, \nwhere my distinguished colleague also studied law, to say that \nreviewing those documents and letters led me to the conclusion that it \nwas clear on its face that the carriers were receiving a valid, legal \ndirective from the highest authorities in the Federal Government.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. He said the \ncommittee ``concluded.'' It concluded by the manifestation of a vote of \n13 to 2, so that an overwhelming majority of the committee, bipartisan, \nmade this decision.\n  Mr. BOND. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think that is an important reference point.\n  Further, I say to my colleague, the committee's liability provision \nin the matters pending before this Senate today extends only to civil--\nI underline civil--liability protection for those providers that \nallegedly assisted with the TSP program. Isn't this already a \ncompromise from what the Director of the National Intelligence had \ninitially requested of the Congress?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Virginia, in April \nof 2007, the DNI submitted his request to modernize FISA to Congress, \nto our committee, and it included a request for full liability for all \npersons, including Government officials who had allegedly participated \nin the President's Terrorist Surveillance Program.\n  As my colleague has stated, the committee passed this bill by a 13-\nto-2 bipartisan vote. It included civil liability protection for those \nproviders that allegedly assisted with the TSP. The protection was not \nextended to Government officials or to criminal prosecution. We did not \nseal off all potential liability of anyone who may have acted \ncriminally--that would be up to the Department of Justice to \ndetermine--or Government officials who are named, I believe, in seven \npending lawsuits.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for that because the \nDNI, Director McConnell, a former admiral--I knew him in the Navy going \nway back when I was there. As a matter of fact, as a point of \nreference, when I was Secretary, he was one of the junior officers who \nbriefed me every morning at 7:30 on intelligence. But he has done an \nextraordinary job in presenting in a very fair and objective way the \nneed for the revisions to this legislation which are reflected in the \npending bill before the Senate as submitted by the committee.\n  I think the Senator has carefully delineated those portions which we \nresolved, as a committee, were essential and did not accept in full \nmeasure all his recommendations; am I not correct in that?\n  Mr. BOND. That is correct. Now I understand why Admiral McConnell is \ndoing such a good job because he obviously had very good early \ntraining. I did not know he had been through the Warner course in \nintelligence, but that ties up the loose ends, and now I understand \nmore fully.\n  Mr. WARNER. Again, Mr. President, I have to tell you, I was learning \nat a very young age and taking on responsibility in that critical \nperiod of history. I learned as much from him, if not more, than he did \nfrom me.\n  I have another question for my colleague. What consequences or risks \nare there if our private volunteer--I underline volunteer--participants \nby way of corporations are not given civil liability protection from \nthe pending and ongoing lawsuits and perhaps others?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, that is a very serious question because if \nthose lawsuits should continue, either directly against carriers \nalleged to have participated or substitution or indemnification, No. 1, \nthe identities of the providers could be revealed which would \ncompromise our intelligence sources and methods. No. 2, the providers \nwould be far less willing to cooperate with legitimate requests for \nassistance in the future, thus crippling our intelligence collection. \nWhy is this? Quite frankly, because this would have a huge damage to \ntheir business reputations. They have already been accused falsely of \nall sorts of things that have raised questions that are reflected in \ndamage to the value of the shareholders of the company and potentially \nbring great risk to the employees of those corporations and their \nfacilities. These lawsuits would occur not only in the United States \nbut even more likely they would occur overseas, and there could be real \npersonal danger if the companies are confirmed as assisting the \nGovernment's fight against terrorism. Their facilities, their personnel \ncould be at risk of terrorist targeting or other vigilante actions.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I think it is very \nimportant that we portray the risks that are associated with these \nendeavors taking place in the court system now. Again, I draw the \nattention of all colleagues to the thorough work done by this committee \non which I am privileged to serve and the bipartisan manner in which we \nresolved these issues.\n  A question to my colleague: We heard some Members advocate \nsubstitution--in other words, a substituted solution--rather than a \ncivil liability protection. Perhaps the Senator can address exactly \nwhat that substitution is and how, in his judgment, this would not be a \nmeans by which to resolve this very serious problem.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as I indicated, the dangers to the providers \nwould be as great under substitution as if they were sued directly. \nWhile the providers might not be parties to the litigation, under the \namendment offered by Senators Specter and Whitehouse, discovery would \nbe allowed to proceed against the providers,\n\n[[Page S473]]\n\nand this puts them at the same risk of disclosure as allowing the \nlitigation to proceed directly against them. That is one of the most \nsensitive intelligence programs in our history. The intelligence \ncommunity has done a thorough bipartisan review of the providers' \nconduct, and we in the committee feel we cannot risk our intelligence \nsources and methods by allowing litigation to continue and by allowing \nthe potential of significant damage to those companies and their \nshareholders who may be widows and orphans and certainly members whose \npensions may be invested in shares of those companies.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I would also add \nthat there will be further chapters in the history of this country, and \nI cannot try to look that far into the future as to what those chapters \nmay be when we, as a successor government to the one we now have in \nterms of our President, will be faced with another challenge and look \nto volunteers--volunteers--to solve this problem. This is going to be a \nlandmark precedent for future Presidents as we address problems which \ncould be assisted by the participation of the corporate world here in \nour United States.\n  A further question of my colleague. We have also heard some Members \nsay the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court should decide whether \nthe providers acted in good faith. Wouldn't this duplicate the \nbipartisan work of the Intelligence Committee?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, that is why we have an Intelligence \nCommittee. The Intelligence Committee concluded on a bipartisan basis \nthat they acted in good faith. There is no need for the FISC to \nduplicate the work. The FISC was set up to issue orders on individual \ntargets for domestic collection. We expanded their responsibilities. \nThe court is not set up and was not set up for protected en banc \nlitigation. The amendment offered by Senator Feinstein would allow \nparties to litigate the good-faith providers.\n  I see my time has expired. I believe the Senator from Virginia has \nsought time, and I see one of my colleagues on the other side has \nsought time, so I will yield to them for their comments, and I ask \nunanimous consent that I be recognized at the end of the remarks of \nthese two colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I would just ask if it would be possible--and I see my \ndistinguished colleague on the floor seeking recognition--may I have \nbut a few minutes to conclude my remarks here with my good friend and \nthe ranking member of the committee?\n  Madam President, last year, when the important legislation passed by \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee came to the floor, I spoke about \nseveral elements in this bill. Specifically, I spoke about how the \nIntelligence Committee bill ensures that the intelligence gap that was \nclosed by the Protect America Act in August remains sealed. I spoke \nabout the important balance the Intelligence Committee bill strikes \nbetween protecting civil liberties and ensuring that our hard-working \nand dedicated intelligence professionals have the tools they need to \nprotect this Nation--a point I cannot too strongly emphasize. I also \nhighlighted one of the most important provisions of the bill: \nretroactive liability protection for carriers alleged to have assisted \nthe Government with the terrorist surveillance program. I said in \nDecember that, based on the documents and testimony provided to our \ncommittee, I strongly believed the carriers that have participated in \nthe program relied--I repeat, relied--upon our Government--that is, the \nexecutive branch of the Government of the United States--that their \nactions were legal and in the best interests of the security of \nAmerica. Further, I stated that, in my opinion, these companies deserve \nand must be protected from costly and damaging litigation in our court \nsystem.\n  During the Senate's Christmas recess, I had additional time to \nfurther study this issue, as I have day after day, and gather \nadditional information. That time to reflect and study and to deepen my \nknowledge on this issue has only reinforced my view that the carrier \nliability protections in the Intelligence Committee's bill are not only \nnecessary but vital for the protection of our future national security.\n  One item in particular has played a key role in my thinking about \nthis issue. It was a thoughtful opinion piece written by three \ngentlemen I know very well, former public servants, and I wish to say a \nfew words about that, and then I will conclude my remarks.\n  Three individuals stepped forward to give their perspectives on this \ncritical issue. The first was Benjamin Civiletti, U.S. Attorney General \nunder President Jimmy Carter; the second was Dick Thornburgh, U.S. \nAttorney General under President George Herbert Walker Bush; and \nthirdly, Judge William Webster, known very well by almost all of us \nhere in the Chamber, former Director of the CIA and former Director of \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation. The article these fine public \nservants authored, titled ``Surveillance Sanity,'' appeared in the \nOctober 31, 2007, edition of the Wall Street Journal.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a copy of that article following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. I wish to share some of the thoughts in that article with \nmy colleagues.\n  First, regarding the Intelligence Committee's carefully crafted and \nlimited liability protections, the three public servants said:\n\n       We agree with the committee. Dragging phone companies \n     through protracted litigation would not only be unfair, but \n     it would deter other companies and private citizens from \n     responding in terrorist emergencies whenever there may be \n     uncertainty or legal risk.\n\n  Our committee has heard testimony that without such protections, some \ncompanies believe they can no longer cooperate and assist our \nGovernment because they would risk hundreds of millions of dollars of \ntheir shareholders' money in protracted lawsuits. They have a fiduciary \nresponsibility, those companies, to their shareholders. That is \nintrinsic in all of our corporate structures.\n  Second, the boards of directors of these companies have a fundamental \nobligation to those shareholders. On this issue, the three public \nservants wrote:\n\n       The government alone cannot protect us from the threats we \n     face today. We must have the help of all of our citizens. \n     There will be times when the lives of thousands of Americans \n     will depend on whether corporations such as airlines and \n     banks are willing to lend assistance. If we do not treat them \n     fairly when they respond to assurances from the highest \n     levels of the government that their help is legal and \n     essential for saving lives, then we will be radically \n     reducing our society's capacity to defend itself.\n\n  Moreover, I believe that companies which assisted the Government will \nnot be treated fairly by the provision being offered by my Judiciary \nCommittee colleagues to substitute the Government in currently pending \nlawsuits.\n  I strongly believe the substitution proposal is not an acceptable \nalternative to the Intelligence Committee's bill.\n  Additionally, if lawsuits are allowed to proceed, companies will \nstill be forced to participate and provide evidence. The continuing \ndamage in terms of business reputation and stock valuation even if the \nGovernment ultimately prevails, will surely be extremely harmful to the \ncompanies.\n  Further, the Government being substituted as the defendant in a trial \nopens up evidentiary problems regarding sources and methods which, if \nexposed, would hinder the ability of the intelligence community to \nintercept terrorist communications and those of our other enemies.\n  Finally, the last point I would like to raise relates to the right of \nindividuals to file suit. Let me be clear--individuals who believe that \nthe Government violated their civil liberties can pursue legal action \nagainst the Government--the Intelligence Committee's bill does nothing \nto limit that legal recourse.\n  This issue is underscored by the final quote I would like to share \nwith you by Messrs. Civiletti, Thornburg, and Webster:\n\n       Whether the government has acted properly is a different \n     question from whether a private person has acted properly in \n     responding to the government's call for help. From\n\n[[Page S474]]\n\n     its earliest days, the common law recognized that when a \n     public official calls on a citizen to help protect the \n     community in an emergency, the person has a duty to help and \n     should be immune from being hauled into court unless it was \n     clear beyond doubt that the public official was acting \n     illegally. Because a private person cannot have all the \n     information necessary to assess the propriety of the \n     government's actions, he must be able to rely on officials \n     assurances about need and legality. Immunity is designed to \n     avoid the burden of protracted litigation, because the \n     prospect of such litigation itself is enough to deter \n     citizens from providing critically needed assistance.\n\n  Madam President--I agree with these distinguished gentlemen.\n  Bottom line, companies who participate in this program do so \nvoluntarily to help America preserve its freedom and security. And that \nsecurity will ensure for the very safety--both individually and \ncollectively--of its citizens.\n  In closing, I would like to state that I have long supported the idea \nof ``an all-volunteer force'' for our military and I believe ``an all-\nvolunteer force'' of citizens and businesses who do their part to \nprotect our great Nation from harm is equally important.\n  Without this retroactive liability provision, I believe companies \nwill no longer voluntarily participate. This will result in a \ndegradation of America's ability to protect its citizens.\n  It is for these reasons that I urge my colleagues to support the \nRockefeller-Bond substitute amendment to grant the men and women of the \nintelligence community the tools they need to protect our country.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From The Wall Street Journal, Oct. 31, 2007]\n\n                          Surveillance Sanity\n\n      (By Benjamin Civiletti, Dick Thornburgh and William Webster)\n\n       Following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, \n     President Bush authorized the National Security Agency to \n     target al Qaeda communications into and out of the country. \n     Mr. Bush concluded that this was essential for protecting the \n     country, that using the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \n     would not permit the necessary speed and agility, and that he \n     had the constitutional power to authorize such surveillance \n     without court orders to defend the country.\n       Since the program became public in 2006, Congress has been \n     asserting appropriate oversight. Few of those who learned the \n     details of the program have criticized its necessity. \n     Instead, critics argued that if the president found FISA \n     inadequate, he should have gone to Congress and gotten the \n     changes necessary to allow the program to proceed under court \n     orders. That process is now underway. The administration has \n     brought the program under FISA, and the Senate Intelligence \n     Committee recently reported out a bill with a strong \n     bipartisan majority of 13-2, that would make the changes to \n     FISA needed for the program to continue. This bill is now \n     being considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n       Public disclosure of the NSA program also brought a flood \n     of class-action lawsuits seeking to impose massive liability \n     on phone companies for allegedly answering the government's \n     call for help. The Intelligence Committee has reviewed the \n     program and has concluded that the companies deserve targeted \n     protection from these suits. The protection would extend only \n     to activities undertaken after 9/11 until the beginning of \n     2007, authorized by the president to defend the country from \n     further terrorist attack, and pursuant to written assurances \n     from the government that the activities were both authorized \n     by the president and legal.\n       We agree with the committee. Dragging phone companies \n     through protracted litigation would not only be unfair, but \n     it would deter other companies and private citizens from \n     responding in terrorist emergencies whenever there may be \n     uncertainty or legal risk.\n       The government alone cannot protect us from the threats we \n     face today. We must have the help of all our citizens. There \n     will be times when the lives of thousands of Americans will \n     depend on whether corporations such as airlines or banks are \n     willing to lend assistance. If we do not treat companies \n     fairly when they respond to assurances from the highest \n     levels of the government that their help is legal and \n     essential for saving lives, then we will be radically \n     reducing our society's capacity to defend itself.\n       This concern is particularly acute for our nation's \n     telecommunications companies. America's front line of defense \n     against terrorist attack is communications intelligence. When \n     Americans put their loved ones on planes, send their children \n     to school, or ride through tunnels and over bridges, they are \n     counting on the ``early warning'' system of communications \n     intelligence for their safety. Communications technology has \n     become so complex that our country needs the voluntary \n     cooperation of the companies. Without it, our intelligence \n     efforts will be gravely damaged.\n       Whether the government has acted properly is a different \n     question from whether a private person has acted properly in \n     responding to the government's call for help. From its \n     earliest days, the common law recognized that when a public \n     official calls on a citizen to help protect the community in \n     an emergency, the person has a duty to help and should be \n     immune from being hauled into court unless it was clear \n     beyond doubt that the public official was acting illegally. \n     Because a private person cannot have all the information \n     necessary to assess the propriety of the government's \n     actions, he must be able to rely on official assurances about \n     need and legality. Immunity is designed to avoid the burden \n     of protracted litigation, because the prospect of such \n     litigation itself is enough to deter citizens from providing \n     critically needed assistance.\n       As the Intelligence Committee found, the companies clearly \n     acted in ``good faith.'' The situation is one in which \n     immunity has traditionally been applied, and thus protection \n     from this litigation is justified.\n       First, the circumstances clearly showed that there was a \n     bona fide threat to ``national security.'' We had suffered \n     the most devastating attacks in our history, and Congress had \n     declared the attacks ``continue to pose an unusual and \n     extraordinary threat'' to the country. It would have been \n     entirely reasonable for the companies to credit government \n     representations that the nation faced grave and immediate \n     threat and that their help was needed to protect American \n     lives.\n       Second, the bill's protections only apply if assistance was \n     given in response to the president's personal authorization, \n     communicated in writing along with assurances of legality. \n     That is more than is required by FISA, which contains a safe-\n     harbor authorizing assistance based solely on a certification \n     by the attorney general, his designee, or a host of more \n     junior law enforcement officials that no warrant is required.\n       Third, the ultimate legal issue--whether the president was \n     acting within his constitutional powers--is not the kind of \n     question a private party can definitively determine. The \n     companies were not in a position to say that the government \n     was definitely wrong.\n       Prior to FISA's 1978 enactment, numerous federal courts \n     took it for granted that the president has constitutional \n     power to conduct warrantless surveillance to protect the \n     nation's security. In 2002, the FISA Court of Review, while \n     not dealing directly with the NSA program, stated that FISA \n     could not limit the president's constitutional powers. Given \n     this, it cannot be said that the companies acted in bad faith \n     in relying on the government's assurances of legality.\n       For hundreds of years our legal system has operated under \n     the premise that, in a public emergency, we want private \n     citizens to respond to the government's call for help unless \n     the citizen knows for sure that the government is acting \n     illegally. If Congress does not act now, it would be \n     basically saying that private citizens should only help when \n     they are absolutely certain that all the government's actions \n     are legal. Given the threats we face in today's world, this \n     would be a perilous policy.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I yield the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, we will have a piece of legislation come \nto the floor, we believe tonight--and perhaps tomorrow morning--that \ndeals with the economic stimulus package, as it is called, to try to \nstimulate the economy. We are either in a recession or near a \nrecession.\n  The Federal Reserve Board today took additional action to cut \ninterest rates by another half of 1 percent. That follows the three-\nquarters of 1 percent cut recently by the Fed, within the last week and \na half. So the Federal Reserve Board is using monetary policy tools to \njump-start the economy, and the thought was that the fiscal policy side \ncoming from the Congress and the President would require--or recommend, \nat least--some kind of stimulus package. So there is a stimulus package \nbeing developed that would provide payments--rebates of sorts--to \nAmerican taxpayers. The discussion in the U.S. House is $600 per \ntaxpayer. The Senate bill that has been proposed is $500 or $1,000 per \ncouple.\n  One can make a number of observations about this, wondering about the \nadvantage and the importance of a fiscal policy that has a stimulus \npackage. I think it is probably necessary for psychological reasons, if \nnot for economic reasons. It is about 1 percent of the GDP that is \nbeing proposed. We have a $13-plus trillion economy, and I don't know \nhow about 1 percent of that--$130 billion, $150 billion--for a stimulus\n\n[[Page S475]]\n\npackage is going to stimulate the economy so much, but I think it is \nprobably psychologically important that we do something here, so I \nexpect to support it.\n  There are a couple of things I intend to recommend. And I don't know \nhow many amendments we will be moving on this bill, and I don't know \nwhat the circumstances might be. I know the bill will be brought to the \nfloor with an unending appetite for amendments, so I understand and \nexpect that we will have to limit some amendments. I want to suggest, \nhowever, two amendments that I think have some merit and that ought to \nbe considered.\n  The first one ought to be really easy, in my judgment. The first one \nis a message we should put on every check that goes out. If we are \nsending checks to American taxpayers, we ought to have on this check \nthis statement, in my judgment: ``Support our economy--buy American.''\n  Now, why is that the case? Well, because of the trade deficit we have \nin this country. You will see the hemorrhaging of red ink as a result \nof our trade deficits year after year. They have grown unbelievably. We \nnow have roughly an $800 billion trade deficit in a year. We have so \nmuch in consumer goods that are being purchased from overseas, with \ncheap labor overseas, and being brought to the big box retailers in our \ncountry and purchased by American consumers. So the proposition of \nsending a rebate to American taxpayers, $500 or $600 per taxpayer, the \npurpose of which is to have them spend that and to boost consumer \nspending and, therefore, boost the economy--it does not do much to \nboost our economy if, in fact, we are providing a rebate, a check to \ntaxpayers, and they spend it on imported goods. In my judgment, that is \nsupporting foreign labor, not American labor.\n  This is American money spent in a way that is designed to boost the \neconomy, and so it seems to me it ought to be sent with a check that \nreminds Americans: Support our economy--buy American. We are going to \nsend, what, probably 150 million checks out in the coming months with \nthe stimulus package? Why not have 150 million messages just to remind \npeople, to the extent they can, that it is very important to buy \nAmerican, because we are trying to stimulate the American economy, not \nthe Chinese economy, not the Japanese economy, and not the European \neconomy. We are trying to stimulate the American economy. So it would \nbe very helpful if they pay a bit of attention to the notion of what \nthis money is about: Support our economy--buy American.\n  I hope there isn't one person in this Chamber who would object to \nthat. It won't cost anything. This would add no cost to the check that \nis to be printed, and it seems to me an important and timely message to \nAmerican consumers. To the extent they can and to the extent they will, \nthey should be reminded that spending these funds in support of the \nproduct of American workers is what invests in and expands opportunity \nin the American economy. That is an amendment which I think should be \nadded. I hope it will be added by unanimous consent, absent a managers' \npackage. It is something that should be easy to do, and I would suspect \nno one would object to the message: Support our economy--buy American.\n  Second, I wanted to make a point about another amendment that I think \nshould be included. I think this is more problematic at this point, but \nit is a piece of legislation I will introduce as well.\n  Part of the economic difficulty in our country is the substantial \nrunup in the price of oil and gasoline. It is interesting to me that \neven as we have seen the price of oil go up, up, up, we see that the \nEnergy Department continues to put oil underground; that is, we receive \nroyalties from certain oil wells, and they take those royalties in \nkind--that is, they take the royalties in the form of barrels of oil \nand they stick it underground in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  Well, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is now about 97 percent full. \nEven though it is 97 percent full and the price of oil has gone to $80, \n$90, and then $100, we are still taking oil and putting it underground. \nWhat that does is it takes oil out of supply and puts upward pressure \non prices. It seems to me we ought to at least take a holiday during \nthis calendar year, as long as oil is above $100 barrel. Why would you \ngo into the market to purchase very high-cost oil and take it off the \nmarket and stick it underground? That puts upward pressure on gas \nprices, and it makes no sense for the Government to be doing that given \nthe fact the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is now 97 percent filled.\n  So I hope--and I have encouraged the Energy Secretary to do this, but \nhe has resisted. So my hope will be that either now or at some point in \nthe future on some appropriate occasion, the Congress will decide to \ntell him: Do not be buying oil at these prices, taking it off the \nmarket and putting it underground. By ``buying it,'' I mean taking it \nas royalty in kind. That makes no sense to do that. You talk about \nstimulating the economy, the way to stimulate the economy is to help \nbring some of these energy costs down.\n  Now about 8.5 million barrels have gone underground in the last 6 \nmonths. Some will say: Well, that is a pretty small part of the amount \nof oil we have and the amount of oil we use. Well, we held a joint \nhearing between the Energy Committee and the Homeland Government \nAffairs Subcommittee on the issue of energy markets, and particularly \noil markets. At that hearing we heard from Dr. Phillip Verleger, who is \nan investigative researcher and energy expert. He pointed out that even \na seemingly small decision with this issue of putting oil back into the \nSPRO at a time when we are short can have significant consequences. He \nsays the DOE is taking what is highly sought after, light sweet crude \nthat is needed right now, and putting that underground in the petroleum \nreserve. He pointed out the volume of light sweet crude that they want \nto put into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve underground has only been \nthree-tenths of a percent of the total global supply available, but it \nwas adding as much as 10 percent to the price of light sweet crude.\n  Yet the Department of Energy insists and maintains that putting this \nroyalty-in-kind oil underground has no consequence at all on the price \nof oil. Clearly it does. That is at odds with testimony we received \nbefore our committees. Clearly it has an impact on the price of \ngasoline. Filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve when we have market \nrecord-high oil prices, as I said, puts upward pressure on the price of \noil because even small volumes of oil off the market can have a \ndramatic price impact. That is especially true with what is called \nlight sweet crude.\n  In recent days we saw President Bush visiting Saudi Arabia to ask the \nOPEC countries, particularly the Saudis, to increase production to help \nease oil prices in our country. Well, the fact is, the OPEC cartel is \ngoing to meet this Friday to discuss whether any change to production \nis warranted. Their decision will impact the price of gasoline in this \ncountry this spring.\n  But there is another decision that will impact it. That is the \ndecision by the Department of Energy to continue taking royalty-in-kind \noil off the market and sticking it underground. This is exactly the \nwrong thing to do at the wrong time.\n  I have always been in favor of a Strategic Petroleum Reserve. But \nwith prices where they are, and an economy that is sluggish, it makes \nno sense to continue to do this. I believe what we ought to do is pass \nsome legislation. If I were writing the stimulus bill, I would include \nthis provision in the stimulus bill.\n  Those are two ideas that I think should be considered. The first I \nwould hope would be considered by unanimous consent. I can't believe \nanybody would object to putting on a check that goes out to 150 million \npeople: Support Our Economy. Buy American. I do not think anybody \nbelieves that we want to provide a bunch of money and hope they will \nspend it on goods made in China. That hardly expands opportunities and \nthe economy in this country. I am not saying they have to spend it on \nAmerican-made goods, but what I am saying is, we ought to remind them, \nto the extent we can, what we are trying to do here, and what this \nstimulus rebate check is all about.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dorgan pertaining to the submission of S.

Madam President, I thank my colleague, Senator Bond, \nthe vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee. He has been working \nfor a full year virtually on trying to accomplish what we need to \naccomplish now.\n  I may not be able to follow the debate, but it seems to me that now \nwe are beginning to hear that somehow despite your determined efforts \nand those of Senator McConnell and our side of the aisle the \nRepublicans are being accused of holding up this legislation.\n  Can you give us your perspective on that? I am sure it is different \nfrom what I have heard on the floor earlier on.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, to respond to my colleague, it would be a \npleasure. Let's go through the record.\n  In April of 2007, the Director of National Intelligence, or the DNI, \nsubmitted a request to update FISA, the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance, law to Congress. The draft legislation that he sent to \nCongress was not a political or partisan piece of legislation, it was \nabsolutely essential because technology has changed and the old FISA \nlaw was prohibiting our agencies from having the ability to go up on a \nforeign target without getting an order of the FISA Court, which \ntotally gridlocked that court.\n  But what he sent up was the result of a year of negotiations and \ncoordination among civil servants in the Department of Justice and our \nintelligence agencies that will actually have to implement the system \nthe legislation will cover. So the people who are running it set up the \nrecommendation.\n\n  Soon after that, there was a court order issued that resulted in \nthese significant gaps. That ruling brought important parts of the \nsystem we use to monitor terrorists overseas to a halt. It created \ndangerous gaps in our ability to collect. The need to pass a permanent \nlegislative fix for FISA suddenly became much more urgent, and the DNI \ncame before the Intelligence Committee in May of 2007 to explain why it \nwas needed and to say how urgent it was.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Indeed, didn't he say it couldn't have come at a worse \ntime to have us be denied this kind of intelligence capability?\n  Mr. BOND. That is correct. As the DNI explained to Congress in a \nclosed-door briefing for all Senators in July of 2007, the FISC ruling \ncame at a time of heightened concern in our intelligence agencies that \nterrorist attacks against the homelands of our allies might be in the \nworks.\n  The DNI explained in that briefing in no uncertain terms the urgent \nneed to update FISA and close the intelligence gaps caused by the \nruling so that our intelligence agencies would have the tools they need \nto detect terrorist plots against our homeland or our troops and allies \noverseas.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. To follow up on that, you are familiar with the NSA and \nhave seen it. Would you dispute his decision based on what you know? \nDidn't you also conclude, as I did, that he was exactly right; this was \nabsolutely critical to our national defense and security?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, yes. I learned at the time why it was so \nessential, and I would say there is a letter from the DNI, a classified \nletter, which is available in our Intelligence Committee offices or in \nS-407 for Senators to read that says what the intelligence community \nwas able to accomplish after the Protect America Act was passed on \nAugust 3, 4, and 5 of last year, which would not have been possible had \nwe not changed the FISA law. So there are clear examples set forth in a \nclassified letter that I invite all my colleagues to review. I would be \nhappy to have them review it.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. When we heard what he said, we got busy. You were one \nof the leaders. We worked through and passed the legislation in August, \njust this past August, that basically affirmed this program and kept it \ngoing. But can you tell us now why we didn't make it permanent at the \ntime?\n  Mr. BOND. First, I am not a big fan of sunsets. If the Intelligence \nCommittee does its job--and with Chairman Rockefeller leading and my \nrole in it, I can assure you that we are looking at all of these laws, \nall of these practices, and authorizing legislation of the intelligence \ncommunity to see if it is working, to see if it is working within \nproper bonds. But I believe that. And I believe the Attorney General \nwas correct when he said we should not sunset these laws because there \nare no sunsets on our enemies' fatwas.\n  That came from our Attorney General. But we did agree to a 6-month \nsunset because Senate Democrats assured me that 6 months was long \nenough to take a systematic look at the law and come up with a strong, \npermanent solution. They believed we needed additional protections that \nhad not existed in the original FISA law. It did not include one of the \nkey elements that the DNI requested in his original April 2007 request. \nWe had to pass a shortened version because of the timeline. But given \nthat we had that sunset, our Intelligence Committee worked very hard, \nafter the passage of the PAA, until we were able to pass on a \nbipartisan basis, by 13 to 2, a strong bill that adds significant new \nprotections for Americans and which permits the DNI to conduct the \nprogram as he thinks it needs to be conducted to assure that our \ncountry is safe.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. How did we get here and why do we need another 15-day \nextension? Why can't we get this thing done?\n  Mr. BOND. That is kind of an obvious question that my colleague has \nasked. The following month, the Judiciary Committee of the Senate put \nout a bill on a straight party-line vote, a partisan substitute which \nwas drafted without getting the effective input of the intelligence \ncommunity, the Department of Justice. And the DNI said it absolutely \nwould not work, so he couldn't support it. So a month after that, on \nDecember 17, the distinguished majority leader brought the bill to the \nSenate floor, thought it very timely to get it done in December, since \nwe have a February 1 expiration date. But several members of the \nmajority party filibustered the bill or actually they phoned in their \nobjections, their filibusters, from campaign stops. And it could not go \nforward. Then the Senate didn't get around to taking up FISA again \nuntil over a month later, on January 23.\n  We only returned to FISA after taking up the Indian health \nlegislation. I don't diminish the importance of that measure, but it \nmight have waited until after we finished FISA.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It seems to me that our Democratic leadership has had \nlegislation from the Director of National Intelligence since April. We \nhave refined it, particularly your committee, the Intelligence \nCommittee, has moved it forward on the floor. And we have just wasted a \nlot of time when we need to be making this permanent.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Unfortunately, my colleague from Alabama is right. I know \nwe both don't want to engage in finger-pointing, but some of my \ncolleagues have been making statements about our efforts on the bill, \nwhich leave me no choice but to correct the record. I invite any of my \ncolleagues who have a different view to come discuss it with me. It is \ncritical that we move forward.\n  We have a 15-day extension. At the end of 15 days, this body goes on \na week's recess. There is no reason we cannot pass this bill, \nconference with the House, and pass it by February 15 so American \ncitizens will have the additional protections this bill includes, and \nour carriers will have the liability they must have to continue to \nparticipate in the program.\n  I thank my colleague from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Senator Bond and Senator Rockefeller and the \nIntelligence Committee. I serve as a member of the Judiciary Committee. \nI strongly opposed the bill that came out of our committee. I believed \nyour bill, the Intelligence Committee bill, which passed 13 to 2 in a \nbipartisan fashion out of the Intelligence Committee, was superior to \nthe one that passed Judiciary on a narrow party-line vote. I also \ngrasped during that debate that one of the real differences was the \nIntelligence Committee members knew what was at stake. That had been \nyour responsibility, to ensure that our intelligence community was\n\n[[Page S477]]\n\nable to function effectively. You knew how the system worked and we \ndidn't. We allowed theoretical ideas and maybe partisan politics to \ninterfere with a simple project which was to identify what we needed to \ndo to fix the broken intelligence system and to do so consistent with \nthe Constitution and liberty.\n  You all worked on that and reached an agreement on it. We continued \nto have nitpicking, complaints, ideas. Everybody has a different idea \nhow they would like to see it done. I guess that is lawyers. Maybe that \nis the Judiciary Committee lawyers as opposed to Intelligence Committee \nmembers.\n  The way I would boil this issue down for the American people is this: \nWe are not asking in this legislation that anything be done to diminish \nthe great liberties we as Americans have come to cherish. Actually, all \nit is doing is facilitating historic concepts of intelligence \nsurveillance that we have always done. Fundamentally, there is no \ndispute that American intelligence officers abroad can intercept such \ncommunications as they are able to intercept without any Federal court \nwarrant or anything else of that nature because the Federal court does \nnot have jurisdiction, one reason, in Europe or the Middle East or \nPakistan or any other country. They just don't have jurisdiction there. \nSo we have always known that our intelligence agencies are capable, \nauthorized, and legally able to do this.\n  In the United States, however, if somebody taps your phone--and we \nhave had so much confusion about this--if a Government agency were to \ntap someone's phone, they are entitled to listen not only to the calls \nthat are placed away from that phone to someone else, they are also \nentitled to listen to phone calls that come into that phone number. \nThat is part of the legal authorization to surveil inside the United \nStates.\n  So the first thing you have to do is have legal authorization to \nsurveil. Once you do, on that phone, then you can listen to the calls \nthat come in. What we do as a matter of practicality is we mitigate if \na phone call comes in on a matter unrelated to the criminal activity \nthat is being surveilled in the United States. That is the way it is.\n  So what I want to say is, don't think this is somehow a retrenchment \nof historic American protections. What we are saying is, if you have a \nlegal authorization to intercept a telephone system in Afghanistan--and \nwe do, our people have a right to intercept a phone conversation--it \nseems to me you also have a right, just as you do if you have a warrant \ninvolving a U.S. citizen, to listen to the phone calls they place into \nthe United States. And if it is not relevant to any kind of terrorist \nactivity, then you would mitigate against it. But if you follow what I \nam saying, once you have the authority, as we do, to intercept a cell \nphone number somewhere, something like that, if you have this activity \nand you intercept that and you can surveil that number, then you are \nable to surveil who they call.\n  If they are calling into the United States to set up a terrorist \norganization to carry out a plot, then that is the kind of call you \nwant to intercept, for heaven's sake. I just don't think we have a big \nissue. I am proud of the committee. They have added protections, \neliminated ideas that could lead to some abuse somewhere, but you have \nwritten a bill that is worthwhile.\n  Let me say about the people at the National Security Agency and our \nFBI and our other agencies that are out doing this kind of work, they \nfollow the laws we give them. Don't think, like you see on television, \non ``24'' and some of these things that people just go around and \nviolate the law on a regular basis. I was a Federal prosecutor for 15 \nyears. People don't put their careers on the line, throw away their \ncareers, violating the law.\n  So we have to have a law that allows them to lawfully do their work \nand not deny them the right or a legitimate power to protect America \nbecause we are putting ourselves at risk, and we should not do it. So I \nam frustrated, forgive me, that we are so timid about allowing the full \nhistorical surveillance capabilities our Nation is used to having at \nthis time when we have unique threats from terrorists who have proven \nthey have the ability to inflict thousands of deaths on Americans.\n  Our good people are working their hearts out. Let's don't make it \nmore difficult for them. Let's affirm what they are doing. We will \ncontinue to monitor it so it is never abused.\n  I thank the chairman and the Intelligence Committee for their \nbipartisan work to serve our country by producing a bill we all can be \nproud of.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I extend my most sincere thanks to my \ncolleague from Alabama, who is a very valuable member of the Judiciary \nCommittee. He does not let the fact that he was a lawyer and a \nprosecutor interfere with the exercise of good judgment. I congratulate \nhim on his very perceptive comments. I thank him for participating with \nme.\n  I also would agree with him. He made the strong point that sensitive \nintelligence matters should be handled in the Intelligence Committee. \nOur intelligence community leaders have said it is very difficult to \npresent matters to a committee when they have to deal in closed session \non so many things. Even the things that may in themselves not be \nclassified are often related to classified materials. So I hope maybe \nwe can take a look at committee jurisdiction in the future.\n  I will take a few minutes to discuss why it is so important the \nSenate pass the bipartisan Rockefeller-Bond substitute amendment \nwithout adding unnecessary or harmful amendments that have not been \nvetted by the intelligence community.\n  There are some colleagues who may believe we can just keep adding \namendments without causing any problem for our intelligence collectors. \nBut the fact is, the legislation is intended, first and foremost, to \nkeep the intelligence gaps that existed prior to the passage of the \nProtect America Act, or PAA, closed. If we do not check with the \nexperts in the intelligence community about whether their proposals \nwill enable the intelligence community to keep the gaps closed, and if \nwe do not heed their advice, the legislation can have--and often has--\nunintended consequences that impede vital intelligence collection.\n  An example of why this is so important: There was a substitute \namendment included in the Rockefeller-Bond bill that provides \nadditional protections for Americans traveling overseas. Originally, \nthis amendment was offered by the Senator from Oregon--a valued member \nof our committee. His intent--which I share, and the intelligence \ncommunity shares--is to provide overseas Americans with the same level \nof court review and approval as Americans in the United States receive. \nWe believe that is very important.\n  The amendment passed in the committee despite my vote in opposition \nbecause of the drafting that the amendment had not been vetted by the \nintelligence community. It turned out it would have been unworkable, \ncausing unintended consequences, including impeding important \nintelligence collection on legitimate targets, if it was passed as it \nwas.\n  But the chairman and I worked with Senators Wyden and Whitehouse over \nthe past few months so we could make this functional--a well-\nintentioned amendment, a very valuable addition to this bill. We fixed \nthat provision, and it is in the managers' amendment that Chairman \nRockefeller and I have. So we will have a workable bill, one that the \nDNI supports, and one we can be very proud of, because it does extend \nadditional protections to American citizens and U.S. persons abroad.\n  But when we had to fix this issue, what we thought was a simple \namendment took 24 pages of language to make sure we did not have \nunintended consequences--in an amendment that was originally only 3 \npages long. I raise this not to criticize the authors of the amendment \nbut to thank them for their cooperation.\n  But the basic principle is a principle of medicine, and we can apply \nit to the intelligence legislation: First, do no harm. I am concerned \nabout the unwillingness of some colleagues who have proposed \nlegislation to call the office of the DNI or NSA to make sure their \namendments would do no harm. If amendments cause the intelligence gaps \nto reopen, the legislation will be worthless, probably will not pass, \nand will not be signed into law.\n\n[[Page S478]]\n\n  An example of how well a bipartisan FISA reform bill can function is \nthe Protect America Act. I have said before that the PAA did exactly \nwhat it was intended to do: it closed the intelligence gaps that \nthreatened the security of our Nation and our troops. It did so in a \ntruncated fashion, but it worked for 6 months.\n  Now, there are some Members who criticize the PAA and call it flawed. \nBut let there be no doubt, the PAA has been a great success. It did not \nopen any new powers that had not existed before the technology changed \nand brought applications of new limitations on our collectors.\n  Next, I want to call attention to a letter received by the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence on January 25 from the DNI. Director \nMcConnell wrote that the authorities provided by Congress, through the \nProtect America Act, passed in August of last year, have ``allowed the \nIntelligence Community to collect vital foreign intelligence \ninformation, and made the Nation safer by enabling the IC to close gaps \nin our foreign intelligence collection.''\n  Let me repeat that: It has enabled the intelligence community to \nclose gaps in our foreign intelligence collection.\n\n  More specifically, Director McConnell said the PAA has enabled the \nintelligence community to obtain information related to disruption of \nplanned terrorist attacks against Americans, efforts by an individual \nto become a suicide operative, instructions to a foreign terrorist \nassociate about entering the United States, efforts by terrorists to \nobtain guns and ammunition, terrorist facilitator plans to travel to \nEurope, information on money transfers; plans for future terrorist \nattacks, and movements of key extremist groups to evade arrest--among \nothers.\n  While I cannot say anything more publicly about these examples, I can \nsay these are examples of how the PAA disrupted ongoing and planned \nattacks against our interests, our allies, and our citizens. The \nDirector did send the committee a classified letter laying out the \ndetails of these disruptions. He also gave examples of how collection--\nthat had faltered because of a FISA Court decision in the spring--was \nrenewed under the PAA. As a result, key intelligence against terrorists \nwas collected.\n  I have reviewed the letter. I think any of our colleagues interested \nin this subject should go to the Senate Intelligence Committee offices \nor to S-407 to read the classified letter for themselves to see how the \nPAA has helped save American lives.\n  Director McConnell has told us some targets might not have been \npursued without the PAA because of the administrative, analytic, and \nlegal burden of seeking FISA orders. Keep in mind, these orders would \nhave been FISA orders to collect information on foreigners, not \nAmericans.\n  It is clear from my reading of Director McConnell's letter that most \nof the successes he identified would not have occurred had it not been \nfor the PAA.\n  While the PAA has been key to gathering unique and vital intelligence \ninformation, Director McConnell does not support its extension. The \nreason he does not support the renewal--one that has been critical to \nenabling the intelligence community he leads to do its job--is because \nit does not include retroactive civil liability protection. In his \nletter, and on numerous occasions--and in every substantive discussion \nI have had with him--the Director has said that we cannot gather this \nkind of information in sensitive intelligence areas without the \ncooperation of private parties.\n  Despite the success of the intelligence community's ability to \ncollect intelligence under the PAA, Director McConnell does not support \nits extension without this retroactive civil liability provision \nbecause he believes the voluntary cooperation of private parties is \nnecessary to the success of the program. I have stated previously in \nanswers to questions of my colleagues precisely why it would work. By \nimplication, it seems he is concerned, wisely, I believe, that carriers \nwill no longer cooperate with the Government if they fear being dragged \ninto expensive lawsuits.\n  Again, for all these reasons, we must pass and get the bill out of \nhere--I hope at least by early next week--and pass a conference report \nbefore February 15. The Rockefeller-Bond substitute is that bill.\n  A lot of questions have been asked about when we are going to move \nforward. We have exchanged papers back and forth. Chairman \nRockefeller's staff and my staff have negotiated extensively. We need \nto get the concurrence of the leaders on both sides. I hope we are \nclose to getting a workable framework. This is such a critical piece of \nlegislation. I do not want to hold it up any longer.\n  I know my colleagues have been waiting for votes. Nobody has been \nmore anxious than Chairman Rockefeller and I. We understand how \nimportant this issue is. We hope to give this body some real action on \nmoving the bill forward sooner rather than later. We will need the \nleaders, who will make the decisions. We will need the cooperation of \nall colleagues on both sides. Let's hope we can come to a successful \nresolution.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, the psalmist prayed:\n\n       Do not cast me off when I am old. Do not forsake me when my \n     strength fails.\n\n  That is really the question before us as we get to the economic \nstimulus bill, which is the bill that is going to send out rebate \nchecks to Americans: Will the Senate cast off 20 million seniors? Will \nthe Senate forsake 20 million of the neediest Americans?\n  A vote for the Finance Committee substitute is a vote for 20 million \nAmerican senior citizens who have worked hard all their lives, who have \npaid taxes for a lifetime. They contribute to the economy today. But \nthe underlying House-passed bill would not give them a rebate check.\n  The House-passed bill says no to 20 million American seniors. The \nHouse bill gives checks only to the more affluent seniors whose incomes \nare high enough that they pay taxes now. The House-passed bill would \nnot give a stimulus check to seniors who are scraping by on Social \nSecurity income alone and have no tax liability. To state it \ndifferently, the House-passed bill says no to the most neediest \nseniors, not only 20 million American seniors, but the House bill says \nno to the 20 million American seniors who happen to be the most needy. \nThese 20 million seniors have given a lifetime of labor. They have \ngiven a lifetime of service, and they have paid a lifetime of taxes. \nThe House-passed bill would not give them a stimulus check.\n  Think of a grandmother who needs money for food, medicine. America's \neconomy is slowing down. Times are\n\n[[Page S479]]\n\ngetting tough for her. Prices for food, gasoline, and home heating oil \nhave skyrocketed right before our eyes. She has a harder time making \nends meet. For many of our Nation's senior citizens, their only source \nof funds for these necessities is a once-a-month envelope from Social \nSecurity. Any Social Security beneficiary will tell that you she has \nnot seen the amount of her check increased enough to cover today's \nrising costs. I am sure the benefits may be going up a little bit, but \nthey clearly do not cover the increase in rising costs. Again, the \nFinance Committee package says yes to those 20 million American seniors \nwho we believe should be included. They should also get a rebate check. \nThe House-passed bill says no to those 20 million American seniors. It \nsays to seniors who happen to be the most needy, no, we are not going \nto give you a rebate check. That is the basic reason why I believe the \nSenate Finance Committee package passed today is by far the better \nalternative.\n  Just think, when Congress acts on an economic stimulus package this \nweek, tomorrow, whenever it is, we should insist on that tax rebate for \nthe 20 million low-income seniors who can use that money right now. A \nrebate for seniors is no feel-good measure. Obviously, it is the right \nthing to do. Rebates for 20 million more seniors will help the economic \nstimulus package work better. Why is that? Because seniors are among \nAmerica's most likely to spend a refund right away and pump cash back \ninto the economy.\n  This chart basically demonstrates that. According to the Bureau of \nLabor Statistics, Americans over age 65 are responsible for over 14 \npercent of all consumer spending. People over 65 spend 92 percent of \nthe their yearly incomes. That is represented by the horizontal bar in \nblue, a little bit of purple over on the right. So people over 65 spend \n92 percent of their yearly income. People over age 75 spend 98 percent \nof their incomes. That is higher than any other demographic group over \nthe age of 25.\n  Seniors spend the money they receive. They have to, in most cases, \nspend the money they receive. It is the right thing to do, to give \nsenior citizens access to that rebate check. Why exclude them? Why cut \nseniors out as the House does? That is not right. In addition, seniors \nspend the money they receive. Seniors over age 65 spend 92 percent of \nthe money they receive, and seniors over 75 years of age spend 98 \npercent of the income they receive. So seniors will spend that rebate \ncheck right away. That will make the rebate check all the more \neffective in helping the economy.\n  The Senate needs to do the right thing by America's seniors and by \nthe American economy. We should extend the tax rebate to 20 million \nAmerican senior citizens living on Social Security. The Finance \nCommittee substitute will help 20 million seniors who were left out of \nthe House bill. The Finance Committee amendment will provide seniors \nwith a rebate check of $500 and $1,000, if they are married.\n  What is more, the Finance Committee amendment helps a quarter of a \nmillion disabled veterans with rebate checks. So far I have talked only \nabout senior citizens. The House-passed bill does not give rebate \nchecks to disabled American veterans. The House bill does not provide \nlow-income disabled veterans rebate checks. That is, the House bill \ndoes not give rebate checks to a quarter of a million, and that is \nbecause they do not provide low-income disabled vets with rebate \nchecks.\n  The House discriminates against lower income seniors, 20 million \nAmerican seniors. It discriminates against lower income disabled vets. \nIt says no to a quarter of a million disabled veterans. We in the \nFinance Committee say, no, we should say yes to seniors. We should say \nyes also to disabled veterans who will get the same rebate check as an \nupper income disabled vet.\n  What is more, the Finance Committee amendment helps people who have \nlost their jobs. Don't you think that is the right thing to do, help \npeople who have lost their jobs, particularly as we are either in a \nrecession or close to a recession? The Finance Committee amendment \nprovides an additional 13 weeks of unemployment insurance, and high \nunemployment States will qualify for an extra 13 weeks. The House bill \ndoes not provide an extension for unemployment insurance. It says no. \nIt says, no, I am sorry, too bad. If you have lost your job and your 26 \nweeks is already up, which is the case for a higher proportion of \nAmerica's unemployed today than at any other time in recent history, \nthe House says, no, sorry. Even though you need the money, even though \nyou would have clearly spent the rebate check, they say, no. The House \nbill doesn't provide that extension.\n  There are almost a million more unemployed Americans than there were \nunemployed a year ago. The Congressional Budget Office found that \nunemployment insurance has a great bang for the buck. That is, people \nwho are unemployed who receive their unemployment insurance spend it. \nIn fact, economy.com, a company which analyzes these things--their \nperson testified today or yesterday before the Budget Committee--found \nthat each dollar spent on extended unemployment insurance benefits \nwould generate $1.64 in increased economic activity. That is a good \none. In straight economic terms, for every $1 spent, $1.64 is the \nresult in increased economic activity.\n  The bipartisan stimulus bill enacted after 9/11 included an \nunemployment insurance extension. President Bush signed that extension. \nWhy don't we do it now? We all know what dire straits the economy is \nin. The Federal Reserve system cut the Fed funds rate another half \npercent. When you add it up in the last 4 or 5 months, 1 percent plus \nthree-quarters plus another half, what does that amount to? That is a \n2\\1/4\\-percentage points reduction in the last several months. They are \nworried. But those rate cuts take time to work their way through the \neconomy. An economic stimulus package has an effect right away. That is \nwhy we believe we should have components in the economic stimulus \npackage which improve upon the House bill and give 20 million seniors \nrebate checks and a quarter of a million disabled vets rebate checks \nand also extended unemployment benefits.\n\n  The Finance Committee amendment helps American businesses that need \nhelp. The Finance Committee amendment would extend what is called the \ncarryback period for net operating losses from 2 years to 5 years. Why \nis that important? Generally, a cyclical business has some profitable \nyears followed by loss years. During loss periods, the company will \ncarry back the net operating losses for the lost years to the prior \nprofitable years. They will file a quick refund claim. The quick refund \nclaim acts as a cash infusion and allows the company to survive the \nloss period. The House bill doesn't take care of that. The housing \nindustry would greatly benefit from an increased carryback period.\n  This whole economic downturn was sparked by a so-called subprime \nproblem, the housing problem, a glut of houses. And the expanded period \nwould allow builders to avoid selling land and houses at distressed \nprices.\n  Additionally, it would enable less costly financing, improving \nbusiness conditions for an eventual return of the housing market. The \nexpanded period would give the housing industry cash to meet payroll. \nThat is not a bad thing to do when we are in an economic downturn. That \nwould stop additional job losses. The National Association of \nManufacturers has written us in the committee in support of the Finance \nCommittee's net operating loss proposal because they know it is the \nright thing to do to help maintain jobs.\n  These are all good reasons to vote for the Finance Committee \nsubstitute. It would help disabled veterans. It would help unemployed \nAmericans. It would help businesses struggling with the business cycle. \nIt would help 20, I think the figure is 20 million American senior \ncitizens. I start where I began. I repeat this point because it is so \nimportant. The biggest difference between the Finance Committee \nsubstitute and the underlying House bill is 20 million seniors. A vote \nfor the Finance Committee substitute is a vote for those seniors. Keep \nthis in mind: 20 million, right here. That is the number of seniors to \nwhom we would give rebate checks because it is the right thing to do, \nto add 20 million to the House-passed bill, which does not give rebate \nchecks, which is clearly the wrong thing to do.\n  Senators should not cast off seniors. Senators should not forsake \nthem. Rather, let us recognize their lifetimes\n\n[[Page S480]]\n\nof labor, recognize their key role in stimulating the economy. Look at \nour senior citizens. They are the real salt, the rock of America. Our \nmothers and fathers and grandfathers, most of them passed through the \nDepression era. Some are a little old for the Depression era, but they \nhave values that are so important for our country. They are the people \nwho paid taxes all their lives. They worked all their lives. They \nprovided service to so many of us and our families and to other \nneighbors in the community. Let us recognize their key role in \nstimulating the economy, and let us pass the Finance Committee \nsubstitute for those 20 million American seniors.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, on January 25, all who work and struggle \nfor social and economic justice, who dedicate themselves to peace and \nending war, lost a wonderful friend in Sister Dorothy Marie Hennessey. \nThe world lost a true Christian soul who, in her own quiet, humble way, \nfought relentlessly for peace and social justice.\n  Sister Dorothy lived 94 years, 67 of them as a member of the Sisters \nof St. Frances. She was the eldest of 15 brothers and sisters who grew \nup on a farm near Oneida, IA, taught by their parents that the Golden \nRule was not an abstraction but a way of life. She fondly always \nremembered that her family ``always fed and housed the tramps who came \nto [their] farm.''\n  Sister Dorothy kept her theology simple and straightforward. She \nsaid:\n\n       I've learned in 75 years in the convent that God is a \n     compassionate God who loves all of us, but who also loves the \n     poor and the people who are oppressed.\n\n  But Sister Dorothy also believed, in the words of President Kennedy, \nthat ``God's work on Earth must truly be our own.'' She was the \nopposite of a cloistered nun. She was an activist. She stepped forward \nboldly, if humbly, to make the world a better and fairer and more just \nplace.\n  She taught in Catholic schools in the Dubuque area for 28 years and \nanother 4 years in Portland, OR. But in the 1960s, her social \nconsciousness came alive. She was deeply disturbed by the tragedy \nunfolding in Vietnam. And she was shocked to learn from her brother, \nalso a priest--Father Ron Hennessey, a longtime missionary in Latin \nAmerica--about the atrocities committed by dictators and their death \nsquads in Central America.\n  Father Ron was, as we know--and he was a friend of mine, and I knew \nhim well--also a friend of Archbishop Oscar Romero of El Salvador, and \nhe witnessed the Salvadoran military firing on mourners after the \narchbishop's assassination.\n  Sister Dorothy became a leader in a newly formed human rights group \nin Dubuque and spent the rest of her life engaging in principled acts \nof dissent and protest, at times putting her own life at risk.\n  For example, in 1984, she went to Nicaragua with the group Witness \nfor Peace, acting as human shields to protect northern border villages \nfrom attacks by the CIA-backed Contras.\n  In 1986, at the age of 73, she joined more than 1,000 activists in \nthe Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament, traveling 3,500 \nmiles from Los Angeles to Washington, DC--at the age of 73.\n  Beginning in 1997, she participated in annual protests at the School \nof the Americas at Fort Benning, GA, where graduates had been \nimplicated in human rights abuses all over Latin America, Central \nAmerica, including the murder of six Jesuit priests in El Salvador.\n  Sister Dorothy was arrested three times for crossing the line onto \nthe Army base. On the third occasion, at the age of 88, she was one of \n3,600 protesters who were arrested. Twenty-six of them were selected by \nlottery to be prosecuted in Federal court, including Sister Dorothy and \nher sibling, Sister Gwen, also a Franciscan Nun.\n  Sister Dorothy was sentenced by a Federal judge to 6 months of \ndetention in her convent, but she refused this leniency. She insisted \non receiving the same treatment as her other 25 codefendants. So her \nsentence was changed to 6 months at the Federal Prison Camp in \nIllinois. As a Des Moines Register columnist noted, ``She was allowed \nto take her hearing aids, but not her Bible.''\n  After a month and a half, she was transferred to a correctional \nfacility in Dubuque, supposedly for health reasons. But Sister Dorothy \nknew better. The real reason was the Federal Government's sheer \nembarrassment at incarcerating an 88-year-old nun because she dared to \nstand up for justice.\n  During her time in prison, Sister Dorothy was interviewed by a \nreporter with the Public Broadcasting System. She said:\n\n       I feel that it's our duty. We can't protest everything, but \n     we can pick out some of the worst things to protest, and \n     that's what I've tried to do.\n\n  So into her eighties, nineties, Sister Dorothy continued to find new \nways to serve people and to help change the world for the good. From \n1996 to 2000, she worked as a daily volunteer at Clare House, a \nresidence in Cedar Rapids for people with AIDS. She cooked and cleaned \nfor the patients. She spoke out loudly and clearly, also, for the \nrights of gays and lesbians.\n  On a personal note, I will always be grateful to Sister Dorothy for \nher many years of friendship and counsel. It has been one of the \nprivileges of my life to know so many members of that wonderful, \nwonderful Hennessey family--Father Ron, all the years he risked his \nlife in Central America, and both Sister Dorothy and Sister Gwen, and \nanother sister. There is Sister Miriam, who was tragically killed in a \ncar incident some years ago. What a wonderful family.\n  Sister Dorothy worked for a while as a senior intern in my Dubuque \noffice. I say ``for a while''--actually, for 8 years. She was a great \nmentor and inspiration to all of my staff.\n  So I will always cherish my friendship not only with Sister Dorothy \nbut also with Sister Gwen, Sister Miriam, Father Ron, and so many other \nmembers whom I have known of the entire Hennessey family.\n  Madam President, as you can clearly see, Sister Dorothy was a \nremarkable person. I am reminded of the old saying: We make a living by \nwhat we make; but we make a life by what we give. Throughout her \namazing life, Sister Dorothy was the ultimate giver. She gave her adult \nlife to the church and to the Sisters of St. Frances. She gave more \nthan three decades of dedicated service to her students. She gave her \nservice on boards and in countless volunteer organizations. And, as I \nhave pointed out, she gave of herself in dissent and protest many times \nagainst oppression and to end war.\n  She gave us her moral passion. She gave us her fine Christian \nexample. She gave us her courage and decency, her love and friendship. \nShe gave it all she had to make sure the world was a better place, that \nwe all--all--had that prickling conscience that things were not right \nwhen poor people suffered, when war became the norm, when there were so \nmany abuses of human rights and oppression against the disenfranchised \nand the poor in this country and in other places around the globe.\n  So after a rich lifetime of service, Sister Dorothy has been called \nhome. She left the world a better place. I am deeply grateful to have \nhad her as a friend. To all of the Franciscan nuns, to her family, of \ncourse, my deepest condolences from me and all of my family on her \npassing, but also our deepest thanks for sharing such a wonderful, \nmagnificent person with us during her lifetime.\n  We will remember her and hopefully honor Sister Dorothy by continuing \nto do what we can to make sure that our Government works more for \nsocial justice and economic justice, that we turn away from the \ninstruments of war and the funding for war and making war sort of the \nnorm, and that we reach out in understanding and peace to the rest of \nthe world. She would have not only asked nothing less, she would have \ndemanded nothing less of us.\n\n[[Page S481]]\n\n  So we say goodbye to Sister Dorothy and, again, honor her memory by \ncontinuing to do what we can in our lifetimes to continue in her great \nwork.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that an article that \nappeared today in the Des Moines Register by Rekha Basu regarding \nSister Dorothy be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Des Moines Register, Jan. 30, 2008]\n\n          Basu: Dubuque Nun Taught Us To Stand Up for Beliefs\n\n                            (By Rekha Basu)\n\n       At 88, Sister Dorothy Marie Hennessey of Dubuque was \n     arrested for trespassing on a U.S. military base. She'd been \n     protesting a school reputed to train Latin American military \n     members to repress democracy advocates. Noting her advanced \n     age, the judge offered her the option of staying under house \n     arrest in her convent.\n       ``I appreciate your thoughtfulness,'' replied the \n     diminutive nun. ``But I am not an invalid. I'd like to have \n     the same sentence the others have.''\n       So Sister Hennessey began her six-month prison term (the \n     maximum sentence), along with 25 others, at the Federal \n     Correctional Institution in Pekin, Ill. She was allowed to \n     take her hearing aids, but not her Bible.\n       The woman dubbed ``the radical nun,'' the activist who in \n     her 70s walked across the country to protest the Cold War, \n     died last week at age 94--and the planet is poorer for it. We \n     lost a passionate champion of peace and justice who, even \n     while protesting war and injustice, maintained an unflagging \n     sense of optimism.\n       ``I consider it a spiritual commitment because I've learned \n     in my almost 70 years in the convent that God is a \n     compassionate God who loves all of us,'' she once said, ``but \n     who also loves the poor and the people who are oppressed.''\n       Though she was a giant in every way but physically, Sister \n     Hennessey's name wasn't a household one in Iowa. It should \n     be. She earned a place in both the Iowa Women's Archives and \n     Wikipedia, was written about in the New York Times and was \n     interviewed on PBS. And with her biological sister Gwen, also \n     a Franciscan nun, she was awarded the Pacem in Terris Award \n     from the Davenport Catholic Diocese in 2002, earning a place \n     among such luminaries as Daniel Berrigan, Cesar Chavez, \n     Desmond Tutu, Martin Luther King Jr. and Mother Teresa. The \n     award is named after a Papal encyclical by Pope John XXIII \n     that calls upon people of goodwill to bring peace among \n     nations. It recognized the sisters for ``living out the \n     Gospel through their work on behalf of the poor and for \n     peace.''\n       The oldest of 15 children, Sister Hennessey was born in \n     1913 in Manchester and raised on a farm. She spent 75 years \n     at St. Francis in Dubuque and taught in various Iowa \n     communities and in Portland, Ore.\n       It was her brother, the late Ron Hennessey, a longtime \n     missionary in Latin America, who first inspired her social \n     activism. His letters from Guatemala and El Salvador in the \n     1980s told of terrorism and killings of Mayan Indians in his \n     parish by Guatemalan death squads. Brutal wars in Central \n     America were being waged using American guns and money.\n       A friend of Archbishop Oscar Romero of El Salvador, Father \n     Hennessey wrote of witnessing the Salvadoran military firing \n     on mourners in the cathedral after Romero's assassination.\n       Sister Hennessey centered her protests on the Army's School \n     of the Americas in Fort Benning, Ga., because it trained \n     Latin American soldiers and police. The school said it gave \n     them a professional education. Protesters said it taught \n     torture. Graduates from the school were later implicated in \n     the 1989 murders of six Jesuit priests and two women in El \n     Salvador. The protest that sent Sister Hennessey to prison \n     involved a mock funeral procession. The school was closed a \n     month later, but it reopened under a different name.\n       In an interview from prison in 2001 on PBS ``Religion and \n     Ethics,'' Sister Hennessey told host Bob Abernethy, ``I feel \n     that it's our duty. We can't protest everything, but we can \n     pick out some of the worst things to protest, and that's what \n     I've tried to do.''\n       Fortunately, her sister remains to carry on the family \n     legacy.\n       Sister Hennessey taught many things, including courage, \n     compassion and the importance of independent thought and \n     creative action.\n       She taught that aging gracefully can be compatible with \n     living meaningfully, and even dangerously. But most \n     important, she taught that we don't have to stand by in \n     frustration when wrongs are perpetrated, even by our \n     government; that the world is best served when we stand up \n     for what's right. And that you do whatever you can from \n     wherever you are.\n       In her case, it was the Lord's work.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues in the \nDemocratic leadership to move forward with the 2007 farm bill. Last \nJuly, the House of Representatives passed the 2007 farm bill by a vote \nof 231 to 191. Last December, the Senate followed suit by passing its \nversion of the 2007 farm bill by a vote of 79 to 14. Certainly there \nare controversial provisions in each bill that must be addressed as we \nmove forward. However, the bipartisan support for these bills is \noverwhelming. In fact, with 79 votes, this Senate-passed farm bill \nreceived more votes than any farm bill in the past 30 years.\n  Unfortunately, little progress has been made since that time. The \nrespective chairs of the House and Senate Agriculture Committees need \nto focus on naming conferees and working together to reconcile their \ndifferences. Right now, my understanding is both chairs have been \nmeeting with the administration, both saying they are making no \nheadway. It seems to me that ultimately we need to work in a bipartisan \nmanner to resolve the differences between the House and the Senate \nversions of the farm bill, and that begins by naming conferees to a \nfarm bill conference committee. We only have 6 weeks left to name \nconferees, reconcile the Senate and House-passed farm bills, and \ndeliver a farm bill that meets the needs of America's producers and can \nbe signed into law by the President.\n  Additionally, in March, the Congressional Budget Office will issue a \nnew baseline for agricultural programs. On account of high prices and a \nsuccessful agricultural industry, the CBO will likely predict that few \nfarm payments will be made in the coming years. The result is that \nCongress will have even fewer dollars to write the new farm bill, which \nwill further magnify our current budgetary issues associated with this \nfarm bill.\n  Our farmers and ranchers are already making their planting decisions \nfor this spring. Many are wondering what regulatory regime will impact \ntheir operations. Will it be the 2007 farm bill--now the 2008 farm \nbill--which Congress and the Agriculture Committees have been debating \nfor the past 12 months? Will it be the 2002 farm bill which has served \nour producers well but expires in 45 days or will it be the 1949 and \n1938 farm bills, which are the last farm bills with permanent \nauthorizations?\n  In recent days, some have threatened to let the 2002 farm bill expire \nand revert to a permanent farm bill policy which was drafted almost 60 \nyears ago. The two laws that would govern most farm programs passed in \neither 1938 or 1949 are what we refer to as permanent law. If Congress \nfails to approve new legislation that would set aside those permanent \nlaws, and if Congress also fails to extend the current farm bill, then \nthese two old laws once again become operational.\n  Now, among other things, permanent legislation would require USDA to \nestablish acreage allotments and marketing quotas for price-supported \ncrops and for producers to vote whether to approve quotas. Some \nagricultural producers actually might benefit from the permanent farm \nbill, while other producers in our conservation programs would \ndramatically suffer. If you are a wheat grower, the loan rate for wheat \nwould be $8.32. That is something a lot of wheat growers would probably \nlike to see. Corn loan rates would be $4.12, and, of course, there \nwould be no countercyclical or direct payments that we have in the farm \nbill that we are operating under today, and no support program for \nsoybeans under the permanent farm law we would revert to--the 1938-1949 \nlaws I referred to--if, in fact, we don't take action to either extend \nthe current farm bill or get the new one passed.\n  Milk purchases by the Commodity Credit Corporation would be \nestablished at $28.20 per hundredweight, far\n\n[[Page S482]]\n\nmore expensive than provisions in the 2002 and 2007 farm bills. Most \nconservation programs would also expire on March 15 of this year, 2008, \nincluding the CRP. If conservation programs expire, no new acres could \nbe signed up by producers.\n  I call on the leadership--the Democrat leaders are the ones who get \nthis process rolling by naming conferees and allowing the process to \nmove forward, but I think that both sides, frankly, need to put aside \nany bickering and fingerpointing that is going on and move forward with \na farm bill process that will enable us to get a bill, a signable bill \non the President's desk before March 15 when the current farm bill \nexpires.\n  Moving forward on the farm bill debate requires a few critical steps. \nFirst, as I said before, there has to be an announcement and naming of \nfarm bill conferees, and that should happen immediately. Conferees need \nto begin meeting to iron out policy differences between both bills and \nto come to an agreement on funding. As the conferees do that, and the \ncommittee works, then they can negotiate in good faith with USDA in an \nattempt to reach an agreement on a bill the President could sign. \nCongress then could pass the bill, get a conference report, move it \nthrough the House, move it through the Senate, and get it on to the \nPresident for his consideration.\n\n  Our agricultural producers, our conservation organizations, our \nschool nutrition groups, our renewable energy sector are all waiting \npatiently for Congress to work its will with this farm bill. The time \nfor action is now. We simply cannot afford further delay.\n  Probably the most frequently asked question when I am back in my home \nState of South Dakota as I travel around the State is: When are we \ngoing to get a farm bill? Are we making any headway on the farm bill? \nWhen is the conference going to meet on the farm bill? Agricultural \norganizations that come here to Washington to visit pose that same \nquestion, because they have every reason to believe that based on the \naction that was taken by the House and the Senate last year, this \nconference committee process would be underway and we would be well on \nthe way to getting a new farm bill enacted. We can't afford to wait any \nlonger. We have farmers and ranchers who are depending upon us, who are \nrelying on us to make good decisions and good judgments and to get a \nbill passed that will serve the purposes of promoting agriculture, \nmaking us globally competitive, and in the years ahead.\n  I simply urge my colleagues in the leadership--and again, my \nassumption at this point is, of course, that the reason we haven't \ngotten conferees named is for some reason the leadership--the Democrat \nleader, perhaps--doesn't want to name conferees. I think the same thing \nis happening on the House side. My understanding is House conferees \nhave not been named either. This process cannot move forward until that \nhappens.\n  Now, I am told too that there is a belief that we have to get this \nworked out with the White House or the administration before conferees \ncan begin to meet. That is simply, to me, the reverse of how this ought \nto work. Chronologically, Congress has to act before we can put a bill \non the President's desk for his consideration and ultimately his \nsignature or veto. So Congress has to do its work first before the \nadministration can do its.\n  I have some concerns, based upon comments that have been made by the \nadministration, about their intentions with regard to the farm bill. \nThere have been veto threats hanging over this bill. I think that would \nbe a big mistake. I will convey that in no uncertain terms, and have, \nto members of the administration. The administration is raising a \ncouple of issues about how the bill is paid for. They don't like the \nway the bill was paid for in the House, which included a tax increase. \nI accept that. I think that would create big problems here in the \nSenate as well. But the financing mechanisms that were used by the \nSenate, many of them are financing mechanisms that had been proposed by \nthe administration in previous budgets submitted to Congress. So it \nseems to me at least we can work through that issue. They would like to \nsee additional reforms in the area of payment limits. Until we get the \nconferees together and start meeting and working out these differences, \nnone of this is going to happen.\n  To get this process jump started, we need to have conferees announced \nand named and get the process moving forward again with an eye toward a \nMarch 15 deadline that if we don't meet, we are going to put our \nproducers in a very precarious position relative to their decisions \nthey have to make about this new planting year and, furthermore, \njeopardize a lot of programs that are in this farm program that are so \ngood, not just for agriculture but for the rural economy and arguably \nfor our national economy.\n  The conservation title in this farm bill includes programs such as \nthe Conservation Reserve Program, the Wetland Reserves Program, the \nGrasslands Reserve Program, the EQIP program. Some of the best \nenvironmental policy that we do as a Congress is found in the farm \nbill. If we don't take action by March 15, that conservation title \nwould expire and no producers could be enrolling in those programs.\n  The energy title in the farm bill is a tremendous policy with regard \nto promoting advanced biofuels, the next generation of biofuels. We \nhave had great success in agriculture with corn-based ethanol.\n  It has been a wonderful story, a remarkable story, frankly, of what \nour producers can do. We are already at about 7 billion gallons of \nethanol. In my State of South Dakota alone by the end of this year, we \nwill be producing 1 billion gallons. The two largest ethanol producers \nin the country are headquartered in South Dakota.\n  We have taken the policies that were put in place in the 2005 farm \nbill--the renewable fuel standard and other incentives--and used them \nto grow an industry that not only is expanding the economic base in \nrural areas, but it is accomplishing a major policy objective that I \nthink we all share, and that is reducing our dependence on foreign \nsources of energy.\n  All those energy provisions in this new farm bill which provide \nfinancial, economic incentives for the development, commercialization, \nand research into cellulosic ethanol will all be lost if we cannot get \na new farm bill enacted, and that would be a tremendous loss not only, \nagain, for agricultural areas of this country that can benefit \neconomically from the production of renewable energy, but it would be a \ntremendous loss as well to our Nation as we strive to get less \ndependent on foreign energy and become energy independent.\n  For all those reasons, this bill needs to move forward and needs to \nmove forward now, but it starts simply with the naming of conferees. As \nI look at the calendar, we are already almost to the end of January. We \nwill have a break over President's Day in February. Pretty soon March \nwill be here. March 15 is the deadline. Typically, when you have a bill \nthat is 1,000 pages long, such as the Senate-passed farm bill, it has \nto be reconciled with the House bill. Even though there are many \nsimilarities, there are differences between the two bills that will \nhave to be worked out. As a consequence, it is going to take a certain \namount of time for the conferees to sit down and reconcile and iron out \nthose differences. Then, of course, the conference report has to go \nback to the House and Senate for final approval and adopted by the \nHouse and Senate, and then we have to get it down to the other end of \nPennsylvania Avenue for consideration by the President, hopefully a \nsignature on that bill.\n  We are talking about 6 weeks for all that to happen. That would be a \nrecord in terms of congressional time when it comes to processing, \ndeliberating, and acting on legislation, but it cannot get started \nuntil conferees are named and both House and Senate conferees agree to \nsit down and schedule some meetings so we can move forward with this \nprocess.\n  I am very concerned about this situation. As I said, I don't think \nthere is a day that goes by when I am back in my State of South \nDakota--and it doesn't matter where I am in my State--that I am not \nrunning into somebody who is impacted by the farm bill. In many cases, \nit is producers, farmers, and ranchers, and they are very anxious \nbecause they are probably most directly dependent on the policies we \nput in place in the farm bill. The conservation community, those \ninterested in\n\n[[Page S483]]\n\nwildlife habitats--Pheasants Forever, Ducks Unlimited, groups such as \nthat. We have an extraordinary program in South Dakota that has \nbenefited the economy enormously by creating recreational \nopportunities, hunting opportunities, and it all comes back to having \nthe right kind of habitat and that comes back to conservation policy \nthat is in place in this farm bill.\n  As I said, anybody who is connected to the renewable energy industry, \nthe nutrition programs, this farm bill has a very broad reach in terms \nof who it impacts. It is not just about farmers and ranchers, it is \nabout renewable energy, it is about conservation programs, it is about \nnutrition programs.\n  As a consequence, the ramifications of our lack of action are very \nfar reaching. I am very hopeful this will happen and happen soon. But I \nwanted to come down here this evening and convey to my colleagues in \nthe Senate and to the leaders the importance of this happening and \nhappening in a very short order.\n  I again suggest the leadership appoint conferees and the conferees \nbegin to meet and let's get this train moving forward.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are the wealthiest nation in the world. \nYet American children go to bed hungry, and American seniors choose \nbetween food and medicine, between food and heating their home. \nAmerican families stand in line at food banks stretched too thin to \nserve them.\n  There is a term for what millions of Americans face every day. It is \ncalled food insecurity. It means children are not getting the food they \nneed to grow up healthy in too many cases. It means mothers and fathers \nforegoing food for themselves so they can feed their kids in too many \ncases. It means seniors who are rationing their food to one meal a day \nin too many cases.\n  I stood on this floor as long as a year ago telling the story of \nRhonda Stewart who testified in front of the Agriculture Committee \nabout food stamps. Ms. Stewart has a 9-year-old son. She has a full-\ntime job, she is president of her local PTA, she is involved in the Cub \nScouts for her son, and she teaches Sunday school. Yet she is squeezed \nat the end of every month because her food stamps simply do not go far \nenough. She gets about $6 a day from food stamps. The average food \nstamp in this country is $1 per person per meal. She told me that early \nin the month, she makes pork chops for her son because that is her \nson's favorite meal. They might do that once or twice early in the \nmonth. By the middle of the month, maybe the second or third week, she \nsaid she takes her son to a fast food restaurant, once, maybe twice. \nBut at the end of the month, she often sits at the kitchen table with \nher son as he eats. She sits there not eating, and her son asks: Mom, \nis there something wrong? Are you sick? She says: I just don't feel \nlike eating tonight. She runs out of food month after month.\n  Food insecurity, not having enough food, to put it bluntly, affects \none in six seniors in this country. Our Nation letting children and \nseniors go to bed hungry is as shortsighted as it is heartless.\n  An hour and a half ago, from 6 o'clock until about 7 o'clock, I was \nin a call with more than two dozen people in Ohio who run food banks \nand food pantries from all over the State. Let me tell you some of the \nthings they told me.\n  They told me they have pretty much about the same amount of dollars \nto run their food pantries as they had a year ago or 2 years ago or 3 \nyears ago. A woman by the name of Tina Ossa in southwest Ohio, \ngenerally a pretty affluent part of the State--Butler County, Claremont \nCounty, that area--said she is running out of food in part because the \ncost of frozen chickens--she used to be able to buy a tractor trailer \nload of frozen chickens--has gone up almost 50 percent. She said a \ntractor trailer load of egg noodles has doubled in cost in the last \nyear or so whether they are buying it wholesale or buying it directly \nfrom the food manufacturer.\n  Others told me on this call that the food banks are always sort of \nthe last stop, an emergency safety net. The food stamp benefit is \nlimited to $1 per meal per person. The cost of energy to heat their \nhome has gone up. The cost of going to work has gone up with the cost \nof gas at $3 a gallon. And the last emergency stop for so many people \nis to go to a food bank because it is a safety net. Yet these food \npantries are running out of food.\n\n  One food pantry told me typically this time of year they have 1 \nmillion pounds of food on hand. Now they have 400,000 pounds of food on \nhand. The lady, Ms. Ossa from Fairfield, OH, in Butler County, told me \nshe started that food bank in 1983. It has never been close to as \ndifficult a situation as today. They are getting fewer donations partly \nbecause the Government has not stepped up and partly because the people \nwho have given to them--charity--in the past, who have given dollars \nfor food, are hurting themselves and not as likely to contribute or \ncontribute as much.\n  She said the companies, the supermarkets and food manufacturers, are \nmore efficient and squeeze any waste out of their system. Any slightly \ndamaged cans, any kind of items they might have given to a food bank \nbefore they are not doing so. They are more in tune to Wall Street and \nthe bottom line, so they are less likely to give these charitable \ncontributions.\n  One person on this call from Cleveland said there is a large bank in \nCleveland where a woman at the bank organized other employees for a \ndress-down Friday. You can wear jeans on Friday if you give $5 to a \nlocal food bank. It has raised significant dollars for the food pantry \nas a result.\n  The husband of this woman who organized this drive at this major bank \nin Cleveland lost his job. She is now barely making it. They together \nare barely making it. The father-in-law has moved in because he has had \nproblems, and she now is going to this food bank. She is a full-time \nworker with a good job in Cleveland, and she is going to this food bank \nbecause she cannot make it.\n  There is story after story. The most amazing story took place in \nLogan, OH, in the southeast, probably the most hard-hit Appalachian \npart of the State. It looks a lot like the area of the Presiding \nOfficer in western Pennsylvania. This is southeastern Ohio.\n  In Logan, OH, on a cold day in December 6 weeks ago, people began to \nline up at 3:30 in the morning to get food from this food bank which \nopened at 8 o'clock. By 8 o'clock, cars were snaked all over the city \nstreets in the town of Logan, a county of about 30,000 people. At 8 \no'clock, they opened the door. By 1 o'clock in the afternoon, 2,000 \npeople had been to this food bank, in a county of 30,000; 7 percent of \nthe residents in this country had gone to this food bank, and many had \ndriven 20 and 30 minutes to get there because it is a rural, pretty \nspread-out county.\n  I might add, Mr. Dick Stevens who runs this food bank told me that \nprobably half of those beneficiaries who visited that food bank at the \nUnited Methodist Church in Logan, OH, were employed. Imagine that: You \nwork hard every day, you play by the rules, you work as hard as any of \nus who dress this way in this institution do, many harder in some \ncases, you are working hard for your family, involved in your \ncommunity, and you have to go to a food pantry to get enough food to \nmake it through the week. Something is wrong that we in this body allow \nthat to happen.\n  Another person involved in food pantries told me 90 percent of the \npeople who come into food banks in Warren County, an affluent county \nstraight northeast out of Cincinnati, the first county out of \nCincinnati, 90 percent of food bank recipients are employed. In some \nplaces, it might be 30 percent employed or 90 percent. The fact is, \nnobody who has a full-time job ought to have to go to food banks, \nespecially since those food banks, in most cases, are giving enough for \n1 week, not 2 or 3, and they don't let them come back as often because \nthey are running out of food. They have the same amount of\n\n[[Page S484]]\n\nfood or less trying to serve more people.\n  It is pretty clear this is as bad a situation as we have seen in \nrecent memory. One of my constituents told me that he and his wife for \nyears have donated time and money to Cleveland area food banks and soup \nkitchens. Over time, as his wages did not go up and with the higher \ncost of transportation, the cost of heating their home and the cost of \nfood, Tim and his wife quit donating money but donate their time to the \nfood banks.\n  Today, Tim is going to the food bank for food. Tim said: It took \ngreat humility in that food bank to ask for food. He said: I used to \nconsider myself middle class, but the salary and cost of living don't \nmake it anymore. The Emergency Food Assistance Program that helps fund \nour Nation's food banks is the quickest, most efficient way to get food \ninto the hands of people as their last stop emergency measure. But \nsince 2002, because the President has had other priorities--tax cuts \nfor the wealthiest Americans, a $3-billion-a-week war--the President \nhas flat funded these food banks. Its current level of $140 million \ndoes not come close to taking care of these problems. Think about that. \nWe talk a good game about personal responsibility, we talk about family \nvalues, yet for the basic level of nutrition, one in six seniors does \nnot have enough food, and even a higher percentage of children in this \nsociety do not have enough food, and people who work full time in this \nsociety--forget about health care; we know many of them don't have \nhealth care--do not have enough food. Yet the President, because of the \n$3-billion-a-week war in Iraq, because he insists, even in his State of \nthe Union Message, on more tax cuts, as Senator Casey, the Presiding \nOfficer, was talking about earlier today, more tax cuts for the richest \npeople in the country, we continue to spend exactly the same shrinking \ndollars for the last 5 years because you cannot buy nearly as much food \non $140 million today as you could 5 years ago. We worked with other \nconcerned colleagues to increase funding for food banks to $250 million \nin the farm bill. There has been bipartisan agreement there. \nUnfortunately, the President has threatened to veto this bill, in part \nbecause of increased spending on nutrition.\n\n  We have also seen the President flat-line funding of the Women, \nInfants and Children program, which is about as pound-foolish and \npenny-wise as you can imagine. We are going to spend less to keep women \nwho are pregnant, low-income women, healthy, spend less on nutrition \nfor them, so we will have more low birth weight babies, more children \nnot getting what is most important after they are born--at the most \nimportant time in their lives, in utero and after they are born--having \nthe kind of nutrition they need--we are not going to fund that? What \nkind of priority is that?\n  It is all a question of priorities. Do we give tax cuts to the \nwealthiest people in this country or do we take care of low-income \nwomen who are pregnant and children after they are born? And are we \ngoing to fund this $3 billion-a-week war in Iraq or are we going to \nlook at some other priorities to take care of the 1-in-6 elderly people \nwho have to choose between food and heat or food and the medicine they \ntake? Are we going to continue to do these tax cuts for the wealthy at \nthe expense of the middle class, at the expense of people who can't \nalways help themselves?\n  Again, most of these people who go to food banks are people who are \nemployed. They are working hard and playing by the rules, and they \nsimply can't quite make it because their incomes haven't kept up with \nthe cost of gasoline in getting to and from work; the cost of heating, \nto stay warm in the winter; and the increasing cost of food.\n  The President hasn't called for emergency measures to aid hungry \nAmericans. He has consistently, as I have said before, tried to cut \nnutrition programs that target populations in desperate need. \nIndifference to human suffering is a moral failure, a moral failure \nthat obscures our Nation's values and dampens our Nation's potential. \nThink about that: children in this country who don't have adequate food \ngrowing up, pregnant women who don't have the right nutrition. \nConsidering what our other priorities are and how much we are spending \non those other priorities, it is clearly something we should be doing \nin this body and in the House of Representatives.\n  In the stimulus package that is about to pass the Senate, we have an \namendment to provide an increase of $100 million for emergency food \nassistance. I know the Presiding Officer supports that, and I know most \nof my colleagues do. We also fear the Republicans will filibuster that \nbecause they do not think we should spend money directly on food \nprograms. Some don't, some do. We know the President has threatened to \nveto anything in the stimulus package that wasn't his idea.\n  There are few things in our country more important than making sure \nseniors, people who have worked all their lives, and children whose \nparents are working hard and playing by the rules and doing their best \nshould be adequately fed and adequately housed. So I urge that this \nCongress, in the next couple days, amend the stimulus package to \ninclude this food assistance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/30/senate-section/article/S484-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S484-S486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               REVISED RULES OF THE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Every member of the committee \n     may designate witnesses who will appear before the committee \n     to testify. To the extent that a witness designated by a \n     member cannot be scheduled to testify during the time set \n     aside for the hearing, a special time will be set aside for \n     the witness to testify if the member designating that witness \n     is available at that time to chair the hearing.\n       Rule 15. Audiences.--Persons admitted into the audience for \n     open hearings of the committee shall conduct themselves with \n     the dignity, decorum, courtesy and propriety traditionally \n     observed by the Senate. Demonstrations of approval or \n     disapproval of any statement or act by any member or witness \n     are not allowed. Persons creating confusion or distractions \n     or otherwise disrupting the orderly proceeding of the hearing \n     shall be expelled from the hearing.\n       Rule 16. Broadcasting of Hearings.--(a) Broadcasting of \n     open hearings by television or radio coverage shall be \n     allowed upon approval by the chairman of a request filed with \n     the staff director not later than noon of the day before the \n     day on which such coverage is desired.\n       (b) If such approval is granted, broadcasting coverage of \n     the hearing shall be conducted unobtrusively and in \n     accordance with the standards of dignity, propriety, courtesy \n     and decorum traditionally observed by the Senate.\n       (c) Equipment necessary for coverage by television and \n     radio media shall not be installed in, or removed from, the \n     hearing room while the committee is in session.\n       (d) Additional lighting may be installed in the hearing \n     room by the media in order to raise the ambient lighting \n     level to the lowest level necessary to provide adequate \n     television coverage of the hearing at the then current state \n     of the art of television coverage.\n       (e) The additional lighting authorized by subsection (d) of \n     this rule shall not be directed into the eyes of any members \n     of the committee or of any witness, and at the request of any \n     such member or witness, offending lighting shall be \n     extinguished.\n       Rule 17. Subcommittees.--(a) The chairman, subject to the \n     approval of the committee, shall appoint legislative \n     subcommittees. The ranking minority member shall recommend to \n     the chairman appointment of minority members to the \n     subcommittees. All legislation shall be kept on the full \n     committee calendar unless a majority of the members present \n     and voting agree to refer specific legislation to an \n     appropriate subcommittee.\n       (b) The chairman may limit the period during which House-\n     passed legislation referred to a subcommittee under paragraph \n     (a) will remain in that subcommittee. At the end of that \n     period, the legislation will be restored to the full \n     committee calendar. The period referred to in the preceding \n     sentences should be 6 weeks, but may be extended in the event \n     that adjournment or a long recess is imminent.\n       (c) All decisions of the chairman are subject to approval \n     or modification by a majority vote of the committee.\n       (d) The full committee may at any time by majority vote of \n     those members present discharge a subcommittee from further \n     consideration of a specific piece of legislation.\n       (e) Because the Senate is constitutionally prohibited from \n     passing revenue legislation originating in the Senate, \n     subcommittees may mark up legislation originating in the \n     Senate and referred to them under Rule 16(a) to develop \n     specific proposals for full committee consideration but may \n     not report such legislation to the full committee. The \n     preceding sentence does not apply to nonrevenue legislation \n     originating in the Senate.\n       (f) The chairman and ranking minority members shall serve \n     as nonvoting ex officio members of the subcommittees on which \n     they do not serve as voting members.\n       (g) Any member of the committee may attend hearings held by \n     any subcommittee and question witnesses testifying before \n     that subcommittee.\n       (h) Subcommittee meeting times shall be coordinated by the \n     staff director to insure that--\n       (1) no subcommittee meeting will be held when the committee \n     is in executive session, except by unanimous consent;\n       (2) no more than one subcommittee will meet when the full \n     committee is holding hearings; and\n       (3) not more than two subcommittees will meet at the same \n     time.\n       Notwithstanding paragraphs (2) and (3), a subcommittee may \n     meet when the full committee is holding hearings and two \n     subcommittees may meet at the same time only upon the \n     approval of the chairman and the ranking minority member of \n     the committee and subcommittees involved.\n       (i) All nominations shall be considered by the full \n     committee.\n       (j) The chairman will attempt to schedule reasonably \n     frequent meetings of the full committee to permit \n     consideration of legislation reported favorably to the \n     committee by the subcommittees.\n       Rule 18. Transcripts of Committee Meetings.--An accurate \n     record shall be kept of all markups of the committee, whether \n     they be open or closed to the public. A transcript, marked as \n     ``uncorrected,'' shall be available for inspection by Members \n     of the Senate, or members of the committee together with \n     their staffs, at any time. Not later than 21 business days \n     after the meeting occurs, the committee shall make publicly \n     available through the Internet--\n       (a) a video recording;\n       (b) an audio recording; or\n       (c) after all members of the committee have had a \n     reasonable opportunity to correct their remarks for \n     grammatical errors or to accurately reflect statements, a \n     corrected transcript; and such record shall remain available \n     until the end of the Congress following the date of the \n     meeting.\n       Notwithstanding the above, in the case of the record of an \n     executive session of the committee that is closed to the \n     public pursuant to Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate, the record shall not be published or made public in \n     any way except by majority vote of the committee after all \n     members of the committee have had a reasonable opportunity to \n     correct their remarks for grammatical errors or to accurately \n     reflect statements made.\n       Rule 19. Amendment of Rules.--The foregoing rules may be \n     added to, modified, amended or suspended at any time.\n\nII.

Mr. President, last May, Senator Baucus and I began \ninvestigating GlaxoSmithKline regarding their diabetes drug, Avandia.\n  We began this investigation when Dr. Steve Nissen at the Cleveland \nClinic published a study in the New England Journal of Medicine. That \nstudy found a link between Avandia and heart attacks.\n  Shortly after we began our investigation, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a \nformer Deputy Commissioner at the Food and Drug Administration, wrote \nan op-ed in the Wall Street Journal. In that article, he insinuated \nthat congressional investigators had obtained a copy of the Nissen \nstudy before it was published. Dr. Gottlieb suggested that this action \ncalled into question the integrity of both congressional investigators \nand Dr. Nissen.\n  Well, congressional investigators did not get a copy of the Nissen \nstudy until it became public. But you can imagine my surprise when I \nlearned that one of GlaxoSmithKline's own consultants leaked a copy of \nthe study to GlaxoSmithKline weeks before it was published. The man who \ndid this is Dr. Steven Haffner. He confirmed to my investigators that \nhe faxed a draft of the study to GlaxoSmithKline weeks before it was \npublished.\n  The New England Journal of Medicine picked Dr. Haffner to peer review \nthe study submitted by Dr. Nissen. That means that Dr. Haffner was \nsupposed to check the study for quality. He was not supposed to pass it \nback to GlaxoSmithKline.\n  Not only did Dr. Haffner breach his agreement with the New England \nJournal of Medicine to properly peer review the Nissen study, but he \nviolated practically every tenet of independence and integrity held \nsacred by the major medical journals.\n  Dr. Haffner told my investigators that GlaxoSmithKline did not ask \nfor an early copy of the Avandia study. But the question still remains \nabout what the company did once they had the study. Maybe \nGlaxoSmithKline's executives returned the study to Dr. Haffner or maybe \nthey contacted the New England Journal of Medicine to report this \nviolation of publishing ethics. I don't know, but I have sent \nGlaxoSmithKline a letter asking how they behaved after Dr. Haffner \nleaked the study to them.\n  But the most troubling aspect of this situation is that the integrity \nof another aspect of the scientific process is called into question--\nscientific peer review.\n  This process ensures that other scientists will judge a study's \nquality before it is made public and becomes used as a marketing tool.\n  It is only good quality science that separates modern pharmaceuticals \nfrom old-fashioned snake oil.\n  Over the last few years, my investigations have found that the Food \nand Drug Administration has a very cozy relationship with drug \ncompanies. I have also discovered that drug companies spend big bucks \nto influence which drugs doctors prescribe.\n  Finally, I have shown that some drug companies intimidate scientists \nwho speak up about bad drugs. Now it appears that even peer-reviewed \nscience is not completely without its own problems.\n  Before I close, I would like to ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record my letter to GlaxoSmithKline.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                         Committee on Finance,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 30, 2008.\n     Mr. Christopher Viehbacher,\n     President, U.S. Pharmaceuticals, GlaxoSmith-\n         Kline, Research Triangle Park, NC.\n       Dear Mr. Viehbacher: As the Ranking Member of the United \n     States Senate Committee on Finance (Committee), I have an \n     obligation to the more than 80 million Americans who receive \n     health care coverage under Medicare and Medicaid to ensure \n     that taxpayer and beneficiary dollars are appropriately spent \n     on safe and effective drugs and devices. This includes the \n     responsibility to conduct oversight of the medical and \n     pharmaceutical industries that provide products and services \n     to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.\n       The purpose of this letter is to determine what action, if \n     any, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)\n\n[[Page S487]]\n\n     took after receiving a leaked manuscript of a study prior to \n     its publication on May 21, 2007 in The New England Journal of \n     Medicine (NEJM). This study reported a link between heart \n     attacks and Avandia, a drug GSK sells to control glucose \n     levels in diabetics.\n       GSK representatives informed the Committee last summer that \n     a peer reviewer leaked the study to them weeks before it was \n     published. GSK later acknowledged to the Committee that the \n     peer reviewer was Dr. Haffner. Dr. Haffner confirmed this \n     fact noting also that he was peer reviewing the study for \n     NEJM when he faxed the study to GSK. According to documents \n     filed at the FDA, GSK has paid Dr. Haffner around $75,000 in \n     consulting fees and speaking honoraria since 1999.\n       Dr. Haffner told Committee investigators that no one at GSK \n     asked him to send them this study about Avandia. Nonetheless, \n     I am interested in what GSK did after receiving the study. \n     Did GSK return the study to Dr. Haffner? Did GSK contact the \n     NEJM to report this violation of publishing ethics? I would \n     appreciate a detailed description of what GSK did after \n     receiving the unpublished study regarding one of their \n     leading drugs. Accordingly, please respond to the following \n     questions and request for documents:\n       1. Please provide a list of all GSK employees who received \n     and/or learned of the results contained in the leaked copy of \n     the manuscript prior to publication by NEJM.\n       2. Please provide copies of all documents, records, and \n     recordings of telephone messages regarding the NEJM \n     manuscript that was leaked to GSK before publication.\n       3. Please provide the following dates:\n       a. When did GSK first contact the data safety monitoring \n     board of the RECORD trial to begin publication of interim \n     results?\n       b. When did GSK begin pulling together the interim data of \n     the RECORD trial?\n       c. When did GSK submit the interim results of the RECORD \n     trial to NEJM for possible publication?\n       4. Please provide copies of all documents, records, \n     communications, and recordings of telephone messages \n     regarding the publication of the interim results of the \n     RECORD trial.\n       5. Please provide copies of any other pre-publication study \n     drafts that GSK received about one of its products. Please do \n     not include these drafts if a GSK employee was an author on \n     the study. This request covers the period of January 1, 2000 \n     to the present.\n       Thank you again for your continued assistance in this \n     matter. I would appreciate receiving the documents and \n     information requested by no later than February 15, 2008.

Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to commend \nIndonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono for his statements on \nDecember 10, 2007, at the Bali Climate Conference, concerning the \nMinistry of Forestry's ``Strategy and Action Plan for National \nConservation of Orangutans.''\n  The President said ``the survival of the orangutan is inextricably \nlinked to the survival of its natural habitat: the rainforests. . . . \n[T]o save orangutans, we must save the forests. And by saving, \nregenerating, and sustainably managing forests, we are also doing our \npart in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, while contributing to \nsustainable economic development of Indonesia. Successful orangutan \nconservation is the symbol of responsible management of the earth's \nresources.''\n  President Yudhoyono's eloquent words represent an important \nrecognition by the Indonesian Government that preserving orangutan \nhabitat is an environmental imperative, not only to protect this \nmagnificent species from extinction but to help reduce carbon emissions \nresulting from the destruction of Indonesia's forests.\n  A decade ago I included funds in the Foreign Operations Act to \nsupport programs administered by the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment to protect the orangutan. Those initial funds have evolved \ninto an ongoing program implemented through grants to nongovernmental \norganizations and for training of Indonesian police, and has begun to \nshow encouraging results. Not only are the entities involved in this \neffort working more cooperatively together, the Indonesian Government \nis taking steps to curb illegal logging which poses the greatest threat \nto the orangutan's survival.\n  The orangutan's fate is far from certain. Far more needs to be done \nto protect the forests of Borneo and Sumatra where these great apes \nlive. But by recognizing the opportunities this challenge presents for \nIndonesia and the world, President Yudhoyono has done a great service \nto this effort and gives us hope that the orangutan can be saved.\n  I ask unanimous to have an article in the Telegraph about President \nYudhoyono's announcement of Indonesia's new Strategy and Action Plan \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Daily Telegraph, Dec. 28, 2007]\n\n               Indonesia Plants Trees To Save Orangutans\n\n                             (By Ian Wood)\n\n       At the Bali climate summit, Indonesia announced a new \n     scheme aimed at protecting its orangutan population.\n       The plight of the orangutan, driven out because of \n     deforestation and degradation of its rainforest home, has \n     become a potent symbol of the battle to save the forests.\n       The most recent survey of wild orangutans estimates that \n     there are about 7000 remaining in Sumatra, and about 55,000 \n     in Borneo. However the combined pressures of palm oil, \n     logging and forest fires are having a catastrophic effect on \n     many areas.\n       Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said at the \n     launch of the project: ``In the last 35 years about 50,000 \n     orangutans are estimated to have been lost as their habitats \n     shrank. If this continues, this majestic creature will likely \n     face extinction by 2050. The fate of the orangutan is a \n     subject that goes to the heart of sustainable forests . . . \n     to save the orangutan we have to save the forest.''\n       For anyone with an interest in protecting Indonesian \n     rainforests these have to be welcome words.\n       The action plan has taken nearly three years to develop and \n     has included various NGO's and the Indonesian forestry \n     ministry. The American group The Nature Conservancy has \n     represented the coalition of NGO's and has also pledged $1 \n     million to support the plan. The bold target of the project \n     is to save huge areas of forest scheduled for conversion to \n     palm oil.\n       ``One million hectares of planned forest conversion \n     projects are in orangutan habitat,'' said Rill Djohani, \n     director of The Nature Conservancy's Indonesia program.\n       ``Setting aside these forests is an important step for \n     Indonesia to sustainably manage and protect its natural \n     resources. It benefits both local people and wildlife while \n     making a major contribution towards reducing global carbon \n     emissions.''\n       Indonesia has made some progress in enforcing forest laws \n     over the last few years and if this plan can be implemented \n     it would be a landmark in Indonesian forest protection.\n       Dr. Erik Meijaard, a senior scientist with The Nature \n     Conservancy, said: ``It could lead to 9,800 orangutans being \n     saved and prevent 700 million tons of carbon from being \n     released.''\n       Although Indonesia has already destroyed huge swathes of \n     rainforest, it still has over 100 million acres left. Both \n     scientists and Indonesian officials hope that the emerging \n     carbon market could provide funds to protect important areas.\n       ``Forest conservation can provide economic benefits for a \n     very long time,'' said Dr. Meijaard. ``If payments for \n     avoided deforestation become an official mechanism in global \n     climate agreements, then carbon buyers will likely compensate \n     Indonesia for its forest protection. Protecting the orangutan \n     will then lead to increased economic development in the \n     country. Such a triple-win situation is not a dream. With \n     some political will, it can soon be reality.''\n       The other target of the project is to return orangutans \n     housed in rehabilitation centres to the forest by 2015. There \n     are currently over 1000 orangutan housed in care centres with \n     more arriving on a regular basis. The majority are ready to \n     be returned to the wild now but there are simply not enough \n     suitable release sites. If carbon trading could achieve the \n     aims of this plan, then these great apes could return to the \n     forests where they belong.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/30/senate-section/article/S487-2", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S487-S488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HELSINKI COMMISSION\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the work of the \nHelsinki Commission.\n  The Helsinki Commission yesterday held an important hearing on \ncombating anti-Semitism in the OSCE region. I would like to commend the \ntwo panelists who testified, Professor Gert Weisskirchen, MP and Dr. \nKathrin Meyer. Professor Weisskirchen serves as the OSCE's chair-in-\noffice personal representative on anti-Semitism, and Dr. Meyer serves \nas the advisor on anti-Semitism issues in the OSCE's Office for \nDemocratic Institutions and human rights. Both of these scholars have \nbeen fighting against anti-Semitism for years, and their good work \nshould be recognized. Modern anti-Semitism is an appalling relic of a \npast horror; and though it is not yet as acceptable as in ages past, \nits resurgence today is no less troubling.\n  We forget, sometimes, just how much the world is indebted to the \nJewish\n\n[[Page S488]]\n\ncommunity. The world's culture has been immeasurably enriched by Jewish \nwriters, scientists, artists, philosophers, and medical pioneers. All \nthose contributions, however, mattered little when the shadow of \nfascism fell across Europe, and European nations began to destroy some \nof their most valuable sons and daughters.\n  We may have thought that the horrors of World War Two and the \nHolocaust had finally cauterized the old festering sore of anti-\nSemitism. And indeed, for some years, that seemed to be the case. \nEurope committed itself to ensuring that never again would its states \ndo violence against their Jewish minority, to which it owed so much. \nBut time is a powerful sedative. Today, much of the same toxic \nnationalism is again on the rise. One of the most troubling aspects to \nme of the past two decades has been the reemergence of virulently \nnationalist and xenophobic political parties. These groups have often \ndrawn on the iconography and ideology of Axis powers during the Nazi \nperiod, with some going so far as to hold public rallies and marches. \nOthers resort to violence, both openly and in the shadows. These gangs \nare not acceptable within European political society--not yet--but \ntheir emergence is a sign that once again, all is not well on the \ncontinent. Economic turmoil has combined with age-old anti-Semitism to \noffer a tiny sliver of legitimacy to burgeoning neo-fascist parties. In \nsome of the newly free states of Eastern Europe, social turmoil has \noften provided opportunistic politicians the chance of blaming national \nproblems on an ancient scapegoat--the Jews.\n  But this problem is not limited to the East. In much of Europe, in \nthe highest centers of learning and culture, a new phenomenon serves to \nbuttress these old prejudices. The Middle East, where the world's only \nJewish state faces a sea of hostile terrorists, is particularly ripe \nfor anti-Semitic propagandists. The world today sees much anti-Semitism \nmasquerading as criticism of Israel. August world bodies, dedicated to \nforging peace, have seen some of their instruments twisted almost \nbeyond recognition. When great institutions cannot rouse themselves to \nend appalling human rights abuses in virtually every corner of the \nworld, but instead focus again and again and again on a tiny nation, \nliberal and democratic, alone in a hostile region--then the instruments \nof those institutions may well be broken. Anti-Semitism is a scourge \nfrom which we are still not free, not so long as radical agitators and \ntacit bigotry alike have a vested interest in blaming the ills of many \non the perceived sins of a few. Because too often, in Europe, the few \nare the Jews.\n  The active steps to combat anti-Semitism proposed yesterday by \nProfessor Weisskirchen and Dr. Meyer could prove exceptionally useful \nin rolling back today's creeping advance of radicalism and anti-\nSemitism. Only through vigorous and proactive measures can we identify \nthe seedlings of hate and discrimination, and uproot them, and ensure \nthat never again would Europe or the world fall prey to the ancient \nbase ugliness of the mob.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/30/senate-section/article/S488-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RICHARD REID CONVICTION ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, most of the victories in the fight against \nterrorism have been won on foreign shores with little to no acclaim \nhere at home. As our Nation continues the long and often silent \ncampaign against extremism, we should not miss the opportunity to \npublicly praise the lifesaving achievements of our Nation's \nintelligence and law enforcement authorities.\n  On this day 5 years ago, al-Qaida operative Richard Colvin Reid, also \ncalled Abdul Raheem--but known to the world simply as the ``shoe \nbomber''--was sentenced to life in prison. Reid sought to explode an \nairplane carrying 185 passengers and 12 crewmembers on their voyage \nacross the Atlantic. Thanks to the vigilance and bravery of two flight \nattendants, Cristina Jones and Hermis Moutardier, Reid was discovered \nand detained, saving flight 63 and all on board.\n  The U.S. Attorney's Office in Massachusetts subsequently prosecuted \nReid. His confession led to the first conviction of an al-Qaida \nterrorist on American soil. To commemorate the occasion, I met \nyesterday with the case's chief prosecutor, Middlesex County district \nattorney Gerry Leone. I took that opportunity to congratulate him on a \nsuccessful conviction, one of the highlights of Gerry's long record of \npublic service.\n  Like the terrorists of September 11, Reid pledged blind fealty to the \nhate-filled ideology of Osama bin Laden. In furtherance of his \ndetermined plot, Reid traveled to more than seven countries spanning \nthree continents. Law enforcement authorities were able to use e-mails \nsent by Reid to obtain a vital glimpse into the complex global network \nof al-Qaida. These correspondences led authorities to discover al-\nQaida-affiliated terrorist cells in London, France, and Turkey.\n  As we commemorate Reid's conviction and express our gratitude to \nthose like Gerry Leone who made it happen, we must remember that future \nvictories depend on private citizens, public servants, and law \nenforcement officers here and abroad working in unison to keep \nAmericans safe against terrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/30/senate-section/article/S488-2", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S488-S489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR TRENT LOTT\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, across America, those citizens who have on \noccasion chosen--or been required--to listen to congressional debate \nhave often heard the Senate described as an ``Institution.'' It is a \nterm which has been overused and perhaps misused more than once, but I \nbelieve it is quite appropriately applied in observing that with \nSenator Trent Lott's departure, we have lost a reservoir of \ninstitutional knowledge, knowledge which has been of enormous value to \nMembers of every political stripe for many years.\n  The breadth of Trent Lott's experience--on both sides of the aisle, \nin both Chambers of Congress, as back bencher, and as a member of \nleadership--has given him an insight into and understanding of the \nlegislative process unique among his peers. We have heard many \ncolleagues describe the effect of that experience when combined with \nthe persuasive personality of the Mississippi gulf coast: No one \ncounted votes better, and perhaps more important, no one enjoyed it \nmore.\n  Within our caucus, in committee rooms, and on the floor, Trent could \nrely time and again on the great friendships and professional respect \ndeveloped through years of hard work. Even more valuable perhaps, he \nunderstood the unusual psychology, decisionmaking, and ego unique to \nMembers of Congress. We all perceive the important role these factors \nplay in our work; few have been able to master them to their use.\n  For Trent, however, counting votes was only the means to a more \nimportant end--being an effective Senator. He has long been a strong \nvoice for the State of Mississippi, but he has also developed the habit \nof finding his way to the center of the legislative storm at the \ncrucial moment when a final deal is struck.\n  On matters of policy, I have worked both alongside and against \nTrent--even coming out ahead once or twice. Those rare events have \nrevealed him to accept loss gracefully, negotiate in good faith, and \naccept compromise without conceding principle. These are traits \nessential to integrity and stability in governance, but also traits \nthat strengthened his hand for the next battle.\n  Thus, the experience, the ability, the ``institutional knowledge'' we \nlose is very real. I count Senator Lott as more than a valued \ncolleague; he is also a valued friend. As a Senator, in my first term, \nI have always been able to count on Trent for sound and thoughtful \nadvice, which always reflected his sincere concern for the personal \nwell-being, career, and family of all with whom he served. I always \ntook confidence from the fact that he unabashedly placed family at the \ntop of his priorities, and understood that our public service should \nnot take place at our families' expense.\n  Mr. President, although I am the youngest Member of the U.S. Senate, \nand still serving in my first term, I am grateful to Senator Lott for \nhis commitment to keeping the Senate strong. The Framers of our \nConstitution saw the Senate as the legislative body that would maintain \nan even keel, engage in meaningful debate, and forge legislation \nthrough the art of compromise\n\n[[Page S489]]\n\nthat addresses the challenges of our day. Through successes and \nfailings, Trent has always been true to this purpose. Most important to \nhim, he has also been true to his constituents, and to his family. I \ntrust that these priorities will continue to guide him, and know they \nwill bring him success for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/30/senate-section/article/S489-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SAFETY OF SLAUGHTER FACILITIES\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I wish to highlight a recent \nundercover video produced by the Humane Society of the United States. \nThis video displays the appalling methods used by employees at the \nCalifornia-based Hallmark Meat Packing Company during the processing of \ncattle, as well as the unacceptable state of USDA's oversight of meat \npacking operations.\n  The video documents horrifying scenes of employees using electrical \nprods to shock animals, pulling them with chains, and carelessly \ndriving over them with a forklift in an effort to bring sick or injured \ncows to their feet. These cruel actions amount to nothing less than \ntorture. There was even a case of using a hose to forcibly spray water \ninto a cow's nose to get it to rise to its feet to avoid the sensation \nof drowning.\n  Currently, the State of California has laws in place that \nspecifically prohibit the kinds of activities taking place at Hallmark. \nIn addition, because of the health hazards associated with so-called \n``downer'' cattle, which are those unable to stand and walk due to \neither injury or illness, USDA in 2003 passed a regulation prohibiting \nthe processing of such animals. According to USDA's own reports, there \nis a much higher incidence of mad cow disease in these animals, and \nthey are also much more susceptible to pathogens like E. coli and \nsalmonella.\n  The actions of this slaughterhouse, and possibly countless others, in \nviolation of established laws, have put our most vulnerable and \nimportant assets in danger our--children. The animals processed by this \nfacility are supplied to the Westland Meat Company, which is the \nsecond-largest provider of beef to USDA's Commodity Procurement Branch. \nThis arm of USDA distributes the meat to needy families and also to \nmore than 100,000 schools across America through the National School \nLunch Program. I shudder when I think of how many other of the Nation's \n6,200 slaughterhouses could be evading oversight and endangering the \nlives of countless Americans.\n  The two daily scheduled USDA inspections at the Hallmark facility are \nobviously no deterrent to the abhorrent practices being performed \nthere. In fact, the very short and superficial nature of the \ninspections serve to encourage workers to do anything they can to bring \na sick animal to its feet just long enough to pass inspection before \nbeing slaughtered.\n  In order to ensure the safety of our Nation's food supply, ensure \nanimals are treated humanely and with respect, and protect our families \nand children from possible life-threatening illnesses, we must act. \nAtrocities such as those exposed by the Humane Society must be swiftly \nabolished, and effective oversight measures put in place immediately.\n  USDA needs to shore up inspections, hold slaughterhouses accountable \nand uphold food safety standards, and ensure that cattle and dairy \nfarmers are aware that nonambulatory cattle will not be accepted for \nprocessing. It is also imperative that we, Congress, ensure that downer \nlivestock is unable to enter our food chain, and the best way to \naccomplish this task is to codify the prohibition of downer livestock \nfrom entering our food supply.\n  I introduced S. 394, the Downed Animal and Food Safety Protection \nAct, to fill a gap in the current USDA and the Food and Drug \nAdministration regulations. It calls for the humane euthanization of \nnonambulatory livestock. The euthanization of nonambulatory livestock \nwould remove this high-risk population from the portion of livestock \nreserved for our consumption. Due to the presence of other prion \ndiseases found throughout other species of livestock, all animals that \nfit under the definition of livestock are included in this bill.\n  The benefits of my bill are numerous, for both the public and the \nindustry. On the face of it, the bill will prevent needless suffering \nby humanely euthanizing nonambulatory animals. The removal of downed \nanimals from our food chain will insure that it is safer and of better \nquality. The reduction in the likelihood of disease would result in \nsafer working conditions for persons handling livestock. This added \nprotection against disease would help the flow of livestock and \nlivestock products in interstate and foreign commerce, making commerce \nin livestock more easily attainable.\n  We must act now and call upon USDA to make the necessary changes to \nensure that the atrocities demonstrated at this slaughterhouse are not \nrepeated elsewhere. In addition, I urge my colleagues to support \npassage of the Downed Animal and Food Safety Protection Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/30/senate-section/article/S489-2", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RETIREMENT OF MARTIN PAONE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Marty began in the House Post Office to \nhelp pay his way through graduate school at Georgetown. He then worked \nto the Senate parking office. Then, in 1979, 29 years ago, Marty began \nworking in the Senate Democratic Cloakroom. Marty worked his way up the \nranks until being appointed Secretary for the Minority in 1995.\n  It is impossible to overstate Marty's importance to everything that \nwe have done on the floor of the U.S. Senate: what comes to the floor, \nwhat gets off the floor, what gets amended or not.\n  But Marty has not just been indispensable on procedure and tactics. \nMarty has also been an invaluable strategic adviser to me, to the \nDemocratic leadership and, I say with confidence, to every Democratic \nSenator and to more than a few Republican Senators\n  There just aren't many people I could say that about.\n  We have relied on him and will miss him because of his tireless work \nethic, his excellent judgment and his ability to be the calm in the \nmiddle of the storm. And for anyone who has been in the middle of a \nstorm around here, staying calm is no easy task.\n  Marty has also put in the hours. Early days and late nights were the \nnorm. But, he is always been here. For that, we will always be \ngrateful.\n  And I would be remiss if I didn't mention his family and our \ngratitude to them for all the time he was here helping us rather than \nat home with them.\n  His wife Ruby is part of our Senate family and has endured Marty's \nvery tough job, as have his children: Alexander, Stephanie, and Tommy.\n  To each of them, I want to say thank you for putting up with him and \nour demands on him.\n  I also want to mention Marty's mother, Evelyn, who is 95 years young. \nHis mother is very proud of him and all that he has accomplished. And I \nwant her to know that we are all very proud of him as well.\n  Lastly, I want to acknowledge Marty's successors. We are all so \npleased that Lula Davis is our new secretary. Having more than 25 years \nof Senate service and many years of working with Marty, we all know she \nwill fill these very big shoes and serve us all well.\n  Tim Mitchell is replacing Lula as Assistant Democratic Secretary. He \nhas 16 years of Senate service and a wealth of experience and we look \nforward to working with him as well in his new capacity.\n  And Jacques Purvis will move from the cloakroom and join Trish Engle \nas one of our floor assistants and I congratulate him on that move as \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/30/senate-section/article/S489-3", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S489-S490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO CAROLE ANNE HEART\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I wish to honor one of the most \ndedicated advocates for health care treaty rights for American Indian \ntribes in my State and throughout the United States, Carole Anne Heart. \nCarole Anne was the executive director for the Aberdeen Area Tribal \nChairmen's Health Board. The Aberdeen Area Tribal Chairmen's Health \nBoard operates several programs for native people in a 4-State region \nthat represents 18 tribes including the 9 treaty tribes in my home \nState of South Dakota. During her tenure with the Chairmen's Health \nBoard, programs such as Healthy Start, Tobacco Prevention, and Asthma \nPrevention expanded to serve hundreds of Native\n\n[[Page S490]]\n\nmen, women, and children. With her assistance, the Northern Plains \nTribal Epidemiology Center opened and serves the tribal nations through \nits many projects and partnerships with the Indian Health Service and \nother Federal agencies.\n  A Sicangu Lakota and Ihanktonwan Dakota, Carole Anne grew up with the \nLakota culture all around her; as a young child, she spent much time \nwith her grandmother and great-grandmother, learning the Lakota values. \nShe went to boarding school in Marty, SD, and then on to high school at \nSaint Francis Indian School on the Rosebud Sioux Indian Reservation. \nHer life's work included water rights and women's rights, and, most \nrecently, health care advocacy. As the executive director to the \nAberdeen Area Tribal Chairmen's Health Board, she worked to incorporate \ntraditional customs into the contemporary programming so the language \nand the culture would continue. She led many conferences and workshops \naround the United States on tribal health care issues. Carole Anne was \nwell known for her humor--she would light up a room with her jokes and \nlaughter. Oftentimes her sense of humor interjected itself as she led \nsome of the most serious discussions on health care disparities. Her \nuse of the phrase ``Don't get sick after June'' was in reference to the \nlack of funding the Indian Health Service has at that time of the \nfiscal year which meant that services were unavailable to many tribal \nmembers. While this is a very serious issue, Carole Anne was able to \nmake light of the situation and remained focused on bettering health \ncare for native peoples throughout Indian Country.\n  Her Lakota name was Waste Wayankapi Win, meaning ``When People See \nYou, They See Something Good.'' How fitting a name for someone who \nwould spread ``good'' throughout Indian Country. On Friday, January 25, \n2008, after a courageous battle with cancer, Carole Anne Heart made her \njourney to the spirit world. I extend my sympathy to her family and \nthose close to her. She will be missed greatly by everyone she touched \non her journey through this world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/30/senate-section/article/S490-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING ESTHER G. KEE\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the \nattention of the Senate the work of Mrs. Esther G. Kee as she retires \nfrom the presidency of the US-Asia Institute. Mrs. Kee came to \nWashington, DC, in 1977 to raise awareness of the unique role Asian \nPacific Americans could play in facilitating communication and \ninteraction between the United States and the countries and people of \nEast Asia.\n  Following the first national gathering at the White House in 1978 of \nAsian American leaders throughout the United States, Mrs. Kee and her \ncolleague, the late Joji Konoshima, were encouraged by then-President \nJimmy Carter to work closely with the Honorable Richard C. Holbrooke, \nAssistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. An \nadvisory council on East Asia was formed to provide insight to the \nState Department on issues impacting the region. From this, the U.S.-\nAsia Institute was established as a nongovernmental organization in \n1979 to serve as an independent voice for the U.S.-Asia relationship. \nMrs. Kee and Mr. Konoshima played a key role in the historic visit of \nChinese Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping to the United States, traveling with \nhim to New York, Houston, and San Francisco, and represented the U.S. \noverseas on numerous delegations.\n  Mrs. Kee has worked steadily and effectively through the years to \nbuild awareness and foster mutual understanding between the United \nStates and countries of East Asia. This quiet diplomacy has earned her \nthe respect of many on Capitol Hill, in various administrations and in \nEast Asia diplomatic, business, and academic circles. She has asked for \nno public recognition, but as she retires from the organization she \ncofounded, we feel it is time to say thank you for her commitment to \nthe U.S.-Asia relationship.\n  From small interpersonal exchanges to facilitating contacts through \ninternational conferences at the U.S. Department of State and on \nCapitol Hill, the Institute has strived to strengthen ties by promoting \ntwo-way dialogue between the United States and countries of East Asia. \nOne cornerstone of the institute's engagement was the establishment of \ncongressional staff delegations to Asia. Since 1985, these official \nvisits have greatly increased the awareness, knowledge and \nunderstanding of Asian and U.S. views, providing invaluable \nopportunities for U.S. congressional advisers to gain a firsthand view \nof the region, its culture, its governments, and its people. More than \n800 staff members have traveled to China alone since 1985 on 70 \ndelegations.\n  Mrs. Kee leaves an important legacy of mutual communication and \nunderstanding, and even in her retirement, she remains determined the \nwork she began almost 30 years ago will continue. The U.S.-Asia \nInstitute will carry on Mrs. Kee's work, promoting dialog on \ninternational issues of common interest to the United States and \nparticipating Asian nations, whenever and however possible.\n  As she retires, we say thank you to Mrs. Kee for her sage counsel, \nher vision, her quiet behind-the-scenes diplomacy, and her unwavering \ncommitment to the U.S.-Asia relationship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/30/senate-section/article/S490-2", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S490-S491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RECOGNIZING THE INSTITUTE OF FINANCIAL LITERACY\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I honor a small business whose \nadmirable goal is to educate citizens about personal finance. The \nInstitute for Financial Literacy, headquartered in Maine's largest city \nof Portland, provides a valuable and unique resource for taxpayers and \nbusiness owners alike--specifically those who have gone through \nbankruptcy--to better understand their economic situation.\n  Founded in 2002 by Leslie Linfield, the Institute for Financial \nLiteracy has grown exponentially in the past 6 years, and now has a \nteam of 50 employees. The institute employs a multitude of programs and \nformats to train clients on various issues related to the betterment of \nfinancial aptitude. Its Personal Finance Series is a combination of \nthree books that aim to demonstrate the principles of budgeting, credit \nand debit management, and investment and retirement planning. The \ncompany's Web site contains several instrumental tools, including a \nbudget worksheet and a financial goal action plan, free for anyone \nwishing to monitor their finances closely. The Web site includes \nseveral papers on legal matters and money management strategies by the \ncompany's employees. Additionally, it offers users the ability to sign \nup for the institute's electronic newsletter.\n  Above and beyond the invaluable information provided on its Web page, \nthe institute provides critical counseling services to assist those in \nneed of financial advice. In 2007 alone, the institute's employees \nserved over 50,000 individuals throughout the country, helping them \nmake better and more informed decisions about their personal financial \ndecisions. Services for people who have filed for bankruptcy include \nboth pre- and post-filing FreshStart counseling and education programs, \nall delivered over the Internet, phone, or in person, to give clients \nthe financial management skills and principles necessary to succeed in \ntheir future endeavors. To make its employees' expertise available to \nthe largest number of people, the institute is open for 13 hours each \nweekday with additional hours on Saturdays.\n  Furthermore, the institute partners with nonprofit, educational and \ngovernmental organizations to integrate its programs into their \nexisting services. These partners include groups with a notable \ninfluence in the realm of financial responsibility, including the \n``Save For Your Future'' campaign that urges Americans to develop \nprivate individual pensions to supplement their Social Security \nearnings, and the American Bankruptcy Institute, an organization \ndedicated to research and education on matters related to insolvency. \nSimilarly, the Institute for Financial Literacy has partnered with \nlocal organizations to create programs that help Mainers improve their \nfinancial and employment opportunities.\n  In its short history, the Institute for Financial Literacy has \nalready benefited tens of thousands of people struggling to recover \nfrom bankruptcy. By developing high-quality, user-friendly financial \nliteracy programs, its educational and counseling assistance renders an \nenormous boon for those looking to advance in life. I thank Leslie\n\n[[Page S491]]\n\nLinfield and all of the institute's employees for their generous help \nto those in need and applaud them for their dedicated service to \nproducing a more financially sound populace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/30/senate-section/article/S491-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Wanda Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/30/senate-section/article/S491-2", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the presiding officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and withdrawals which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/30/senate-section/article/S491-3", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  At 11:28 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 2110.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to require a \nprogram of mental health care and rehabilitation for veterans for \nservice-related post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety \ndisorder, or a related substance use disorder, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nlegislation I am introducing today that will hopefully chart a new \ncourse for veterans with mental illness--the Veterans Mental Health \nTreatment First Act.\n  As the title suggests, the bill proposes to advance a commonsense \nconcept: Providing medical treatment for mental illness as a first \npriority will lead to a better quality of life for tens of thousands of \nveterans. It is a simple concept with which few would disagree.\n\n[[Page S494]]\n\nThe problem is that the Government agency tasked with advancing that \nconcept--the Department of Veterans Affairs--lacks the proper focus to \nactually deliver. Notice I didn't say VA lacked the tools to deliver. \nIt has the tools--a world-class health care system, evidence-based \ntherapies emphasizing recovery and rehabilitation, first-line \nmedications, and the support of a dedicated group of clinical \nprofessionals. The problem is that, as an agency, VA doesn't coordinate \nthe use of all of its resources--medical treatment, vocational \nrehabilitation, and disability compensation--to ensure what is \nuniversally agreed as the desired outcome of those with disabilities: \nwellness and a return to a productive life.\n  Let me take a few minutes to lay out some of the facts for my \ncolleagues. These facts have helped me get a better grasp of what the \nproblem is, and they have truly informed my belief that a new approach \nto solving the problem is, in fact, necessary.\n  Fact No. 1: There has been a steep increase in the number of veterans \nreceiving disability compensation for post-traumatic stress disorder.\n  In a 2005 report, the VA inspector general issued the following \nfindings:\n\n       During fiscal years 1999 through 2004, the number and \n     percentage of PTSD cases increased significantly. While the \n     total number of all veterans receiving disability \n     compensation grew by only 12.2 percent, the number of PTSD \n     cases grew by 79.5 percent, from 120,265 cases in fiscal year \n     1999 to 215,871 cases in fiscal year 2004.\n\n  Sadly, the trend has not decelerated. Through September of 2007, \n299,672--almost 300,000--veterans with PTSD were on the compensation \nrolls, a 39-percent increase since the VA inspector general's findings.\n  Now, many might argue that it is only natural that we would see an \nincrease in PTSD compensation given that we have been in a war on \nterror since the year 2001. However, today there are just under 30,000 \nveterans of the global war on terror on the disability compensation \nrolls for PTSD. Thus, the increase in PTSD rate represents a broad \ncross-section of the veterans community.\n  No matter how far removed they are from military service, veterans \nare filing claims and being granted service-connected compensation for \nPTSD, and these staggering increases are occurring despite a decline--a \ndecline--in the overall veteran population.\n  Fact No. 2: Veterans with PTSD-related compensation appear never to \nget better, only to get worse.\n  I just provided the sobering statistics about a 120-percent increase \nin PTSD disability rolls since 1999. Here is what the VA inspector \ngeneral found in its 2005 review of veterans who have been added to the \ndisability rolls:\n\n       Based on our review of PTSD claim files, we observed that \n     the rating evaluation level typically increased over time, \n     indicating the veteran's PTSD condition had worsened. \n     Generally, once a PTSD rating was assigned, it was increased \n     over time until the veteran was paid at the 100 percent rate.\n\n  This fact is even more disturbing than the first. It suggests a trend \ntoward not only increasing sickness over time but also permanent \nsickness. It also suggests a certain sense of inevitability among those \nwith lower disability ratings that the natural progression is for them \nto slip into total 100 percent. Then, as time wears on, total and \npermanent disability is, in fact, established.\n  Mr. President, words have meanings. My greatest worry is that the \nmessage carried by an undesirable rating may lessen a veteran's resolve \nto seek treatment and to actually get better. They may feel themselves \nas beyond recovery, caught in the quicksand of permanent disability. If \nour current system encourages this kind of mindset, then we must change \nit.\n  Fact 3: There is evidence that PTSD is treatable and that VA has the \ntools to do it.\n  This may seem paradoxical, but it is true. The same agency that \npossesses disability claims showing veterans sliding toward increasing \nand permanent sickness is, in fact, the same agency that is recognized \nas having the tools necessary to successfully treat PTSD.\n  On the question of whether PTSD is treatable, here is what the \nInstitute of Medicine found in their 2007 report:\n\n       The committee finds that the evidence is sufficient to \n     conclude the efficacy of exposure therapies in the treatment \n     of PTSD.\n\n  The Institute of Medicine also recommended additional research \nregarding the efficacy of other forms of PTSD treatment, but at a \nminimum, it concluded that the evidence suggests that at least one form \nof treatment worked.\n  What specific assets does the VA have to help veterans with PTSD? \nWell, let me list those assets, and let me also remind my colleagues \nthat the VA health care system has been widely lauded by independent \nexperts as one of the top health care providers in the United States.\n  The VA has 215 readjustment counseling centers, or Vet Centers, which \noffer readjustment counseling for PTSD for afflicted veterans. The VA \nhas PTSD clinic teams or specialists at each of its 153 medical centers \nacross the country. The VA has 8 specialized PTSD inpatient units, 10 \nPTSD residential rehabilitation programs, 9 PTSD domiciliary programs, \n7 women's trauma recovery programs, 10 day hospital outpatient \nprograms, 10 substance use PTSD outpatient programs, and 22 women's \nstress treatment outpatient programs. These programs offer a full \nspectrum of therapies, including exposure therapies and medications to \ntreat our veterans for PTSD. In total, VA is planning to spend more \nthan $3 billion on health care services this year--roughly one-tenth of \nits total medical care budget.\n  So how do we explain this paradox? Why does a look at the \ncompensation rolls show us that veterans with mental illness are \ngetting progressively worse even though the VA health system is \nrecognized as having the tools to make them better?\n  That question leads me to my fourth and final fact: There is a poor \nlinkage between the arm of VA that treats PTSD--the Veterans Health \nAdministration--and the arm of the VA that awards disability \ncompensation--the Veterans Benefits Administration.\n  One of VA's strategic objectives is to restore the capabilities of \ndisabled veterans to the greatest extent possible. Most would agree \nwith that objective, and most would conclude that restoring capability \ninvolves a focus on treatment and rehabilitation and not a rush to, in \nfact, award disability compensation.\n  The problem is that the VA is inconsistent in how it measures whether \nit is achieving its objective. On the health care side, VA measures \nwhether it is obtaining this objective by measuring meaningful outcome \ndata regarding wellness and disease prevention. On the disability \nbenefits side, it measures it by how fast and accurate a disability \nclaim can in fact be decided.\n  There is a serious disconnect here. One side emphasizes health and \nwellness, the other emphasizes a rush to award compensation confirming \nthe existence of illness. There is no requirement that these two sides \nwork together. Thus, disability compensation can be awarded and \nincreased over the years without a veteran ever receiving medical \ntreatment.\n  To me, there is something backward about how this works. The Veterans \nDisability Benefits Commission honed in on this point in its 2007 \nreport. There is little interaction between the Veterans Health \nAdministration, which examines veterans for evaluation of severity of \nsymptoms, and treats veterans with PTSD, and the Veterans Benefits \nAdministration, which assesses disability ratings and may or may not \nrequire periodic reexamination.\n  A further disconnect seen by the Veterans Disability Benefits \nCommission, the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs held a hearing \nlast week at which the chairman of the Disability Commission, GEN James \nTerry Scott, testified. I asked General Scott specifically to expand on \nthe Commission's findings and, more importantly, their recommendations. \nGeneral Scott told me it was not his intent to offend anyone, but that \nwe have been paying people with PTSD to go away; not to treat them, to \ngo away. He went on to say that disability compensation has precluded, \nin the judgment of the Commission, any effort to make veterans with \nPTSD better, the No. 1 objective, I believe, of our system.\n  General Scott then made the following statement that represents the \nheart of the Commission's findings on the link between PTSD \ncompensation and treatment:\n\n\n[[Page S495]]\n\n\n       It is our judgment that one of the principal goals of the \n     VA and of the Commission, was that we want to make people \n     better so they can return to the fullest extent possible, \n     into ordinary lives without treatment. I do not see how we \n     are fulfilling our obligation.\n\n  These facts lead me, and I hope they will lead my colleagues as well, \nto the inescapable conclusion that the current approach to helping our \nveterans diagnosed with PTSD simply is not working. It is abundantly \nclear that we need to try something new. Again to quote the Veterans \nDisability Benefits Commission report:\n\n       The Commission believes that PTSD is treatable, that it \n     frequently reoccurs and remits, and that veterans with PTSD \n     would be better served by a new approach to their care.\n\n  The Veterans Disability Benefits Commission says:\n\n       Veterans with PTSD would be better served by a new approach \n     to their care.\n\n  I believe the legislation I am introducing today is, in fact, that \nnew approach. Before I describe the legislation and how it works, let \nme describe how the present system is working or, as the evidence \nsuggests, not working.\n  Let's say a young marine who is 2 years removed from his service in \nIraq comes to the VA because he is suffering from PTSD-related \nflashbacks and cannot hold down a steady job. As a consequence, he is \nhaving trouble paying his bills. We all would.\n  That veteran needs help immediately. First and foremost, he needs \nmental health treatment before his condition worsens, but he also needs \nshort-term financial help during his treatment period. If we cannot \naddress that, we cannot be assured that the correct amount of \nrehabilitation takes place.\n  Under the current system, the veteran might first be counseled to \nfile a disability claim with the Veterans Benefits Administration. And \nwho could blame him. It is the source of money. He sees that as the \nquickest route to solving his immediate financial crisis.\n  Although medical care would be made available at that time, the \nveteran cannot simply afford to put his life on hold to get well. We \ncan all associate with this. After a 6-month wait, the average time it \nnow takes to process a disability claim--average; some are sooner, more \nare later, but the average is 6 months--the veteran might be rated \nservice connected due to disability. But by that time, a critical \nwindow of opportunity for wellness would have come and gone. The \nveteran's experience with the VA will have been one that emphasizes his \nsickness and the level of his disability rather than wellness through \nan aggressive treatment program.\n  What would my legislation do? It would establish a program to refocus \nthe existing system to one that emphasizes and incentivizes wellness. \nIt would say to a veteran eligible for VA health care who suffers \nfrom service-related PTSD, depression, anxiety disorder, or related \nsubstance use disorder, that our focus is to make certain you are given \nthe best efforts to get healthy and to feel better.\n\n  It would do this by providing--get this--a wellness stipend, a \nwellness stipend for up to 1 year to any veteran diagnosed with these \nconditions so long as the VA diagnosing physician judges the conditions \nto be plausibly related to military service.\n  All the veteran would have to do is to agree faithfully to attend the \nprescribed treatment regime, in other words, go get the services that \nare already provided, and hold off on filing disability for those \nillnesses until you have completed your rehab schedule. So if the rehab \nschedule the doctor prescribes is 6 months, we want you to hold off \nfiling the disability claim for 6 months so we can give you the \nfinancial help you need to get through it, we can focus you into \ntreatment, and at the end of the time you and the system can assess \nwhere you are.\n  That is it. And we will do that for up to a year. Here is how it \nworks for the marine whom I spoke about earlier. Upon diagnosis and \ntreatment with the conditions of the program, an immediate $2,000 \nwellness stipend is made to him. All of a sudden the immediate \nfinancial crisis could be over; no lengthy claims process, no 6-month \ndelay in getting needed financial help.\n  With this immediate financial infusion, our marine can focus on \ngetting well and not worrying about how he pays the next month's rent. \nMore importantly, every 90 days that he participates, every 90 days \nthat they can say ``he came to rehab,'' it translates into an \nadditional $1,500 of a wellness stipend, a reward for continued \nparticipation. Finally, at the end of the treatment program, in this \ncase the end of a year, a final $3,000 wellness stipend would go to the \nmarine. Thus, in the total of a 1-year treatment program, we would pay \nthe maximum wellness stipend of $11,000.\n  Think about this. We are actually taking the most difficult piece, \nwhich is the financial obligation, and we are setting that aside so we \ncan focus on what I believe is our obligation: to make sure that we \nprovide the best course of rehab, of prevention, of wellness.\n  I recognize treatment programs will vary depending on the medical \nneeds of the veteran. My legislation gives the VA complete discretion \nto develop a recovery plan of an appropriate type and duration. Hence, \nif our marine only needs a 4-month program, he would receive $2,000 of \nwellness stipend up front, $1,500 after 90 days, and $3,000 at the end \nof the program, for a total of $6,500.\n  Hopefully, at the conclusion of the treatment of our marine, he will \nthen be healthy, or at least healthy enough to reenter society and move \non to a productive life. If the opposite is true and the marine did not \nget well, his option to file a disability claim is still available in \ntotal. We have not deprived any veteran of their right to file \ndisability claims.\n  What we have asked is: Set it aside, let's focus on treatment, let's \nmake sure you are not financially strapped, and at the end of intense \ntreatment, focus on that treatment, let's get back together, and if you \nare still in a situation where you are disabled, then we file the \ndisability claim.\n  I know some might think this is a nonconcept, paying people to come \nin for what is basically free health care. But I think it is time for \nall of us to recognize what the Veterans Disability Benefits Commission \nand the Dole-Shalala commission have already recognized: treatment, \nrehabilitation, and recovery need to be the primary focus of our VA \nhealth and benefits system. And, more importantly, they need to be the \nfocus of our mental health services.\n  Let me quote the Disability Commission on this very point.\n\n       The Commission believes that a new, holistic approach to \n     PTSD should be considered. This approach should couple PTSD \n     treatment, compensation, and vocational assessment.\n\n  The Disability Benefits Commission felt so strongly about focusing on \ntreatment for those with mental illness, particularly PTSD, that it \nrecommended that we condition the receipt of compensation on the \nreceipt of treatment.\n  I am not proposing that we condition it as the Commission has \nproposed to Congress, but I want my colleagues to understand, you \ncannot have multiple commissions look at this issue and say: It is \nbroken. It does not focus on the wellness our veterans need. It needs \nto be changed.\n  Senator Dole and Secretary Shalala's commission recommended providing \ntransition payments for injured service personnel while they receive \ntreatment and rehabilitation services, and they recommended an \nincentive bonus payment designed to reward participants in a rehab \nprogram for achieving certain milestones, that if they actually \naccomplished a milestone that was set, we give them a financial \nincentive.\n  Why? Because today's veteran, in many cases, has expectations that \nare unlike any generation before. Because of their age, because of the \ntypes of injuries they are exposed to, what their expectations are with \nan artificial limb--I lose no mobility, I am just as productive, I can \nplay golf, I can run, I can play basketball, I can even pass a physical \nto stay in the Army. That is the reality. If we lose them up here, we \nhave done them an injustice relative to their expectations for life. I \nthink both commissions focused on an innovative approach to wellness, \nand the Disability Commission approach goes farther than mine in that \nit is a negative incentive as opposed to a positive one, but the \nunderlying concepts are the same. The current system is not working. \nLet's try something new.\n\n[[Page S496]]\n\n  I want to make a few points clear. First, under my legislation, no \nveteran would have to give up his or her right to receive disability \ncompensation. Veterans can file a claim whenever they want. If they \ndecide when they are presented this option right at the beginning that \nthey want to file a disability claim and roll the dice on rehab, they \ncan do that. If they get a month into rehab and they decide: I do not \nthink this is working, they can file a disability claim. They will not \nget a financial stipend at the end of 90 days. They can drop out. They \ncan continue to access VA benefits. They can continue to stay in rehab. \nBut they may feel compelled to go ahead and file a disability claim. \nThey can do that. The financial stipend ends, but we still continue the \ntreatment, we just do not have an incentive for them to attend.\n  The wellness stipend, as I said, will be paid only if the veteran \nagrees to stay faithful to the program and holds off on filing the \nclaims during that treatment period of up to 1 year.\n  Second, none of the nearly 300,000 veterans already in receipt of \nPTSD-related compensation and the thousands of others in receipt of \ncompensation for depression and anxiety disorder would have to give up \ntheir compensation in order to participate in the treatment first \nprogram. For them, my legislation would pay a wellness stipend that is \none-third the amount I mentioned earlier, so long as they agreed not to \nfile a claim to increase their disability rating during this treatment \nperiod.\n  Let me draw a distinction. For somebody who has already filed a \ndisability claim, regardless of how old they are, and annually goes to \nbe rerated, if they delay that rerating, if they go into an intense \nrehabilitation program, if, in fact, one has been identified by a \nmedical professional within the Veterans' Administration for them to \nenter into, if they agree not to be rerated until the completion of \nthat program, we will actually include them in the cash stipend, but it \nwill be one-third the amount of somebody who enters the system for the \nfirst time. So whether you are a veteran who has never filed a claim \nbefore, a veteran with a claim pending, a veteran already in receipt of \ncompensation, the treatment first program would be available to all.\n  Finally, my legislation contains no requirement that disability \ncompensation be reevaluated at the end of the treatment period. If \ntreatment works--and the Institute of Medicine says it does--then \nveterans will have better lives because of it. That is the only goal of \nthis legislation. I think we can all look at it, with what we know \nabout the health care system, we can probably find a rationale to say, \nif we invest now in these veterans, we might save money on the back end \nfor taxpayers in actual health care services that might be provided to \nsomebody who drops out of the workforce who doesn't regard their health \nas important because they have now become locked into a monthly \ndisability check for their livelihood.\n  But for the ones who could end up there that we have now gotten into \nrehab successfully and increased or changed the quality of their life, \nthe likelihood is the back end health care cost is minimal, if any.\n  In conclusion, the status quo is not working. We need a new and bold \napproach. My legislation represents a direct challenge to all of us to \nthink outside the box, to think about things that work elsewhere, but \nwe haven't tried. Doing so sometimes requires taking steps that are a \nlittle unknown and a little bit unique. I am sure not only Members of \nthe Senate but the veterans service organizations and, I am sure, the \nveterans themselves will look at this and say: Where is the cash?\n  There is no cash. For once, we have a piece of legislation that is \nfocused on how to make people better. We are willing to put our money \nwhere our mouth is because it is that important to a 19-year-old who \ncomes back from Iraq who can truly be made well with the right type of \nrehab and who may, because of financial decisions in his own life, not \nchoose to fully exhaust the rehabilitation needed to overcome that \nmental health challenge. This at least would give the American people \nthe assurance that we have done everything possible for that 19-year-\nold to get the services he or she would need to lead a productive and \nfruitful life.\n  I ask my colleagues for their support. It is time to put the \ntreatment of our veterans with mental health illnesses first.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Reed, Mr. Menendez, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Whitehouse, \n        Mr. Inouye, Mr. Levin, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 2577. A bill to establish background check procedures for gun \nshows; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Gun Show \nBackground Check Act of 2008. I am proud to be joined by lead cosponsor \nSenator Jack Reed from Rhode Island, as well as Senators Feinstein, \nKennedy, Menendez, Kerry, Schumer, Whitehouse, Inouye, Levin, and \nBoxer.\n  It was almost 9 years ago, on May 20, 1999, that I stood in this \nchamber and urged my colleagues to close the gun show loophole once and \nfor all.\n  Barely 1 month earlier, two teenagers had shot and killed 12 students \nand one teacher at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado. None \nof us will ever forget the horror we felt as we watched students run in \nfear from a shooting rampage that took the lives of 13 innocent people.\n  Those 13 people never should have died because those teenagers never \nshould have had those guns. Some of the guns were purchased from \nunlicensed dealers at gun shows.\n  Although the Federal Brady Law requires licensed firearms dealers to \nconduct background checks before selling guns, a loophole in Federal \nlaw allows unlicensed dealers--who make up 20 to 50 percent of all \ndealers at gun shows--to sell guns without conducting background \nchecks.\n  Because the Columbine killers' guns were bought from unlicensed \ndealers, they were sold without a single background check being done. A \nfriend who bought them guns said she never would have done it if she \nhad to go through a background check.\n  In the wake of that terrible tragedy, the Senate responded. We passed \nmy legislation to close the gun show loophole, with Vice President Al \nGore casting the tiebreaking vote.\n  Unfortunately, the gun lobby stripped my legislation in conference, \nand 9 years later, the gun show loophole is still open. Nine years \nafter the horror of Columbine, easy access to guns is still the law of \nthe land, and gun violence still plagues our schools, our streets, and \nour communities.\n  Last April, we witnessed the worst school shooting tragedy in our \nNation's history. Thirty-two students and professors were killed, and \n15 more were wounded at Virginia Tech.\n  We know now that the Virginia Tech shooter never should have been \npermitted to buy the two weapons he used that day. He should have been \non a prohibited list because of his history of treatment for serious \nmental illness. In response, we are working to make sure that States \ninclude these mental health records in the FBI's background check \ndatabase.\n  However, even if the Virginia Tech shooter had been stopped from \nbuying a gun at a gun shop, he still could have walked down the street \nto a gun show to buy a gun from an unlicensed dealer. All the mental \nhealth records in the world will not stop mentally ill people or other \nprohibited purchasers from buying guns unless all gun dealers--\nincluding unlicensed dealers at gun shows--have to consult those \nrecords before selling a gun.\n  That is why the Virginia Tech Review Panel recommended closing the \ngun show loophole to prevent prohibited purchasers from buying guns. \nThat is why the survivors of the Virginia Tech massacre and families of \nthe victims are fighting to close the gun show loophole.\n  Today, I ask my colleagues to finish the job we started almost 9 \nyears ago. We must close the loophole that allows convicted felons, \nfugitives and domestic abusers to buy guns without going through a \nbackground check.\n  The Lautenberg-Reed bill would close the gun show loophole by \nrequiring background checks for all gun sales at gun shows. \nSpecifically, our bill would require background checks by licensed \nfirearms dealers for all gun transactions at gun shows; define a gun \nshow as an event where 50 or more guns are offered or exhibited for \nsale; require gun show promoters to register\n\n[[Page S497]]\n\nwith the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, ATF, and \nensure that sellers understand their legal obligations; require \nlicensed gun dealers to keep records of guns sold at gun shows to make \nit easier to trace guns that are later used in crime.\n  This bill is a common-sense public safety measure. It has been \nendorsed by the International Association of Chiefs of Police.\n  Now, let me be very clear: Our bill would not hurt law-abiding gun \nowners. It would simply require a background check to stop unlicensed \nsellers from selling guns to people who are not allowed to own one. \nApproximately 92 percent of background checks are completed within \nminutes, and 95 percent are completed within 2 hours.\n  Those few minutes are worth it. From the enactment of the Brady Act \nin 1993 through 2005, nearly 70 million background checks have been \nperformed, denying guns to 1.36 million prohibited purchasers.\n  I am proud to say that more than 150,000 of those guns have been \ndenied to convicted domestic abusers as a result of a law I wrote in \n1996.\n  We can only imagine how many lives have been saved by preventing \nfelons, fugitives, and domestic abusers from getting those guns. Now we \nhave the opportunity to save even more lives by requiring that every \ngun sold at the thousands of gun shows held across the U.S. each year \ngoes through a background check.\n  It has been almost 9 years since the Columbine tragedy. We should not \nwait another day to close the gun show loophole.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my colleagues \nin support of the Gun Show Background Check Act to reduce gun violence. \nClosing this dangerous loophole in current Federal gun laws will make \ngun show transactions safer for all our people.\n  Americans overwhelmingly favor responsible gun control laws. They \nwant effective background checks for firearm purchases at gun shows or \nanywhere else. Yet, year after year, the ``gun show loophole'' allows \nfirearms to be purchased with no questions asked, and legislation is \nurgently needed to close this flagrant loophole in our current gun \nlaws.\n  Under today's laws, licensed gun dealers must be approved, must \nregister with the Federal Government, and must conduct background \nchecks on gun buyers who come to their stores. But in most States, \nalmost anyone can be an unlicensed private seller of guns. Timothy \nMcVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber, was one such private seller at gun \nshows. These private sellers have no obligation to conduct criminal \nbackground checks on buyers or keep any records at all about the sale. \nIt is no surprise that felons and other prohibited gun buyers go to gun \nshows to buy guns in order to evade background checks. That is \nunacceptable. Closing the gun show loophole and requiring background \nchecks for purchasers at gun shows is vital for public safety.\n  The Gun Show Background Check Act defines gun shows as any event at \nwhich 50 or more firearms are offered or exhibited for sale and \nrequires gun show promoters to register with the Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. It requires the promoters to \nmaintain a list of vendors at all gun shows, and these vendors must \nacknowledge receipt of information about their legal obligations. It \nalso requires that all firearm sales at gun shows go through a Federal \nFirearms Licensee. Private vendors and nonlicensed persons will be \nrequired to complete the sale of weapons using such a licensee, who \nwill be responsible for conducting a background check on the purchaser \nand maintaining a record of the transaction. Finally, the bill improves \nthe tracing of firearms by requiring these licensees to submit \ninformation about firearms sold at gun shows to the ATF's National \nTracing Center.\n  Approximately 50 percent of all gun sales in the U.S. today are \n``private'' sales made by individuals at thousands of gun shows. No \nproof of identification and no criminal background check are required. \nEven after the horrific events of September 11, suspected terrorists \nand felons can easily purchase any quantity of firearms, including \nmilitary style assault weapons, without an ID or background check at \ngun shows in 32 States. Federal law permits gun owners to sell rifles, \nshotguns, and even assault weapons to children, without their parent's \nknowledge or permission.\n  It is not enough to leave this issue any longer to State action. As \nJohn Rosenthal, founder of the nonprofit organization, Stop Handgun \nViolence, has pointed out, Massachusetts has enacted some of the most \neffective laws to prevent gun violence in the country, but \nMassachusetts is surrounded by States, which have no such laws and \nallow individuals to buy and sell guns easily. According to ATF data \nfor 2006, many of the gun crime weapons recovered in Massachusetts had \nbeen obtained in other States with little or no regulation of firearms \nsales.\n  Critics claim that mandating background checks at gun shows will not \nreduce crime significantly and will be a step towards banning private \nfirearms sales between individuals. Some even make the preposterous \nclaim that there is no gun show loophole, and that gun control \nadvocates are trying to address a non-existing problem. Evidence \nclearly proves, however, that gun shows are an important source of the \nguns used in crime in the U.S. During the late 1990s, cases involving \ngun shows and flea markets accounted for 30 percent of all trafficked \nguns in the U.S. That is no surprise, since there are over 4,000 gun \nshows in the U.S. every year, and no Federal laws to regulate them. \nStatistics also show that States such as Massachusetts, where strict \ngun control legislation has been enacted, have significantly lower \nfirearm fatality rates than States with lax gun laws.\n  In another appalling move, the Bush administration successfully \npushed legislation requiring the FBI to destroy records of approved gun \npurchases within 24 hours of a completed background check. That action \nprevents law enforcement from identifying whether a person under \ninvestigation for another crime, including terrorism, has purchased a \nfirearm. In addition, if federally licensed gun dealers fail to report \nstolen or missing guns, they face only misdemeanor charges, despite the \nfact that thousands of guns are stolen from gun stores every year. The \nrifle used by the DC sniper was ``lost'' by a gun store--the same store \nthat ``lost'' 238 guns in 3 years.\n  We can't ensure public safety unless we stop kowtowing to the gun \nlobby. We can't accept a system that allows criminals and terrorists to \nbuy guns at gun shows without detection. The gun show loophole should \nhave been closed long ago. I urge my colleagues to enact this vital \nlegislation to do that. I commend Senator Lautenberg and Senator Reed \nfor introducing this bill, and I look forward to its enactment into law \nas soon as possible. Too many lives are on the line for us to delay any \nlonger.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE (for himself and Mr. Inhofe):\n  S. 2579. A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint \ncoins in recognition and celebration of the establishment of the United \nStates Army in 1775, to honor the American soldier of both today and \nyesterday, in wartime and in peace, and to commemorate the traditions, \nhistory, and heritage of the United States Army and its role in \nAmerican society, from the colonial period to today; to the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, since its founding in 1775, the U.S. Army \nhas served this country well for over 230 years and has played a \ndecisive role in protecting and defending freedom throughout the \nhistory of the U.S., from the Colonial period to today, in wartime and \nin peace; and has consistently answered the call to serve the American \npeople at home and abroad since the Revolutionary War. The sacrifice of \nthe American soldier, of all ranks, since the earliest days of the \nRepublic, has been immense and is deserving of the unique recognition \nbestowed by commemorative coinage.\n  Today I rise to introduce the U.S. Army Commemorative Coin Act, and \nam joined by Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma in support of the bill, \nas well as the U.S. Army, the National Museum of the U.S. Army, and the \nArmy Historical Foundation.\n  The U.S. Army Commemorative Coin Act authorizes the Secretary of the\n\n[[Page S498]]\n\nTreasury to mint 100,000 five dollar gold coins, 500,000 one dollar \nsilver coins, and 750,000 half-dollar copper-nickel clad coins.\n  These coins will be the first U.S. coins to honor the Army as an \ninstitution in its entirety. Coin designs will be emblematic of the \ntraditions, history and heritage of the U.S. Army, and its role in \nAmerican society, from the Colonial period to today. Design motifs will \nspecifically honor the American soldier, both today and yesterday, in \nwartime and in peace; and commemorate the traditions and heritage of \nthe U.S. Army.\n  A surcharge will be applied to each coin, in the amount of $35 for \neach $5 gold coin, $10 for each silver dollar coin, and $5 for each \nhalf-dollar clad coin. Proceeds from the sales of these coins will be \ndirected to the Army Historical Foundation specifically to be used to \nhelp finance construction of the National Museum of the U.S. Army at \nFort Belvoir, VA.\n  The Army, the Nation's oldest and largest military service, is the \nonly service that currently lacks a comprehensive, national museum \ncelebrating, preserving and displaying its heritage and honoring its \nveterans. The Army also lacks a national memorial to serve as its \nnational landmark here in America's capital city. The museum will \neventually fill both roles.\n  One of the ways that the museum already honors Army veterans is \nthrough its ``Registry of the American Soldier.'' The Registry \npotentially could contain millions of names and service histories, and \ncan already be viewed online. It is open to all who have worn the \nArmy's uniform, and I myself recently became the first Member of the \nU.S. Senate to be listed. This registry will eventually be permanently \ndisplayed at the museum after its public opening, due in 2014.\n  In 2000, the Secretary of the Army designated the Army Historical \nFoundation as its primary partner in building the National Museum of \nthe U.S. Army, and today the Foundation is actively engaged in \nexecuting a major, $200 million, capital campaign to support the \nMuseum.\n  These commemorative coins will do more than just honor the Army and \nour Army veterans. They will also help ensure that the extraordinary \naccomplishment and sacrifice of our soldiers will live on as a legacy \nfor future generations. This bill authorizes surcharges that may \ngenerate over $12.2 million for the Army museum. I want to assure my \ncolleagues that this bill will not place any burden on the American \ntaxpayer. The profits generated by the sales of these coins will cover \nall costs incurred by the Department of the Treasury.\n  Personally, I will never forget the pride I felt in wearing my \nuniform during the Second World War, and I know that I share this pride \nof service with millions of fellow veterans from all walks of life \nacross this great country.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, which \nwill honor the U.S. Army while helping to open an outstanding, world-\nclass National Museum of the U.S. Army just across the river from this \nbuilding.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2579\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I rise to express my support for an \neffort that I believe is long overdue. I am honored today to join \nSenator Inouye as a co-sponsor of the U.S. Army Commemorative Coin Act \nof 2008. As co-chair of the Senate Army Caucus and a former soldier, I \nam proud to pay tribute to the U.S. Army, which has dutifully served \nour Nation for over 230 years.\n  The Army is the only service branch that currently does not have a \ncomprehensive museum honoring its members and veterans. The \nCommemorative Coin Act will help raise the revenue needed to build a \nmuseum dedicated to the men and women who have for so long protected \nthe sovereignty and freedom of our country. The museum will serve to \ncommemorate the enormous sacrifice of our soldiers, and will be a \nsymbol of the Army's dedication to the fight for freedom.\n  Since the days of the Continental Army of the Revolution, to the \nhighly mobile and technological force of today, the U.S. Army has been \nthe bulwark against which tyranny and oppression have consistently \nfailed. It is time we permanently memorialize the sacrifice that the \nU.S. Army has given to the cause of liberty around the world.\n  I urge the Congress to quickly grant its approval to the U.S. Army \nCommemorative Coin Act of 2008.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BYRD (for himself and Mr. Rockefeller)\n  S. 2581. A bill to designate as wilderness additional National Forest \nSystem lands in the Monongahela National Forest in the State of West \nVirginia, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join with my friend \nand colleague from West Virginia, Senator John D. Rockefeller, to \nintroduce legislation entitled the Wild Monongahela: A National Legacy \nfor West Virginia's Special Places. Our legislation would designate \nadditional wilderness areas in the Monongahela National Forest, located \nin eastern West Virginia. A bipartisan companion measure was introduced \nyesterday in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n  I have long supported efforts to provide permanent protections for \nour most treasured lands. Along with Senator Kennedy and Senator \nInouye, I voted for the original Wilderness Act in 1964. We can proudly \nsay that the nine million acres of lands protected by the Wilderness \nAct has now grown to over 106 million acres in 44 States.\n  One of the most important sectors for economic development in West \nVirginia is environmental tourism. Our ``Wild and Wonderful'' slogan \naptly describes the beautiful vistas, flower covered valleys, free \nflowing streams and rivers, and impressive sandstone formations, that \ncan be found in the Monongahela National Forest. Inclusion of these \nsites in and nearby federally protected wilderness areas puts them ``on \nthe map'' for those seeking an adventure in nature. Attracting these \nvisitors is one of the keys to future economic growth in West Virginia.\n  Since the Forest Service released its new Forest Management plan for \nthe Monongahela National Forest in September 2006, I have heard from \nmany West Virginians wishing to express their strong opinions on \nproposals that call for new wilderness areas. I was particularly \ntouched by a Christian youth group that visited my office. These young \npeople spoke in personal terms of how a hike in these wild areas \nbrought them closer to God.\n  Currently, the Monongahela National Forest has five protected \nwilderness areas, including Otter Creek, Dolly Sods, Laurel Fork North \nand South, and Cranberry. These areas comprise about 78,000 acres of \nland, approximately eight percent of the Monongahela's 919,000 acres.\n  Our legislation would designate seven additional areas for wilderness \nprotection out of the 18 roadless areas evaluated by the Forest \nService. Three of these are expansions of existing wilderness areas. \nThese are the Cranberry expansion, Dolly Sods expansion, and the Otter \nCreek expansion. We propose four new areas for wilderness protection--\nBig Draft, Cheat Mountain, Roaring Plains West, and Spice Run. In all, \nour legislation would protect an additional 47,000 acres of wilderness. \nThis would bring the total acreage of wilderness in the Monongahela \nNational Forest to approximately 125,000 acres, or just under 14 \npercent of the total forest.\n  Our legislation would add a significant amount of land to those areas \nprotected as wilderness. However, the vast majority of the Monongahela \nNational Forest will continue to be available for the multiple uses \nenvisioned when the National Forest System was first created.

Res. 437\n\n       Whereas the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have exerted very \n     large demands on the Treasury of the United States and \n     required tremendous sacrifice by the members of the Armed \n     Forces of the United States;\n       Whereas Congress has a constitutional responsibility to \n     ensure comprehensive oversight of the expenditure of United \n     States Government funds;\n       Whereas waste and corporate abuse of United States \n     Government resources are particularly unacceptable and \n     reprehensible during times of war;\n       Whereas the magnitude of the funds involved in the \n     reconstruction of Afghanistan\n\n[[Page S500]]\n\n     and Iraq and the war on terrorism, together with the speed \n     with which these funds have been committed, presents a \n     challenge to the effective performance of the traditional \n     oversight function of Congress and the auditing functions of \n     the executive branch;\n       Whereas the Senate Special Committee to Investigate the \n     National Defense Program, popularly know as the Truman \n     Committee, which was established during World War II, offers \n     a constructive precedent for bipartisan oversight of wartime \n     contracting that can also be extended to wartime and postwar \n     reconstruction activities;\n       Whereas the Truman Committee is credited with an extremely \n     successful investigative effort, performance of a significant \n     public education role, and achievement of fiscal savings \n     measured in the billions of dollars; and\n       Whereas the public has a right to expect that taxpayer \n     resources will be carefully disbursed and honestly spent: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SENSE OF SENATE ON CERTAIN CLAIMS REGARDING THE \n                   COALITION PROVISIONAL AUTHORITY.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that any claim of fraud, \n     waste, or abuse under the False Claims Act that involves any \n     contract or spending by the Coalition Provisional Authority \n     should be considered a claim against the United States \n     Government.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am going to be introducing legislation--\nI have previously introduced this--that deals with the construction in \nthe Congress of what is called a Truman Committee.\n  In fact, President Truman was from the home State of the Presiding \nOfficer and the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee on the \nfloor. So the two Senators from Missouri, of course, I know harbor \ngreat pride in Harry Truman.\n  One of the interesting things about Truman's tenure here in \nWashington, DC was not just his service in the Senate and not just him \nbeing President, but one of the sources of pride was his stewardship of \nsomething called the Truman Committee.\n  At a time when a President of his own party was in power in the White \nHouse, he and the Congress created a committee here in the Senate to \ntake a look at waste, fraud, and abuse in contracting, particularly in \nthe military. It cost him $15,000 to start it. Estimates are they saved \n$15 billion--in dollars from that time. Think of that: $15,000 to start \nthe committee and saved $15 billion.\n  Now I know there are some who will disagree, but I happen to think it \nis long past time for us to be far more aggressive to find out what is \nhappening to all this money. I will give you a couple of examples. One \nI have used a lot--I shall not today--by bringing a towel to the floor \nof the Senate, but I have held up a towel that Henry Bunting brought. \nHe was a buyer for Kellogg, Brown, and Root, a subsidiary of \nHalliburton. He was a buyer stationed in Kuwait. One of the things he \nwas to do was buy hand towels for American soldiers. So he filed out \nthe order for hand towels. His supervisor saw it and said: No, we are \nnot going to buy those hand towels; we are going to buy hand towels \nwith the initials of our company embroidered on the hand towels, KBR.\n  He said: Well, that will almost triple the cost. He was told: That \ndoes not matter; this is a cost-plus contract. The American taxpayer is \ngoing to pick up that tab.\n  So they ordered the towels that cost four or five times more. It did \nnot matter; the taxpayers pick up the tab. That little towel is a very \nsmall reminder of what has been going on and how much the taxpayer has \nbeen fleeced. There is so much more.\n  Why do we need to track these things? Well, Paul Mullinax is a good \nreason. I called Paul Mullinax one Sunday. He was a truck driver in \nFlorida. Here is what Paul Mullinax did. This is a good example of \ncontracting in FEMA.\n  Paul Mullinax drives a refrigerated 18-wheeler. He was in Florida. He \ngot a call from FEMA when Hurricane Katrina hit. They needed ice down \nin the Gulf of Mexico. So Paul Mullinax, God bless him, drove up, and \nhe picked up some ice in New York for a FEMA contract; picked up a load \nof ice in his refrigerated truck. They said: Take it to Carthage, MO. \nThis is ice that is destined for the Gulf of Mexico for the relief of \nthe Katrina victims.\n  He drove his truck from New York to Carthage, MO; got there, they \nsaid: No, you are not supposed to be in Carthage, MO; you are supposed \nto be in Montgomery, AL. So he turned his truck south and east and went \nto Montgomery, AL. When he got there, he said there were over 100 18-\nwheel trucks. They had him park. He sat there for about 12 days with \nhis refrigerated unit running on his truck. After about 12 or so days \nthey sent him to Gloucester, MA, to offload his ice. This is ice \ndestined for victims of Katrina. He picked it up in New York, went to \nCarthage, went to Alabama, and then they said: Offload it in a \nwarehouse in Massachusetts, 15,000 bucks for that truckload of ice.\n  There were another 100 18-wheelers sitting where he was sitting. \nShould somebody ask questions and say: Who on Earth is responsible for \nthis? The answer is yes. Waste, fraud, and abuse in contracting is \nepidemic. It is unbelievable.\n  Connected to the Katrina issue, this is a photograph, of course, of \n8,420 brandnew, never-used FEMA trailers clogging an unused airport. \nThe question is: Who made that decision and why? Were there any \nconsequences as a result of this decision? I do not know.\n  This is money wrapped in Saran Wrap. Hundred dollar bills. This guy, \nby the way, told me--this is in a basement in Baghdad. This guy told me \nthat they wrapped this money in Saran Wrap and occasionally threw it \naround like a football because it is about the size of a football--I \nhave never wrapped hundred dollar bills. I have never seen that many \nhundred dollar bills. But if you wrap hundred dollar bills in Saran \nWrap, I guess that is what it looks like. He said they actually threw \nthem around like footballs in that room in Baghdad. The reason these \nwere wrapped in Saran Wrap, with some rubber bands around them, is \nbecause this guy was in charge of distributing the money. He said we \nwere paying contractors and subcontractors in Iraq, and our motto was: \nWe pay in cash; you bring a bag.\n  This payment happened to be a $2 million payment. We pay in cash, so \nbring a bag. He said it was just like the Wild West.\n  Question: Who is watching over all of this? Who is tracing it all? \nThere is, I think, substantial evidence, with the release just 2 days \nago of the Special Inspector General for Iraq, and another report, if \nyou go through all of those reports, not just with Iraq, go through the \nreports on Katrina, and so many other similar examples, there is, I \nthink, substantial evidence to lead one to conclude this is the \ngreatest waste, fraud, and abuse in the history of this country.\n  Harry Truman, at a time when there was substantial concern about \nthat, was able to get a select or special committee created here in the \nCongress, bipartisan; cost $15,000 to create, they saved $15 billion. \nPretty successful. It ought to happen again. I am going to introduce \nlegislation today, once again. We have voted on it several times \npreviously. I propose that we once again create a Truman Committee, a \nbipartisan committee to investigate waste, fraud, and abuse, and on \nbehalf of the American taxpayer say: This cannot continue. This has to \nstop.\n  I am going to make a longer presentation at some point, but I wanted \nto simply indicate that there is so much that needs to be done on this \nissue, and my hope is that at last, at long, long last, this Senate \nwill adopt a select committee or a special committee similar to the \nTruman Committee.\n  If ever the American taxpayer deserved good Government, it is now, \nwith something like this in which we can begin to unravel who got what \nand how we stop this from happening again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/30/senate-section/article/S501-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S501-S502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 438--AUTHORIZING THE PRINTING WITH ILLUSTRATIONS OF A \nDOCUMENT ENTITLED ``COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS, UNITED STATES SENATE, \n                              1867-2008''\n\n  Mr. BYRD (for himself and Mr. Cochran) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n[[Page S502]]\n\n                              S.
