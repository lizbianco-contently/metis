Mr. President, the matters before the Senate have been \nhere. There are no restrictions on any amendments that have been \noffered. We disposed of some campaign finance amendments that were \noffered yesterday. I know the amendments were offered in good faith, in \ngood conscience by the authors of the amendments. I agree with the \nauthor of those amendments, that we need to take a look at campaign \nfinance reform, but I think it\n\n[[Page S406]]\n\nshould be done in the right way and that is to have hearings.\n  I believe we need extensive hearings on these matters. And both \nSenator Bennett and Senator Feinstein have agreed to do that. So if \nthere are other campaign finance matters, we would approach those in \nthe same manner as we did these.\n  It is very important we finish this legislation. We are going to do \nthe very best we can to do that, and we are going to finish it next \nweek.\n  Now, I told the Republican leader, late last night, that I am \nthinking of filing cloture tomorrow or Tuesday on this matter. I think \npeople have had every opportunity to offer amendments, to debate those \namendments. I am sure there will be others that will be offered and \ndebated, I hope, today. It is an important piece of legislation. But I \nhope people would do their best to direct it toward what we are trying \nto do; that is, ethics and lobbying reform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/11/senate-section/article/S406-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the distinguished Republican leader, with me \nand a few others, met with the President yesterday. I told the \nPresident how much I thought of him, personally. I told him, even \nthough my fondness for him is significant, I disagree with a number of \nhis policies, not the least of which is what is going on in Iraq.\n  He announced his new plan last night, and it was basically what he \ntold us there at the White House yesterday. The President admitted he \nhad made some mistakes, and I think that is commendable, the right \nthing to do, because there have been mistakes made in the waging of \nthat war. But by calling for escalation of this conflict, I think he is \non the verge of making another mistake.\n  As I made clear in a letter to the President last Friday, along with \nSpeaker of the House Pelosi, I oppose his new plan because it sends the \nwrong signal to the Iraqis, to the Americans, and to the rest of the \nworld. President Bush is Commander in Chief, and his proposal deserves \nserious consideration by this body, and we will give it serious \nconsideration.\n  In the days ahead, we will give his proposal and the overall \nsituation in Iraq a thorough review. I received a call late last night \nfrom one Democratic Senator who has a proposal, early this morning from \nanother Senator, a Democratic Senator, who has some ideas. We heard, \nyesterday, from Senator Coleman. He opposes the surge. Senator \nBrownback is in Iraq and issued a press release saying he opposed the \nsurge.\n  But we are going to have hearings. Those hearings are starting today \non the war that is raging in Iraq. Tomorrow, there will be further \nhearings by the Armed Services Committee. In those hearings, experts \nwill be asked about his proposal. And when the process is complete, we \nwill have a vote in the Senate. As to when that will be, under Senate \nschedules, sometimes it is difficult to determine, but we will have \none. I will not prejudice the outcome of the vote on the President's \nplan, but I will say this: Putting more U.S. combat forces in the \nmiddle of an Iraqi civil war is a mistake.\n  In November, voters all across the country spoke loudly for change in \nIraq. That was the issue. In overwhelming numbers, they delivered a \nvote of no confidence on the President's opened-ended commitment and \ndemanded we begin to bring this war to a close.\n  Last December, the Baker-Hamilton Commission--a respected panel of \nforeign policy experts who studied the law, patriots all--echoed the \nvoters' call for change. The Commission, which included both Democrats \nand Republicans, determined the time has come to transition our forces \nout of Iraq, while launching a diplomatic and regional strategy to try \nto hold together this destabilized region.\n  But last night, the President--in choosing escalation--ignored the \nwill of the people, the advice of the Baker-Hamilton Commission, and a \nsignificant number of top generals, two of whom were commanders in the \nfield.\n  In choosing to escalate the war, the President virtually stands \nalone.\n  Mr. President, we have lost more than a score of soldiers from \nNevada. The same applies to every State in the Union. From the State of \nPennsylvania--I was speaking to the junior Senator from Pennsylvania--\nthey lost more than 140. So many have sacrificed so much. They have \ndone their job, these brave men and women. It is time for a policy, I \nbelieve, that honors their service by putting the future of Iraq in the \nhands of the Iraqis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/11/senate-section/article/S406-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, let me echo the comments of the \nmajority leader about the underlying bill. The Senate passed, \nessentially, this bill 90 to 8 last year. Because of difficulties in \ndealing with the other body, we were not able to complete the job. But \nthe Senate is ready to act. Members on this side of the aisle are ready \nto act. I share the majority leader's view that we ought to wrap this \nimportant lobby and ethics reform bill up sometime next week, and we \nwill be cooperating toward that end.\n  We made good progress yesterday. There are a number of other \namendments to be dealt with. We expect to deal with many of them today \nand in the morning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/11/senate-section/article/S406-4", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Briefly, Mr. President, with regard to the President's \nremarks last night, I think the American people would like to see us \nprevail in Iraq, succeed in Iraq. And the definition of ``success,'' \nobviously, would be a stable government and an ally in the war on \nterror. What prevents that is violence in Baghdad.\n  This plan announced last night to clear and hold Baghdad \nneighborhoods gives the capital city a chance to quiet down, to create \nthe kind of secure environment that will allow this fledgling democracy \nto begin to function.\n  I think the President should be given a chance to carry this out. \nRather than condemn it before it even starts, it seems to me it would \nbe appropriate to give it a chance to succeed. If it could succeed, it \nwould be an enormous step forward in the war on terror.\n  Finally, let me say, it is no accident we have not been attacked \nagain here for the last 5 years. I hope no one believes that is a quirk \nof fate. The reason we have not been attacked again here at home for \nthe last 5 years is because we have been on offense in Afghanistan and \nIraq. Many of the terrorists are now dead, many are incarcerated, \nothers are hiding and on the run.\n  The policy of being on offense has been 100 percent successful in \nprotecting our homeland, and we are grateful for that, that no \nAmericans have been attacked for 5 years.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/11/senate-section/article/S406-5", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, following the other two speakers in \nregard to Iraq, I want to say a couple things. No. 1, anybody who \ncriticizes what the President is proposing or anybody else is proposing \nor what has been done cannot get away with criticizing. There has to be \nanother plan. I want to hear plans from people who think that what the \nPresident is doing is wrong. What would they do?\n  The second thing is that even the Iraq Study Group, which is very \nbipartisan, said there should not be a precipitous withdrawal from \nIraq.\n  In regard to what my distinguished leader of the Republican caucus \nhad to\n\n[[Page S407]]\n\nsay, that there has not been any attack on Americans in the 5 years \nsince 9/11, those who are criticizing our efforts on the war against \nterror would be the first ones, if we had an attack this very day, of \ncriticizing the President of the United States: Why wasn't he on top to \nprevent some sort of attack? And because America has not been attacked, \nthere tends to be a short memory about the fact that we did lose 3,000 \nAmericans. And we know it can happen again.\n  We know that terrorists came into O'Hare with the idea of a dirty \nbomb in America. We know there were people who were going to blow up \nbridges in New York City who were caught and the plans known. We \nindividual Senators have been told by the CIA and by the FBI about many \ninstances of where terrorist attacks against Americans have been \nstopped, and American lives have not been lost because of that. But \nthey cannot talk about it because we do not want the terrorists to know \nwhat we know about them.\n  Too much attention on Iraq detracts from the fact that there are \nterrorists in 60 different countries around the world waiting to kill \nAmericans. Evidence of that was American military people working with \nthe Filipinos over the weekend to kill two terrorists connected with \nradical religious groups.\n  We finally were able to get at some of the people who should have \nbeen arrested in the previous administration, if a proper relations \nwith Saudi Arabia had brought it about, who thought up the bombing of \nthe embassies in east Africa when 12 Americans were killed and 200 \nother people were killed. We believe one of those persons was killed in \na strike we were making in Somalia over the weekend. So we are involved \nin more than just Iraq in the war on terror.\n  People who forget what happened to America on 9/11, and if it \nhappened again, some of the people who are criticizing what the \nPresident is doing would be there saying, as they were soon after \nSeptember 11: Why wasn't the President on top of what happened on \nSeptember 11 so it wouldn't happen again, when there were five \ninstances of Americans being killed: 1993, 1995, 1997, 1999, before \n2001, and this body passed the Iraqi Liberation Act unanimously in 1998 \nbecause President Clinton was saying what a threat Saddam Hussein was \nto the United States or to the world as well and that he had to go.\n  When you have that bipartisan support at a time when Americans are \nbeing attacked and killed--in 1993, 1995, 1997, and 1999, before 9/11 \nsomewhere around the world--you have to stop to think, it isn't just \nIraq. It isn't just Afghanistan. It isn't just 9/11. These religious \nradicals have been out to kill Americans going way back to 250 marines \nbeing killed in Lebanon in 1983. And there are individual instances of \nterrorism before that.\n  The war on terrorism isn't something new. What is going on in Iraq is \nnot the war on terrorism. What is going on in Afghanistan is not the \nwar on terrorism. The war on terrorism covers many nations, many \nthreats to American people. The life of every one of us in this Chamber \nright now, if we were to go over to some parts of the world, would be \nthreatened. We expect the President of the United States to protect us \nbecause he is Commander in Chief and because the responsibility of the \nFederal Government under the Constitution, No. 1, is the protection of \nthe American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/11/senate-section/article/S407-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S407-S409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 GOVERNMENT NEGOTIATION OF DRUG PRICES\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I did not come to the floor to talk \nabout Iraq. I am not on too many of the committees that deal with \nforeign relations and military issues. I am on the Finance Committee, \nserving as a team player with the capable chairman of that committee, \nSenator Baucus, to deal with health issues, tax issues, and trade \nissues.\n  One of the health issues I have been speaking on for the last several \ndays is the issue of Medicare and prescription drugs. For 3 days you \nhave heard this Senator say why Democratic efforts to ruin the Medicare \nprescription drug program by doing away with the nonintervention clause \nis bad for senior citizens. I will take this fourth day of speaking to \nquote from other experts because I don't presume that any of the other \n99 Senators care what I say. I have said it anyway. But I want to back \nup what I have said over the last 3 days by quoting from other people \nwhom other Senators may be listening to in the period of time between \nnow and a couple of weeks from now when this issue of prescription \ndrugs is going to come up.\n  On Monday I spoke about how the benefit uses prescription drug plans \nand competition to keep costs down and how well that is working. I \nbacked that up statistically. I said it then, and I say it again: If it \nain't broke, don't fix it.\n  I presented findings from the chief actuary at the Center for \nMedicare Services. And for the benefit of a new Senator chairing, this \nchief actuary is the one people on his side of the aisle were quoting \nso extensively, that there was a much higher figure coming out of the \nadministration than what the CBO had, and there was an effort to keep \nthat hidden--what the chief actuary said it would cost--from the \nCongress so that we would pass a bill that was more expensive than we \nsaid it was. And if he could be quoted then, I want people to listen to \nhim now.\n  I also quoted experts from the Congressional Budget Office, \nexplicitly rejecting opponents' claims that giving the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services the authority to negotiate with drug \ncompanies would produce savings.\n  Today I will let the words of others from across the political \nspectrum and from the news media do the talking. I will begin with \nSecretary Michael Leavitt, head of the Department of Health and Human \nServices, who said:\n\n       Government negotiation of prices does not work unless you \n     have a program completely run by the government. Federal \n     price negotiations would unravel the whole structure of the \n     Medicare drug benefit, which relies on competing private \n     plans.\n\n  Just today, the Secretary wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post that \nif the Government was required to negotiate--I am quoting the \nSecretary--``one government official would set more than 4,400 prices \nfor different drugs, making decisions that would be better made by \nmillions of individual consumers.''\n  The Secretary went on to say:\n\n       There are many ways the administration and Congress can \n     work together to make health care more affordable and \n     accessible. But undermining the Medicare prescription drug \n     benefit, which has improved the lives and health of millions \n     of seniors and people with disabilities, is not one of them.\n\n  The next person I would like to quote is Dan Mendelson, a former \nClinton administration official, who now is president of a health care \nconsulting firm that tracks Medicare prescription drug programs. Mr. \nMendelson, a former Clinton administration official, said:\n\n       From a rhetorical perspective, Democrats may feel like they \n     gain a lot with this issue, but there are many substantive \n     hurdles that the government faces in trying to negotiate \n     prices. If you look historically at the government's \n     experience in trying to regulate prices, it's poor.\n\n  That was an official from the Clinton administration. As supporting \nevidence, a Chicago Tribune editorial said the following:\n\n       Richard S. Foster, the chief actuary for the Centers for \n     Medicare and Medicaid Services, studied whether direct \n     government negotiation would yield bigger discounts. His \n     answer: Not likely.\n\n  One reason, he said, was Medicare's unreassuring record on price \nnegotiations, even before this new benefit was passed.\n  I made the point the other day that over the last 40 years, we have \nseen CMS, HHS, price health care, wasting a lot of taxpayers' dollars, \nbecause the Government has overpriced things, overreimbursed things. \nMobile wheelchairs is just the most recent example I have used in some \nof my hearings in my committee while I was chairing it.\n  Medicare has a history, following on what I said, of paying for some \ndrugs ``at rates that, in many instances, were substantially greater \nthan the prevailing price levels. Translation: The feds got fleeced.''\n  That is the chief actuary that people on the other side of the aisle \nwere quoting so liberally 3 years ago. I hope they will take his \nanalysis of what is going on now in Medicare, working well for seniors, \ninto consideration before they screw everything up with an amendment to \ndo away with the noninterference clause.\n  Now I want to show you a chart. I guess this will be the first chart. \nI\n\n[[Page S408]]\n\nwant to start with the Washington Post in November, when they printed a \nquote from Marilyn Moon, director of the health program at the American \nInstitutes for Research. She is a former trustee of the Social Security \nand Medicare trust funds, a former senior analyst of the Congressional \nBudget Office, and the new Senator presiding will find out that the \nCongressional Budget Office is God here. If they say something is going \nto cost something, it costs something. If we think it costs less, we go \nby what they say. If you want to overrule them, it takes a 60-vote \nsupermajority. Marilyn Moon is currently president of the board of the \nMedicare Rights Center.\n  She says:\n\n       This is going to be much more of a morass than people \n     think. Negotiating drug prices is a feel good kind of answer, \n     but it's not one that is easy to imagine how you put it into \n     practice.\n\n  Dr. Alan Enthoven, professor at Stanford University, now emeritus--we \noften read his writings because he is such an expert in health care \nfinancing--wrote in the Wall Street Journal an opinion piece:\n\n       When the government negotiates its hands are tied because \n     there are few drugs it can exclude without facing political \n     backlash from doctors and the Medicare population, a very \n     influential group.\n\n  Quoting further from Dr. Enthoven:\n\n       Congressional Democrats need to be careful in making the \n     logical leap from market share to bargaining power. \n     Empowering the government to negotiate with pharmaceutical \n     companies is not necessarily equivalent to achieving lower \n     drug prices. In fact, neither economic theory nor historical \n     experience suggests that will be the outcome.\n\n  An editorial in the Dallas Morning News echoed my statement from \nMonday that beneficiaries do not want the Government in their medicine \ncabinet. A quote from the Dallas editorial:\n\n       Giving the feds the power to negotiate drug prices for \n     seniors would effectively cede control of the pharmaceutical \n     industry to Washington. When congressional Democrats press \n     for this change, remember they're pushing for much more than \n     lower prices. They're seeking to move the line where \n     government should stop and the marketplace should start.\n\n  But let's talk about who really matters in this case. Who really \nmatters are the beneficiaries, the senior citizens, the disabled people \non Social Security, and, of course, the taxpayers ought to be given \nequal or more consideration. Once again, to emphasize, if it ain't \nbroke, don't fix it.\n  In 2006, premiums were 38 percent lower than originally anticipated. \nBy ``originally anticipated,'' I mean the work that was done by CMS and \nthe Congressional Budget Office to give us information when we wrote \nthis bill in 2003. We also find out that the net cost to the Federal \nGovernment is lower than expected. The 10-year cost of Part D has \ndropped $189 billion, representing a 30-percent drop in the actual cost \ncompared to the original projections.\n  I ask: How many times do Government programs come in under cost? \nEvery day we are reading about cost overruns of Government programs, \nand here is one that is coming in 30 percent under cost, and somebody \nwants to screw it up by offering amendments to change what has worked, \nthe one lever that has brought about 35-percent lower prices for the 25 \ndrugs most used by senior citizens, and that is on top of the 38-\npercent lower price for premiums to which I have already referred.\n  A poll of the Medicare beneficiaries by J. D. Power & Associates, \nwhich takes consumer temperatures of all sorts of products, found that \n45 percent of the beneficiaries surveyed were ``delighted'' with the \nMedicare drug benefit. They gave their own drug plan a 10 on a 10-point \nscale, and another 35 percent of those surveyed gave their prescription \ndrug plan an 8 or 9 rating on a 10-point scale. And other polls are \nconsistent. So that is 80 percent satisfied.\n  All of the program's successes have been challenged at various times \nby this program's opponents, and each time these challenges have been \nproven wrong.\n  As the plan continues to return positive results, skeptics are \nbeginning to change their opinion as well. I want to quote Dr. \nReischauer, who is former Director of the Congressional Budget Office, \nand has great respect on the Democratic and Republican sides. He is a \nnationally known expert on Medicare. Currently, he is president of the \nUrban Institute and serves as vice chair of the Medicare Payment \nAdvisory Commission.\n  This is a very candid statement by somebody who had their doubts \nabout this program when it was put in place. He says:\n\n       Initially, people were worried no private plans would \n     participate.\n\n  In other words, we were patterning it, as I said, after the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Program of 50 years. We wanted to transplant \nthat for the benefit of senior citizens in Medicare. We didn't know if \nour program would work, even though it worked for Federal employees. As \nhe said, there were doubts.\n  Continuing to quote:\n\n       Then too many plans came forward.\n\n  Parenthetically, a heck of a lot more plans than we anticipated. We \neven thought at one time there were going to be so few plans, and \nbecause we wanted people to have some choice, that we were going to \nhave to have the Federal Government subsidize an extra plan just for \npeople to have choice. But then the complaint was too many plans.\n  He goes on to another point:\n\n       Then people said it's going to cost a fortune. And the \n     price came in lower than anybody thought. Then people like \n     me--\n\nMeaning Dr. Reischauer--\n\n     said they're low-balling the prices the first year and \n     they'll jack up the rates down the line.\n\nThat is what he thought.\n\n     And, lo and behold, the prices fell again. At some point you \n     have to ask: What are we looking for here?\n\n  Let me tell you what the press is saying.\n  First, a Washington Post editorial represented an insightful view, \nsaying:\n\n       A switch to government purchasing of Medicare drugs would \n     choke off this experiment before it had a chance to play out, \n     and it would usher in its own problems. For the moment, the \n     Democrats would do better to invest their health care energy \n     elsewhere.\n\n  A USA Today editorial took it a step further, saying:\n\n       A deeper look, however, suggests that the Democrats' \n     proposal was more of a campaign pander than a fully baked \n     plan . . . governing is different than campaigning. The \n     public would be best served if the new Congress conducts \n     indepth oversight to gather the facts, rather than rushing \n     through legislation within 100 hours to fix something that \n     isn't necessarily broken.\n\n  In other words, this Senator says, for a third time, if it ain't \nbroke, don't fix it.\n  Finally, put simply by the National Review, Government negotiation \n``is a solution in search of a problem and could unnecessarily disrupt \na benefit that is working well for seniors.''\n  I am sure the Presiding Officer doesn't want to disappoint people in \nMontana.\n  What compounds the problem is the fact that neither I nor anyone else \nhas heard Democrats explain how Government negotiation would work. I \nspoke a great deal about this yesterday. I am not going to go into the \ndetails of it, but I want my colleagues to hear what the New York Times \nsays. How many times do I quote the New York Times? But when it is very \nuseful, I like to do it.\n  They raise these questions about the Democrats' proposal, H.R. 4, as \nseen by ``many economists and health policy experts . . . as a \nparadox.''\n  On the one hand, Democrats want the Government to negotiate lower \ndrug prices for Medicare beneficiaries, but, on the other hand, they \ninsist that the Government should not decide which drugs are covered. I \nmade clear yesterday, if you don't have a formulary, as the House bill \ndoes not have, you have no lever for the Government to negotiate. That \nis why the Veterans' Administration put in a formulary.\n\n  People say they want to do it like the Veterans' Administration does. \nThen why does the first bill in the House of Representatives take out \nthe only tool by which the Veterans' Administration leverages lower \nprices?\n  Continuing the paradox issue brought up, and I am quoting from the \nNew York Times:\n\n       The bill says the Secretary ``shall negotiate'' lower \n     prices. On the other hand, the drug benefit would still be \n     delivered by private insurers. Each plan would establish its \n     own list of covered drugs, known as a formulary, and the \n     Secretary could not ``establish or require a particular \n     formulary.''\n\n  In the same New York Times article, James R. Lang, former president \nof Anthem Prescription Management--a\n\n[[Page S409]]\n\ndrug benefit manager is what he is--said this:\n\n       For this proposal to work, the Government would have to \n     take over price negotiations. It would have to take over \n     formularies. You can't do one without the other.\n\n  But the House bill just introduced says you can. That is a \nparenthetical on my part.\n  Continuing to quote:\n\n       Drug manufacturers won't give up something for nothing. \n     They will want a preferred position on the Medicare \n     formulary--some way to increase the market share of their \n     products.\n\n  The only comparison I know of is, of course, the Veterans' \nAdministration. I have already referred to that point. So when people \ncome up to me and ask why the Government negotiates for veterans and \nnot for seniors, I tell them what the Medicare system, modeled after \nthe VA, would look like.\n  Yesterday I spent some time explaining what Government negotiations \nlooked like for the VA and other Federal programs. Again, instead of \nlistening to my words, I want my colleagues to hear what other people \nhave said.\n  As explained in the Washington Post:\n\n       The veterans program keeps prices down partly by \n     maintaining a sparse network of pharmacies and delivering \n     three-quarters of its prescription by mail . . . Moreover, \n     the program for veterans is in a position to negotiate hard \n     with drugmakers because it can credibly threaten not to buy \n     from them. Its plan excludes new medicines.\n\n  Why would any person on the other side of the aisle, or even a \nRepublican who might want to consider doing this, want to deny any drug \nto a senior citizen? But the VA program excludes 70 percent of the \ndrugs that senior citizens can get under Part D. And why would anybody \nbacking these plans want to follow the Veterans' Administration and \ndeliver three-quarters of the prescription drugs by mail? Do they want \nto ruin their community pharmacist? I don't think anybody does.\n  The Los Angeles Times continues the discussion, stating:\n\n       Applying the VA approach to Medicare may prove difficult. \n     For one thing, Medicare is much larger and more diverse. VA \n     officials can negotiate major price discounts because they \n     restrict the number of drugs on their coverage list. Instead \n     of seven or eight drugs for a given medical problem, the VA \n     list may contain three or four. If a drug company fails to \n     offer a hefty discount, its product may not make the cut.\n\n  Mr. President, the final thoughts I will leave with you today come \nfrom a letter sent by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. I \nwant to make clear to the new Senators that the Congressional Budget \nOffice is ``god'' around here because when ``god'' speaks up and says \nsomething costs something and you disagree with them, your disagreement \ndoesn't mean anything unless you have 60 votes to override them, a \nsupermajority.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, after reviewing the Democratic bill \nin the House of Representatives at the request of Chairman Dingell, the \nchairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, concluded the \nfollowing, and here I am quoting again and I have a chart on this \nquote:\n\n       H.R. 4--\n\nThat is the Democratic bill in the House--\n\n     would have negligible effect on federal spending because we \n     anticipate that the Secretary would be unable to negotiate \n     prices across the broad range of covered Part D drugs that \n     are more favorable than those obtained by PDPs under current \n     law.\n\n  The letter continues to say:\n\n       . . . [W]ithout the authority to establish a formulary, we \n     believe that the Secretary would not be able to encourage the \n     use of particular drugs by Part D beneficiaries, and as a \n     result would lack the leverage to obtain significant \n     discounts in his negotiations with drug manufacturers.\n\n  In conclusion, the CBO's letter to Mr. Dingell says:\n\n       . . . [T]he PDPs have both the incentives and the tools to \n     negotiate drug prices that the government, under the \n     legislation, would not have.\n\n  I think that pretty much sums it up. I can think of nothing more to \nsay than what the CBO says in regard to the Democratic bill in the \nHouse of Representatives. But maybe to quantify all this, I have \nalready said that the 25 drugs used by seniors most often--the way we \nprice drugs now through plans negotiating for their members to drive \ndown the price of drugs--the average price of those 25 drugs is down 35 \npercent. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\n  As I said earlier this week, I hope we can put politics aside and \nfocus on some of the real improvements we could be making in the drug \nbenefit. I wrote it. There are items that need to be changed, and I \nmentioned some of those items on Monday. This is what we should be \nfocusing on instead of trying to fix something that ain't broke. I \nstill hope that reason will prevail around here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that each side's \nperiod of morning business be extended by an additional 15 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

Mr. President, I come to the Chamber to speak on the \npreeminent issue facing our country today, and that is the threat of \nIslamic radicalism, and specifically to respond to the comments of some \nof our colleagues on the other side of the aisle regarding the \nPresident's speech and the plans he has announced for our fighting \nforces in Iraq last night.\n  As I have tried to sift through the differences of opinion--and here \nagain, among people of good will who love their country and who are \ntrue patriots--I am forced to conclude that the division or faultline \nfalls between those who have simply given up and do not believe the \nsituation in Iraq is salvageable and those who believe the President's \nplan offers the last best hope for success in Iraq.\n  I agree with those who say you cannot look at Iraq as if through a \nsoda straw, as if that is the only challenge facing the United States \nand the Middle East, because, indeed, failure in Iraq, descension into \na civil war, creation of a failed state will undoubtedly create a \nregional-wide conflict that will necessitate the United States and its \nallies reentering the conflict at some later date were Iraq unable to \nsustain and defend and govern itself, as the Iraq Study Group said it \nmust.\n  Indeed, I believe it is incumbent upon those who say the only \nsolution is to draw down our troops in a gradual redeployment to \nexplain what they intend to do when Iraq descends into a failed state, \ncreating another platform, as Afghanistan did once the Soviet Union \nleft that country, which gave rise then to the Taliban and al-Qaida. \nWhat is their plan to deal with that consequence if, in fact, that is \nwhat occurs, if the United States leaves Iraq before it is able to \nsustain itself, to govern itself, and defend itself?\n  I congratulate the members of the new majority, but I must say, with \nthe new majority comes not only the privilege of setting the Nation's \nagenda in\n\n[[Page S410]]\n\nthe Congress but also the duty of governing. It is not acceptable to \nmerely criticize, particularly if you are in the majority. We need to \nknow what their alternative plan is for this unacceptable possibility \nof failure in Iraq if, in fact, we are to cut the legs out from under \nthe Maliki government and simply withdraw before the Iraqis are able to \nsustain themselves.\n  Mr. President, I am one of those who have not given up on Iraq and \nwho believe that our fighting forces in Iraq are doing a lot of good. \nIt is true, as the President said, that mistakes have been made, but it \nis important to recognize that the initial threat in Iraq was of a \nSaddam Hussein delivering weapons of mass destruction and technology \nabout biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons to terrorists to use \nagainst us, as the terrorists did on 9/11. Even a remote possibility \nthat might happen was unacceptable. We voted with a vote of 77 \nSenators--on a bipartisan basis--to authorize the President to use \nmilitary force to take out Saddam Hussein.\n  I don't need to recount the failures of our intelligence community \nthat led us to erroneously believe he actually at that time did have \nweapons of mass destruction. But there is no question at all that \nSaddam Hussein sought weapons of mass destruction, much as his neighbor \nnow to the east, Iran, seeks nuclear weapons itself. It is simply \nunacceptable, in a world where there are those driven by a radical \nideology that celebrates the murder of innocent civilians, as al-Qaida \nand other Islamic radicals do, to allow them to get weapons of mass \ndestruction and then to use them on innocent civilian populations, \nwhether it is in the United States or abroad.\n  It is true that the President has said that this is a test for the \nMaliki government. We are putting a lot of reliance, yet pressure, on \nthe Maliki government to perform. When Prime Minister Maliki said he \nwill stand up to the death squads and Shiite militias, like that of al-\nSadr, we will hold him to his word.\n\n  It is absolutely critical to the success of reconstruction in Iraq, \nto a peaceful self-determination through a democratic form of \ngovernment, that the security situation in Iraq be stabilized. The only \nway that is going to happen is if a lawful government of Iraq obtains a \nmonopoly on the legal use of force in that country. Right now, the \npeople of Iraq don't trust their own Government to provide that sort of \nsecurity, so they have broken down along sectarian lines and relied \nupon Shiite militias and other extralegal groups to try to provide that \nsecurity. But what happened is that we have seen retribution killings \nbetween different ethnic groups. But the threat is that sort of \nsectarian violence is not going to be contained just to Iraq but will \nspill over into the region. Iran will use the opportunity of Shiite \nviolence to exact ethnic cleansing on Sunni populations in Iraq. Iran \nwill use its ability to expand its influence into Iraq, perhaps to \nexpand its own borders.\n  That will not go without some response by the Sunni majority nations \nin the Middle East. Saudi Arabia, for example, has already expressed \ngrave concern that if the Shiite militias and others continue to exact \nviolence upon the Sunni population, they may very well find a necessity \nto become involved and, indeed, we know that what some people view as \nif through a soda straw, violence in Iraq will become a regional \nconflict.\n  Is there any doubt that if, in fact, we fail in Iraq because we have \ngiven up, because we don't believe Iraq and the Middle East is worth \nthis last best chance for success, is there any doubt that the oil and \ngas reserves in that region of the world will be used as an economic \nweapon against the United States? So not only will we have a security \nvulnerability using that platform of a failed state as a launching pad \nfor future terrorist attacks, much as al-Qaida did in Afghanistan \nfollowing the fall of the Soviet Union in that country, but is there \nany doubt that in addition to additional terrorist attacks in the \nUnited States and among our allies and around the world, that the oil \nand gas reserves in that region will be used as an economic weapon to \nwreak a body blow against the rest of the world?\n  So with winning the election on November 7 and gaining the majority \nand the mandate of the American people comes responsibility. The \nresponsibility of our Democratic colleagues is to point out what their \nplans are when Iraq fails if we do not even try, as the President has \nproposed last night, to salvage the situation there by a change of \ncourse, by working with our Iraqi allies, backing them up, stiffening \ntheir backbone, to restore the security environment there so that \nreconstruction and democracy and self-government can flourish. I don't \nknow whether it will work. I don't know whether anyone can ever \nguarantee in a time of war that one side or the other will be \nsuccessful. But the consequences of giving up and of failure are simply \ntoo horrendous to contemplate, present too great a risk to the American \npeople and civilized people around the world, for us not to try.\n  That, to me, is the choice we have been given--between trying, using \nthe last best effort we can come up with through this change of course \nin Iraq, or simply giving up. I would like to hear from our colleagues \nwhat their plan is if Iraq does descend into that failed state, if a \nregional conflict occurs and it then becomes necessary at a future date \nnot to send an additional 20,000 American troops but far more to \nprotect America's national security interests.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Maryland is recognized for 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/11/senate-section/article/S410-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S410-S411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes of the time \ncontrolled by the majority.\n  Last night, President Bush asked the American people to support a \nsurge of military troops in Iraq. Many are using the term ``surge,'' \nthough the President didn't. Make no mistake, this is a dramatic \nescalation of our troop presence in Iraq. In the debate leading into \nthe President's speech, the term ``surge'' was used, which implied \nsomething that was limited and temporary. An escalation is where we are \nheading, which means a long-term commitment with no end in sight.\n  We are in a hole in Iraq, and the President says the way to dig out \nof this hole is to dig deeper. Does that make sense? When you are in a \nhole, do you get out by digging deeper? This is a reckless plan; it is \nabout saving the Bush Presidency, it is not about saving Iraq.\n  Before Congress can act on this plan--and act we must--there are \nseveral questions that need to be answered. I need those answers, you \nneed those answers, the American people need those answers and, more \nimportantly, our troops and their families need those answers. Is this \npolicy achievable? Is it sustainable? What is the President's objective \nin calling for this escalation of troops? Who is the enemy? Does the \nBush administration even know anymore? When our troops are embedded \nwith Iraqi forces, are they going to shoot Sunnis or Shiites? Are we \ntaking sides in a civil war? I don't think we know. What is the Iraqi \nGovernment going to do for itself? We suddenly have something called \nbenchmarks. Where have those benchmarks been for the last several \nyears? What is going to be the political solution that only the Iraqis \ncan do to resolve the power sharing with Sunni, Shiite, and Kurds? \nWhere are the oil revenues that were talked about to pay for this war? \nWhen is the Iraqi Government going to end the corruption in their own \nministries so that they can come to grips with services, security, and \npower sharing and oil revenue sharing?\n\n  Who is going to disarm the militias and insurgents and, more \nimportantly, who is going to keep them disarmed? Are we going to be in \nthose neighborhoods forever? Where are the troops going to come from \nfor this escalation? Our military, our wonderful military is worn thin. \nAlso, how are we going to pay for it? While China builds up its \nreserves, we build up our debt.\n  Make no mistake, though. U.S. troops cannot do what the Iraqi \nGovernment will not do for itself. Iraq needs a functioning government \nthat produces security and services for its own people. It needs a \ngovernment of reconciliation that will function on behalf of the Iraqi \npeople. Iraq needs its own security forces up and running. No matter \nwhat training we give them, they have to have the will to fight. They \nneed to put an end to the sectarian violence, and they need to end\n\n[[Page S411]]\n\nthis corruption in their own ministries to get oil production moving \nand a way to share those oil revenues.\n  There are those who say: Well, what about supporting our troops? I \nabsolutely do support our troops. And for those troops who are in Iraq, \nlet me say this: Your Congress will not abandon you.\n  But the best way to support the troops is not to send them on this \nreckless mission. The best way to support our troops is to bring them \nhome safely and swiftly. That is why I voted against this preemptive \nwar in the first place. In my speech when I was 1 of the 23, I said: We \ndon't know if we will be greeted with flowers or landmines. I said: We \nshouldn't go to Iraq on our own. We need to go with the world if, in \nfact, the weapons are there.\n  Well, from the very beginning, everything the Congress and the \nAmerican people have been told by this administration has proven not to \nbe so. It has either been an outright lie or dangerously incompetent. \nThe President asked the Congress to vote for a preemptive war because \nIraq was supposed to have weapons of mass destruction that posed an \nimminent danger to the United States. Well, the Congress gave the \npreemptive authority. However, the weapons of mass destruction were not \nthere.\n  I say to my colleagues, after all of those troops we sent, weren't \nyou filled with shock and awe to find out there were no weapons?\n  Then, the administration sent Colin Powell to the United Nations to \nmake the case for war. He is one of the most esteemed Americans in the \nworld, and the Bush administration set him up. Then--CIA Director Tenet \nsaid it was going to be a slam dunk. To this day, Colin Powell cries \nfoul about what happened to him at the U.N. How can we trust the data \nor judgment of an administration that continually gives us this fiasco?\n  Now, what about President Bush's good friend, Prime Minister Maliki? \nI listened to my colleague from Texas. He said: Are we giving up on \nMaliki? The question is, is Maliki giving up on Iraq. Are we cutting \nthe legs out from Maliki? I say no, Maliki's government has no legs. \nThey are not involved in dealing with the corruption, with power \nsharing. It is the same Maliki who told our U.S. marines they couldn't \ngo into a neighborhood to go after a Shiite cleric called al-Sadr, who \nbankrolls attacks on American soldiers. Is Maliki an honest broker in \nIraq or is he someone who represents the Shiites?\n  I don't have confidence in what we have been told by this \nadministration, and I have very serious doubts about the will of the \nadministration of Prime Minister Maliki. Make no mistake--and I feel so \ndeeply about this--a great American military cannot be a substitute for \na weak Iraqi Government. The stronger we are, the more permission we \ngive the Iraqis to be weak.\n  We were challenged a few minutes ago to say: Well, what is the \nalternative? I say let's use the ideas that have come from our \ncommanders, which have now been put aside, the Iraq Study Group, and \nothers within the region. Let's use Baker-Hamilton as a starting point. \nLet's send in the diplomats before we send in the troops. I don't \nembrace all of the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group, but it is a \nbipartisan way of going forward. It was not reckless. Once we send in \nthose troops, it is irrevocable. I think we need a new policy, and I \nthink we need a new direction. I think Baker-Hamilton gave us a good \ndirection to pull us together to go in, and I think that is where we \nneed to go.\n  Let me conclude by saying this: To our outstanding men and women in \nuniform who are already in Iraq, you have a tough job, and we are proud \nof you. Neither the Congress nor the American people will ever abandon \nyou. But to those troops who are waiting to head to Iraq, the best way \nto support you is to say no to the President's reckless, flawed \nescalation of this war in Iraq.\n  Again, let's send in the diplomats, not the troops.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Colorado is recognized for 15 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/11/senate-section/article/S411-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S411-S412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EVOLVING DISASTER IN COLORADO\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to call to the attention of \nthe Members of the Senate an evolving disaster that is occurring in \nparts of eastern Colorado as well as parts of Nebraska, Oklahoma, New \nMexico, and Kansas and to concur with statements made earlier this week \nby my colleague, Senator Roberts from Kansas. On Monday, my friend from \nKansas stated that he rose to call attention to what can only be \ndescribed as a major disaster. I agree with Senator Roberts, there can \nbe no doubt that we are dealing with a disaster in the West.\n  Over the last few weeks Colorado and its neighbors have experienced \nrecord-setting blizzards. In some parts of Colorado the storms dropped \nalmost 5 feet of snow which has drifted in some cases to a size of 15 \nfeet. I stand about 6 feet 1 inch, so to get some perspective, 5 feet \nof snow would leave my neck and shoulders just out above the snow. It \nis tough to get around in and a nightmare if you have to tend to \nlivestock, but that is what folks in Colorado, and in the neighboring \nStates have done. In fact, so much snow has fallen in Baca County down \nin southeastern Colorado that weather stations that transmit data \nincluding snowfall were unable to send information because they were \nburied under a number of feet of snow.\n  Let me reiterate that there was so much snow in Baca County that they \nwere unable to measure it. This has created a horrendous situation for \nmany in the West. Thousands of cattle and other livestock are currently \nstranded without food or water. Many have died due to the freezing \ntemperatures. I have here a photo of an animal that is caked with \nseveral inches of snow. There are ice sickles falling down off of the \nnose of the animal and off of the underbelly of the animal. This is a \nhearty animal. Most animals that have suffered this kind of condition \nwould not survive. The reason I point this out to the Members of the \nSenate is it just shows how ferocious this particular storm was and how \nserious of an impact it has had on the animals. This doesn't occur \nunless you have very severe blizzard conditions with lots of snow \naccompanying it.\n  The aftermath of these devastating blizzards continues to paralyze \nmany counties in Colorado and the West. Dozens of communities have \nexperienced severe economic damage and loss as a result of these \nblizzards. These storms have created a dire situation. Thousands of \nlocal men and women have banded together and are working to provide \nrelief to their neighbors and to the tens of thousands of livestock \nfacing starvation. In the tradition of the West, local individuals have \npulled together and spent much of their holiday season trying to dig \neach other out and reach stranded livestock.\n  These storms struck during a time of year when ranchers in Colorado \nare preparing for the National Western Stock Show, one of the largest \nstock shows in the world. The stock show is an important opportunity \nfor ranchers to show stock and to make contacts. Now in its 101st year, \nthis year's stock show has seen a marked drop in attendance due to \nthese storms.\n  A story in the Rocky Mountain News was ``No-Show Stock Show.'' I have \nreceived reports that livestock pens are sitting empty at the stock \nshow and that the number of exhibitors is down. This is because the \nanimals that would fill the pens are fighting for their very survival \nand the ranchers who would typically exhibit simply can't make it \nbecause they are trying to save their stock. Folks aren't at the stock \nshow because they are back home trying to help one another deal with \nthe aftermath of these major storms. Locals are trying to do all they \ncan.\n  I am grateful for the assistance that the National Guard and FEMA \nhave provided. Unfortunately, more help is needed. The vicious \ncombination of blizzards was especially hard on eastern Colorado and \nthe farmers and ranchers who call this part of Colorado home.\n  The part of Colorado hardest hit by these blizzards is also one of \nthe most important agricultural regions in our Nation and is an \nepicenter for cattle production. Ranchers in this part of the State are \ncurrently racing against time in an attempt to locate cattle that have \nbeen stranded without feed or water. Unfortunately, as each day\n\n[[Page S412]]\n\ngoes by, the death toll increases. I have confirmed reports that the \nlivestock loss has already reached into the thousands, and the tally is \nsteadily growing.\n  I have a photo that reflects how devastatingly some of the herds have \nbeen impacted. We have live cattle back here, and down here dead \ncattle. This photo reflects how all the cattle bunched together for \nwarmth during the storm, and as a result, we have dead animals \nclustered together down here in this lower part of the photo that I \nbring to the Senate. It is a gruesome scene. This loss will have a very \nsevere economic impact on this particular farmer and rancher. \nUnfortunately farmers and ranchers all over the State of Colorado and \nour neighbors to the east are facing similar situations.\n  I grew up on a ranch, and I know all too well when your livestock is \nthreatened, then so is your livelihood. Indications are that a tragic \nscene is developing in Colorado as cattle succumb to the elements due \nto a lack of food or a lack of water or from extreme exposure.\n  Colorado's Governor has declared a state of emergency and has \nrequested help from the Federal Government. I support this request and \nhave transmitted my support for Federal aid to the White House. On \nSunday, President Bush made an official emergency declaration for parts \nof Colorado. I am thankful for the President's attention to this crisis \nand the time he and his staff put in on this situation, working through \nthe weekend to help Colorado producers. By signing this declaration on \nSunday night, the President showed that he is a man familiar with \nranching and understands how devastating this situation is for rural \nColorado.\n  The efforts of the President freed up valued aid from FEMA for snow \nremoval for which I am grateful. As you can see from this particular \npicture, we have a roof that collapsed from the weight of the snow. It \nis just part of the picture, but I think it again reflects how the \nutilities and the infrastructure in areas of Colorado have been \nimpacted. These impacts include the closure major highways and one of \nthe country's busiest airports. I am grateful for the aid from FEMA. \nLocal officials have been offering aid from the start and others from \ntheir office have swarmed to Colorado to offer assistance. They have a \ntemporary headquarters set up in a Holiday Inn off the highway. Even in \nthese less-than-ideal conditions, they are committed to helping folks \nin Colorado. This photo depicts the need, it shows a roof that \ncollapsed from the weight of the snow.\n  Last night I was informed by FEMA officials that upon receipt of \nappropriate paperwork from Colorado, up to six additional counties \ncould be eligible for assistance. Those counties that could be added to \nthe President's original emergency declaration are Baca, Bent, Crowley, \nEl Paso, Prowers, and Pueblo Counties. In the coming days and weeks, I \nwill continue to work the FEMA officials to see if other Colorado \ncounties will be eligible. We appreciate the assistance FEMA has \nprovided and their continued efforts.\n  One of the most pressing matters that needs to be addressed is \nlivestock aid. We desperately need aid for livestock rescue and \nrecovery. The need for livestock aid becomes more pressing with each \npassing minute. I am hopeful that short-term relief will be forthcoming \nvery soon.\n  To address this need in the long term I have introduced a bill with \ncolleagues from other affected States. The Livestock Assistance Act of \n2007 will provide aid to farmers and ranchers for livestock recovery \nand assistance to help cover the costs of the livestock losses created \nby these storms. I am hopeful that my colleagues in the Senate can \nappreciate the vital nature of this bill and act quickly on it. As I \nstand here today, another storm is on its way to Colorado, bringing \nArctic cold and a prediction of up to another foot of snow. We are in a \ntough spot out West, and I ask that all necessary Federal resources be \nmade available to Colorado and other Western States suffering the \ndevastation brought on by these historic storms.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, on November 7, the voters in Maryland and \nall around the Nation voted for change. Ten new Senators were elected \nto this body, six defeating incumbents.\n  After serving the people of Maryland for 20 years in the House of \nRepresentatives, I am honored that they have sent me here, to the other \nside of the Capitol, where I will continue to fight on their behalf.\n  The voters in Maryland and across the Nation sent a clear message on \nNovember 7: It's time for a change.\n  Our constituents want things done differently in Washington. They \nwant their interests put before the special interests.\n  Therefore, it is appropriate that the Senate's first order of \nbusiness is ethics legislation that will bring greater transparency and \nfairness to the political process in Washington and help restore the \nAmerican people's confidence in their Government.\n  The American people also called for a reordering of our priorities. \nThey want Congress to respond to the needs of families fighting for the \nAmerican dream.\n  They want their children to have a better chance at that dream, and \nthey know that achieving it is impossible without stronger communities, \naccess to quality health care, and better educational opportunities. \nThey want to raise their families in an energy-independent Nation with \ncleaner air and water. They want a country that respects the rights of \nall, and that celebrates and embraces our diversity.\n  But the loudest cry in November was the call for a change in our \npolicies in Iraq. Americans overwhelmingly want to see our troops begin \nto come home and they don't want to see thousands of additional troops \ngo to Iraq.\n  Iraq is a country today torn by civil war. Victory in Iraq will not \nbe achieved with our military might. It will come only from \nsuccessfully aiding Iraq in establishing a government that protects the \nrights and enjoys the confidence of all its people. It must be a \ngovernment that respects both human rights and democratic principles. \nThe efforts of U.S. soldiers, no matter how heroic, cannot accomplish \nthese objectives for the Iraqis.\n  For 4 years, our soldiers have helped the Iraqis in ousting Saddam \nHussein, providing security to the country and advising and training \nIraqi security forces.\n  Our soldiers have performed their responsibility with bravery and \ndevotion to their country. We honor their service. More than 3,000 \nsoldiers have made the ultimate sacrifice and many more have suffered \nlife-changing injuries.\n  It is well past time for a change in strategy in Iraq. The \ncircumstances on the ground are worsening. Last June, I laid out a plan \nfor success in Iraq. It started with reducing our combat troop levels \nand having the Iraqis take greater responsibility for the defense of \ntheir own country. It stressed the need for diplomatic and political \nsolutions--with the international community engaged in negotiating a \ncease fire with the warring militias.\n  I called on greater support from our allies in helping us to train \nthe Iraqi security forces.\n  And last June, I spoke about the need for a negotiated government in \nIraq that would represent all of its ethnic people--Sunnis, Shia and \nKurds.\n  Last month, the Iraq Study Group came forward with similar \nrecommendations--highlighting the need for the President to start \ndrawing down troops. Many military experts agree, including some of our \ngenerals on the ground.\n  As GEN George Casey recently said:\n\n       It's always been my view that a heavy and sustained \n     American military presence was not going to solve the \n     problems in Iraq over the long term.\n\n  On November 7, the American people told us that they too agree that \nit's time for a change in Iraq.\n  So when President Bush said several weeks ago that he was \nreevaluating the\n\n[[Page S413]]\n\nsituation in Iraq and would announce a new policy shortly after the new \nyear, there was great hope that the President, Congress and the \nAmerican people could come together with an effective new policy to \nhelp the people in Iraq and advance U.S. interests.\n  Unfortunately, that was not the case. President Bush has decided to \nignore the advice of the Iraq Study Group, many of his own military \nofficials and the American people in making his decision to send 20,000 \nadditional American troops to Iraq.\n  The President's announcement last night represents more of the same, \nmore ``staying the course,'' just now with more American troops in \nharm's way. An escalation of U.S. troops in Iraq is counterproductive.\n  Former Secretary of State Collin Powell recently said:\n\n       I am not persuaded that another surge of troops into \n     Baghdad for purposes of suppressing this communitarian \n     violence, this civil war.\n\n  We need a surge in U.S. troops coming home, not a surge in those \ngoing to war. We need a surge in diplomatic and political efforts to \nend the civil war. We need a surge in the urgency of the U.S. \nengagement of the international community to deal with its regional \npolitics and problems in the Middle East.\n  This Congress has a responsibility to our citizens to evaluate a \nclear record of the facts in Iraq.\n  The hearings taking place in the Armed Services and Foreign Relations \nCommittees are vital. But our responsibility goes well beyond the \nhearings. Individually and collectively, we must act with our voices \nand our votes, speaking out vigorously and taking action against the \ncontinued mismanagement of this war.\n  The American people deserve an opportunity to hear from military \nexperts and administration officials on the consequences of a surge in \ntroops in Iraq. Congress has a responsibility to scrutinize this plan \nand offer its own recommendations.\n  In October 2002, in the other body of Congress, I voted against \ngiving the President the right to use force in Iraq. I am proud of that \nvote. As a Senator, I have the responsibility to acknowledge where we \nare today and take action that is, in my view, in the best interest of \nMaryland and the Nation.\n  I want the U.S. to succeed in Iraq and in the Middle East. I want our \nsoldiers to return home with the honor that they deserve. I want to \nwork with my colleagues to strengthen our military and to make sure \nthat promises made to our veterans are promises kept.\n  We can achieve these objectives, but they would be more achievable if \nthe President would act on the overwhelming evidence and work with this \nCongress to truly set a new direction in Iraq. We must begin by \nstarting to bring our troops home, not by escalating troop levels. We \nneed to engage and energize the international community, including our \ntraditional allies as well as other countries in the Middle East. Our \nprimary focus must be extensive political and diplomatic negotiations \ndirected toward the twin goals of a cease-fire and a lasting and stable \nIraqi Government. Let that be our mission.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SANDERS).

Mr. President, last evening President Bush spoke about \nIraq. His speech represented perhaps a change in tone but not a \nfundamental change in strategy, and the American people were looking \nfor a fundamental change in strategy. They were particularly looking \nfor this change based upon the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group. \nThese are distinguished Americans who have dedicated themselves to \npublic service, bipartisan individuals who thoughtfully and carefully \nlooked at the situation in Iraq and made a series of proposals, most of \nwhich the President apparently ignored.\n  The American people are deeply concerned about the course of our \noperations in Iraq. They are incredibly supportive, as we all must be, \nof the soldiers, the marines, the sailors, the airmen and airwomen who \nare carrying out this policy, but they are deeply concerned. One of the \nthings that has characterized the President's approach to Iraq for so \nmany years has been the discussion of what I would describe as false \ndichotomy--false choices. You can recall, in the runup to the conflict \nin Iraq, the President said we have two choices--invade the country, \noccupy it indefinitely, or do nothing. Of course, those were not all \nthe choices.\n  We had the ability to interject U.N. inspectors to do the things \nwhich we thought were important, which is to identify the true status \nof weapons of mass destruction--and that was rejected out of hand. We \nhad diplomatic options. We had limited military options. If, as was \nsuggested, there were terrorists lurking in the Kurdish areas, we could \nhave used the same approach as we used a few days ago in Somalia, a \npreemptive targeted strike, targeted on those whom we had identified as \nterrorists. All of that was rejected.\n  Then the President undertook a strategy which I think was deeply \nflawed, which has led us to a situation now where the emerging threat \nof Iran is much more serious. Iran has seen its strategic position \nenhanced by the Bush strategy.\n  Of course, we know now the incompetence of the occupation of Iraq, \nthe decisions made in Washington about debaathification, about \ndismantling the Iraqi Army, about spending so many months in denial of \nthe spreading insurgency have led us to this day. After all of that, \nthe American people were looking for something more than a so-called \nsurge.\n  I say so-called because this is not a surge. This is a gradual \nincrease in troops--20,000 troops approximately in the Baghdad area, \nand additional Marine forces in Al Anbar Province. It is gradual \nbecause our Army and Marine Corps are so stretched that they could not \ngenerate an overwhelming force in a short period of time. In fact, due \nto the policies of this administration, we lack an adequate strategic \nreserve. Our Army Forces who are not deployed to Iraq are, in so many \ncases, unready principally because of equipment problems, to rapidly \ndeploy. That I think is a stunning indictment of this administration.\n  But this gradual escalation is not, I think, going to accomplish the \ngoal and objective that the President talked about. One of the critical \naspects of this is that even though 20,000 troops will represent \nbillions of dollars of additional expense and put a huge strain on the \nArmy and Marine Corps, it is probably inadequate to the task of a \ncounterinsurgency operation in a city such as Baghdad, a city of \nroughly 6 million people. Lieutenant General David Petraeus who has \nbeen nominated to take over the operations in Iraq, replacing General \nCasey, spent the last several months coauthoring a new field manual on \ncounter-insurgency, and one point they make in this field manual is \nthat counterinsurgency operations require a great deal of manpower.\n  At a minimum, the manual suggests 20 combat troops for every 1,000 \ninhabitants. That would mean Baghdad, with roughly a population of 6 \nmillion people, would require, according to the manual, 120,000 combat \ntroops. The additional 20,000 troops the President is suggesting will \nhardly make that total of 120,000 combat forces. I know there will be \nIraqi forces there, but those forces have proven to date to be less \nthan reliable. They are motivated, not so much by a military agenda but \nby sectarian agendas. They are often overruled by their political \nmasters in the Iraqi Government.\n  So as a result, the increase of forces is probably inadequate to \naccomplish the mission the President wants. That is not according to \nsome subjective view; it is based upon the best thinking of the best \nminds in the Army and the Marine Corps. For that reason alone, the \nPresident, I think, has to ask himself after the speech, Why am I doing \nit?\n  The other huge cost is not just in terms of money, in terms of stress \non\n\n[[Page S414]]\n\nthe regular Army and Marine Corps, but inevitably we are going to have \nto reach out, once again, to our National Guard, those men and women \nwho have served so well, the citizen soldiers we call upon, again. They \nwill receive an additional burden to bear. Again, probably not in \nsufficient numbers with a 20,000 deployment to achieve and guarantee \nsuccess.\n  The other factor here, too, is it will literally take the pressure \noff Iraqi forces and Iraqi political leaders to do the job that they \nmust do. The issues in Iraq, the issues of counterinsurgency are \nfundamentally more political than they are military. That is what we \nare seeing today in Iraq. It requires political will. It requires \npolitical competence to succeed. That will and confidence must be the \nIraqis' primarily, not that of the United States.\n\n  What I think is happening in Iraq today is this Government is \nessentially a Shia government. They feel they are winning. They are \naccomplishing the goals they won't articulate but that seem to be \nobvious from the pattern of their behaviors: to marginalize the Sunnis \nso they never again will be in a position of dominating Iraq, \nconsolidating Shia power in the south of Iraq, using probably the model \nof the Kurds in the north. If you go to Iraq, the area which is the \nmost successful, prospering, is the Kurdish area. If you look at it and \nask why, they have their own militia, they have their own virtual \nautonomy, they have access to oil, and they are doing quite well.\n  Again, that is what the Shia intend for themselves. That, of course, \nleaves the Sunnis in an area where they face an existential conflict. \nIf things continue as they are today, they will be absolutely and \ntotally marginalized in Iraqi society. The Shia, still harboring fears \nafter years and years of domination and horrific tyranny by Sunni \nleaders, are unwilling to compromise.\n  Unless we can forge some type of reasoned compromise, it is very \nlikely the future of Iraq is one of political fragmentation, if not \nformal disintegration. I think the best and perhaps the only leverage \nwe have as a nation is to suggest to Shia leaders that we are not going \nto give them an open-ended commitment.\n  I was pleased last evening to hear for the first time the President \nsay something my colleague Carl Levin has been stressing for almost 2 \nyears now, a simple statement by the President to the effect that there \nis not a blank check to the Iraqi Government. I fear those perhaps are \njust words because in the same speech he is talking about increasing \nour military forces there, increasing our support to the Iraqi security \nforces. That is where we have our leverage. I don't think the President \nis quite yet willing to use that leverage. More importantly, until we \ndo exert that leverage, the milestones the President talked about--the \nmilestones which were announced months ago by the Iraqis and still are \nunfulfilled--will remain unfulfilled.\n  The political issues have not yet been resolved by the President. \nWithout political cooperation and political commitment by the Iraqi \nGovernment, the number of forces we have in the country is a secondary \nmatter. What I think the Iraqi political leaders--the Shia government \nand the Maliki government, with Hakim and the Badr organization and \nMoqtada al Sadr and Maahdi army, all part of this government--what they \nwould be quite willing to do is to have us conduct operations in Sunni \nneighborhoods in Anbar Province, but what will be left undone is \nconfronting, in a serious way, the Shia militias which are also part of \nthe problem.\n  If you go to Iraq, as many of my colleagues have, as I have, and you \ntalk to the Prime Minister or the Minister of the Interior, they \nrecognize there is an insurgency. It is a Sunni insurgency. They would \nbe very happy for us to conduct operations against the Sunnis. But they \nare very unwilling to take the steps that are necessary to provide a \ncheck on Shia militias and Shia operations in that country.\n  There is another long-term consequence of the President's speech \nwhich may be, in the longer term, the most important. Any strategy of \nthe United States--increasing troops, redeploying troops, training \nIraqi forces--requires as an essential element, public support of the \npeople of the United States. The people spoke last November and in a \nvery convincing way said they need to see a change in course in Iraq. \nThey continue to speak--not just in the formal polls, but go out to the \ncoffee shops, walk the streets of this country, all across this \ncountry, and you will discover the great concern and disquiet the \nAmerican public has about the President's policy in Iraq.\n  Nothing changed last evening, fundamentally. In fact, the President \nactually predicted that this increase in troops is likely to create \nmore chaos in Baghdad, more casualties. That is the nature of \ncommitting more troops to intense combat operations in an urban area. \nThe American public will have a very difficult time squaring that with \nthe assertion this is the way forward. I fear they might abandon \nsupport for any type of significant commitment to the region.\n  This is a very dangerous precedent that could be emerging today. The \nPresident, in disregarding popular opinion, is running the risk of \nalienating that opinion in a way in which we cannot conduct serious \noperations there for limited missions in Iraq and elsewhere.\n  We have a very difficult situation. We have a situation in which we \nhave to begin to manage the consequences of the administration's \nfailures. This is not a question of winning or losing. This is a \nsituation of managing a situation that is deteriorating rapidly and, \nsome fear, irreversibly. In doing that, we have to adopt a strategy \nthat is consistent with our resources--our military personnel, our \ndiplomatic resources, our economic resources, and the political support \nof the American people.\n  That strategy rests in the context of a phased withdrawal of our \nforces from Iraq, a refocusing of our mission to specific areas which \nis more consistent with our national interests than trying to arbitrate \nand settle the sectarian civil war. These missions would be training \nIraqi security forces so the country does not collapse because of chaos \nand anarchy; focusing attention on those small elements of \ninternational terrorists who are there, many of whom came after the \nfall of Saddam--not before; of indicating to the regional powers that \nwe would not tolerate gross violations of the borders of Iraq or gross \nintervention in the political affairs of Iraq. These are missions that \ncan and should be done, and they don't require an increase of troops. \nIn fact, I would suggest they require a redeployment of our troops.\n\n  The real challenge is--and the President alluded to it without \nindicating to the American public confidently and surely that these \nmilestones are being accomplished--that the Iraqi Government, the \nMaliki government, must undertake serious reconciliation. I think the \ntemper of that Government at the moment is not to do that because they \nfeel they do not have to.\n  Second, they have to begin to spend their own money. I was aware of \nthe significant money--upwards of $13 billion that the Iraqi Government \nis sitting on--they are not spending. I hope the American people were \npaying attention when the President announced the Iraqis are promising \nto spend $10 billion for their own benefit. We have been pouring \nbillions of dollars into Iraq for reconstruction and economic \nrevitalization and the Iraqis have been sitting on billions of dollars \nwhen their survival and the integrity of the country is at stake. \nSomething is wrong. They have suggested they will spend the money, but \nonly time will tell because so far they have been extremely reluctant \nto spend resources unless they benefited their own sectarian community. \nIf that continues, this will be another idle promise.\n  There is one issue, too, that the President did not talk about which \nis essential to progress in Iraq. It is not democracy and freedom--all \nthe buzzwords--because, frankly, what democracy means in Iraq to the \nShia is Shia control. What democracy means to the Sunni is Sunni \ncontrol. That is one of the reasons they are having sectarian struggle.\n  What we need now more than democracy and freedom and elections is \ngovernmental capacity, ministries that actually can serve the people of \nIraq so they feel they have a stake in their Government and the \nGovernment can respond to their basic needs. They have ministers in \nIraq today who are political operatives. The Minister of Health is a \ndevotee of Moqtada al Sadr and the\n\n[[Page S415]]\n\nMaahdi army and will refuse to adequately supply hospitals in Sunni \nareas. We have repeated examples where the ministries of Iraq are not \nonly nonfunctional but deliberately so. Until they help them, or \nsomeone helps them, there won't be a government to rally around for the \nIraqi people because the Government provides nothing to them.\n  This is a long list of items that has to be accomplished. I am not \nconfident, after the President's speech, that any of this will be done \nby the Iraqi Government, nor am I confident at all that an additional \n20,000 troops in Baghdad will make a decisive military difference. I \nbelieve the President has to go back to the drawing board to craft a \ntruly changed strategy that will be consistent with our strategic \nobjectives in the region, consistent with our resources, and consistent \nwith the will and desires of the American people. I hope he does that.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 11\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I come to the Chamber to discuss DeMint \namendment No. 11 which relates to earmark reform.\n  First, let me say that I welcome the Senator's efforts to strengthen \nthis bill. We certainly all have a mutual interest in making this \nprocess more transparent. Senator DeMint, in his amendment language, \nadopts the language passed by the House in several important ways. As \nwe move through the process, we are going to work together to ensure \nthat the earmark provisions are carefully crafted and as strong as \npossible.\n  Unfortunately, overall the DeMint language is not ready for this \nbill. The DeMint amendment defines earmarks to include amounts provided \nto any entity, including both non-Federal and Federal entities. The \nReid-McConnell definition which is before the Senate covers only non-\nFederal entities. On its face, the DeMint language may sound \nreasonable. After all, I have no problem announcing to the world when I \nhave secured funding for the Rock Island Arsenal in my State. But the \nDeMint language is actually unworkable because it is so broad.\n  What does the Appropriations Committee do? It allocates funds among \nprograms and activities. Every appropriations bill is a long list of \nfunding priorities. In the DeMint amendment, every single appropriation \nin the bill--and there may be thousands in any given appropriations \nbill--would be subject to this new disclosure requirement, even though \nin most cases the money is not being earmarked for any individual \nentity. How did we reach this point in the debate?\n  There is a concern expressed by some that there is an abuse of the \nearmark process. When you read the stories of some people who have been \nindicted, convicted, imprisoned because of earmarks, it is \nunderstandable. There was a corruption of the process. But as a member \nof the Senate Appropriations Committee, I tell my colleagues that by \nand large there is a race to the press release. Once you put an earmark \nin to benefit someone in a bill, you are quick to announce it--at least \nI am because I have gone through a long process evaluating these \nrequests and come up with what I think are high priorities. So there is \ntransparency and there is disclosure.\n  The purpose of our debate here is to consider reasonable changes in \nthe rules to expand that disclosure. Senator DeMint is talking about \nsomething that goes way beyond the debate that led to this particular \nbill. We are not talking in his amendment about money that goes to non-\nFederal entities--private companies, for example--or States or local \nunits of government. Senator DeMint now tells us that we have to go \nthrough an elaborate process when we decide, say, within the Department \nof Defense bill that money in an account is going to a specific Federal \nagency or installation. That is an expansion which goes way beyond any \nabuse which has been reported that I know of. Frankly, it would make \nthis a very burdensome responsibility.\n  If I asked the chairman, for example, to devote more funds to the \nFood and Drug Administration to improve food safety--think of that, \nfood safety, which is one of their responsibilities--that is \nautomatically an earmark under the new DeMint amendment, subject to \nbroad reporting requirements. No one can be shocked by the suggestion \nthat the Food and Drug Administration is responsible for food safety. \nThey share that responsibility, but it is one of theirs under the law. \nSo if I am going to put more money into food safety, why is that being \ntreated as an earmark which has to go through an elaborate process? I \nthink that begs the question. Every request, every program, money for \nNo Child Left Behind, for medical research at the National Cancer \nInstitute, for salaries for soldiers, for combat pay for those serving \nin Iraq, for veterans health programs, every one of them is now \nconsidered at least suspect, if not an odious earmark, under the DeMint \namendment. It is not workable. It goes too far.\n  In other instances, the DeMint amendment does not go far enough. To \npass this amendment at this time could, down the road, harm the \nSenate's efforts to achieve real earmark reform.\n  Many of us on the Appropriations Committee happen to believe that the \nprovisions in tax bills, changes in the Tax Code, can be just as \nbeneficial to an individual or an individual company as any single \nearmark in an appropriations bill. If we are going to have transparency \nin earmark appropriations, I believe--and I hope my colleagues share \nthe belief--that should also apply to tax favors, changes in the Tax \nCode to benefit an individual company or a handful of companies. The \nDeMint amendment does not go far enough in terms of covering these \ntargeted tax benefits. The language already in the Reid-McConnell \nbipartisan bill strengthens the earmark provisions passed by the Senate \nlast year by also covering targeted tax and trade benefits. The Reid-\nMcConnell language on targeted tax benefits is superior to the DeMint \namendment. The DeMint amendment, in fact, weakens this whole aspect of \ntargeted tax credits and their disclosure.\n\n  Reid-McConnell covers ``any revenue provision that has practical \neffect of\n\n[[Page S416]]\n\nproviding more favorable tax treatment to a particular taxpayer or a \nlimited group of taxpayers when compared with other similarly situated \ntaxpayers.'' That is the language from which we are working. Consider \nwhat it says: favorable tax treatment to a particular taxpayer or a \nlimited group of taxpayers compared to others similarly situated. That \nis a pretty broad definition. It means that if you are setting out to \ngive 5, 10, 15, or 20 companies a break and several hundred don't get \nthe break, that is a targeted tax credit which requires more \ndisclosure, more transparency.\n  The DeMint amendment covers revenue-losing provisions that provide \ntax credits, deductions, exclusions, or preferences to 10 or fewer \nbeneficiaries or contains eligibility criteria that are not the same \nfor other potential beneficiaries. The Senate should not be writing a \nnumber such as 10 into this law or into the Senate rules, creating an \nincentive for those who want a tax break to find 11 beneficiaries to \nescape the DeMint amendment.\n  The Reid-McConnell amendment establishes a definition with \nflexibility so that facts and circumstances of the particular tax \nprovision can be considered. There may be instances when a tax benefit \nthat helps 100 or even 1,000 beneficiaries should be considered a \nlimited tax benefit. Our bill provides that. The DeMint amendment \nweakens it and means that more of these targeted tax credits will \nescape scrutiny.\n  Second, in the interest of full disclosure, the Reid-McConnell \napproach requires that the earmark disclosure information be placed on \nthe Internet 48 hours before consideration of the bills or reports that \ncontain earmarks. The DeMint amendment does not have a similar \nprovision. Why would he want to weaken the reporting requirement? That \nis, in fact, what he does. Under the DeMint amendment, information \nabout earmarks must be posted 48 hours after it is received by the \ncommittee, not 48 hours before consideration of the bill. In the case \nof a fast-moving bill, it is possible that the information could be \nmade public only after the vote has already been taken. So this \nprovision actually weakens reporting requirements.\n  Finally, it is important that the House and Senate have language that \nworks for both bodies. Technical changes are probably needed in the \ncurrent language in both bills, changes that may come about during the \ncourse of a conference. Adopting the imperfect House language \nwholesale, as Senator DeMint suggests, would make it more difficult for \nus to work out our differences in conference. The better course would \nbe to address the final language in conference and not get locked into \nany particular words at this moment.\n  We need strong reforms in the earmarking process. The Reid-McConnell \nbipartisan amendment does that. Unfortunately, DeMint amendment No. 11 \nweakens it--first, in exempting more targeted tax credits instead of \nbeing more inclusive; second, in weakening reporting requirements \nalready in this amendment; and finally, tying the hands of conferees by \nadopting House language that has already been enacted by that body.\n  The Reid-McConnell substitute is an excellent first step. I am afraid \nthe DeMint amendment does not improve on that work product but detracts \nfrom it. To adopt this amendment will only take us backward in this \nprocess. I urge the Senate to oppose the DeMint amendment No. 11. Let's \nkeep working on this issue together on a bipartisan basis.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 13\n\n  I would also like to discuss DeMint amendment No. 13. This amendment \non the surface seems like a harmless amendment. Nobody wants a \nGovernment shutdown. But in truth, what amendment No. 13 does is \nencourage Congress to abdicate its appropriations responsibility and \nfund the Government on automatic pilot at the lowest levels of the \nprevious year's budget or the House- and Senate-passed levels. That is \nwhat we are in the process of doing for this fiscal year. It is \npainful. But the results could be disastrous if it becomes the policy \nof our country. Funding the Government by continuing resolutions does \nnot allow Members to adequately work for a consensus to adjust funding \nfor new challenges and changing priorities. The responsibility to \nappropriate was duly outlined for the legislative branch by our \nforefathers in our Constitution. It is a duty we should not abandon by \nhanding it over to some automatic process.\n  The Senator from South Carolina has argued that this amendment is \nneeded so that Congress should not feel the pressure to finish \nappropriations bills on time. He is plain wrong. If there is anything \nwe need, it is the pressure to finish on time. If we are under that \npressure, it is more likely we will respond to it. But if we are going \nto glide into some automatic pilot CR that absolves us from our \nresponsibility of passing appropriations bills, we will find ourselves \nin future years facing the same mess we face this year, when many of \nthe most important appropriations bills were not enacted before the \nlast Congress adjourned.\n  Our constituents look to us to complete our appropriations bills on \ntime, not make it easy to govern by stopgap measures that underfund \nimportant priorities such as education, transportation, and health \ncare. Incidentally, the last time Congress completed its appropriations \nprocess on time was the 1995 fiscal year. Rather than abdicate our \nresponsibility, we need to focus on fulfilling that duty under the \nConstitution. I believe this DeMint amendment is not responsible. It \nsignals our willingness to throw in the towel before the fight has even \nstarted.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to oppose this amendment, send a clear \nmessage to the American people that we are ready to accept our \nresponsibilities and not avoid them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I am not quite prepared to make all of my \nremarks about the amendments, but I did happen to be in the Chamber, \nand Senator Durbin was kind enough to open the discussion on two of my \namendments, which I greatly appreciate. I am somewhat disappointed, \nhowever, that my colleague is not completely informed about these \namendments.\n  I will start with the amendment that attempts to more accurately \ndefine what an earmark is. My colleague went to great pains to \ncontinuously describe this as the DeMint amendment, the DeMint \nlanguage. Unfortunately, I am not sure if he knows, but this is the \nlanguage which the new Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, has put in \nthis lobbying reform bill in order to make it more honest and \ntransparent. I believe she has a very thoughtful approach. She \ncampaigned on this, along with a number of Democrats and Republicans. \nWe do need to disclose and make transparent every favor we do for an \nentity.\n  I am beginning to get disappointed in this process because I did \nbelieve in a bipartisan way that we were going to come together to try \nto do things to show the American people that we were going to spend \ntheir money in an honest way and that was not wasteful. But as we look \nback on some of the scandals, the first one that comes to mind, \nobviously, is the Abramoff scandal--using Indian money to try to buy \ninfluence on Capitol Hill.\n  Yesterday there was a thoughtful amendment by Senator Vitter that \nwould have attempted to get the Indian tribes to play by the same rules \neveryone else in America plays by, that they have regulated \ncontributions that are disclosed. The reason we had the scandal with \nAbramoff is the Indian tribes are not regulated by the Federal Election \nCommission. They can give unlimited amounts, unaccounted for, and it \ncorrupted our process. The amendment yesterday very simply said: Let's \njust have everyone follow the same rules. Yet that was voted down, \nprimarily by my Democratic colleagues. I hope they will rethink that. \nWe would like to bring that amendment back to the floor and make sure \nthere is adequate discussion because it is hard for me to believe that \nanyone who wants to clear up the corruption in Washington would \noverlook that a big part of the corruption was caused by unlimited \ndonations by lobbyists from Indian tribes.\n  Now we have another problem. We are talking about earmark reform. We \nuse language here many times in the Chamber that I don't think \nAmericans understand. When we talk about earmarks, we are talking \nusually about lobbyists who come and appeal on behalf of some \norganization or business\n\n[[Page S417]]\n\nor whatever for us to do them a favor with taxpayer money. It may be a \nmunicipality that wants a bridge. It may be a defense contractor that \nwants a big contract from us. And if we put that money in an \nappropriations bill designated just for them, it is an earmark. That is \na Federal earmark. Nancy Pelosi had the wisdom to see that a lot of the \nproblems we have had came from lobbyists asking for favors that went to \nFederal, as well as State, and other types of earmarks.\n\n  What other corruption comes to mind as we think about last year? Duke \nCunningham. The corruption there was a Federal earmark. The underlying \nbill we are discussing today would not have included that. It would not \nhave been disclosed. Senator Durbin said that should not be disclosed, \nwhen most of the problems that we have come from that particular type \nof earmark.\n  I think if you look at this in the big picture, we are talking about \ntrying to let the American people know how we are spending their money. \nWhen we designate their money as a favor to different people and \nentities across this country, we want to let them know what we are \ndoing so we can defend it, so they can see it. But what is a dirty \nlittle secret in the Senate and in the House is that while we are \nmaking this big media display of reforming earmarks and lobbying, 95 \nout of every 100 earmarks are in the report language of bills that come \nout of conference which are not included in the current discussion of \ntransparency for earmarks.\n  So the case my dear friend Senator Durbin has made today is that we \nwant to disclose these particular favors for 5 out of every 100 \nearmarks in this Senate. That is not honest transparency. If we are \ngoing to do it, let's look at what the new Speaker of the House has \nasked us to do. If we are going to go through this process and if we \nare going to change the laws and try to tell the American people that \nnow you can see what we are doing, let's don't try to pull the wool \nover their eyes. Speaker Pelosi is right. Many in this Chamber know I \ndon't often agree with Speaker Pelosi, but she is the new Speaker. One \nof her first and highest priorities was to do this ethics reform bill \nright. At the top of the list is, if we are going to talk about the \ntransparency to the American people, let's be honest and show them the \nway we are directing the spending of their money. I agree with her. I \nam here to defend her language on behalf of the Democratic colleagues \non the House side that let's not try to pull the wool over the American \npeople's eyes and tell them we are cleaning up these scandals when what \nwe are doing here would not have affected the Abramoff scandal, the \nCunningham scandal, or any of the scandals we have talked about in the \nculture of corruption in this Congress. Let's at least be honest with \nthe reform we are saying is going to clean up this place. We are not \nbeing honest now. Speaker Pelosi has the right idea.\n  Let me mention one other thing, the other amendment my colleague was \nnice enough to bring up. It is what we call the automatic continuing \nresolution. I have been in Congress now for 8 years. This is my ninth \nyear. Every year, we get toward the end of the year and we have not \ngotten all of our appropriations done; it comes down to the last minute \nand they are saying we have to vote on this and we have to pass it or \nwe are going to shut down the Government. So we create this crisis. \nThen we don't know what is in all of the bills. They are just coming \nout of conference and we have to vote on them, and most of us go home \nin December and find out about all of the earmarks and the favors that \nwere put in the bills. We find it out later because we are not even \ngiven time to read them. We create this crisis and force people to vote \non bills when they don't know what is in them. We are forced to vote on \nthings that should not be in them so we won't close down the \nGovernment.\n  We need to stop playing this game at the end of the year that forces \nus to accept what lobbyists and Members and staff have worked out that \nwe don't even know about. If we are serious about decreasing the power \nof lobbyists in this place, we need to take the pressure off passing \nbad bills at the end of every year. This is a very simple idea.\n  You will notice, despite what has been said, we passed a continuing \nresolution at the end of last year and didn't pass our appropriation \nbills. Of course, as you look around, you see the country is still \noperating just fine. The thing we don't have is 10,000 new earmarks. I \nwould make the case we need a system that if we are not able to have \nample debate and discussion about appropriations, we don't have all \nthis fanfare about closing down the Government every year and scaring \nour senior citizens and our veterans that something is not going to \ncome that they need. Let's have a simple provision that if we cannot \nget our work done and agree on what needs to be done and what should be \nin these bills, then we will have a continuing resolution until we can \nwork it out. We will fund everything at last year's level, so that \nthere is no crisis, there is just responsibility.\n  That is what is missing here. When we put things into crisis mode, we \ncannot see what needs to be seen, or tell America what needs to be told \nabout these bills, and we pass bills and find out later we have done \nthings that embarrass us and diminish the future of our country.\n  This is a simple amendment. I am very disappointed in my Democratic \ncolleague who wants to help us, I believe sincerely, clean up the way \nlobbying works in this place by making things more transparent to the \nAmerican people, but these two amendments--one will disclose all \nearmarks and the other will take the crisis out of every year and allow \nus to pass responsible legislation.\n  Mr. President, I will have more to say later and I am sure other \nMembers will also before these amendments come to a vote. \nUnfortunately, I have been told that my colleagues don't even want \nthese bills to come to a vote. They want to try to table them so we \nwill limit the debate.\n  I will reserve the rest of my time and yield the floor right now, and \nwe will discuss more about these amendments after lunch.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I understand now might be a convenient \ntime for the Senate to consider some debate on the amendments I have \njust offered, Nos. 26 and 27.\n  I think the preeminent value, when we talk about ethics debate, that \nwe ought to be focusing on is transparency. It has been said time and \ntime again that the old saying is ``sunlight is perhaps the best \ndisinfectant of all.'' The fact is, the more Congress does on behalf of \nthe American people that is transparent and can be reported and can be \nconsidered by average Americans in how they determine and evaluate our \nperformance here, the better, as far as I am concerned.\n  I am proud to be a strong advocate for open government and greater \ntransparency. Senator Pat Leahy, now the chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, and I have been cosponsors of significant reform \nof our open government laws. We only had modest success last Congress. \nWe were able to get a bill voted out of the Judiciary Committee. But it \nis my hope, given the sort of bipartisan spirit in which we are \nstarting the 110th Congress and given Senator Leahy's strong commitment \nto open government, as well as my own, that we will be able to make \ngood progress there.\n  This amendment No. 27 is all about greater transparency that is \nhealthy for our democracy and essential if we are to govern with \naccountability and good faith. I offer this amendment with the goal of \nshining a little bit more light on the legislative process in this body \nand actually giving all Members of the Senate an ability to do their \njob better.\n  Specifically, this amendment would require that before the Senate \nproceeds\n\n[[Page S419]]\n\nto any matter, that each Senator receive a minimum of 3 days' notice \nand that, more importantly, the full text of what we will consider will \nbe made available to the public before we actually begin our work on \nit.\n  What happens now is that in the waning hours of any Congress, we have \na procedure--known well to the Members here but unknown to the public, \nperhaps--known as hotlining bills. In other words, presumably \nnoncontroversial matters can be so-called hotlined, and that is placed \non the Senate's calendar and voted out essentially by unanimous \nconsent.\n  The problem is this mechanism, which is designed to facilitate the \nSenate's work and move relatively noncontroversial matters, is \nincreasingly the subject of abuse. For example, in the 109th Congress, \nthere were 4,122 bills introduced in the Senate. In the House there \nwere 6,436 bills. Of course, many of these bills run hundreds of pages \nin length. The problem is, as I alluded to a moment ago, in the final \nweeks of the 109th Congress, I was told there were 125 matters called \nup before the Senate for consideration, many of which included costs to \nthe taxpayers of millions of dollars, including an astonishing 64 bills \nin the final day and into the wee hours of Saturday morning before we \nadjourned. In fact, as the chart I have here demonstrates, in the last \n5 days of the 109th Congress, there was a total of 125 bills hotlined. \nAs I mentioned, some of these are relatively noncontroversial matters, \nbut some of them spent millions of dollars of taxpayers' money.\n  I would think that at a very minimum Senators would want an \nopportunity to do due diligence when it comes to looking at the \ncontents of this legislation and determining whether, in fact, it is \nnoncontroversial and in the public interest or whether, on the \ncontrary, someone is literally trying to slip something through in the \nwaning hours of the Congress in a way that avoids the kind of public \nscrutiny that is important to passing good legislation and making good \npolicy.\n  Mr. President, I have in my hands a letter in support of this \namendment from an organization called ReadtheBill.org, which I ask \nunanimous consent be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I know this perhaps seems like a small \nthing, but small things can have dramatic consequences.\n  Let me give an example. Senator X introduces a bill called the Clean \nWater Access Act sometime this year. For whatever reason, this bill \ndoesn't get a hearing or the hearing is held perhaps with just a modest \nnumber of Members actually attending--in other words, it doesn't get a \nlot of attention. The bill is one of the thousands of bills introduced. \nAnd let's say my staff or your staff, Mr. President, or other Members' \nstaff don't really have this bill on the list of priorities, of things \nto do; it is not one of the most urgent priorities because it looks as \nthough perhaps there is not a lot of interest in the legislation. The \nbill never gets a vote in committee or on the floor, so Senator X \ndecides: I have an idea. I will hotline the bill at the end of the \nyear, at the very end of the Congress in the last few hours. What this \namendment would do would be to impose a very commonsense requirement--\nlet's give adequate notice that this is legislation which Senator X \nintends to move--so that the appropriate scrutiny and consideration may \nbe given to the bill.\n  Of course, a notice goes out under the current rule, and the \nSenator's staff alerts the Senator to some concern that unless that \nhappens, it passes by default. That is right, this is essentially an \nopt-out system. If the Senator does not object within an hour or two, \nthe bill goes out by unanimous agreement.\n  My proposal is that there be simply a modest notice period before the \nSenate proceeds to a measure for Senators and their staff to review the \nlegislation and so the American people and various groups that may have \nan interest in it could scrutinize it before we actually consider it \nand pass it in the waning hours, perhaps, of a Congress. I don't know \nwho could really have a legitimate objection to such a requirement. I \nlook forward to hearing from any of my colleagues who have some \nconcerns about it, and perhaps I can address those concerns and we can \nwork together to pass this important, although simple and \nstraightforward, amendment.\n  I believe this amendment is certainly common sense and a good \ngovernment and open government approach, which is conducive to allowing \nus to do our job better. So I ask my colleagues for their enthusiastic \nsupport, and maybe if not their enthusiastic support, at least their \nvote in support of this amendment at the appropriate time.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 26\n\n  Mr. President, I have also offered Senate amendment No. 26. This is \nanother amendment designed to offer greater sunshine and this time on \nthe earmark process. This is an amendment which I have offered in the \nspirit that Senator DeMint, the junior Senator from South Carolina, has \noffered but with a little bit of additional twist that I would like to \nexplain.\n  The current bill requires that all future legislation include a list \nof earmarks and the names of the Senators who requested them. Again, I \nknow we talk in terms of legislative-ese and, of course, an earmark is \nsomething not otherwise provided for within the Federal appropriations \nbills but is specifically requested by a Member of Congress--a Senator \nor a Congressman--to be included.\n  Frankly, there are some earmarks that are very positive and very much \nin the public interest, but there are others that have been the subject \nof abuse, and I don't need to go into that in any great detail.\n  It is a fact that the American people have grown very concerned about \nthe abuse of earmarks here, again, primarily because there is not \nadequate scrutiny, adequate sunshine on this process, causing them \ngrave concerns about the integrity of the entire appropriations \nprocess.\n  My amendment would add a requirement that the budgetary impact for \neach earmark be included, as well as a requirement that the total \nnumber of earmarks and their total budgetary impact be identified and \ndisclosed. The goal is that when we are considering legislation, we \nwill have a summary document that details the number of earmarks, the \ntotal cost of those earmarks, and a list of the earmarks, along with \ntheir principal sponsor. I believe this will allow us, again, to do our \njob more diligently and with greater ease.\n  We will also create a fixed baseline from which we can proceed in the \nfuture and will further allow the American public, as well as our own \nstaff, to be able to analyze the impact of these earmarks on the \nbudgeting process.\n  Consider that the Congressional Research Service studies earmarks \neach year and identifies earmarks in each appropriations bill. Through \nthat study, one can see both the total number of earmarks and the total \ndollar value of those earmarks have grown significantly over the last \ndecade. The total number of earmarks, for example, doubled from 1994 to \n2005, and the number appears to likely go up in 2006 as well. The \nproblem is that getting this data after voting on the legislation is \nnot particularly helpful after the fact. By requiring that all \nlegislation contain a list of each earmark, the cost of each earmark, \nand the total number and cost of earmarks in the legislation as a \nwhole, we empower our staffs and, more importantly, the American \npeople, and ourselves to make better decisions.\n  As I said, this is not a broadside attack against all earmarks. Some \nearmarks are good government, but not all earmarks are good government. \nWhat this would do is give us the information we need to evaluate them, \nto have some empirical baseline we can use to evaluate how this impacts \nFederal spending and the integrity of the appropriations process.\n  There is one other little element of this amendment I would like to \nhighlight. This amendment would also require an explanation of the \nessential governmental purpose for the earmark or a targeted tax \nbenefit or targeted tax tariff benefit, including how the earmark \ntargeted tax benefit or targeted tariff benefit advances the general \nwelfare of the United States of America. This requirement--again, \nsomething I think most people would assume would be part of the \nanalysis\n\n[[Page S420]]\n\nand deliberative process Congress would undertake anyway--is an \nimportant reform for the Congress, and it is certainly appropriate on \nthe subject of ethics reform.\n  Take, for example, these situations: In the fiscal year 2004 budget, \nthere was a $725,000 earmark for something called the Please Touch \nMuseum; $200,000 of Federal taxpayers' money was appropriated by an \nearmark for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Even those who like rock \nand roll may question the appropriateness of taxpayers' money being \nspent to subsidize the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Mr. President, \n$100,000 was spent for the International Storytelling Center.\n  In 2005, $250,000 was spent in an earmark for the Country Music Hall \nof Fame. I myself am partial to country music. I like country music, \nbut I think many might question whether it is appropriate that Federal \ntaxpayers' dollars be spent by an earmark, here again largely anonymous \nbecause it is not required to be disclosed who the Senator is under \ncurrent law, who has requested it, but a quarter of a million dollars \nof taxpayers' money has been spent for that purpose.\n  Another example: $150,000 for the Grammy Foundation and $150,000 for \nthe Coca-Cola Space Science Center.\n  These are just a couple of quick examples, but I think they help make \nthe point; that is, under the status quo, there is simply not enough \ninformation, not enough sunshine shining on the appropriations process \nand particularly the earmark process which has been the subject of so \nmuch controversy, and yes, including some scandal leading up to this \nlast election on November 7. If there is one certain message I think \nall of us got on November 7, it is that the American people want their \nGovernment to work for them and not for special interests.\n  One of the best things we can do, rather than passing new rules, is \nto shine more sunlight on the process. With more sunlight comes greater \naccountability, and I think in many ways it provides a self-correcting \nmechanism. In other words, people are not going to be doing things they \nthink they can sneak through in secret out in the open. So it has the \nadded benefit of sort of a self-policing or self-correcting mechanism \nas well.\n  So I would commend both of these amendments for the Senate's \nconsideration. At the appropriate time, I will ask for a vote, working, \nof course, with the floor managers on this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                              ReadtheBill.org,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 11, 2007.\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: ReadtheBill.org Education Fund \n     commends you for your leadership in proposing an amendment to \n     S. 1 that would prohibit floor consideration of legislation \n     and conference reports before senators and the public had \n     more time to read them. If implemented in Senate rules, this \n     Cornyn amendment would be a significant improvement over \n     current Senate rules, and over Senate practice during the \n     109th Congress.\n       ReadtheBill.org respects the openness of the sponsors of S. \n     1 to additional improvements on the floor. As proposed, S. 1 \n     would amend Senate rule XXVIII to prohibit consideration of \n     conference reports before they have been publicly available \n     online for 48 hours. S. 1 would improve on current Senate \n     rules. However, S. 1 would NOT cover legislative measures or \n     matters on their first consideration by the Senate (as \n     opposed to final conference reports). This is a major failing \n     of S. 1. It's crucial to find and fix questionable provisions \n     early in the legislative process. By the time a bill emerges \n     from conference committee in its final form, it can be too \n     late to fix even its worst provisions. Yes, the conference \n     report can be posted online. But a conference report can \n     gather the political momentum of a runaway train. Posting the \n     manifest for each train car may reveal a sinister or illicit \n     cargo. But it's too late to do more than wave an arm before \n     the train is long gone.\n       That is why it is so important to take time to read bills \n     early in the legislative process, before their first floor \n     consideration by the Senate. The Cornyn amendment would cover \n     ALL measures or matters (but no amendments), prohibiting \n     their consideration until they had been printed in the \n     Congressional Record for three calendar days and posted \n     publicly online for two calendar days. ReadtheBill.org \n     endorses the substance of the Cornyn amendment.\n       The Cornyn amendment would be a vital step toward \n     ReadtheBill.org's ultimate goal of amending the standing \n     rules of the Senate and House to require legislation and \n     conference reports to be posted online for 72 hours before \n     floor debate. As work on this bill continues, ReadtheBill.org \n     looks forward to working closely with you to craft the most \n     practical, enforceable amendment that moves toward this goal.\n       Non-partisan and focused only on process, ReadtheBill.org \n     is the leading national organization promoting open floor \n     deliberations in Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Rafael DeGennaro,\n                                              Founder & President.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to speak in general, so I ask \nunanimous consent that the current amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I wish to speak in general about the bill, \nnot on the specific amendments, about what I think we are doing and the \nimportance, frankly, of what we are doing. We are talking, of course, \nabout ethics, about how we function within this body, and I hope we can \nkeep that in mind. We are not talking about Federal law. We are not \ntalking about rules and laws dealing with contributions. We are talking \nabout how we operate within this body.\n  I happen to be a member of the Ethics Committee, and I have been very \nimpressed, frankly, with what we are doing now. That is not to say we \ncan't do some more, and indeed we should, but the fact is we have \nreally gone along fairly well here. We haven't had any real problems \nparticularly. We are reacting largely to some of the problems that have \nhappened on the other side of the Capitol, and they could happen here, \nso they are appropriate. So I believe we need to evaluate where we are \nnow with the rules and regulations we have with the Ethics Committee, \nwhich is designed to enforce them, and try to maintain our focus on \nthose kinds of things.\n  I think we have gotten into things that become Federal law in terms \nof, for instance, political contributions. Well, that is really not an \nethics issue; that is a Federal issue with relation to what is done \nthere. So it seems to me the real overriding opportunity for us is to \nincrease the transparency of how we function and the accountability and \nto spend more time with the Members and with the staff in terms of \nfamiliarizing ourselves with what the rules are. We have lots of rules. \nQuite frankly, as I came onto this committee, I was a little impressed \nwith all there is that most of us haven't had much time or opportunity \nto take a look at.\n  So really what we need is transparency and accountability, and that \nis what we are doing. I am pleased that we are, but I want to suggest \nthat we keep in mind the role of what we are doing, the role of ethics, \nand try to maintain some limits on the kinds of things we do and hold \nit to what we are doing. As I said, our record has been pretty good. I \nthink the key is transparency and accountability, so I hope we can hold \nit to that.\n  I think we need to understand that even though there have been things \nthat have happened in the Capitol that we don't like, the fact is the \npeople who have done most of those things, many of them, are in jail. \nThey have acted against the law. The Jack Abramoff thing, which has \nbrought much of this about, was wrong and bad and has been dealt with \nand is being dealt with. I think we need to keep that in mind and try \nto define the difference between ethics and behavior here and legal \nactivities that affect everyone.\n  So again, I say ethics is something for which each of us is \nresponsible. As representatives of our people, we are responsible for \nit. So if we have transparency, that is one of the keys. And we should \nunderstand that what we are doing is dealing with ethics rules. When \nthis is all over, we ought to be able to take another look at the total \nof our rules and hold what we are doing here on the floor to that \neffort. We can do that.\n  There are a good many reforms in S. 1, and I am pleased we are \ntalking about earmarks, which is one topic of reform. There needs to be \nmore public information. There needs to be more information to Members \nas to what earmarks are. On the other hand, if I want to represent \nthings that are important to my State or your State or anyone else's \nState, we need from time to time to have an opportunity to suggest that \nhere is an issue in this budget\n\n[[Page S421]]\n\nwhich needs to be dealt with. Now, it needs to be done early on. It \nneeds to be transparent. Everyone needs to know about it. We need to \navoid the idea of putting things in during the conference committee \nmeetings. After all, Members' opportunities have passed. That is wrong. \nBut I think the idea that Members have an opportunity to have some \ninput into the distribution of funding for their States is reasonable. \nSo I think, again, transparency is the real notion, and the conference \nreports ought to be available on the Internet.\n  Banning gifts, of course, is good. I think we need to be a little \ncareful about what gifts are and whom they are from.\n  I just had an opportunity to meet with someone who is a realtor in \nWyoming. He came in to talk about problems for realtors. He is not a \nlobbyist; he is a realtor. Now, am I supposed to be a little careful to \ntalk to somebody from Wyoming? How else am I going to know what the \nissues are for the various groups? Even though they have an association \nand he is probably a member of it, he is not a lobbyist. So I think we \nneed to be sure we identify some of the differences that are involved.\n  We ought to talk about holds. I think there is nothing wrong with \nhaving a distribution of what the holds are when we are putting them \ntogether in Congress and then putting them in the Congressional Record. \nAgain, that is something which should be public.\n\n  Travel. I think there is nothing wrong, with major travel, with \nhaving some sort of preapproval from the Ethics Committee. That is a \nreasonable thing to do. We each have different problems with travel. \nSome States are quite different from others. Charters can be made to \ndifferent places, so we need to have some flexibility there. Again, I \nsay one of the keys is to have some annual ethics training, some annual \nethics information so people know what it is all about. I would venture \nto say that before this discussion started, if you talked about what is \nin our ethics rules, most of us wouldn't be able to tell you much about \nthem. We need to do more of that.\n  There needs to be public disclosure of lobbying, there is no \nquestion, and that is a good thing and we need to do that.\n  The idea of an independent ethics office troubles me a good deal. We \nare talking about our behavior among ourselves as Members, and the idea \nof having some non-Member office overseeing our operation just doesn't \nseem to make sense to me. If any of you have not had the opportunity to \nsee all of the things that our Ethics Committee staff goes through, I \nwish you would take a look at it. There is a great deal that goes on.\n  So in sum, I am generally saying that I hope--and I think our leaders \non this issue have done this--we stay with what it is we are seeking to \ndo; that is, take a look at our rules and regulations and how we abide \nby them, how we understand them, how we enforce them, and how we have \nopportunities to see them, and that there is transparency from them. \nThat is what we are talking about. When we start getting off into so \nmany things that really are much beyond ethics and get into the laws--\nfor instance, as I said, campaign contributions--that is another issue. \nIt is a good issue, but it is not this issue. So I hope we are able to \ndo that.\n  Those are the points I wanted to make. We are going to be going \nforward, and I am glad we are. I hope we don't spend too much time on \nthis because I think our real challenge is to focus on what it is we \nare really seeking to do and not let us spend a lot of time on things \nthat are inappropriately in this bill. Our main goal, it seems to me, \nis greater transparency, a set of rules we can understand, the \nopportunity to know what those are, and then, of course, to have an \nopportunity within our own jurisdiction to enforce them.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from West Virginia is \nrecognized for up to 25 minutes.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, last night in his address to the Nation, the \nPresident called for a ``surge'' of 20,000 additional U.S. troops to \nhelp secure Baghdad against the violence that has consumed it. \nUnfortunately, such a plan is not the outline of a brave new course, as \nwe were told, but a tragic commitment to an already failed policy; not \na bold new strategy but a rededication to a course that has proven to \nbe a colossal blunder on every count.\n  The President never spoke words more true than when he said, ``The \nsituation in Iraq is unacceptable to the American people.'' But the \nPresident, once again, failed to offer a realistic way forward. \nInstead, he gave us more of his stale and tired ``stay the course'' \nprescriptions. The President espoused a strategy of ``clear, hold, and \nbuild''--a doctrine of counterinsurgency that one of our top \ncommanders, GEN David Petraeus, helped to formulate. Clear, hold, and \nbuild involves bringing to bear a large number of troops in an area, \nclearing it of insurgents, holding it secure for long enough to let \nreconstruction take place. But what the President did not say last \nnight is that, according to General Petraeus and his own military \nexperts, this strategy of ``clear, hold, and build'' requires a huge \nnumber of troops--a minimum of 20 combat troops for every 1,000 \ncivilians in the area. If we apply that doctrine to Baghdad's 6 million \npeople, it means that at least 120,000 troops will be needed to secure \nBaghdad alone. Right now, we have about 70,000 combat troops stationed \nall throughout Iraq. Even if they were all concentrated in the city of \nBaghdad, along with the 20,000 new troops that the President is calling \nfor, we would still fall well short of what is needed.\n  But let us assume that the brave men and women of the U.S. military \nare able to carry out this Herculean task and secure Baghdad against \nthe forces that are spiraling it into violence. What is to keep those \nforces from regrouping in another town, another province, even another \ncountry--strengthening, festering, and waiting until the American \nsoldiers leave to launch their bloody attacks again? It brings to mind \nthe ancient figure of Sisyphus, who was doomed to push a boulder up a \nmountainside for all of eternity, only to have it roll back down as \nsoon as he reached the top. As soon as he would accomplish his task, it \nwould begin again, and this would go on endlessly. I fear that we are \ncondemning our brave soldiers to a similar fate, hunting down \ninsurgents in one city or one province only to watch them pop up in \nanother. For how long will U.S. troops be asked to shoulder this \nburden?\n  Over 3,000 American soldiers have already been killed in Iraq; over \n22,000 have been wounded. Staggering. Hear me--staggering. And \nPresident Bush now proposes to send 20,000 more Americans into the line \nof fire beyond the 70,000 already there.\n  The cost of this war of choice to American taxpayers is now estimated \nto be over $400 billion. That means $400 for every minute since Jesus \nChrist was born. That is a lot of money.\n  Hear me now. Let me say that, again. The cost to American taxpayers \nof this war of choice is now estimated to be over $400 billion, and the \nnumber continues to rise. When I say number, I am talking about your \ntaxpayer dollars. That ain't chicken feed. One wonders how much \nprogress we could have made in improving education or resolving our \nhealth care crisis or strengthening our borders or reducing our \nnational debt or any number of pressing issues with that amount of \nmoney. Man, we are talking about big dollars. And the President \nproposes spending more money, sending more money down that drain.\n  On every count, an escalation of 20,000 troops is a misguided, \ncostly, unwise course of action. I said at the beginning we ought not \ngo into Iraq. I said that, and I was very loud and clear in saying it. \nI stood with 22 other Senators. I said from the beginning we ought not \nto go into Iraq. We had no business there. That nation did not attack \nus, did it? I said from the beginning I am not going down that road and \nI didn't and I am not going to now.\n\n[[Page S422]]\n\nThis is not a solution. This is not a march toward ``victory.''\n  The President's own military advisers have indicated we do not have \nenough troops for this tragedy to be successful. It will put more \nAmericans in harm's way than there already are. It will cost more in \nU.S. taxpayers' money--your money. You, who are looking through those \nlenses, looking at the Senate Chamber, hear what I have to say. Many \ncommanders have already said that ours is an Army that is at its \nbreaking point. It is a dangerous idea.\n  Why, then, is the President advocating it? This decision has the \ncynical smell of politics to me, suggesting that an additional 20,000 \ntroops will alter the balance of this war. It was a mistake to go into \nIraq. Now we want to pour 20,000 more of your men and women, your sons \nand daughters, into this maelstrom, this sausage grinder, this drainer \nof blood and life.\n  We won't alter the balance of this war. It is a way for the President \nto look forceful, a way for the President to appear to be taking bold \naction. But it is only the appearance of bold action, not the reality, \nmuch like the image of a cocky President in a flight suit declaring \n``mission accomplished'' from the deck of a battleship. Remember that?\n  This is not a new course. It is a continuation of the tragically \ncostly course we have been on for almost 5 years now. Too long. I said \nin the beginning, I won't go; it is wrong; we should not attack that \ncountry which has never invaded us or attacked us. Those persons who \nattacked this country were not Iraqis, right? Somebody says I am right.\n  It is simply a policy that buys the President more time, more time to \nequivocate, more time to continue to resist any suggestion that the \nPresident was wrong to enter our country into this war in the first \nplace. This war, in this place, at this time, in this manner, and, \nimportantly, calling for more troops, gives the President more time to \nhand the Iraq situation off to his successor in the White House. The \nPresident apparently believes he can wait this out, that he can \ncontinue to make small adjustments here and there to a misguided policy \nwhile he maintains the same trajectory until he leaves office and it \nbecomes someone else's problem.\n  If you are driving in the wrong direction, anyone knows, as you will \nnot get to your destination by going south when you should be going \nnorth, what do you do? What should you do? You turn around. I see the \nPresiding Officer is following me. I saw him use his arm like that. He \ndid just what I did, before I did it. You turn around and get better \ndirections.\n  This President--I speak respectfully when I speak of the President. I \nspeak respectfully of the President; that is my intention--this \nPresident is asking us to step on the gas in Iraq full throttle while \nhe has not clearly articulated where we are going. What is our goal? \nWhat is our end game? How much progress will we need to see from the \nIraqi Government before our men and women come home? I should think \nthat is what the fathers and mothers of our American troops would want \nto know. What is our goal? What is our end game? In the first place, \nwhy are we there in Iraq? Why are we asking for more troops now? How \nmuch progress will we need to see from the Iraqi Government before our \nmen and women come home? How long will American troops be stationed in \nIraq, to be maimed and killed in sectarian bloodshed?\n  The ultimate solution to the situation in Iraq is political and would \nhave to come from the Iraqis themselves. The Iraqi Government will have \nto address the causes of the insurgency by creating a sustainable \npower-sharing agreement between and among Sunnis, Shias, and Kurds, and \nit is far from clear that the Government has the power or the \nwillingness at this point. But as long as American troops are there to \nbear the brunt of the blame and the fire, the Iraqi Government will not \nshoulder the responsibility itself. And Iraq's neighbors, especially \nIran and Syria, won't commit to helping to stabilize the country as \nlong as they see American troops bogged down and America losing \ncredibility and strength. Keeping the United States Army tied up in a \nbloody, endless battle in Iraq plays perfectly into Iran's hands and it \nhas little incentive to cease its assistance to the insurgency as long \nas America is there. America's presence in Iraq is inhibiting a lasting \nsolution, not contributing to one.\n  Let me say that again. I should repeat that statement. Iraq's \nneighbors, especially Iran and Syria, won't commit to helping to \nstabilize the country as long as they see America bogged down and \nlosing credibility and strength. Keeping the United States Army tied up \nin a bloody, endless battle in Iraq plays perfectly into Iran's hand \nand it has little incentive to cease its assistance to the insurgency \nas long as America is there. America's presence in Iraq is inhibiting a \nlasting solution, not contributing to a lasting solution.\n  The President has, once again, I say respectfully, gotten it \nbackwards. What I hoped to hear from the President were specific \nbenchmarks of progress that he expects from the Iraqi Government and a \nplan for the withdrawal of American troops conditioned on those \nbenchmarks. Instead, we were given a vague admonition that the \nresponsibility for security will rest with the Iraqi Government by \nNovember, with no suggestion of what that responsibility will mean or \nhow to measure that Government's capacity to handle it.\n  The President is asking us--you, me, you, you out there, you who look \naround this Chamber today--asking us once again to trust him while he \nkeeps our troops mired in Iraq. But that trust was long ago squandered. \nI weep for the waste we have already seen--lives, American lives, Iraqi \nlives, treasure, time, good will, credibility, opportunity--wasted, \nwasted. Now the President is calling for us to waste more. I say \nenough, enough. If he will not provide leadership and statesmanship, if \nhe does not have the strength of vision to recognize a failed policy \nand to chart a new course, then leadership will have to come from \nsomewhere else. Enough waste, enough lives lost on this misguided \nventure into Iraq.\n  I said it was wrongheaded in the beginning and I was right. Enough \ntime and energy spent on a civil war far from our shores while the \nproblems Americans face are ignored. Yes, while the problems that you, \nthe people out there, face--you, the people on the plains and mountains \nand in the hollows and hills, your problems--we wallow in debt and \nmortgage our children's future to foreigners. That is what we are \ndoing. We are continuing. We are asking now for more, more, more. Not: \nGive me more, more, more of your kisses but more, more of your money, \nmore, more of your lives. Enough. It is time to truly change course. \nMr. President, it is time to look at the compass, time to change course \nand start talking about how we can rebalance our foreign policy and \nbring our sons and daughters home--bring our sons and daughters home.\n\n  There are a lot of people making political calculations about the war \nin Iraq, turning this debate into an exercise of political \ngrandstanding and point scoring. But this is not a political game. This \nis a game of life and death. This is asking thousands more Americans to \nmake the ultimate sacrifice for a war that we now know, beyond a shadow \nof a doubt, was a mistake. We had no business going into Iraq. We had \nno business invading a country that never posed an imminent threat, a \nserious threat to our own country.\n  There were those of us who cautioned against the hasty rush to war in \nIraq. And I have some credibility on that score. I cautioned against \nit, yes. And there were others in this Senate Chamber who stood against \nthe hasty rush to war in Iraq. Unfortunately, our cries, like \nCassandra's, went unheeded. Like Cassandra, our warnings and our fears \nproved to be prophetic--proved to be prophetic.\n  But we are not doomed to repeat our mistakes. We ought to learn from \nthe past. We must understand--and understand it now, and understand it \nclearly--that more money and more troops--more American troops, more \nAmerican lives lost in Iraq--are not the answer.\n  The clock--there is the clock above the Presiding Officer's chair. \nThere it is. There is the clock. There is another one behind me on this \nwall. These clocks are running, running, running\n\n[[Page S423]]\n\non our misadventure. And I can say that with credibility because I said \nit was a misadventure in the beginning--our misadventure into Iraq.\n  Enough time has been wasted, Mr. President. Enough. Enough. Hear me: \nEnough. Enough time has been wasted.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Obama). My understanding is, under the \nprevious order, the Senator from Arizona is recognized for up to 15 \nminutes.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I suppose it was inevitable, the criticism of \nthe President's announcement last night. But I ask: What happened to \nall of the promises of last week, the talk of bipartisanship, the talk \nof trying to work together, especially on the biggest challenge of our \ntime, this challenge to our national security? Where is the unity that \nwe need at this time for this issue more than at any other? I am \ndisappointed by the attacks on President Bush's strategy, particularly \nbecause they come primarily from people who have offered no \nalternative. It seems to me that threatening to cut off funding for our \ntroops, as some have done, while not giving the President's Iraq \nstrategy a chance, is the worst kind of partisan politics.\n  When dealing with issues of war and peace, and trying to devise a \nstrategy that will result in the least harm to Americans, with the \ngreatest chance of success, it seems to me we should be trying to find \ncommon ground.\n  The critics of the President throughout last year called for a new \nstrategy and interpreted the election results of 2006 as substantially \na repudiation of the President's strategy and confirmation that there \nneeded to be a new strategy.\n  After consulting with Members of Congress, with generals, with \nretired generals, with other experts, the Baker-Hamilton Commission, \nand many others, the President has come up with another strategy, and \nhe announced that strategy last night. It seems to me that we at least \nowe him the opportunity to see whether that strategy can work before \nimmediately attacking it as a policy that is bound to fail, especially, \nas I said, because I have seen no alternative.\n  The only alternative is that we withdraw. There are a lot of \ndifferent ways that we would withdraw, and timetables for withdrawal, \nbut they all come down to withdrawing. That suggests that leaving the \nIraqi forces to establish the stability and peace that is required in \nIraq is likely to be more successful than the Iraqi troops combined \nwith U.S. troops--a proposition which, it seems to me, is incredible on \nits face. So where is the alternative strategy for success?\n  Now, one of our colleagues, earlier this morning, said:\n\n       We are in a hole in Iraq, and the President says the way to \n     dig out of this hole is to dig deeper. Does that make sense, \n     when you are in a hole, you get out by digging deeper? This \n     is a reckless plan. It is about saving the Bush Presidency. \n     It is not about saving Iraq.\n\n  Well, let me talk about the two elements of that--first, the analogy, \nwhich I think breaks down. I have used it before. It is a good analogy \nin certain situations. But it is a little bit like saying that when the \nfirst wave of our boys hit the Normandy beaches, because many of them \nwere dying, that it made no sense to add more forces, to land the rest \nof our troops on the beach. And that, of course, was not the case.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will be happy to yield to the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Those of us who disagreed with the plan to go into Iraq in \nthe beginning--and now who disagree with the request that we put more \ntroops into Iraq--we are not talking about the Normandy beach. That was \nan entirely different matter.\n\n  What are we fighting for over here in Iraq? Why are the American \npeople sending their boys and girls into Iraq, a country that has not \nattacked us? Why are we sending our boys and girls to have their blood \nspilled in that faraway country? For what? For what are we spending \nthese billions of dollars?\n  I cannot understand it. I say that most respectfully to the \ndistinguished Senator, who is my friend.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would say to the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia, the Senator asked that question in his remarks a few \nminutes ago, and I had written down that is a fair question. I am \nprepared to answer that question, and I would like to answer that \nquestion. If the Senator would allow me just to finish the point I was \nmaking earlier, I will answer that question.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. Very well. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KYL. I might say, by the way, that is the central question, and \nit has not been adequately answered to date. I will concede that to my \nfriend from West Virginia. But there is an answer, I believe, that \njustifies, that warrants our participation, and I will make that point.\n  The point I wanted to make before is that simply because you are \nhaving a problem achieving something does not mean it is wrong to try \nto figure out a new strategy to win. And sometimes applying more force \ncan supply that element, that missing element.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes, of course, I will be happy to.\n  Mr. BYRD. What is it we are seeking to achieve by putting more troops \ninto Iraq?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, first of all, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe time used by the Senator from West Virginia not count against the \ntime I was given.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Secondly, since the Senator has remained on the Senate floor \nand asked that question a second time, I will go ahead and move to \nanswer that question, and then come back to the other points I was \ngoing to make a moment ago.\n  Basically, the Senator asked two questions: Why are we there in the \nfirst place; and, secondly, how is this strategy supposed to enable us \nto achieve the victory we seek to achieve?\n  Let me answer that second question first, briefly, because the \nPresident talked about this last night. The concept that the President \noutlined was one that he had developed, or our forces in Iraq had \ndeveloped with the Maliki government. And it was predicated on a \ncommitment that the President received from the Iraqi Government that \nit would be willing to do some things differently in the future.\n  Specifically, what? We appreciate until peace and stability come to \nIraq, it is not going to be possible for that Iraqi Government to \nengage in the political and economic reforms that will be necessary for \nthat society to move forward.\n  How does one achieve peace and stability? For most of the country \nthere is relative peace. But everyone agrees in Baghdad itself there is \ngreat conflict and killing. So the President talked last night about a \ndivision of the city into nine specific regions, bringing in more \ntroops from the Iraqi Government, twice as many more as the United \nStates would bring in, in order not just to clear those areas of the \nkillers, as the President called them, but to hold the areas, to \nprevent them from coming back in and then causing harm to the innocent \nIraqi civilians.\n  The Maliki government had talked about doing this in the past. But \nwhen we did the clearing, the killers were allowed to come back and \ncontinue their bad action right after we left. We established \ncheckpoints and curfews, and the Iraqi Government said they would like \nfor us to eliminate those checkpoints and curfews. We would arrest \nthese killers and put them in jail, but the Iraqi Government would let \nthem back out. In other words, it was doing things that were \nantithetical to our ability to consolidate the original victory we \nobtained by clearing those areas of the killers.\n  The President obtained a commitment from Maliki that this would \nchange, so the strategy now would be with Iraqi troops taking the lead \nand American troops assisting, to clear the areas and hold them, and \nhold the killers responsible, keep them from killing again, and go \nafter the militias, especially in Baghdad, that were doing most of this \nkilling.\n  Now, that would require some additional troops in Baghdad, and the \nPresident talked about the number of troops that would be provided for \nthat. He said the other area where troops\n\n[[Page S424]]\n\nwould be provided would be in Al Anbar Province, to the west, where the \nal-Qaida terrorists had basically developed a tremendous amount of \nstrength and taken over parts of that area, and some additional troops \nwould be needed there.\n  There were other elements of the President's speech. There were well \nover 20, as I counted them, of different parts of this strategy. But \nthe key elements were the ones I just mentioned. So that is the role \nthese additional troops are supposed to play.\n  Now, to the more fundamental question that the Senator asked, if one \nonly looks at Iraq in a vacuum, I can easily understand why one would \ncome to the conclusion that with the death and destruction there, and \nthe harm to our own troops, it does not make sense for us to be there.\n  But Iraq is not in a vacuum. Iraq is part of a larger war. And this \nis one thing that both Osama bin Laden and George Bush agree on, \nprobably the only thing: Both of them have called the battle in Iraq \ncritical to achieving victory in the ultimate--the President calls it \nthe war against terrorists; bin Laden calls it the holy jihad. But, in \neither case, they understand that the loser in this battle in Iraq is \nnot likely to be able to prevail in the larger global war.\n  In bin Laden's case, he is talking about the war to establish the \ncalifate, and he says that Baghdad will be the capital of the califate. \nThis is the area that will be ruled by Sharia, the strict law of his \ninterpretation of Islam. The U.S. concept of victory is a peaceful, \nstable Iraq that can maintain its society and borders and be an ally \nwith us in the war against the terrorists.\n  Our security there is identified in two ways. First, because of the \nal-Qaida and other terrorists who, as I said, have done a tremendous \namount of damage in Al Anbar Province and who initiated a lot of the \nconflict between the Shiites and the Sunnis, among other things, by \nbombing one of the most holy of the Shiite mosques; they have initiated \na lot of this terrorism. We have to be able to defeat al-Qaida and the \nother terrorists in Iraq.\n  Secondly, we cannot lose the momentum we have gained in this war \nagainst these terrorists in places such as Jordan and Egypt and Saudi \nArabia and Pakistan and Afghanistan and Yemen and other places. From a \nsituation where they were actually helping terrorists, we have gotten \nto a point where they are actually helping us to find and root out and \ncapture or kill the terrorists. Were we to leave Iraq a failed state, \nit would not only be a devastating--I will use the word--Holocaust for \nthe people of Iraq, especially anyone who tried to help us or \nparticipated with the Iraqi Government, but it would be a horrible blow \nto our national security because it would reverse the momentum we have \ngained in the war against the terrorists and cause these other states \nto begin to hedge their bets in working with us because it is a \ndangerous neighborhood. It would be evident that we have no stomach to \nstay there and that the terrorists, therefore, can move back in, can \nuse those as a base of operation and continue, then, to work against \nthe states of Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the like. In \nfact, Saudi Arabia has already talked about trying to provide funding \nfor Sunnis in Iraq. Iran is providing assistance to Shiites in Iraq. \nThese are the reasons why it is more than a battle for Iraq but, \nrather, to continue the momentum we have gained in dealing with these \nradicals all throughout that region.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will my friend yield?\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to yield, again, to my friend.\n  Mr. BYRD. He used these words: ``We have no stomach to stay there.'' \nThe question is, How long and at what cost? Stay there how long? How \nlong are the American taxpayers and mothers and fathers going to put up \nwith the use of their sons and daughters and their money? How long are \nthey going to continue to want to--I shouldn't say it that way--how \nlong are they going to continue to put up with this expenditure of \nblood and money and for what? I thank my friend for yielding. I hope I \ndon't appear to be discourteous in any way.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia has, again, \nasked the most fundamental of all questions. I am going to have to take \nsome time to go into more detail about my answer to the question. But I \nthink I have tried to answer one of the two questions: What is the U.S. \nsecurity interest in achieving victory in Iraq?\n  We know that the world in that region would be thrown into absolute \nchaos, with probably hundreds of thousands of casualties, if not more, \nif we leave Iraq a failed state. Even more directly to America's \ninterests and to answer the question of how long will Americans support \nthis effort is the danger that our momentum in the war on terror will \nbe set back and will be dealt a tremendous blow if we leave Iraq a \nfailed state and the terrorists are able to then move out from there \nand again become dominant in places such as Afghanistan and Pakistan, \nthe Wahabis, and Saudi Arabia and so on. That would be a terrible blow \nto the progress we have made against these terrorists.\n  Osama bin Laden has a saying about the weak horse and the strong \nhorse. It has always been his view that we are a weak horse because we \nget out when the going gets tough--in Lebanon, in Vietnam, and in \nMogadishu. He believes that just as he thinks he threw the Soviets out \nof Afghanistan, he can throw the United States out of all of this part \nof the world because we are the weak horse. If we confirm to the people \nin that region that he is right, because we will not stay in Iraq \nbecause of the difficulties we have confronted, then we will only \nvalidate the view that he has propounded and make it much more \ndifficult for us to confront terrorists.\n  To the question of how long Americans will continue to support this, \nI suspect that the answer is only so long as they believe there is a \nprospect for success and only so long as the hidden costs of failure \nremain hidden. We have not done as good a job as we need to, to say: \nAll right, maybe this new strategy of President Bush won't work. He \nbelieves it will. There are new commitments from the Iraqi Government \nthat suggest it will. We are going to be doing things differently. We \nbelieve this has a chance to succeed. We know one thing for sure; that \nis, the alternative, withdrawal, is a guarantee for failure. And what \nwill that failure bring? Who wants the blood on his or her hands of the \nhundreds of thousands of people who are likely to be killed as a result \nof our leaving Iraq a failed state? Who wants to then ask the question \nof why it is that terrorists began to spread their evil ideology \nthroughout that part of the world to be more effective in potentially \nattacking the United States, when, in fact, we have had them on the \nrun? The evidence of what we did in Somalia is a good illustration. The \nfact that the London bombing about 6 months ago was thwarted is another \ngood illustration of the fact that when we have good intelligence and \nwhen we have the ability to take the fight to the enemy, we make \nourselves more secure.\n  I appreciate the questions of the Senator from West Virginia. They go \nto the heart of this debate. I would hope that we will have the \nopportunity soon to expand on these questions and the answers to them \nand engage in the kind of debate that we haven't had up to now and this \ncountry needs in order to be able to make the decision of what kind of \nsupport it wants to give to the President or whether it wants to accept \nother points of view.\n  I didn't deliver quite the remarks I intended, but I appreciate the \ncomments of the Senator from West Virginia. I would be happy to engage \nin that discussion in the future.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator for his comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent to ask the Senator from Arizona a \nquestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. The question I have is, The distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia asked the question: How long and at what price? But that \nis a false choice. Because if we leave Iraq and we walk away, we are \ngoing to be fighting this battle again. So it is not about how long and \nat what price; it is, when are we going to have this battle again? I \nbelieve that is up for debate. What the American people lack is the \nunderstanding that if we walk out now, we are going to put young men \nand women\n\n[[Page S425]]\n\nagain at risk, at far greater numbers and at far greater cost in the \nfuture, as we empower the terrorists. I wonder if the Senator from \nArizona may comment.\n\n  Mr. KYL. In response to the Senator from Oklahoma, that is the point \nI raised at the very end. It is not only a question of whether the \nPresident's new strategy has a chance to succeed, as he believes it \ndoes, but what is the alternative. If the alternative is leaving Iraq a \nfailed state, I have barely scratched the surface of identifying the \nhorrors that that would represent and the dangers to American national \nsecurity that it would involve. We need to do a better job of \narticulating that alternative. As I see it, that is the only \nalternative that has been put forward to the President's new strategy.\n\n\n                       Amendments Nos. 11 and 13\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, am I correct in my understanding that I \ncontrol the time between now and 2 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, that is correct.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the Chair.\n  I am here to discuss two amendments that will be voted on at 2 \no'clock. I see my colleague, Senator Coburn, is here to speak on one of \nthem. I will make a few comments and then yield some time to him.\n  This whole debate about lobbying and ethics reform is very important \nto this Congress. We know from the last election that the American \npeople are concerned about how we spend our money, about corruption. \nThe closer we looked at it as Congressmen and Senators, the clearer it \nbecame that the practice we have of earmarking, which is providing some \nfavor with tax dollars to some group or entity around the country, has \nbegun to corrupt the process. The scandals we saw on the House side \nwere mostly related specifically to a lobbyist basically buying an \nearmark, a favor we consider scandalous in the Senate.\n  The new Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, in a thoughtful proposal, \nH.R. 6, provided a clear definition of what these earmarks or favors \nare, so that when we begin to develop reform of the earmarking process, \nwe can target those things that are the problem.\n  That is what my amendment is about. The bill that is on the floor of \nthe Senate now defines earmarks in a way that only includes about 5 \npercent of the total earmarks. It would not have included the type of \nearmarks that got Congressman Duke Cunningham in trouble. It would not \nhave included the Abramoff type of scandal either. We often disagree, \nbut as we start this new session, there is a new climate of \nbipartisanship, the need to cooperate, Republicans and Democrats. But \nit is also important, between the House and the Senate, that when we \nthink the House gets it right, whether it is Republican or Democrat, we \nshould take an honest look at it. In this case, Speaker Pelosi has it \nright on the earmarks.\n  I would like to speak more about it. Before I do, I will yield \nwhatever time Senator Coburn would like.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I don't think you can have a discussion on \nearmarks until you set the predicate for what is really going on. It is \nnot dishonorable to want to help your home State. The vast majority of \nthose things that are considered earmarks are not bad projects. They \nare not dark. They have a common good that most people would say would \nbe adequate.\n  The question about earmarks is, What has evolved through the years \nand what have they become? I believe earmarks have been the gateway \ndrug to the lack of control of the Federal budget. The proof of that \nis, look at who votes against appropriations bills. I will promise you, \nthere won't be Senators in this body who have an earmark in a bill that \nwill vote against the appropriations bill. What does that say? Does \nthat mean everything in that bill was good; they agree with the bill?\n  What it means is, they have an earmark in the bill. And if they vote \nagainst it, the next time they want an earmark, they won't get it. So \nyou have the coercion of using earmarks to control votes.\n  Our oath is to do what is in the best long-term interest of our \ncountry. No matter what our political philosophy, we are all Americans.\n  We can all agree about that. And whether we are liberal or \nconservative, we don't want any money wasted. But as we spend money on \nthings that are earmarks that are not bad but definitely should not be \na priority when we are fighting a war and have a gulf catastrophe and a \nbudget deficit of $300 billion we are passing on to our children, we \nget the priorities all out of whack. Priorities are what the American \npeople said they wanted us back on, and they wanted us back on it \ntogether.\n  The bill that is on the floor, as the Senator from South Carolina \nsaid, addresses only 5 percent of that problem--5 percent of the \nearmarks. The Congressional Research Service looked at that--12,318, of \nwhich 534 would fall under the bill that is on the floor--correction, \n12,852 is the total and there are 12,318 that this bill would not apply \nto at all. It would have no application to it at all.\n  The other problem with earmarks is there has to be sunshine. Fixing \nthe problem to make everybody think we fixed it versus really fixing it \nis what this bill does. It is a charade, as far as earmarks are \nconcerned. There is nothing wrong with wanting an earmark or for me \nwanting to bring something to Oklahoma. I have chosen not to do that \nbecause I cannot see how Oklahoma can be helped with an earmark when we \nare borrowing $300 billion from our kids and grandkids. I cannot see \nhow that priority can be greater when it undermines the future standard \nof living of our children and grandchildren. But to put this bill up \nwithout the House version--and even it doesn't go far enough because it \ndoesn't list who the sponsor is until after it is passed. In other \nwords, you don't know who the sponsor is until after the bills come \nthrough.\n  We need to be honest with the American people. The only way we are \never going to get our house in order fiscally is to have complete \ntransparency on what we are doing, so they can see it. Today the \nPresident of the Senate and I passed a bill that will, after the fact, \ncreate transparency so that everybody will know where all the money \nwent. But it does nothing before the fact. We need the discipline to \ncontrol the spending and to not use this tool of earmarks as a coercive \ntool with which we get votes on appropriations bills that are spending \nmore money than we have.\n  This last year, a subcommittee I chaired in the last Congress had 46 \noversight hearings where we identified over $200 billion in \ndiscretionary waste, fraud, or duplication. We ought to be taking up \nthose things. We ought to be eliminating that. We can do tremendous \nwork.\n  The other thing that is important in the earmark discussion is that \nyou don't have an earmark if it is authorized. When it is authorized, \nthat means a committee of the Senate--a group of our peers--looked at \nit and said this is a priority and something that should be done; \ntherefore, it is no longer an appropriations earmark because it has \nbeen approved by the committee of jurisdiction.\n  The best way to eliminate earmarks is to bring them into the \nsunlight, get them authorized, and allow Appropriations to fund them. \nThat way, we have 100-percent sunshine and the American people know \nwhat we are doing, and we defend that in the public, open arena of \ncommittee hearings. We should not be afraid to do what is right, what \nis open, what is honest, and what is transparent for the American \npublic. They deserve no less than that.\n  The earmark provision that is in the bill in the Senate that we are \ndebating right now is cleaning the outside of the cup while the inside \nstays dirty. We should not let that happen. There is no doubt in my \nmind that Senator DeMint's amendment is going to lose.\n  So the question has to come to the American public, are you going to \nhold the Senate accountable for acting as though they are fixing \nsomething when they are not? Anybody who votes for this bill, with the \nlanguage in it the way it is today, is winking and nodding to the \nAmerican people and saying we fixed it. But we didn't. Everybody here \nknows it won't be fixed with the language as it sits today. So it is \ngoing to\n\n[[Page S426]]\n\nrequire the American people to have great oversight over us to see who \nvotes for this bill. If you are voting for this bill, you don't want to \nchange the way business is done here; you want to leave it exactly the \nway it is and leave everything alone. So you want to tell everybody you \nfixed it when you didn't. That smacks of a lack of integrity in this \nbody that belies its history.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his persistence \nand hard work on a very commonsense issue. Many times in this Chamber, \nand in the House, we assume on our side that if the Democrats have an \namendment, there is always some trick in it and they are trying to get \nus to take a vote and make us look bad; we don't trust each other. I \nwish to make an appeal that on this one amendment--this amendment No. \n11 we have talked about--there is no trick. It is the exact language \nSpeaker  Nancy Pelosi put in their ethics bill, because everybody \nthere--many Republicans and Democrats--agree that if we are going to at \nleast have a pretense of changing the culture here, we need to be fully \ntransparent and open and honest in what we are talking about.\n  As Senator Coburn said, many earmarks are good projects; they help \npeople and organizations. The problem we have is that in order to get a \nfew of those things that are good and necessary, we have to vote for \nthousands and thousands of earmarks that are not Federal priorities, \nand many of them, once disclosed, become an embarrassment to us. I \nthink it has made the American people jaded about what we do here.\n  This is an opportunity to at least work together on one thing. The \nproblem we had--and Senator Coburn mentioned this--in 2006 is that in \nthe appropriations bills there were 12,852 earmarks. I am sure there \nare many that could be defended. But the biggest problem we have as a \nCongress is that behind these thousands of earmarks are thousands and \nthousands of lobbyists who have been paid to come up here and influence \nus in a way that would include a favor for their client in the bill. \nAgain, many of these are legitimate. But what we have done to ourselves \nand our country--it drives me crazy to see a little town in South \nCarolina that is paying a lobbyist firm over $100,000 a year because \nthat firm has promised them they can come up here and get a Federal \nearmark for a million dollars or more. What a great return--pay \n$100,000 and get a million dollar earmark. We see little colleges, \nassociations, and businesses hiring lobbyists, hoping to get a \nparticular earmark. So we have thousands of lobbyists in this town who \nare here to try to influence us to do a favor on behalf of their \nclient. Much of this is legitimate, but our oath and our reason for \nbeing here is for the good of this country. We cannot do business with \nthousands and thousands of special interests who are here to influence \nus, and we have a system that actually makes it difficult for us not to \ngo along with that, as Senator Coburn has pointed out.\n\n  This amendment is very simple. It doesn't create any kind of rigorous \nprocess for disclosure, which has been claimed here today by the other \nside. It simply says if we are going to create a transparent, well-\ndisclosed process of the earmarks we are putting into a bill, all of \nthem are disclosed, not just some small definition that includes only 5 \nout of 100 earmarks. We have already said there were only 534 out of \nabout 12,800, so we cannot pretend to be putting a stop to the \ncorrupting process of money here in the Congress if we try to convince \nthe American people that somehow we have done some good. If we look at \nthe corruption we are trying to get rid of, Duke Cunningham on the \nHouse side was influenced by lobbyists to get a Federal earmark from \nthe Department of Defense. That would not have been included in the \nbill that is here on the Senate side. But it would be in Nancy Pelosi's \nlanguage. We could stop the corruption before it ever happens.\n  We have a real opportunity to do something that is significant. If we \nare going to spend weeks and weeks--which ultimately we are--with \nethics and lobbying reform and transparency, if we get to the end of \nthis and we have something that does not appear remotely honest to the \nAmerican people, I think we will all be ashamed of the process we went \nthrough. Unfortunately, yesterday, we voted down an amendment that \nwould bring another bit of honesty to this organization. We had the big \nscandal we talked about in the last election, Abramoff. The problem \nthere is that Indian tribes in America are allowed to give unregulated \namounts of unaccountable money to Congress to buy influence, and that \nis what happened in that case.\n  We had an amendment yesterday that would have asked the Indian tribes \nto play by the same rules every other group in America plays by, but we \nvoted it down. That means that in the future Indian tribes, with all \ntheir casinos and money, are going to continue to flood Congress with \nmoney and the American people don't know what it is buying, where it is \ncoming from. It is senseless to go through an ethics reform bill and \noverlook something that obvious.\n  Today, we have something equally as obvious. We have a proposal to \nidentify and make transparent the earmarks that come through the \nappropriation bills. It is something the House has agreed on, and \nSpeaker Pelosi has made it a top priority. This is not a partisan \ntrick. This is a commonsense disclosure provision that will be good for \nthis body.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Yes.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I will make a point. There is nobody down \nhere defending the other side.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am here.\n  Mr. COBURN. I would love to have a debate on the basis of why the \namendment that is in this substitute should not cover the other 95 \npercent of the earmarks. I ask the Senator from Illinois, what is the \nbasis for only covering 5 percent of the earmarks in the bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is controlled by the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I yield to Senator Durbin so he may answer the question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there are two problems, at least, with the \namendment. First, we try in the bipartisan Reid-McConnell earmark \nreform to include not only appropriations earmarks but also tax \nbenefits. It is the same deal. You either send a million dollars to a \ncorporation in an appropriations earmark or in a tax benefit. So we \ninclude both. The language of Senator DeMint's amendment, \nunfortunately, waters that down and weakens it.\n  Secondly, we have more stringent reporting requirements in the Reid-\nMcConnell amendment than in the DeMint amendment. There is no reason to \nwalk backward here. We are moving forward toward reform of earmarks. I \ndon't know if it was a drafting error or what, but the DeMint amendment \nmakes language on tax earmarks weaker and the reporting requirements \nweaker as well.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the Senator. Reclaiming my time, I would be happy \nto work with the Senator on that. We include earmarks related to \nspecial tax treatment and special tariffs. I know there was discussion \nin the House. Again, Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats decided on this \ndefinition because they believe strongly in it. I do, too. We are \ncertainly willing to work on that.\n  The strategy today to table this amendment that would move from 5 \npercent of earmarks to 100 percent does not seem to be an open and \nhonest part of the process to get at a better ethics reform bill.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Yes.\n  Mr. COBURN. I make the point, if you got better reporting on 5 \npercent and no reporting on 95 percent, you have nothing. That is the \nwhole point. Before the Senator from Illinois came down, I said it is \nnot dishonorable to ask for an earmark. Most of them are good projects. \nI made that point. But to not have 95 percent of the earmarks reported, \nwhether strong or weak, and say we are going to report 5 percent of the \nearmarks and report them strongly is not cleaning anything up.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will one of the Senators yield?\n  Mr. DeMINT. I yield.\n\n[[Page S427]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. As I said, this is \ngetting perilously close to debate in the Senate, which hardly ever \nhappens.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for being here.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am glad to be here with my colleague. The difference is \nthis: I have had a passion for a long time about the fight for global \nAIDS. I believe we need to appropriate the funds that the President \npromised and for which I applauded him to fight the global AIDS \nepidemic.\n  Every year I try to plus up and increase the amount of money that \ngoes to fight global AIDS. I have been successful. I am proud of it. I \nthink it is something I have done that has made a difference in the \nworld.\n  That, under the Senator's definition, is an earmark. It is not an \nearmark as we have traditionally understood it. The money is not going \nto a private company, individual or private entity. The money is going \nto a Federal agency.\n  To add to this earmark reform language, all the money that goes to \nFederal agencies may give the Senator some satisfaction, but it is just \ncreating voluminous, unnecessary paperwork.\n  Can we not focus on where the abuses have occurred, where the \nearmarks have gone to special interest groups, businesses, and \nindividuals? Let's get that right. The rest of it is what an \nappropriations bill is all about.\n  Mr. DeMINT. In the interest of continued debate, I yield to the \nSenator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina yields to the \nSenator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, first, that is not an earmark program. It \nis not an earmark. Everybody knows it is not an earmark. It is the 95 \npercent that is in the report language that nobody knows about and on \nwhich we are not going to report.\n  The American people deserve transparency. The Senator is good. \nSenator Durbin is very good, and I understand debating with him is \ndifficult, but he is not to the point. The point is, that is not an \nearmark. It is a great move to the side. That is not an earmark. Items \nauthorized are not earmarks. That is the point I made before the \nSenator from Illinois came to the floor.\n  All we have to do to get rid of the earmark program is to authorize \nthem in an authorizing committee. Let a group of our peers say they are \ngood. But we don't want to do that. We want to continue to hide this 95 \npercent that is hidden in the report language that the American public \nisn't going to know about until an outside group or some Senator raises \nit to say: Look at this atrocious thing.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COBURN. I would like to finish. The point being, let's not send a \nfalse message to the American public. This provision that is in this \nbill is a sham in terms of cleaning up earmarks, and if you are going \nto defend it, then you are going to have to defend it to the American \npublic.\n  It will not eliminate 95 percent of the earmarks, it will not make \nthem transparent, and they will never know until after the fact who did \nit, why, when, and what lobbyist got paid for it.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, reclaiming my time. I am running short. I \nbelieve I have until 2 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. The Senator from Illinois has \nasked if the Senator from South Carolina will yield for a response.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I will yield in a moment. I appreciate the Senator from \nIllinois staying with us because I want to mention another amendment \nand give him some comment. I do appreciate the opportunity for some \ndebate.\n  I would like to summarize to make a key point. Nothing in this \namendment would limit, in any way, our ability to earmark bills. We \ncould have 12,000 next year, if we want. The main point of this is that \nif we are going to have 12,800 some-odd earmarks we have a way to show \nthe American people what these earmarks are, where they are going, and \nwho sponsored them so they can see what we are doing.\n  We know what that would do. It would, first of all, reduce a lot of \nthe earmarks if they were disclosed. It would allow Members to know \nwhen we have earmarks. Many times, the 95 percent or so we are voting \non are in a conference report, and we haven't seen them. We are not \neliminating earmarks, we are disclosing them and making them \ntransparent, which is key to any lobby reform.\n  Let me mention another amendment we talked about earlier today. It is \nreferred to as an automatic continuing resolution, and I am sure a lot \nof folks don't know exactly what we are talking about. Every year we go \nthrough a process of appropriating money for different Government \nprograms. We have 11 or so different bills, if that is the way we \ndivide it this year. We have to have those done, or supposed to, by the \nend of our fiscal year in order for the Government to continue \noperations. But 24 out of the last 25 years, the Congress, under the \ncontrol of both Republicans and Democrats, has not finished all its \nappropriations bills before the end of our fiscal year, and we have had \nto have a continuing resolution to avoid the Government shutting down. \nWe have done that every year I have been in the House and in the \nSenate.\n\n  What that does at the end of every year is create a crisis. We have \nto vote for the continuing resolution, we have to get it done, and that \nis when many of these earmarks are slipped in. That is when many times \nwe are told that if we want to keep the Government operating, we need \nto vote for this resolution, even though we don't know what is in it \nyet.\n  Every year we frighten senior citizens, veterans, and other people \ndepending on Government programs that somehow their service is going to \nbe interrupted because the Government is going to close down.\n  It is completely unnecessary to do this every year. We know, in the \nlast years, it is not unusual for us to pass a continuing resolution in \nthe middle of the night and put it on a jet airplane and fly it to the \nother part of the world so the President can sign it at the last minute \nso we won't send all our Federal employees home and cut services around \nthe country. It is a game we play every year that encourages bad \nlegislation, it encourages unnecessary earmarks, and it encourages us \nto operate with blinders on because we don't know what we are voting \non. This is not a partisan trick because the Democrats could be in \ncharge, we could have a Democratic President.\n  This amendment is, again, very simple. If we have not passed the \nappropriations bills at the end of the fiscal year that applies to \ncertain agencies of Government, those agencies continue to operate at \nthe budget they had the previous year. At whatever time during the year \nwe pass the appropriations bill that funds them, then that circumvents \nthe automatic CR, and we continue with the new level funding. This \nwould take the crisis out of the end of every year.\n  What is effective blackmail, where you vote for this or the \nGovernment is going to close down, we don't need to do that. What we \nneed is an orderly, transparent process that the American people can \nsee and that we as Members can see.\n  This amendment would continue the operation of Government until we \nare able to get our business done, and then we would continue business \nas usual.\n  Again, it is simple, commonsense legislation that does not cost the \ncountry anything. In fact, I think it will save us millions and \nmillions of dollars when we do our business correctly.\n  If the Senator from Illinois has some response, I will be glad to \nyield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will be kind enough to \nyield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have been speaking with our colleague \nfrom Oklahoma. On some of this, I say to the Senator, we may be able to \nreach an understanding. As I understand it, from the original language \nof the bill which referred to earmarks as non-Federal spending, that \nlanguage ``non-Federal'' is stricken, leading us to conclude that it \napplies to Federal earmarks as well.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma says he believes the distinction should be \nwhether the program is authorized. That is not in the language of the \namendment of the Senator from South Carolina.\n  It is important for us, if we are going to change the Senate rules, \nto explore\n\n[[Page S428]]\n\nin some detail the language we use. Although the Senator's intent may \nbe noble, I am opposing it as currently written because I think we need \nto tighten it and make sure we achieve what we want to achieve.\n  The final point I will make is, as disappointing as the underlying \nbill may be to some, to others, I think it is a positive step forward. \nIt is going to result in more required transparency and disclosure than \ncurrently exists.\n  If the Senator feels we should move beyond it, perhaps at another \ntime we can, but let's do it in a manner that achieves exactly what the \nSenator has described on the floor. I think the language presented to \nus does not achieve that.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator's transparency. I \nhave been around long enough to know exactly what is going to happen. \nIf we have a transparent provision for 5 percent of earmarks, but if we \ndo them another way, such as in report language, they are not \ntransparent, and this is going to encourage more perversion of the way \nwe do business because what is going to happen is we are going to push \nmore and more of our earmarks into report language in conference bills \nthat we don't know is there and the American people don't know is \nthere.\n\n  We know how this place operates, and we are going to choose the path \nof least resistance. If we don't have to disclose it if it is in report \nlanguage, but we do if it is in the bill, then we are actually going to \ndo harm to the process.\n  I will tell the Senator from Illinois this: He mentioned a Senate \nrule. We are not talking about a Senate rule. We are talking about a \nstatute of law we are passing that will go to conference with the \nHouse. The Senator, obviously, as a member of the majority, will have \nample opportunity to change this provision, but I think it would be a \ngood signal to America, to the House, to our colleagues in the Senate \nthat if we adopt this amendment today, and if there are ways to improve \nit in conference, I am certainly open to that. But to table this \namendment and to say we don't even want to discuss or vote on an \namendment that creates more disclosure and honesty in the process, I \nthink does harm to what we are trying to do today.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, having served in the \nHouse and Senate on Appropriations Committees and having been fortunate \nto chair a subcommittee in the House and now in the Senate, I would \nlike to make this point which I think the Senator's amendment misses.\n  We cannot authorize a program with committee report language--we \ncannot authorize a program with committee report language. I learned \nlong ago that unless we have bill language, actually creating a law, we \nare not authorizing the creation of a program. The Senator's language \nsays:\n\n       The term ``congressional earmark'' means a provision or \n     report language authorizing or recommending a specific \n     amount.\n\n  It is not legally possible in a committee report to authorize a \nprogram.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. The Senator from \nIllinois is right. We don't authorize, but the Senator also mentioned \nthe word ``recommending.'' Ninety-five percent of the earmarks produced \nby this Congress are in report language and conference reports that \nactually do not have the force of law, that are recommended but have \nbeen carried out by the executive branch for years just for fear of \nretribution from the Congress because we talked to the President about \nthis.\n  There is no reason why these should not be disclosed. There is no \nreason the American people should not know they are there. We are not \nlimiting the number that can be there. We are not suggesting we change \nthe authorizing process.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DeMINT. I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I want to put in the Record this idea of Federal entity, \nnon-Federal entity. Let me give my colleagues examples of Army Corps of \nEngineers' earmarks in report language:\n  Six hundred thousand dollars to study fish passage, Mud Mountain, WA;\n  Two hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars to remove the sunken \nvessel State of Pennsylvania from a river in Delaware;\n  Five hundred thousand dollars for the collection of technical and \nenvironmental data to be used to evaluate potential rehabilitation of \nthe St. Mary Storage Unit facilities, Milk River Project, MT;\n  Five million dollars for rural Idaho environmental infrastructure. \nNowhere will you find in that bill what that is for. The American \npeople ought to know what that is for. We ought to know what that is \nfor.\n  One million and seventy-five thousand dollars for a reformulation \nstudy of Fire Island Inlet to Montauk Point, NY;\n  One hundred and fifty thousand dollars for the Teddy Roosevelt \nEnvironmental Education Center;\n  One million two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for the Sacred \nFalls demonstration project in Hawaii;\n  Two million dollars for the Desert Research Institute in Nevada.\n  None of those are authorized. Nobody will hold anybody accountable \nfor those earmarks. Nobody will know it happened unless we bring it up \non the floor, and then we would not have the power to vote because the \ncoercive power of appropriations in this Congress is, if you don't vote \nfor it, you won't get the next earmark you want; you will be excluded \nfrom helping your State on a legitimate earmark.\n  The American people better pay attention to the vote on tabling this \namendment because anybody who votes to table this amendment wants to \ncontinue the status quo in Washington as far as earmarks.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will vote to table the DeMint amendment. \nThis amendment would strike earmark reform language in the Reid-\nMcConnell bipartisan substitute and replace it with provisions which \ncontain, among other things, a definition of earmarked tax benefits \nwhich is weaker than the Reid-McConnell language.\n  The DeMint amendment would define a tax benefit as an earmark only if \nit benefits 10 or fewer beneficiaries. This leaves open a loophole for \nearmarks aimed at benefitting very small groups of people, perhaps as \nfew as 11 or 15 or 50 taxpayers. It would be relatively easy to \ncircumvent the DeMint language and the intent of the tax earmark \nlanguage in the bill.\n  The bipartisan Reid-McConnell language, on the other hand, defines a \ntax benefit as an earmark if it ``has the practical effect of providing \nmore favorable tax treatment to a limited group of taxpayers when \ncompared with similarly situated taxpayers.'' This is stronger \nlanguage--a limited group can be far more than 10.\n  I am hopeful that this bill will come back from conference committee \ncontaining strong and effective earmark reform provisions from both the \nHouse and the Senate bills.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I will give the Senator from Illinois the \nlast word.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say at the outset that committee \nreport language cannot authorize something that is not legal, no matter \nwhat we put in committee report language. This has to be put in bill \nlanguage.\n  So referring to a committee report--trust me, after more than 20 \nyears serving on appropriations committees, committee report language \nis akin to sending a note to your sister--it doesn't mean much. But \nwhen it comes to the actual expenditure of money, you want bill \nlanguage and it is there.\n  Let me, also, say that the money the Senator is talking about is \nbeing transferred, I assume--I don't know those particular projects--to \nother governmental entities. They could be counties, they could be \nStates, they could be cities. These governmental entities are receiving \nthis money.\n  What we are talking about, the most egregious cases that have led to \nthe greatest embarrassment on Capitol Hill involves the people who \nrepresent private interest groups who come here and receive these \nearmarked funds. Those people are subject to full disclosure under the \nunderlying bill. That is what this is all about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2\n\n[[Page S429]]\n\nminutes of debate equally divided in relation to the DeMint amendment \nNo. 11. Who yields time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized \nfor 1 minute.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Which amendment is this?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 11.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, this is what we call the Nancy Pelosi \namendment; it is in her honor. I appreciate the opportunity for debate. \nI appreciate my colleague from Illinois joining us in some give and \ntake. I think there is a temptation to make this more than it is. It is \nnot a new set of regulations. It is applying the same transparency we \nare trying to apply to 5 percent of earmarks to all the earmarks so \nthat we will not only be honest as a body, but we will appear honest to \nthe American people.\n  I think all of us know if we walk out of here and the media shines a \nlight on what we have done, and if it becomes obvious that most of the \nearmarks we pass are completely overlooked by our ethics and lobbying \nreform bill, then it will be seen for the sham that it really is. We \nare investing too much of our time and too much of the interests of our \ncountry in this idea of ethics reform----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the President for his patience.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote for a motion \nto table. We have a good underlying bipartisan bill that will bring \nabout significant reform in the earmark process. The DeMint amendment \nwould weaken the bill in two specific instances.\n  When it comes to targeted tax benefits, his definition, regardless of \nthe source, is not as strong as the underlying bill, which means the \ntargeted tax benefits that benefit special interest groups will not \nreceive the same full disclosure under DeMint that they will under the \nunderlying bill.\n  Second, for reasons I don't understand, he removes the requirement of \nposting these earmarks on the Internet 48 hours in advance. That is a \ngood safeguard. Why he has removed it I don't know, but it weakens the \nunderlying bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the motion to table. I will work \nwith my colleagues from South Carolina and Oklahoma in the hopes that \nwe can find some common ground.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the DeMint amendment and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

There are 2 minutes of debate actually divided \nprior to the vote on the DeMint amendment, No. 13.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask for order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be order in the Chamber.\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, it is my understanding I am speaking in \ndefense of amendment No. 13, which we call the automatic continuing \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I wish to appeal to my fellow Senators to remember that \nover the last 25 years, 24 of those years we were not able to complete \nthe appropriations process before the end of the fiscal year. As you \nknow, every year we have a crisis situation here. We are all familiar \nwith the end of the year crisis where we have to vote for a bill or we \nare going to close down the Government or parts of the Government. We \nsign a continuing resolution and that night, many times, we are flying \nto other parts of the world so the President can sign it.\n  This amendment is a very simple idea. If we are not able to finish an \nappropriations bill before the end of the fiscal year, it simply \ncontinues the Government under last year's funding. That way, we do not \nhave to have a crisis and vote on bills we have not read and that we \nare embarrassed about 3 weeks later, and we do not have to threaten \nFederal employees or senior citizens that their services will be cut \noff.\n  Please support this amendment. It is simple common sense to continue \nthe operations of Government until we can complete our business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, this amendment essentially provides for \nan automatic continuing resolution in the event any annual \nappropriations bill is not enacted prior to the beginning of the fiscal \nyear.\n  In this fiscal cycle we have passed three continuing resolutions to \nfund the programs for which appropriations bills have not yet been \nenacted. Those continuing resolutions have been free of extraneous \nmatter, and have been passed by the House and Senate without particular \ndifficulty.\n  My desire to enact the regular appropriations bills on time does not \nstem from fear of our inability to enact a continuing resolution. I do \nnot see that the need to pass continuing resolutions creates a ``crisis \natmosphere'' as some have portrayed.\n  Rather, the pressure to pass the annual spending bills stems from a \nsincere desire--at least on this Senator's part--to fulfill Congress's \nconstitutional obligation to exercise the power of the purse. It stems \nfrom our desire to make intelligent decisions about programs that \ndeserve more funding than was provided in the prior year, and to reduce \nor cut off funding for other programs that aren't working, or which are \na lower priority within the constraints of the budget resolution.\n  Mr. President, if Senators feel that biennial budgeting is wise, then \nlet us enact a biennial budget. If Members feel that the amount of \ndiscretionary spending should be reduced for certain programs, then let \nus debate amendments to the appropriations bills or to the budget \nresolution. But let's not abdicate our responsibilities by putting the \nwhole operation on autopilot.\n  Finally, I would observe that at the end of the last Congress it was \nnot the continuing resolution that was laden with extraneous items. It \nwas rather the tax bill that contained a host of disparate and costly \nitems, many of which were new to members of the Senate. And what was \none of the primary\n\n[[Page S430]]\n\ndrivers of that tax legislation? The need to extend expiring tax \nbreaks. I wonder how Senators would feel about a formula-driven \napproach to automatically extend expiring tax provisions?\n  This isn't a position that I am advocating, but it illustrates the \npoint that a continuing resolution is not a ploy by the Appropriations \nCommittee to pressure Members into supporting appropriations bills.\n  We don't need an automatic formula of this sort. What we need to do \nis get to work, debate legislation, move it through in the regular \norder, and get it done. We should not abdicate our responsibilities and \nput government on autopilot.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, while this amendment is well intended, I \nbelieve it will make the circumstance even worse, because it will put \nGovernment on automatic pilot.\n  Madam President, more seriously, the automatic CR proposed by the \nSenator guarantees funding levels; therefore, CBO would score the \nproposal as effectively prefunding the 2008 bills. Thus, if adopted, \nthis amendment will be scored by the Congressional Budget Office with \nincreasing direct spending by hundreds of billions of dollars. The last \ntime CBO scored this bill, this proposal, they put an estimate of $566 \nbillion on this amendment.\n  The pending amendment deals with matters within the jurisdiction of \nthe Committee on the Budget. I therefore raise a point of order that \nthe pending amendment violates section 306 of the Congressional Budget \nAct of 1974.\n  Mr. DeMINT. We get lots of scores around this place. This is not \nspending. Pursuant to section 904(c)(1) of the Congressional Budget \nAct, I move to waive the point of order, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, Iraq is the overarching issue of our \ntime. American lives, American values, America's role in the world is \nat stake.\n  As the November election made clear, the American people oppose this \nwar, and an even greater number oppose sending more troops to Iraq.\n  The American people are demanding a change in course in Iraq. \nInstead, the President is accelerating the same failed course he has \npursued for nearly 4 years. He must understand Congress will not \nendorse this course.\n  The President's decision to send more American troops into the \ncauldron of civil war is not an acceptable strategy. It is against the \nadvice of his own generals, the Iraq Study Group, and the wishes of the \nAmerican people and will only compound our original mistake in going to \nwar in Iraq in the first place.\n  This morning, the Secretary of State testified that the Iraqi \nGovernment ``is . . . on borrowed time.'' In fact, time is already up. \nThe Iraqi Government needs to make the political compromises necessary \nto end this civil war. The answer is not more troops, it is a political \nsettlement.\n  The President talked about strengthening relations with Congress. He \nshould begin by seeking authority from Congress for any escalation of \nthe war.\n  The mission of our Armed Forces today in Iraq no longer bears any \nresemblance whatsoever to the mission authorized by Congress in 2002. \nThe Iraq war resolution authorized a war against the regime of Saddam \nHussein because he was believed to have weapons of mass destruction, an \noperational relationship with al-Qaida, and was in defiance of the U.N. \nSecurity Council resolutions.\n  Not one Member of Congress--not one--would have voted in favor of the \nresolution if they thought they were sending American troops into a \ncivil war.\n  The President owes it to the American people to seek approval for \nthis new mission from Congress. Congress should no longer be a \nrubberstamp for the President's failed strategy. We should insist on a \npolicy that is worthy of the sacrifice of the brave men and women in \nuniform who have served so gallantly in Iraq.\n  President Bush has been making up his mind on Iraq ever since the \nelection. Before he escalates the war, the American people deserve a \nvoice in his decision.\n  He is the Commander in Chief, but he is still accountable to the \npeople. Our system of checks and balances gives Congress a key role in \ndecisions of war and peace.\n  We know an escalation of troops into this civil war will not work. We \nhave increased our military presence in the past, and each time the \nviolence has increased and the political problems have persisted.\n  Despite what the President says, his own generals are on the record \nopposing a surge in troops.\n  Last November 15, 2006, General Abizaid was unequivocal that \nincreasing our troop commitment is not the answer.\n  He said:\n\n       I've met with every divisional commander--General Casey, \n     the corps commander, General Dempsey--we all talked together. \n     And I said, ``in your professional opinion, if we were to \n     bring in more American troops now, does it add considerably \n     to our ability to achieve success in Iraq?'' And they all \n     said no.\n\n  On December 29, General Casey said:\n\n       The longer we in the U.S. forces continue to bear the main \n     burden of Iraq's security, it lengthens the time that the \n     government of Iraq has to take the hard decisions about \n     reconciliation and dealing with the militias. . . .They can \n     continue to blame us for all of Iraq's problems, which are at \n     base their problems.\n\n  Time and again our leaders in Vietnam escalated our military \npresence, and each new escalation of force led to the next. We \nescalated the war instead of ending it. And similar to Vietnam, there \nis no military solution to Iraq, only political. The President is the \nlast person in America to understand that.\n  We must not only speak against the surge in troops, we must act to \nprevent it.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be temporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 30 to Amendment No. 3\n\n      (Purpose: To establish a Senate Office of Public Integrity.)\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I now ask that amendment No. 30 be \ncalled up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman], for himself, \n     Ms. Collins, Mr. Obama, Mr. McCain, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Kerry, \n     and Mr. Carper, proposes an amendment numbered 30 to \n     amendment No. 3.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am proud to offer this amendment, \nalong with Senators Collins, Obama, McCain, and the occupant of the \nChair, the distinguished Senator from Delaware, Mr. Carper.\n  This amendment would create a Senate Office of Public Integrity. The \nmatter before the Chamber now is to reform the rules by which Senate \nethics and the conduct of lobbyists are governed. It is the contention \nof those of us who sponsor this amendment that reform of the rules is \ncritically necessary and important following the scandals of recent \nyears. But it is also important to reform the enforcement process by \nwhich those rules are applied.\n\n  If we are about the business of restoring the public's trust in this \ninstitution and its Members and the willingness of this great \ninstitution to independently and aggressively investigate allegations \nof misconduct among Members and then to hold those Members accountable, \nit seems to me we can no longer be comfortable or content with a \nprocess that allows us to investigate charges against us and then reach \na judgment about what the response should be to us.\n  The office that would be created by this amendment would investigate \nallegations of Member or staff violations of Senate rules or other \nstandards of conduct. It would present cases of probable ethics \nviolations to the Select Committee on Ethics of the Senate which would \nretain the final authority, consistent with tradition and law.\n  This office of public integrity would make recommendations to the \nEthics\n\n[[Page S434]]\n\nCommittee that it report to appropriate Federal or State authorities \nany substantial evidence of a violation by a Member or staff of any law \napplicable to the performance of his or her duties or responsibility.\n  Finally, the Senate office of public integrity, a new office that \nwould be created by this amendment, would approve or deny approval of \nprivately funded trips for Members or staff, subject to the review of \nthe Ethics Committee.\n  I called up this amendment to inform our colleagues that this group \nof cosponsors was going to go forward with the amendment and to urge \nthat our colleagues take a look at it, consider it, ask us questions \nabout it, and that we look forward to a full debate on it next week.\n  Earlier, I failed to say that Senators Feingold and Kerry are also \ncosponsors of the amendment.\n  Having introduced it, called it up, I now ask unanimous consent that \nthis amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I was not sure this would come up. I know \nit has been an issue that has been discussed. But in view of the vote \non this issue when we dealt with S. 1 in the previous Congress, I \nthought perhaps it would not come up. Because in the previous Congress, \nthis was defeated 67 to 30. While we have had some turnover in the \nSenate, we haven't had a sufficient turnover to obviate 67 votes. Even \nif every new Senator who has come would vote with the 30, that would \nprobably take them to 40 and is still not enough to pass.\n  We had a vigorous debate about this in the previous Congress. I don't \nneed to rehearse too many of the issues that were discussed. Just for \nthe record, the Senate does have a record of dealing with its own \nMembers. Under the Constitution, it is the Senate that is charged with \npunishing its Members for misconduct. And the Senate has done that \nhistorically and sometimes courageously.\n  Interestingly enough, the majority has dealt with Members of the \nmajority. Senator Packwood, who was a valued Member of this body, \nchairman of the Senate Finance Committee, one of the most prestigious \npositions a Senator can hold, the master of his craft--I don't know of \nmany Senators who knew the finances of this country any better than \nSenator Packwood--engaged in activity which the Ethics Committee \nunanimously decided was inappropriate. Our current Republican leader, \nSenator McConnell, was at the time the chairman of the Ethics Committee \nand recognized that the removal of Senator Packwood would undoubtedly, \nas it did, result in the shift of a seat from the Republican side to \nthe Democratic side. I don't think you will find any more loyal \npartisan to the Republicans than Senator McConnell.\n  In that position, with existing procedures, not requiring any office \nof public integrity, Senator McConnell, as chairman of the Ethics \nCommittee, led a unanimous vote out of the Ethics Committee against the \ninterests of Senator Packwood, and Senator Packwood resigned. He was, \nindeed, replaced by Senator Wyden, a Democrat. The Republicans had a \nseat which they lost and have never gotten back.\n  On the other side of the aisle, Senator Torricelli was dealt with by \nthe Ethics Committee in a manner that caused him to resign his \nnomination and, therefore, any hope he may have had of reelection. We \nhave a history in this body of dealing with our Members who act \ninappropriately with the existing procedures.\n  S. 1 is all about transparency. Most of the debate has been about \ntransparency, getting more information out. The more information we get \nout, the better prepared we are within our existing procedures to deal \nwith those of our Members who may or may not act as they should.\n  For all of those reasons, the Senate, by a vote of 67 to 30, said: We \nare capable under the present circumstances, under the present rules, \nunder the present structure, to deal effectively with those Members who \nact inappropriately. I would expect the vote would be very close to the \nsame this time. There is much more that can be said and that has been \nsaid. But given the history of this, that is probably a sufficient \nstatement on my part.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Utah. I was \nthinking, there is much more that could be said and much that has been \nsaid. Undoubtedly next week much more will be said. The vote was 67 to \n30 last time. Those of us who support this remain undaunted in our \nbelief that we can improve the process. The process of ethics and \nethical adjudications has been, with all respect, more problematic in \nthe other body of the Congress, but we have an opportunity here, as we \nconsider and I believe pass what will be landmark legislation with \nregard to the attempt of this great legislative body to set the highest \nstandards of conduct for itself and those who interact with us, to also \ncomplete the mission while we are doing so by raising the independence \nof the enforcement process, still leaving the Senate Ethics Committee, \ncomposed of Senators, with the final judgment on what should happen in \nevery case.\n  First, about the vote last year, I suppose the most general response \nI would offer is that hope springs eternal and the power of reason of \nour arguments will touch some of our colleagues. Secondly, we do have \nsome new Members who are very focused on this legislation and upgrading \nthe rules by which we govern ourselves and the process by which those \nrules are enforced.\n  Finally, a lot of things have been said here about Iraq and the \nmessage the people were sending last year about Iraq. It seems to me \nthey were sending at least as strong a message about the way we in \nCongress do our business. I saw one public opinion survey or exit poll \nthat showed more people said they voted based on what were ethical \nwrongdoings here in Congress than on any other issue. I begin this \ndebate to indicate to our colleagues that my cosponsors and I intend to \ngo forward with this amendment next week.\n  I thank my friend from Utah for beginning what I know will be a \nserious and elevating discussion.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I would just like a few minutes to \naddress the Senate. I have some deep concerns about some things that \nare going on.\n  I have been really encouraged since the new majority took over. We \nhave had some great bipartisan meetings, and we have talked about \ntrying to create a new spirit of cooperation here in the Senate and to \nwork together. I think a lot of us have been trying to do that, and it \nhas been going reasonably well.\n  Today I had the opportunity to offer an amendment, an amendment that \nwill contribute to the transparency of what we call earmarks or the \nfavors that sometimes lobbyists and Members work out where we put money \nin bills for specific things. We just wanted to make that transparent \nand to include all earmarks, not just a few.\n  We had a good debate. I have to admit it was the most fun I have had \nsince I have been in the Senate. I was given 45 minutes of time before \nthe vote at 2 o'clock, and Senator Coburn came down to speak on my \nbehalf. Senator Durbin asked me to yield, and I gave him all the time \nhe wanted. I even yielded the last 2 minutes and gave him the last \nword. We had a good debate about it.\n  The majority had decided to try to table that amendment so we \nwouldn't have a vote, so the motion was to table the DeMint amendment. \nWe had a good vote. It is always exciting to see how votes come in. \nWhen they held up the final sheet, 51 had voted not to table the \namendment and 46 had voted to table it. It wasn't a partisan vote. It \nwasn't party line at all. That is what was kind of unusual.\n  Again, I think the spirit of what we have been trying to do is not \njust to\n\n[[Page S435]]\n\nlook at the party but to look at the issue. I think a lot of folks \ndecided that if we are going to have disclosure of earmarks, let's have \ndisclosure of all of them, and this one happens to take it from 5 \npercent to 100.\n  But I would like to thank some of my colleagues, my Democratic \ncolleagues who thought about this amendment, who listened to the \ndebate, including Senator Landrieu and Senator Kerry, Senator Cantwell, \nSenator Webb, Senator Tester, Senator Harkin, Senator Feingold, Senator \nObama, and my good friend Senator Lieberman, who took the time to \nlisten to the debate and decided that this shouldn't be tabled, that we \nshould have a vote on it. Normally what happens in the Chamber--in \nfact, I have never seen it done any other way--is if a motion to table \nfails, then the majority would accept the amendment as a voice vote \nbecause the will of the Senate has spoken and a majority have expressed \ntheir support of that amendment.\n  But something happened on the way to civility and camaraderie here \ntoday. Instead of the normal procedure of the majority conceding that \nRepublicans and Democrats wanted to pass this amendment, they did not \nagree when I asked that the amendment be accepted. They objected. Now I \nam told that after a lot of backroom work, they want to bring the \namendment back to the floor, and apparently they have convinced some of \nmy colleagues to change their votes. I have to say, I know when I was \nin the House, I saw my party guilty of that, after a Medicare vote \nbeing open 3 hours and arm-twisting and all kinds of carrying on.\n  I think we all decided after the last election that maybe the \nAmerican people didn't want us to do business that way. I think the \nwill of the Senate has spoken on this amendment, and I think the issue \nis bigger than on my particular amendment; it is, if we are going to \nhave ethics reform, let's be ethical about the process of voting on \nthis reform. We had a good, open, and honest debate.\n  The amendment is simple and clear. It is actually Nancy Pelosi's \namendment from the House side which has been vetted and voted on and \ndiscussed. I am aware there is some misinformation now going on about \nthe amendment, but I would just encourage my colleagues--I would \nencourage my Republican colleagues because some of them voted against \nthis--even if they don't like the amendment, let's support the idea of \njust following normal courtesies here in the Senate.\n  I have often heard, since I came from the House side, that the Senate \nis a much different place, that we are civil, we respect each other's \nrights. I am afraid a lot of that is slipping away here. I would just \nlike to make an appeal today that my colleagues accept this amendment. \nThe will of the Senate has spoken. It obviously can be worked on and \nimproved in conference. The majority will control the conference. I \nthink it will speak well for the Senate that we are willing to shine \nthe light of day onto all of our earmarks so the American people can \nsee it.\n  So, Madam President, I thank you for the opportunity to speak, and I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will continue to call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk resumed the call of the roll and the following \nSenators entered the Chamber and answered to their names.\n\n                          [Quorum No. 2 Leg.]\n\n     DeMint\n     Durbin\n     Klobuchar\n     Reid,\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A quorum is not present. The majority leader \nis recognized.\n  Mr. REID. I move to instruct the Sergeant at Arms to request the \nattendance of absent Senators. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd), \nthe Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye), and the Senator from South Dakota \n(Mr. Johnson) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT.

With the addition of Senators voting who did \nnot answer the quorum call, a quorum is now present.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 11\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, these are the times when some of us who have \nserved in the House yearn for the House procedures. But we are in the \nSenate. We live by the Senate procedures, and we have to work our way \nthrough this.\n  Everyone keep in mind, the underlying legislation that is bipartisan \nin nature, sponsored by the Democratic and Republican leaders, is good \nlegislation. It is a significant step forward to anything that has \nhappened in this country since Watergate: ethics reform, lobbying \nreform, earmark reform--a very sound piece of legislation.\n  I am going to be patient and listen to what others have to say. I do \nnot know exactly, but I think we have 12 amendments that are pending, \nmaybe 13, and we are going to try to work our way through those.\n  I have told my friend Senator DeMint that I know his heart is in the \nright place. He believes in what he is doing. But this amendment he has \noffered is going to take a little more time.\n  Everyone should understand that the DeMint amendment strikes the \ndefinition of ``earmark'' in the underlying Reid-McConnell substitute \nand replaces it with language that is basically the House-passed \ndefinition.\n  I am happy to see the House doing their 100 hours and moving things \nalong very quickly. I admire and respect that. But having served in \nthat body, I know how quickly they can move things and, frankly, \nsometimes how much thoughtful consideration goes into matters that are \non that House floor.\n  With this matter Senator DeMint is trying to change, a lot of time \nwent into this--a lot of time--weeks of staff working so that Senator \nMcConnell and I could agree to offer something in a bipartisan fashion.\n  The earmark provision is good. It is in the underlying bill. If we \nhave an opportunity to vote on the DeMint amendment, I hope it is \nrejected because the definition that Reid-McConnell has is very much \npreferable to what Senator DeMint is trying to do with the ``earmark'' \ndefinition.\n  I repeat, the underlying legislation that deals with earmarks was \nvery carefully vetted by--and I repeat--weeks of work by our respective \nstaffs. And it is stronger in various ways than DeMint.\n\n[[Page S436]]\n\n  The underlying Senate definition of ``earmark'' was included in last \nyear's ethics bill. We have refined and defined it a little better now. \nThe relevant committees worked with us on a bipartisan basis. We added \nlanguage to the underlying section dealing with earmarks that passed 90 \nto 8 last year.\n  First, we added language to address the Duke Cunningham situation. \nCongressman Cunningham wrote his earmarks without actually naming the \nspecific defense contractors he intended to receive Federal contracts. \nAnd he never mentioned the defense contractors, but there is only one \ndefense contractor in the world that met his specific definition of \nthat legislation. Under DeMint that would not have to be listed.\n  Under the new definition in the Reid-McConnell substitute, a Member \ncannot evade the disclosure requirement by clever drafting. They cannot \ndo that. An earmark is present if the entity to receive Federal support \nis named or if it is ``described in such a manner that only one entity \nwould qualify.''\n  Second, the substitute includes an improved definition of ``targeted \ntax benefit.'' Under the DeMint definition, a tax benefit would only \nqualify as an earmark if it benefited ``10 or fewer beneficiaries.'' \nBut that leaves open the possibility of drafting mischief. And what \nkind of mischief could you draft? For example, someone could easily \nwrite a provision for 11 or 15 or 50 beneficiaries to evade the \ndefinition.\n  The Reid-McConnell definition says a tax earmark is anything which \n``has the practical effect of providing more favorable tax treatment to \na limited group of taxpayers when compared with similarly situated \ntaxpayers.'' This subjective standard will capture more earmarks, by \nfar, than the rigid DeMint definition--this ``10 or fewer \nbeneficiaries.''\n  Actually, the Reid-McConnell definition is based on the definition of \n``targeted tax benefit.'' Where did we come up with this? Senator Judd \nGregg, in his line-item veto bill. That is where we got that. I do not \nlike the line-item veto bill, but I like his definition of ``targeted \ntax benefit.'' That is where we got that. I think Senator Gregg has \nfound a sensible definition for this illusive concept.\n  Third, the Reid-McConnell substitute requires Members to certify they \nhave no personal financial stake in the earmark. This seems to be a \ncommonsense requirement that was not in the underlying bill. We added \nthat to it.\n  It is important that the Senate rules be amended slowly and with \ncareful bipartisan deliberation. My friend, the distinguished Senator \nfrom North Carolina--South Carolina--north, south; they are close \ntogether--the distinguished Senator from South Carolina has said this \nis exactly like the House provision. I say to my friend that is one of \nthe problems I have with it because I, frankly, do not think they spent \nthe time we have on this.\n\n  The House can change its rules at will, and they do. We cannot. The \nSenate is a continuing body. Our rules are permanent. It takes 67 votes \nto change a Senate rule. So when we write a Senate rule, we write it in \nconcrete.\n  Earmark disclosure will be a major change in the way the Senate \nworks. We should adopt the Reid-McConnell version rather than the House \nversion in the DeMint amendment.\n  If we need to revisit the issue later, we can do that. I would appeal \nto my friend from South Carolina. I repeat: I know you are doing this \nbecause you think it is the right thing to do. But take the opportunity \nto look at what is here. It is better than the House version--so much \nbetter.\n  I have only touched upon why it is better than the House version. \nAnd, frankly, as we all know, we are going to have to do some work in \nconference. If the House version is what we send over there, there is \nno way in the world to improve this.\n  So I would say to my friend: Let's take another look at this. Do we \nneed to vote on this? I hope not. This should not be a partisan issue. \nThis bill is not meant to be partisan. That is why we worked so hard. \nOne of the hardest provisions staff had to work on to get McConnell and \nme to agree was this earmark provision. Senator McConnell and I are \nmembers of the Appropriations Committee--well, I used to be for 20 \nyears. I know the appropriations process very well. I think, with all \ndue respect, the DeMint amendment will weaken the earmark provision. \nLet's see what we come up with with the underlying amendment that Reid \nand McConnell submitted to the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I see that the majority leader was discussing this \nbill. While I have a number of Members sitting here, if I could respond \nto the majority leader. I very much appreciate his consideration. I \nappreciate what happened today. We had a good debate. Some of you \nlistened. We had a good vote on the motion to table, and we won that \nvote.\n  As any of you know, if you have ever been through the process of \ntrying to get an amendment up and trying to develop the support you \nneed, to win a vote like that, it is a good day in the Senate.\n  I am afraid it is starting to feel a little like the House. I \nremember when I was in the House when the Medicare bill would not pass, \nthe Medicare Part D, and we kept the vote open for 3 hours twisting \narms, changing minds until the Republicans got what they wanted. I had \nhoped the Senate would be different. Our rules are different. We can't \nhold the vote open that long. But by using tabling and then bringing it \nback up, as we are doing now, we are doing exactly the same thing.\n  I will take exception to the House and Nancy Pelosi not taking the \ntime to work this through. I think anyone who looks at the language \nwill see that the Senate version only deals with 5 out of 100, 5 \npercent of the earmarks that we pass. We have a chart from last year, \nwhen there were 12,800 earmarks. Under the Senate provision, only about \n500 would be included. The public is not going to believe that we are \ndisclosing earmarks. So if we are going to disclose earmarks, let's \ndisclose them all.\n  The House did have the good sense, after seeing what that did to the \nethical appearance of the House, when the Medicare bill was held open \nfor 3 hours until the majority got what it wanted, to have in their \nethics rules that you cannot--I will just read the rule. It says: \nClause 2(a) of rule 20 is amended by inserting after the second \nsentence the following sentence: A record vote by electronic device \nshall not be held open for the sole purpose of reversing the outcome of \nsuch vote.\n  They know what that does to the appearance and the culture of the \nHouse. We didn't hold the vote open, but it has been less time than was \nheld open for that Medicare vote, and we are back here revoting \nsomething after some arms have been twisted. If that is the culture we \nwant in the Senate, I think we should stop saying that we have a higher \nculture than the House.\n  I believe Speaker Pelosi is sincere in wanting to disclose what we \nare doing so the American people will know how we are spending their \nmoney. This is not a careless amendment. It is something that has been \ndone with a lot of thought. We won this vote fair and square. It is \ngoing to happen to all of you. If this is how you want fellow Members \ntreated, if any amendment we offer can be tabled and if you win your \namendment, the majority can go off and twist some arms and change some \nminds and we can have another vote, if that is how we are going to do \nbusiness, then I think it is time the American people know it, and we \nmight as well set this whole ethics bill aside because it is all \npretense anyway.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to have a few people sitting here \nlistening, but I can assure you that this amendment will improve this \nbill, and it will improve the perception of this Senate if we pass it.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DeMINT. I yield.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I wanted to ask the Senator from South Carolina, what\n\n[[Page S437]]\n\nis the difference in his amendment from the underlying bill, and how \ndoes it improve the transparency we are all seeking?\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the Senator. I welcome any input into this \namendment. We have adopted the exact language that Speaker Pelosi \ninsisted on just for the definition of ``earmarks.'' The most important \npart to remember is, in the Senate bill, no matter what we do with \ntransparency, it only applies to 5 percent of the earmarks. It doesn't \napply to Federal earmarks, the type of earmarks that got Duke \nCunningham in trouble. Those need to be disclosed. It doesn't apply to \nreport language in conference reports which include 95 percent of all \nthe earmarks we do. So there is no way for the media or the public to \nlook in on what we do, regardless of how we try to do transparency on \nthat 5 percent and say that we are doing anything to make this place \nmore transparent. That is the main difference.\n  We can get into the tax provisions. We used the definition the House \ndid, but we do include tax-based earmarks or tariff-based earmarks. \nAgain, in conference, we have the opportunity to work together and \nchange it. But if we defeat this bill with misinformation right now and \nit doesn't go to conference as part of the mix, the public is going to \nknow from day one that this idea of being open and transparent is just \na scam. If we are going to do it, let's do it to all the earmarks, and \nthen let's discuss what the best way is to do it.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Would the Senator say that the earmarks that are \ncovered in his amendment would include an earmark to a Federal agency \nas well as an earmark for a private university or some other private \nentity? Is that what he is saying, that he wanted to cover all the \nearmarks whether they are a specific earmark for a particular city and \nan agency such as the Corps of Engineers, a specific water project in a \ncity? You just want that earmark to be known, who the sponsor is, just \nas if it were an earmark for funding for health research at a \nuniversity; is that correct?\n  Mr. DeMINT. The Senator has it right. We are not saying whether \nearmarks are good or bad. We are not saying that we have some and not \nothers. All we are saying is that earmarks are designated spending. \nWhether it be Federal, non-Federal, or report language, it should be \ndisclosed in the same way. This chart shows the number of earmarks in \nthe 2006 budget of 12,852. The Senate bill would apply to only 534 of \nthose. So if we are going to have disclosure of earmarks--and that is \nup to the Senate to decide--if we are going to say we are going to have \ndisclosure, I think we need to include the 12,318 that we don't want to \ntell people about. People will not believe we are transparent. I think \nthat is what both sides of the aisle want. That is the only thing this \namendment does; it doesn't limit earmarks. It doesn't change anything \nexcept it defines them in a way that is open and honest.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator for the explanation. I think it \nis an excellent amendment. I thank him for bringing it to the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I couldn't hear the Senator. I am sorry. What did the \nSenator say?\n  Mr. DeMINT. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 38 to Amendment No. 3\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, is there an amendment pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, there is.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of the \nranking member and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself \n     and Mr. Bennett, proposes an amendment numbered 38 to \n     amendment No. 3.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To permit attendance of meetings with bona fide constituents)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. FREE ATTENDANCE AT A BONA FIDE CONSTITUENT EVENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Paragraph 1(c) of rule XXXV of the Senate \n     Rules is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(24) Subject to the restrictions in subparagraph (a)(2), \n     free attendance at a bona fide constituent event permitted \n     pursuant to subparagraph (h).''.\n       (b) In General.--Paragraph 1 of rule XXXV of the Senate \n     Rules is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(h)(1) A Member, officer or, employee may accept an offer \n     of free attendance at a convention, conference, symposium, \n     forum, panel discussion, dinner event, site visit, viewing, \n     reception, or similar event, provided by a sponsor of the \n     event, if--\n       ``(A) the cost of any meal provided does not exceed $50;\n       ``(B)(i) the event is sponsored by bona fide constituents \n     of, or a group that consists primarily of bona fide \n     constituents of, the Member (or the Member by whom the \n     officer or employee is employed); and\n       ``(ii) the event will be attended by a group of at least 5 \n     bona fide constituents or individuals employed by bona fide \n     constituents of the Member (or the Member by whom the officer \n     or employee is employed) provided that an individual \n     registered to lobby under the Federal Lobbying Disclosure Act \n     shall not attend the event; and\n       ``(C)(i) the Member, officer, or employee participates in \n     the event as a speaker or a panel participant, by presenting \n     information related to Congress or matters before Congress, \n     or by performing a ceremonial function appropriate to the \n     Member's, officer's, or employee's official position; or\n       ``(ii) attendance at the event is appropriate to the \n     performance of the official duties or representative function \n     of the Member, officer, or employee.\n       ``(2) A Member, officer, or employee who attends an event \n     described in clause (1) may accept a sponsor's unsolicited \n     offer of free attendance at the event for an accompanying \n     individual if others in attendance will generally be \n     similarly accompanied or if such attendance is appropriate to \n     assist in the representation of the Senate.\n       ``(3) For purposes of this paragraph, the term `free \n     attendance' has the same meaning as in subparagraph (d).\n       ``(4) The Select Committee on Ethics shall issue guidelines \n     within 60 days after the enactment of this subparagraph on \n     determining the definition of the term `bona fide \n     constituent'.''.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this amendment on behalf of Senator \nBennett and myself speaks to a problem that we see with this bill. And \nthat is when you meet with a very small group of people, say, 10 or \nless, bona fide constituents, no lobbyists present, and you have a \nsandwich or there is a lunch, somebody puts food in front of you, maybe \nyou eat two bites of it, maybe you don't eat any of it, maybe you eat \nall of it--we all know we have been through that--you are illegal \nunless there is some provision that you can accept the lunch.\n  How many times have I gone to a speaking engagement, got involved, \nsomething is put in front of me. I don't touch it or maybe I touch it \nor maybe something is offered to me, maybe I eat one of it, maybe I eat \ntwo of it. It is hard to tell. With respect to these small, bona fide \nconstituent events, one should be able to accept the meal, if one \nchooses, as long as the value of the meal is under $50. It seems to me \nthat this is a reasonable amendment. The lobbyist is excluded, cannot \nbe present. It is a bona fide constituent event. You can go to them at \na Member's home. It can be a coffee. It can be a dinner. They happen \nall the time. I candidly see nothing wrong with it.\n  Sometimes you have events where people bring little amounts of food \nthat are shared. To put a pricetag on all of this, to have to decide \nwhether it is de minimis or not, whether it is equal to a baseball cap \nor a cup of coffee is extraordinarily difficult in the real world where \nwe operate. That is the purpose of this amendment.\n  I yield to the ranking member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank the chairwoman for her \nconsideration of this. As I pointed out in my opening statement when we \ngot to consideration of this bill, virtually every American has an \nassociation with an\n\n[[Page S438]]\n\nentity that employs a lobbyist. If you go to the rotary club, there is \na lobbyist for the rotary club here in Washington. If you go to the \nGirl Scouts, the Girl Scouts have a lobbyist in Washington. If you go \nto the PTA, they have a lobbyist here in Washington. A bill that says \nyou can't accept anything from any institution or corporation or \norganization that has a lobbyist means that if the Girl Scouts come by \nand give you some cookies and you eat those cookies in the presence of \nthe Girl Scouts who are there, you have violated the law. You have \ntaken something, taken a gift from someone who is connected to an \norganization that employs a lobbyist. And the chairman heard what I had \nto say on this. We worked on it together. We have been working on it \nfor the past couple of days and came up with a commonsense solution \nthat removes the concern about this situation. I salute her and thank \nher for the way in which she has worked with me. We have something on \nwhich we both agree. We understand it is fairly widely accepted \nthroughout the body. I am more than happy to act as a cosponsor to this \namendment and hope the Senate will adopt it.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I misspoke. The way we have this \ndrafted, it is at least 5--I think I said 10--it is at least 5 \nconstituents. I hope that is not a problem for anyone.\n  I thank the ranking member. It has been a pleasure to work with him. \nI think we both feel similarly about this. This issue of what you \naccept at a meal is a difficult issue, dependent upon where you are and \nwhere you are located. I think this is fair, in view of the nature of \nevents covering all States, low cost of living, rural and urban States. \nSo it is at least five bona fide constituents--that is a member of the \nState, not a professional lobbyist, although a professional lobbyist \ncan also be a constituent. For the purpose of this bill, they are \nexcluded. I hope this will be agreed to. I know there are some Members \nwho want to look at this. It is at the desk. I urge them to come down \nright away and look at it because we would like to voice vote it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 20 to Amendment No. 3\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and that amendment No. 20 be called up and that \nit be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Bennett] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 20 to amendment No. 3.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To strike a provision relating to paid efforts to stimulate \n                          grassroots lobbying)\n\n       Strike section 220 of the amendment (relating to disclosure \n     of paid efforts to stimulate grassroots lobbying).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 37 to Amendment No. 3\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and that amendment No. 37 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require any recipient of a Federal award to disclose all \n                    lobbying and political advocacy)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. DISCLOSURE OF POLITICAL ADVOCACY BY THE RECIPIENT OF \n                   ANY FEDERAL AWARD.\n\n       The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of \n     2006 (Public Law 109-282) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 5. DISCLOSURE OF POLITICAL ADVOCACY BY THE RECIPIENT \n                   OF ANY FEDERAL AWARD.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--Not later than December 31 of each year, \n     an entity that receives any Federal award shall provide to \n     each Federal entity that awarded or administered its grant an \n     annual report for the prior Federal fiscal year, certified by \n     the entity's chief executive officer or equivalent person of \n     authority, and setting forth--\n       ``(1) the entity's name;\n       ``(2) the entity's identification number; and\n       ``(3)(A) a statement that the entity did not engage in \n     political advocacy; or\n       ``(B) a statement that the entity did engage in political \n     advocacy, and setting forth for each award--\n       ``(i) the award identification number;\n       ``(ii) the amount or value of the award (including all \n     administrative and overhead costs awarded);\n       ``(iii) a brief description of the purpose or purposes for \n     which the award was awarded;\n       ``(iv) the identity of each Federal, State, and local \n     government entity awarding or administering the award and \n     program thereunder;\n       ``(v) the name and entity identification number of each \n     individual, entity, or organization to whom the entity made \n     an award; and\n       ``(vi) a brief description of the entity's political \n     advocacy, and a good faith estimate of the entity's \n     expenditures on political advocacy, including a list of any \n     lobbyist registered under the Lobbying Disclosure Act of \n     1995, foreign agent, or employee of a lobbying firm or \n     foreign agent employed by the entity to conduct such advocacy \n     and amounts paid to each lobbyist or foreign agent.\n       ``(b) OMB Coordination.--The Office of Management and \n     Budget shall develop by regulation 1 standardized form for \n     the annual report that shall be accepted by every Federal \n     entity, and a uniform procedure by which each entity is \n     assigned 1 permanent and unique entity identification number.\n       ``(c) Website.--Any information received under this section \n     shall be available on the website established under section \n     2(b).\n       ``(d) Definitions.--In this section:\n       ``(1) Political advocacy.--The term `political advocacy' \n     includes--\n       ``(A) carrying on propaganda, or otherwise attempting to \n     influence legislation or agency action, including, but not \n     limited to monetary or in-kind contributions, endorsements, \n     publicity, or similar activity;\n       ``(B) participating or intervening in (including the \n     publishing or distributing of statements) any political \n     campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for \n     public office, including but not limited to monetary or in-\n     kind contributions, endorsements, publicity, or similar \n     activity;\n       ``(C) participating in any judicial litigation or agency \n     proceeding (including as an amicus curiae) in which agents or \n     instrumentalities of Federal, State, or local governments are \n     parties, other than litigation in which the entity or award \n     applicant--\n       ``(i) is a defendant appearing in its own behalf;\n       ``(ii) is defending its tax-exempt status; or\n       ``(iii) is challenging a government decision or action \n     directed specifically at the powers, rights, or duties of \n     that entity or award applicant; and\n       ``(D) allocating, disbursing, or contributing any funds or \n     in-kind support to any individual, entity, or organization \n     whose expenditures for political advocacy for the previous \n     Federal fiscal year exceeded 15 percent of its total \n     expenditures for that Federal fiscal year.\n       ``(2) Entity and federal award.--The terms `entity' and \n     `Federal award' shall have the same meaning as in section \n     2(a).''.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly to this amendment \nbefore asking that it be set aside.\n  Currently, Federal grant recipients are generally prohibited from \nusing their Federal grant funds to lobby Congress or to influence \nlegislation or appropriations. Current law also generally prohibits \n501(c)(4) civic leagues and social welfare organizations from all \nlobbying activities, even with their own funds, if they receive a \nFederal grant, loan or award. But these prohibitions do not prevent \nFederal grant recipients from lobbying or engaging in political \nadvocacy. Most Federal grant recipients are free to use other parts of \ntheir budget, beyond their Federal grant, for lobbying or political \nadvocacy. Even 501(c)(4) organizations whose prohibitions are more \nstringent can simply incorporate an affiliated organization to engage \nin lobbying activities or political advocacy.\n  While the appropriateness of Federal grant recipients engaging in any \nlobbying or political advocacy, even with their own funds, could be \ndebated, the least we should ask these Federal grant recipients is that \nthey disclose their lobbying and political advocacy activities. Federal \ngrant recipients who are engaging in lobbying should register under the \ncurrent public disclosure requirements for lobbyists. The public\n\n[[Page S439]]\n\nshould also have a right to know if recipients of Federal grants are \nengaging in political advocacy and to what extent.\n  In the wake of last year's transparency legislation, information on \nFederal grants and their recipients will soon be on a publicly \navailable and searchable database. This amendment builds on that \nconcept by requiring Federal grant recipients to disclose any and all \npolitical advocacy activities. The amendment would also require a good-\nfaith estimate of the grantee's expenditures on political advocacy.\n  This, in my view, is a fairly straightforward amendment that adds to \nthe transparency of organizations that engage in political advocacy and \nlobbying and I think sheds further light on the whole process of \ngetting involved in Federal issues by organizations that actually are \nreceiving Federal funding. I believe that is something the American \npeople would like to see happen.\n  The Transparency Act that was passed last year, as I said earlier, \nwill bring about disclosure of those organizations. They will have to \nnow disclose, those who receive Federal funds.\n  All this amendment does is take that a step further and say that \nthose organizations that receive Federal funds need to disclose if they \nare engaging in a form of political advocacy and to what extent--in \nother words, how much money are they spending on those types of \nactivities.\n  The definition of ``political advocacy'' in the amendment is pretty \nstraightforward, but it has to do with:\n\n       (A) carrying on propaganda, or otherwise attempting to \n     influence legislation or agency action, including, but not \n     limited to monetary or in-kind contributions, endorsements, \n     publicity, or similar activity;\n       (B) participating or intervening in (including the \n     publishing or distributing of statements) any political \n     campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for \n     public office, including but not limited to monetary or in-\n     kind contributions, endorsements, publicity, or similar, \n     activity;\n       (C) participating in any judicial litigation or agency \n     proceeding (including as an amicus curiae) in which agents or \n     instrumentalities of Federal, State, or local governments are \n     parties, other than litigation in which the entity or award \n     applicant--\n       (i) is defendant appearing in its own behalf;\n       (ii) is defending its tax-exempt status; or\n       iii) is challenging a government decision or action \n     directed specifically at the powers, rights, or duties of \n     that entity or award applicant. . . .\n\n  This is a fairly straightforward amendment. I am simply trying to \nshine additional light on this process. It is in line with the thinking \nbehind this underlying bill; that is, bringing greater transparency, \ngreater accountability to the process of lobbying and the whole \nexercise that we undertake around here and outside organizations \nundertake in trying to influence Federal legislation and Federal \nissues.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I ask unanimous consent that \nthe amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 40 to Amendment No. 3\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask that the pending amendment be set \naside, and I have an amendment to offer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 40 to amendment No. 3.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with. I intend to explain it at a later \ndate. There may be a technical change I have to make to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To permit a limited flight exception for necessary State \n                                travel)\n\n       On page 8, line 14, after ``entity'' insert ``or by a \n     Member of Congress, Member's spouse or an immediate family \n     member of either''.\n       On page 10, after line 5, insert the following:\n       (4) Limited flight exception.--Paragraph 1 of rule XXXV of \n     the Standing Rules of the Senate is amended by adding at the \n     end the following:\n       ``(h) For purposes of subparagraph (c)(1) and rule XXXVIII, \n     if there is not more than 1 regularly scheduled flight daily \n     from a point in a Member's State to another point within that \n     Member's State, the Select Committee on Ethics may provide a \n     waiver to the requirements in subparagraph (c)(1) (except in \n     those cases where regular air service is not available \n     between 2 cities) if--\n       ``(1) there is no appearance of or actual conflict of \n     interest; and\n       ``(2) the Member has the trip approved by the committee at \n     a rate determined by the committee.\n     In determining rates under clause (2), the committee may \n     consider Ethics Committee Interpretive Ruling 412.''.\n       (5) Disclosure.--\n       (A) Rules.--Paragraph 2 of rule XXXV of the Standing Rules \n     of the Senate is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(g) A Member, officer, or employee of the Senate shall--\n       ``(1) disclose a flight on an aircraft that is not licensed \n     by the Federal Aviation Administration to operate for \n     compensation or hire, excluding a flight on an aircraft \n     owned, operated, or leased by a governmental entity, taken in \n     connection with the duties of the Member, officer, or \n     employee as an officeholder or Senate officer or employee; \n     and\n       ``(2) with respect to the flight, file a report with the \n     Secretary of the Senate, including the date, destination, and \n     owner or lessee of the aircraft, the purpose of the trip, and \n     the persons on the trip, except for any person flying the \n     aircraft.\n     This subparagraph shall apply to flights approved under \n     paragraph 1(h).''.\n       (B) FECA.--Section 304(b) of the Federal Election Campaign \n     Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C. 434(b)) is amended--\n       (i) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (7);\n       (ii) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (8) and \n     inserting ``; and''; and\n       (iii) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(9) in the case of a principal campaign committee of a \n     candidate (other than a candidate for election to the office \n     of President or Vice President), any flight taken by the \n     candidate (other than a flight designated to transport the \n     President, Vice President, or a candidate for election to the \n     office of President or Vice President) during the reporting \n     period on an aircraft that is not licensed by the Federal \n     Aviation Administration to operate for compensation or hire, \n     together with the following information:\n       ``(A) The date of the flight.\n       ``(B) The destination of the flight.\n       ``(C) The owner or lessee of the aircraft.\n       ``(D) The purpose of the flight.\n       ``(E) The persons on the flight, except for any person \n     flying the aircraft.''.\n       (C) Public availability.--Paragraph 2(e) of rule XXXV of \n     the Standing Rules of the Senate is amended to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(e) The Secretary of the Senate shall make available to \n     the public all disclosures filed pursuant to subparagraphs \n     (f) and (g) as soon as possible after they are received and \n     such matters shall be posted on the Member's official website \n     but no later than 30 days after the trip or flight.''.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I stand to use this opportunity to again \nfocus us on what I think is a very significant issue in this ongoing \nethics and lobbyist debate, and that is the unfortunate practice, in my \nopinion, and the very clear and huge opportunity for abuse that exists \nwhen spouses of sitting Members, Senate or House, are lobbyists and act \nas lobbyists.\n  Now, the underlying bill and the underlying substitute, as we all \nknow, have a prohibition on this issue, and it simply says in that case \nthe spouse lobbyist can't directly lobby the Member he or she is \nmarried to, and that is good. I hope we all agree with that. I hope \nthat is a no-brainer, an absolute minimum we would all agree to.\n  I have an amendment on which I look forward to voting in the very \nnear future. It is amendment No. 9. That would broaden that in a way \nthat I think is absolutely necessary. That would simply be a broadening \nto say that a spouse cannot lobby any Member of Congress, House or \nSenate. I think that is necessary if we are going to get real, if we \nare going to get serious in this ethics and lobbying debate, and if \nthis bill is going to be a meaningful attempt to right grievous wrongs \nwe have seen, including in the last couple of years.\n  The Presiding Officer came from the House of Representatives, as did \nI. Unfortunately, as we know, there have been these abuses. Really, the \nabuses fall into two categories; there are not just one but two real \ndangers we are talking about. One is that a lobbyist who is married to \na sitting Member clearly has unusual access to other Members of \nCongress--forget about his\n\n[[Page S440]]\n\nor her spouse but to other Members. You can't tell me if a lobbyist is \ngoing in to see a Member and he happens to be married, say, to a female \nMember who is chair of a committee on which that other Member sits, \nthat doesn't cross the other Member's mind. You can't tell me that is \nnot part of the equation; that is not part of the backdrop on that \nlobbying relationship. Clearly, that spouse lobbyist is going to have \nextraordinary, unusual access to all Members, or many Members, not \nsimply the Member to whom he or she is married.\n  Of course, there are all sorts of social occasions where we get \ntogether, as we should, as families, with spouses. So there is that \nvery real issue. But there is a second very real issue which, in my \nopinion, is even more serious and more pernicious and that is the clear \nopportunity for moneyed interests, special interests, to write checks \ndirectly into the family bank account of a Member through the lobbyist \nspouse.\n\n  I wish I could stand here and say that this was a hypothetical. I \nwish I could stand here and say that this was a solution searching for \na problem in the real world. I can't. This has happened. This does \nhappen. There have been cases, including in the House, that have been \nin the press in the last year or two where this does happen, and \nspouses are making big salaries from interests that have very important \nmatters before Congress and before the Member to whom that lobbyist \nspouse is married.\n  This is not theoretical. This is not a solution looking for a \nproblem. This is real and this is real abuse. It is simply a bribe by \nanother name because it is a conduit to send significant amounts of \nmoney to the family bank account--the same family bank account that the \nMember, of course, lives on and relies on and enjoys.\n  I think this is a very serious issue. Clearly, if we are bringing up \na bill that is about two things, ethics and lobbying, you can't ignore \nthis issue. This issue is right in the middle of it. It is all about \nlobbying. It is all about ethics. It is all about both of those things, \nthat this whole debate is about.\n  Let me point out that in my amendment I do include an exception. I \nthink it is a fair exception. I can make an argument to have no \nexceptions, and I was tempted to do that. I wanted to bend over \nbackwards to be fair and meet any legitimate questions out there. There \nis an exception if the spouse lobbyist was a lobbyist a year or more \nbefore the marriage happened, and/or before the Member's first election \nto Congress happened. In that situation, I think what it would mean is \nthat this spouse had a real, bona fide career and was doing this and \nbuilt up that practice, way before the marriage relationship ever \nhappened or the representation relationship--membership in the House or \nSenate--ever happened. I think that legitimately is a different \nsituation than the others.\n  Again, I can make the argument for no exceptions. I can certainly \nunderstand the sentiment: get rid of that exception. But in an \nabundance of trying to meet reasonable questions, reasonable \nobjections, I included that exception.\n  I urge all of my colleagues, Democrat and Republican, to take a hard \nlook and then to vote for the amendment because this goes to the heart \nof what we are talking about. This has been a real abuse. It is subject \nto continuing abuse. If we do not address it, this exercise, frankly, \nis not going to have much credibility in the eyes of the American \npeople. If we do not address it, we are not going to be doing enough to \nrestore the confidence of the American people in this institution and \nthe institution across the Rotunda, the House of Representatives.\n  This has to be at the center of our debate, and I look forward to \ncontinuing the debate. I will be happy to answer any objections or \nquestions and continue that debate in the next day or two and look \nforward to a vote on this very central amendment. I will specifically \ntalk to the majority leader about a vote. He has not responded yet. \nCertainly, I cannot imagine a reasonable, fair debate on this question \nof ethics and lobbying and yet we do not at least vote on this issue of \nspouses lobbying Congress. Of course, I hope we vote the right way and \nforbid it.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to the continuation of this discussion \nand the vote and I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I announce that there will be no more \nrollcall votes tonight. However, I caution Members, there will be \npossibly two rollcall votes, certainly one, tomorrow morning. No more \nrollcall votes tonight.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask that amendment No. 38 be the \npending business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I have a modification at the desk, and \nI ask the amendment be modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 38), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of Senator Rockefeller and Senator Feinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, a brief explanation, and then I wish \nto set aside the amendment. But essentially what this amendment does is \nvery simple.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the honorable \nand heroic actions demonstrated by the late Marine Cpl Jason Dunham of \nScio, NY.\n  Today, the President of the United States presented the Medal of \nHonor, the Nation's highest decoration for combat heroism, to the \nfamily of Cpl Jason Dunham during a ceremony in the White House.\n  Cpl Jason Dunham was 22 years old in mid-April of 2004 and serving in \nHusaybah, Iraq. An Iraqi terrorist attacked Dunham, and Dunham \nselflessly acted to shield his squad members from a hand grenade blast. \nThe blast severely wounded Dunham and he was flown to Bethesda Naval \nHospital outside of Washington, DC where he died April 22, 2004.\n  Corporal Dunham is the first marine to earn the Medal of Honor in \nmore than 30 years and one of only two U.S. service members to be \nawarded the medal since the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq began.\n  Corporal Dunham's actions in Iraq were truly humbling and worthy of \nthe greatest honor. This medal is a fitting tribute to a true hero who \nmade the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of his Nation and the marines \nwith whom he proudly served.\n  I was honored to have sponsored the legislation last year to \ndesignate the U.S. Postal Service facility located at 4422 West Sciota \nStreet in Scio, NY, as the ``Corporal Jason L. Dunham Post Office''.\n  Today, as their son is honored as the incredible hero that he was, I \nsend my thoughts and prayers to Corporal Dunham's family and to all the \nbrave men and women of our Armed Forces.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/11/senate-section/article/S441-3", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S441-S442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 AGJOBS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the last Congress worked long and hard to \nresolve one of the most contentious issues of our time: immigration. As \nmany of our colleagues know, while a number of border enforcement \nmeasures were enacted, we did not complete all the critical elements of \na comprehensive strategy on immigration reform.\n  Yesterday, I joined with Senators Feinstein, Kennedy, Martinez, \nVoinovich, and Boxer in reintroducing legislation to address a very \nimportant piece of that unfinished business: the establishment of a \nworkable, secure, effective temporary worker program to match willing \nforeign workers with jobs that Americans are unwilling or unable to \nperform.\n  Our legislation is specific to U.S. agriculture because this economic \nsector, more than any other, has become dependent for its existence on \nthe labor of immigrants who are here without legal documentation. The \nonly program currently in place to respond to a lack of legal domestic \nagricultural workers, the H-2A guest worker program, is profoundly \nbroken. Outside of H-2A, farm employers have no effective, reliable \nassurance that their employees are legal.\n  The bill we reintroduced is called AgJOBS--the Agricultural Job \nOpportunity, Benefits, and Security Act. This bill was part of the \ncomprehensive immigration legislation passed last year by the Senate. \nToday's version incorporates a few language changes that update, but do \nnot substantively amend, that measure.\n  We are reintroducing AgJOBS to fix the serious flaws that plague our \ncountry's current agricultural labor system. Agriculture has unique \nworkforce needs because of the special nature of its products and \nproduction, and our bill addresses those needs.\n  Our bill offers a thoughtful, thorough, two-step solution. On a one-\ntime basis, experienced, trusted workers with a significant work \nhistory in American agriculture would be allowed to stay here legally \nand earn adjustment to legal status. For workers and growers using the \nH-2A legal guest worker program, that program would be overhauled and \nmade more streamlined, practical, and secure.\n  This legislation has been tested and examined for years in the Senate \nand House of Representatives, and it remains the best alternative for \nresolving urgent problems in our agriculture that require immediate \nattention. That is why AgJOBS has been endorsed by a historic, broad-\nbased coalition of more than 400 national, State, and local \norganizations, including farmworkers, growers, the general business \ncommunity, Latino and immigration issue groups, taxpayer groups, other \npublic interest organizations, State directors of agriculture, and \nreligious groups.\n  We all want and need a stable, predictable, legal workforce in \nAmerican agriculture. Willing American workers deserve a system that \nputs them first in line for available jobs with fair market wages. All \nworkers should receive\n\n[[Page S442]]\n\ndecent treatment and protection of fundamental legal rights. Consumers \ndeserve a safe, stable, domestic food supply. American citizens and \ntaxpayers deserve secure borders and a government that works.\n  AgJOBS would serve all these goals.\n  Last year, we saw millions of dollars' worth of produce rot in the \nfields for lack of workers. We are beginning to hear talk of farms \nmoving out of the country, moving to the foreign workforce. All \nAmericans face the danger of losing more and more of our safe, domestic \nfood supply to imports.\n  Time is running out for American agriculture, farmworkers, and \nconsumers. What was a problem years ago is a crisis today and will be a \ncatastrophe if we do not act immediately. I urge my colleagues to \ndemonstrate their support for U.S. agriculture by cosponsoring the \nAgricultural Job Opportunity, Benefits, and Security Act--AgJOBS 2007--\nand by helping us pass this critical legislation as soon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/11/senate-section/article/S442-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RETIREMENT OF COLONEL JYUJI D. HEWITT\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a Maine native and \nmember of the U.S. Army who has served our country for nearly 30 years \nwith both honor and distinction. On this day of his retirement, COL \nJyuji D. Hewitt will leave his post as Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army \nJoint Munitions Command, where he has worked steadfastly to ensure that \nour military services maintain the logistics and resources necessary to \ncomplete their missions and protect our country from the gravest of \nthreats.\n  Known by his fellow comrades as a man of candor and respect, Colonel \nHewitt has amassed an impressive list of accolades and accomplishments \nthroughout his career, which has taken him all over the world, to \nGermany, Korea, and Japan. However, his journey began in his home \nState: at the University of Maine-Orono. Shortly after graduating in \n1978 with a bachelor of science in chemistry, Colonel Hewitt earned his \ncommission as an officer through the ROTC Program. He then went on to \nearn a master's degree in systems management from the Florida Institute \nof Technology, a master of sciences in physics from the University of \nNew Hampshire, and a master's degree in strategic studies from the U.S. \nArmy College.\n  Following his education, Colonel Hewitt went on to fully utilize his \nexpansive knowledge of science and military affairs by serving overseas \nas a nuclear policy officer, as well as program manager of the Defense \nSpecial Weapons Agency and Army Material Command liaison officer. Those \nwhom he worked with appreciated his stringent managerial style, which \noften reflected both his personality and his acute understanding of \nbusiness management.\n  Balancing his time as a husband and father of two, Colonel Hewitt \nreturned to the United States where among other leadership assignments, \nhe served as a school instructor and team leader at the U.S. Army \nOrdnance Missile and Munitions School at Redstone Arsenal, AL. After \njoining the Joint Munitions Command as a commander of installations in \nOklahoma and Iowa, Colonel Hewitt's ascension through the military \nranks culminated in September 2005, with his promotion as Chief of \nStaff, a position of great responsibility to the welfare and security \nof our country.\n  Colonel Hewitt's military awards and decorations are numerous, for \nthey include the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the Army \nMeritorious Service Medal with three Oak Leaf Clusters, the Joint \nService Commendation Medal, the Army Commendation Medal with Oak Leaf \nCluster, and the Army Achievement Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster.\n  Today, as he retires from the armed services, Colonel Hewitt deserves \nthe highest of praise for his endless contributions to the military and \nthe United States of America. His dedication and service is not only an \nasset to our Nation but serves as an inspiration to all Americans who \nknow the price of freedom. Our Nation owes him a tremendous amount of \ngratitude, and I extend Colonel Hewitt my personal thank you for his \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/11/senate-section/article/S442-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   RECOGNITION OF ANN R.

Mr. President, today I offer a few words in \nobservance of the passing of Norman Livermore, Jr., a man who dedicated \nhis life to the preservation of beauty in the natural world and left us \na magnificent legacy of protected natural resources throughout the \nState of California.\n  I extend my deepest sympathy and most sincere condolences to Mr. \nLivermore's family, especially his wife, Virginia Livermore, and their \nfive children. My thoughts and prayers go out to them as they struggle \nwith the death of a man they loved dearly.\n  Norman B. ``Ike'' Livermore, Jr. was a successful businessman with a \nprofound appreciation for his surroundings and a passion for \nenvironmental advocacy. The son of an engineer and an environmental \nactivist, he learned at an early age to infuse a respect for the \nbottom-line with a deeply held reverence for the sanctity of nature. \nThroughout his life, Mr. Livermore would use this remarkable ability to \nform an environmentally conscious vision of the future that appealed to \nCalifornians of all ideological persuasions.\n  As a youth, Mr. Livermore spent countless hours exploring the Sierra \nNevada, beginning a love affair with the mountains that would guide him \nalong his path in life. Strong and athletic, at age 15 he rode 200 \nmiles on horseback and climbed the Grand Teton in tennis shoes. Mr. \nLivermore would continue to display a robust vigor and zeal for life in \nearly adulthood, representing our nation as a baseball player in the \n1936 Olympics and serving with great distinction and honor in the U.S. \nNavy during World War II.\n  Before and after the war, Mr. Livermore operated an outfitting \nbusiness that took people into the Sierra. He ran the business for 20 \nyears, during which time he crossed all 50 Sierra passes over 10,000 \nfeet. Mr. Livermore's outstanding business sense and intimate knowledge \nof the Sierra and the northern woods of California made him a valuable \nasset to a wide array of groups seeking to shape the future of the \nstate. He was an active member of the Sierra Club starting in the 1930s \nand later, in the 1950s and 1960s, he served as treasurer of the \nPacific Lumber Company.\n  With self-effacing modesty, he once referred to himself as a living \ncontradiction, but it was evident for everyone to see that all Mr. \nLivermore's actions were firmly rooted in a commitment to preserving \nthe environment he encountered in his youth. His capacity to understand \nand engage the concerns of the industrialist and the environmentalist \nis what enabled him to be one of the most effective conservationists in \nCalifornia history. Recognizing Mr. Livermore's extraordinary ability \nand the high regard in which he was universally held, Governor Ronald \nReagan tapped him to serve as Secretary for Resources in 1967.\n  While serving on Governor Reagan's Cabinet, Mr. Livermore played an \nindispensable role preserving the state we know and love today. \nCalifornia is filled with testaments to his incredible achievement. The \nRedwood National Park is a product of Mr. Livermore's efforts to \nprotect the forest and the\n\n[[Page S443]]\n\njobs of lumberjacks by arranging an exchange of federally owned land \nfor private plots that included the most magnificent old growth trees.\n  With similar resolve and resourcefulness, Mr. Livermore successfully \nled the campaign to preserve the Eel River. The Army Corps of Engineers \nand the state Department of Water Resources were supporting the \nconstruction of the Dos Rios Dam on the middle fork of the Eel River in \nan effort to minimize the risk of flooding to areas downstream. The \nproposed dam would have flooded the Round Valley, home to the Yuki, a \nNative American Tribe that had lived in the valley for 9,000 years. \nArguing that the dam would have traded ``permanent destruction'' for \n``occasional protection'', Mr. Livermore fought vigorously against the \nproposal and arranged a meeting between Governor Reagan and members of \nthe Yuki tribe. The meeting had such a profound impact on the governor \nthat he withdrew his support for the project, saving the Round Valley \nand preserving the natural state of the middle fork of the Eel River.\n  Mr. Livermore combined well-reasoned arguments with emotionally \ncompelling appeals to win the hearts and minds of those inside and \noutside the conservation movement. He recognized that we all care \ndeeply about that which we are familiar and that effective advocacy \ndepends on one's ability to draw connections between experiences. He is \nknown by many as ``Reagan's environmental conscience'', but his impact \non our State is not confined to the policy of one administration. Mr. \nLivermore's legacy is in the beauty of our state and the joy and \ninspiration it invokes in 37 million Californians.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/11/senate-section/article/S443-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN RECOGNITION OF THE OUTLAND TROPHY\n\n   Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I wish to \nrecognize the Greater Omaha Sports Committee, the Omaha World-Herald, \nand the Downtown Omaha Rotary, which tonight will continue a long-\nrunning tradition in honoring college football's top interior lineman.\n  The Outland Trophy has been awarded every year since 1946 by the \nFootball Writers Association of America. It is named after John \nOutland, who was an All-American tackle at the University of \nPennsylvania in 1897. Mr. Outland created the award in 1946 because he \nbelieved his fellow linemen deserved more recognition for their \ncontributions. Indeed, the game of football is often won in the \ntrenches, with the most physically dominating linemen deciding the \ngame's outcome.\n  From 1946 to 1989, Outland winners received only a plaque, and there \nwas no public ceremony to honor their remarkable achievements. That has \nsince changed, thanks to the dedication of football supporters in \nOmaha, NE, who not only prepared an impressive trophy presentation but \nbegan an annual banquet and public award ceremony.\n  It is only fitting that the Outland Trophy is awarded in Nebraska, as \nthe University of Nebraska Cornhuskers lead the Nation with seven \nOutland Trophy winners, while three other Huskers have been named \nrunners up.\n  This year, we congratulate Wisconsin offensive tackle Joe Thomas, who \nat 6 feet, 8 inches, 315 pounds, becomes the first Badger to earn the \nhonor. Mr. Thomas led the Badgers' offense to average 30.3 points per \ngame as the team compiled a 12-to-1 record. Congratulations as well to \nBill Fischer, the 1948 Outland Trophy winner at offensive guard for the \nUniversity of Notre Dame and a member of the national championship-\nwinning Fighting Irish teams of 1946 and 1947. Mr. Fisher will receive \nan authentic Outland Trophy to replace his plaque in a long-overdue \naward ceremony.\n  Tonight the State of Nebraska is honored to welcome these men, \ntogether with other past winners, in what is sure to be another \nprestigious evening for the giants of college football. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/11/senate-section/article/S443-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/11/senate-section/article/S443-3", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/11/senate-section/article/S443-4", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4:17 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3.

A bill to harmonize rate setting standards for copyright \nlicenses under section 112 and 114 of title 17, United States Code, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nPlatform Equality and Remedies for Rights-holders in Music Act along \nwith Senators Graham, Biden, and Alexander.\n  The need to protect creative works has been an important principle \nrecognized in our country since the time when our Constitution was \nfirst drafted.\n  However, the founding fathers could not have predicted the path \ninnovation would eventually lead us down, nor the amazing new \ntechnologies that we now take for granted.\n  While many of us still enjoy traditional radio, this too is rapidly \nchanging.\n  Recently, radio stations have begun advertising for a national \ncampaign to switch to High Definition, or HD, radio. This new platform \nis changing the way music is transmitted and, according to its \npromoters, ``radio has never sounded better.''\n  In addition, we can now have music radio programs provided not just \nin our cars, or on traditional home stereos, but radio programs have \nexpanded to be available through Internet, cable, and satellite music \nstations.\n  And radio services are looking to use the new digital transmissions \nand new technologies to change how music is delivered so that the \naudience can not only listen but also record, manipulate, collect and \ncreate individual music play lists.\n  Thus, what was once a passive listening experience has turned into a \nforum where consumers can create their own personalized music \nlibraries.\n  As the modes of distribution change and the technologies change, so \nmust our laws change.\n  The government granted a compulsory license for radio-like services \nby Internet, cable, and satellite providers in order to encourage \ncompetition and the creation of new products.\n  However, as new innovations alter these services from a performance \nto a distribution, the law must respond.\n  In addition, as the changing technology evolves the distinctions \nbetween the services become less and less, and the differences in how \nthey are treated under the statutory license make less and less sense.\n\n[[Page S447]]\n\n  Therefore, I am introducing a bill that will begin to fix the \ninequities currently in the statute and open the door to further debate \nabout additional issues that need to be addressed.\n  First, the bill I am introducing today, the PERFORM Act, would create \nrate parity. All companies covered by the government license created in \nsection 114 of title 17 would be required to pay a ``fair market \nvalue'' for use of music libraries rather than having different rate \nstandards apply based on what medium is being used to transmit the \nmusic.\n  The bill would also establish content protection. All companies would \nbe required to use reasonably available, technologically feasible, and \neconomically reasonable means to prevent music theft. In addition, a \ncompany may not provide a recording device to a customer that would \nallow him or her to create their own personalized music library that \ncan be manipulated and maintained without paying a reproduction \nroyalty.\n  This does not mean such devices cannot be made or distributed. It \nsimply means that the business must negotiate the payment for the music \noutside of the statutory license.\n  The bill also contains language to make sure that consumers' current \nrecording habits are not inhibited. Therefore, any recording the \nconsumer chooses to do manually will still be allowed.\n  In addition, if the device allows the consumer to manipulate music by \nprogram, channel, or time period that would still be permitted under \nthe statutory license.\n  For example, if a listener chooses to automatically record a news \nstation every morning at 9:00 a.m.; a jazz station every afternoon at \n2:00 p.m., a blues station every Friday at 3:00 p.m., and a talk radio \nshow every Saturday at 4:00 p.m., that would be allowable. In addition, \nthat listener could then use their recording device to move these \nprograms so that each program of the same genre would be back to back.\n  What a listener cannot do is set a recording device to find all the \nFrank Sinatra songs being played on the radio-service and only record \nthose songs. By making these distinctions this bill supports new \nbusiness models and technologies without harming the songwriters and \nperformers in the process.\n  Unfortunately, this bill was unable to move last Congress primarily \nbecause of misinformation about what the bill does and does not do.\n  However, there were also some questions that were raised, not about \nproblems with the bill, but about ways to expand its reach. For \nexample, currently the bill does not apply to traditional radio \ndistributed by the broadcasters. This legislation only covers \nbusinesses that are under the section 114 license: Internet, cable, and \nsatellite. Yet, some of my Republican colleagues argued that the bill \nshould apply the same recording limitations to over-the-air \nbroadcasters as are applied to Internet, cable, and satellite. While \nthis change has not been made in the version of the bill I am \nintroducing today, I believe it is an issue we should look at in the \n110th Congress.\n  Also, the bill as introduced does not address the other conditions \napplied to Internet, cable, and satellite services in order for them to \nget the benefit of the statutory license. The one that I am most \nconcerned with is interactivity.\n  I think there is real confusion about what is and what is not allowed \nunder the current statute: how much personalization and customization \nmay these new services offer?\n  Currently, licensing rates are higher for interactive services. \nHowever, there are clear disagreements as to what constitutes an \n``interactive'' service. I tried to have the parties meet to negotiate \na solution to this issue so that we could include new language in this \nbill; however, the parties were so far apart that a solution could not \nbe reached.\n  Despite this, I still believe this is an important issue that must be \naddressed. As introduced, the bill calls for the Copyright Office to \nmake recommendations to Congress, but I am hopeful that through the \nprocess of moving this bill through the Senate we can develop a \nsolution sooner rather than rely on a study.\n  Finally, some have raised concerns that applying content protection \nto all providers is unfair. They argue that if there is no connection \nbetween the distributor of the music and the technology provider that \nallows for copying and manipulating of performances then they should \nnot be required to protect the music that they broadcast. In general, I \ndo not agree. We know that there are websites out there now that \nprovide so-called stream-ripping services that allow an individual to \nsteal music off an Internet webcast.\n  It is not enough to turn a blind eye to this type of piracy and do \nnothing simply because there is no formal connection between the \nbusinesses. At the same time, I am sympathetic to the concerns that if \nthe type of technology a company uses is inadequate or ineffective, \nthrough no fault of their own, they should not be saddled with huge \nmandatory penalties.\n  I am interested in looking at this issue more closely to see if there \nis some way to address this concern and find a compromise solution.\n  To be clear, I see this as the beginning of the process. I think this \nlegislation is a good step forward in addressing a real problem that is \noccurring in the music industry. Changes or additions may be necessary \nas the bill moves forward, but I believe to wait and do nothing does a \ndisservice to all involved.\n  Music is an invaluable part of all of our lives. The new technologies \nand changing delivery systems provide exciting new options for all \nconsumers. As we continue to move forward into new frontiers we must \nensure that our laws can stand the test of time.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 256\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the establishment of the Henry Kuualoha \nGiugni Kupuna Memorial Archives at the University of Hawaii; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am introducing with my dear friend, the \nsenior Senator from Hawaii, Dan Inouye, and several of our colleagues \nfrom both sides of the aisle, a bill paying tribute to one of this \nbody's most loyal servants. The Henry Kuualoha Giugni Kupuna Memorial \nArchives bill honors Henry K. Giugni, our former Sergeant-at-Arms of \nthe U.S. Senate, through the establishment of cultural and historical \ndigital archives. Mr. Giugni would have turned 82 today, if he were \nstill alive. These archives will enable the sharing and perpetuation of \nthe culture, collective memory, and history of peoples Mr. Giugni so \ndearly loved.\n  As many of my colleagues are aware, Henry was a man full of life and \nloyalty who served our country with distinction. He enlisted in the \nU.S. Army at the age of 16 after the attack on Pearl Harbor. During \nWorld War II he served in combat at the battle of Guadalcanal. \nFollowing World War II, he continued to serve the State of Hawaii and \nour Nation by working as a police officer and firefighter. After nearly \na decade of service with Senator Inouye in the Hawaii territorial \nlegislature, he came to Washington, DC, as the senior Senator's senior \nexecutive assistant and then chief of staff for more than 20 years. Mr. \nGiugni was appointed in 1987 to serve as Sergeant-at-Arms of our \nrevered body--a position that each of my colleagues and I know as \ncrucial to the running of the Senate.\n  Henry also sought to tear down barriers in society. In 1965 it was \nMr. Giugni who represented Senator Inouye's office, and thus the people \nof Hawaii, in the famous 1965 Selma to Montgomery civil rights march \nled by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. As Senator Inouye's chief of staff, \nMr. Giugni served as a vital link between the Senator's office and \nminority groups. He was the first person of color and the first Native \nHawaiian to be appointed Senate Sergeant-at-Arms. In this influential \nposition, he sought out capable minorities and women for promotion to \nensure that our workforce reflects America. He appointed the first \nminority, an African-American, to lead the Service Department, and was \nthe first to assign women to the Capitol Police plainclothes unit. \nBecause of his concern about people with disabilities, Mr. Giugni \nenacted a major expansion of the Special Services Office, which now \nconducts tours of the U.S. Capitol for the blind, deaf, and wheelchair-\nbound, and publishes Senate maps and documents in Braille.\n  Further in his capacity as Sergeant-at-Arms, Henry was the chief law \nenforcement officer of the U.S. Senate and an able manager of a \nmajority of the Senate's support services. He oversaw a budget of \nnearly $120 million and approximately 2,000 employees. As Sergeant-at-\nArms, Mr. Giugni presided over the inauguration of President George \nH.W. Bush, and escorted numerous dignitaries on their visits to the \nU.S. Capitol, including Nelson Mandela, Margaret Thatcher, and Vaclav \nHavel.\n  Establishing the Henry Kuualoha Giugni Memorial Archives would be a \npoignant and appropriate way to honor our loyal friend, colleague, and \nfellow American, as well as his dear wife Lani, who recently followed \nhim to the great beyond. Henry lived a life full of rich experiences, \nand along the way he accumulated a wealth of wisdom. His memory and \nspirit live on, but it is essential we perpetuate his wisdom and\n\n[[Page S449]]\n\nexperiences, and those of others like him, so what was learned and \naccomplished will not be lost to future generations. This is the \nprimary impetus behind creating these archives. There is a dearth of \nphysical archives, museums, or libraries devoted to preserving and \nperpetuating the history, culture, achievements and collective \nnarratives of indigenous peoples. As one generation passes, a wealth of \ntraditional knowledge could be lost forever. Establishing these \narchives to perpetuate the traditional knowledge of indigenous peoples \nsuch as Henry will ensure that future generations have access to that \nwidsom and, in a sense, will be able to learn from the original sources \nthemselves.\n\n  The development of the Internet in managing knowledge in electronic \nformat has enabled the most pervasive storing and sharing of \ninformation the world has ever seen. Electronic, digital archives would \nfacilitate the sharing, preservation and perpetuation of the unique \nnative culture, language, tradition and history. These archives will be \na source of enduring knowledge, accessible to all. It will help to \nensure that the children of today and tomorrow will not be deprived of \nthe rich culture, history and collective knowledge of indigenous \npeoples. These archives will help to guarantee that the experiences, \nwisdom and knowledge of kupuna, or elders such as Henry, will not be \nlost to future generations.\n  The first section of the Henry Kuualoha Giugni Memorial Archives bill \nauthorizes a grant awarded to the University of Hawaii's Academy for \nCreative Media for the establishment, maintenance and update of the \narchives which are to be located at the University of Hawaii. These \nfunds would be used to enable a statewide archival effort which will \ninclude the acquisition of a secure, web-accessible repository that \nwill house significant historical and cultural information. This \ninformation may include oral histories, collective narratives, \nphotographs, video files, journals, creative works and documentation of \npractices and customs such as traditional dance and traditional music \nthat were used to convey historical and cultural knowledge in the \nabsence of written language. The funds will enable this important \neffort by assisting in the purchasing of equipment, hiring of \npersonnel, and establishment of space for the collection and transfer \nof media, housing the archives, and creating this in-depth database.\n  The second section of this bill authorizes the use of these grant \nfunds for several different educational activities, many of which are \nintended to magnify the resourcefulness of these archives and benefit \nthe student populations who will likely access the archives the most. \nThis includes the development of educational materials from the \narchives that can be used in teaching indigenous students. Despite \ntheir focus, these materials are meant to enhance the education of all \nstudents, even students from non-native backgrounds. This also includes \ndeveloping outreach initiatives to introduce the archives to elementary \nand secondary schools, and as enabling schools to access the archives \nthrough the computer.\n  Grant funds would also be available to help make a college education \npossible for students who otherwise could not independently afford such \nan education through scholarship awards. Additionally, funds can be \nused to address the problem of cultural incongruence in teaching, an \nissue that impedes effective learning in our Nation's classrooms. Such \na lack of congruence exists in a wide range of situations, from rural \nand underserved communities in remote areas to well-populated urban \ncenters, from my State of Hawaii to areas on the eastern seaboard. The \ndynamic I am describing exists along lines of race and ethnicity, \nsocioeconomic strata, age, and many other vectors, which can muddy the \neffective transmission of knowledge. Many of us, especially those from \nrural, indigenous, or ethnic minority backgrounds, including Henry \nGiugni, have experienced barriers to learning as we have worked our way \nthrough the education system. This bill seeks to improve student \nachievement by addressing cultural incongruence between teachers and \nthe student population. This will be accomplished by providing \nprofessional development training to teachers, enabling them to better \ncommunicate with their students.\n  Finally, as financial illiteracy is a growing problem, especially \namong college age youth who are exposed to a variety of financial \nproducts, funds can be used to increase the economic and financial \nliteracy of college students. This will be accomplished through the \npropagation of proven best practices that have resulted in positive \nbehavioral change in regards to improved debt and credit management, \nand economic decision making. Such activities can help to ensure that \nstudents stay in school, graduate in a better financial position, and \nremain disciplined in effectively managing their finances throughout \ntheir working and retirement years.\n  Henry K. Giugni served among us with distinction and honor. I am very \ngrateful to have known him and his family. I encourage all of my \ncolleagues to perpetuate his memory by supporting the Henry Kuualoha \nGiugni Memorial Archives bill. These archives are the most fitting way \nwe can honor and remember our friend and dear public servant, Henry \nKuualoha Giugni.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord and that support letters from University of Hawaii President \nDavid McClain and Academy for Creative Media Director Christopher Lee \nalso be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 259\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

We were honored to be\n\n[[Page S450]]\n\n     able to award him an Honorary Doctorate in Humane Letters \n     from the University of Hawai`i in 2003.\n       Please add the University of Hawai`i to the growing list of \n     many friends and congressional co-sponsors who have joined \n     with you and Senator Inouye to pay appropriate tribute to a \n     great Hawaiian and a worthy advocate for minorities in \n     government--Henry Kuualoha Giugni. Thank you for this \n     opportunity to express our support for one who was so \n     important to our University `ohana.\n           With best wishes and Aloha,\n                                                    David McClain,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            University of Hawai`i,\n\n\n                                   Academy for Creative Media,\n\n                                    Honolulu, HI, August 21, 2006.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,\n     U.S. Senator, State of Hawai`i, Hart Senate Office Building \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: The Academy for Creative Media at the \n     University of Hawai`i at Manoa is proud to support, and \n     honored to be designated as the primary home for the \n     establishment of the Henry Kuualoha Giugni Kupuna Memorial \n     Archives.\n       As you know, there is an exciting visual history of Hawai`i \n     that has yet to be collected, documented and archived for the \n     benefit of historians, teachers, students, and all people who \n     embrace the Spirit of Aloha. This is a people's history and \n     archive that will tap deeply into the diversity and \n     multiculturalism of our state.\n       Unfortunately, much of this rich treasure of moving images \n     on film and video tape is deteriorating with age and cries \n     out to be permanently preserved in a digital archive where it \n     can be readily and interactively accessed by all.\n       The establishment of the Henry Kuualoha Giugni Kupuna \n     Memorial Archives will enable the creation of a plethora of \n     illustrated oral histories of our beloved elders, create \n     educational programs which can be used to bridge \n     intercultural gaps while embracing an ever wider \n     multicultural society, and empower new generations by \n     grounding them in the richness of values, as reflected by Mr. \n     Giugni, that has defined Hawai'i as the Aloha State.\n       The Academy for Creative Media stands ready to make this \n     Archive a primary educational center and resource, a living \n     tribute to Henry Kuualoha Giugni and the people of Hawai`i.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Christopher Lee,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I join my partner from Hawaii, \nSenator Akaka, and other esteemed colleagues, in lending my support to \nthe Henry Kuualoha Giugni Kupuna Memorial Archives Bill. I offer my \nsupport today, on this, the eleventh day of January, Henry's birthday, \nto herald the significant role that the establishment of these archives \nwill play in shaping the future of a new generation of Americans, just \nas Henry did during his remarkable tenure as the 30th Sergeant-at-Arms \nof the United States Senate.\n  In addition to creating a digital archive and preserving the \ntraditions and culture of Native Hawaiians, this bill will support \ninitiatives critical to the development of Web-based media projects and \nthe creation of educational materials that will richly enhance the \neducational experience for countless students.\n  It is my hope that the establishment of these archives will inspire \ngreater academic achievement of indigenous students by sharing with \nthem the stories and histories of accomplished individuals with \nindigenous backgrounds, such as Henry.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 260. A bill to establish the Fort Stanton-Snowy River Cave \nNational Conservation Area; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nprotect a natural wonder in my home State of New Mexico. A passage \nwithin the Fort Stanton Cave contains what can only be described as a \nmagnificent white river of calcite. I am pleased to be joined in this \neffort again this year by my colleague from New Mexico, Senator \nBingaman.\n  Many locals are familiar with the Fort Stanton Cave in Lincoln \nCounty, NM. Exploration of the cave dates back to at least the 1850s, \nwhen troops stationed in the area began visiting the network of \ncaverns. Exploration continued over the years and in 2001 BLM \nvolunteers discovered a two-mile long continuous calcite formation.\n  We have not found a formation of this size anywhere else in New \nMexico or perhaps even in the United States. Because of the beauty and \ndistinct appearance of this discovery, I continue to be excited about \nthe scientific and educational opportunities associated with the find. \nThis large, continuous stretch of calcite may yield valuable research \nopportunities relating to hydrology, geology, and microbiology. In \nfact, there may be no limits to what we can learn from this snow white \ncave passage.\n  It is not often that we find something so striking and so \nsignificant. I believe this find is worthy of study and our most \nthoughtful management and conservation.\n  My legislation does the following: (1) creates a Fort Stanton-Snowy \nRiver Cave Conservation Area to protect, secure and conserve the \nnatural and unique features of the Snowy River Cave; (2) instructs the \nBLM to prepare a map and legal description of the Snowy River cave, and \nto develop a comprehensive, long-term management plan for the cave \narea; (3) authorizes the conservation of the unique features and \nenvirons in the cave for scientific, educational and other public uses \ndeemed safe and appropriate under the management plan; (4) authorizes \nthe BLM to work with State and other institutions and to cooperate with \nLincoln County to address the historical involvement of the local \ncommunity; (5) protects the caves from mineral and mining leasing \noperations.\n  As the people of my home State of New Mexico know, we have many \nnatural wonders, and I am proud to play a role in the protection of \nthis recent unique discovery. I hope my colleagues will join with me in \napproving the Fort Stanton-Snowy River National Cave Conservation Area \nAct.\n  I ask unanimous consent that text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 260\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are \n     necessary to carry out this Act. To establish the Fort \n     Stanton-Snowy River Cave National Conservation Area.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself, Mr. English, Mr. Specter, Mr. \n        Durbin, Mr. Allard, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Levin, Ms. Collins, Mr. \n        Kyl, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 261. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to strengthen \nprohibitions against animal fighting, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleagues, \nSenators Specter and Ensign, in reintroducing the Animal Fighting \nProhibition Enforcement Act of 2007. This legislation has won the \nunanimous approval of the Senate several times, but unfortunately has \nnot yet reached the finish line. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to see this important bill finally become the law of the \nland.\n  There is no doubt, animal fighting is terribly cruel. Dogs and \nroosters are drugged to make them hyper-aggressive and forced to keep \nfighting even after suffering severe injuries such as punctured eyes \nand pierced lungs.\n  It's all done for ``entertainment'' and illegal gambling. Children \nare sometimes brought to these spectacles, and the fights are \nfrequently accompanied by illegal drug trafficking and acts of human \nviolence. In 2006, nine murders related to animal fighting occurred \nacross the country.\n  Some dogfighters steal pets to use as bait for training their dogs, \nwhile others allow trained fighting dogs to roam neighborhoods and \nendanger the public.\n  The Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act will strengthen \ncurrent law by making the interstate transport of animals for the \npurpose of fighting a felony and increase the punishment to three years \nof jail time. This is necessary because the current misdemeanor penalty \nhas proven ineffective--considered a ``cost of doing business'' by \nthose in the animal fighting industry which continues unabated \nnationwide. These enterprises depend on interstate commerce, as I \nevidenced by the animal fighting magazines that advertise and promote \nthem.\n  Our bill also makes it a felony to move cockfighting implements in \ninterstate or foreign commerce. These are razor-sharp knives known as \n``slashers'' and ice pick-like gaffs designed exclusively for \ncockfights and attached to the birds' legs for fighting. Cockfighting \nmagazines I and websites contain hundreds of advertisements for mail-\norder knives and gaffs, revealing a thriving interstate market for the \nweapons used in cockfights.\n  This is long overdue legislation. Both the Senate and House approved \nfelony animal fighting provisions in their Farm Bills in 2001, but they \nwere stripped out in conference. The Senate included felony animal \nfighting provisions in the 2003 Health Forest Bill, but they were again \ndropped in conference. In September 2004, the Animal Fighting \nProhibition Enforcement Act was approved by the House Judiciary \nCommittee, but did not reach the floor. In April 2005, the Senate \npassed a bill nearly identical to the one we are introducing today, \nwhen it unanimously approved S. 382. In May 2006, the House Crime, \nTerrorism and Homeland Security Subcommittee held a comprehensive \nhearing on the House companion bill, H.R. 817, which garnered 324 \ncosponsors but was not considered on the House floor. The legislative \nhistory of this animal fighting felony legislation shows it has broad \nbipartisan support of more than half the Senate, and it has won \nunanimous approval on the floor time and time again.\n  It's time to get this felony animal fighting language enacted. With \nthe bird flu threat looming, we can't afford to wait any longer. The \neconomic consequences are staggering--the World Bank projects worldwide \nlosses of $1.5 to $2 trillion. We must be able to say we did all we \ncould to prevent such a pandemic, and this is an obvious, easy and \nnecessary step.\n  Interstate and international transport of birds for cockfighting is \nknown to have contributed to the spread of avian influenza in Asia and \nposes a threat to poultry and public health in the United States. \nAccording to the World Health Organization and local news reports, at \nleast nine confirmed human fatalities from avian influenza in Thailand \nand Vietnam may have been contracted through cockfighting activity \nsince the beginning of 2004. Several children are among those who are \nreported to have died from avian influenza as a result of exposure \nthrough cockfighting, including 4-year-old, 6-year-old, and 18-year-old \nboys in Thailand and a 6-year-old girl in Vietnam.\n  There have been many news stories focusing on the connection between \nbird flu and cockfighting. For example, an MSNBC report headlined, \n``Cock-fights blamed for Thailand bird flu spread.'' A World Health \nOrganization Asia regional spokesperson interviewed recently on the CBS \nEvening News described the risk of spreading disease through \ncockfighting with infected animals as a ``total disaster waiting to \nhappen.''\n  Because human handling of fighting roosters is a regular occurrence, \nthe opportunity of disease transmission from fighting birds to people \nis substantial. Fighting-bird handlers come into frequent, sustained \ncontact with their birds during training and during organized fights. \nIt is common practice for handlers to suck saliva and blood from \nroosters' beaks to help clear their airways and enable them to keep \nfighting.\n  Cockfighters frequently move birds across State and foreign borders, \nbringing them to fight in different locations and risking the spread of \ninfectious diseases. Communications in national\n\n[[Page S452]]\n\ncockfighting magazines and websites have shown that U.S. cockfighters \nregularly transport their birds to and from other parts of the world, \nincluding Asia.\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), in endorsing the Animal \nFighting Prohibition Enforcement Act, noted that strengthening current \nFederal law on the inhumane practice of animal fighting would enhance \nthe agency's ability to safeguard the health of U.S. poultry against \ndeadly diseases such as avian influenza and exotic Newcastle disease \n(END). The USDA has stated that cockfighting was implicated in an \noutbreak of END that spread through California and the Southwest in \n2002 and 2003. That outbreak cost U.S. taxpayers nearly $200 million to \neradicate and cost the U.S. poultry industry many millions more in lost \nexport markets. The costs of an avian influenza outbreak in this \ncountry could be much higher--with the Congressional Budget Office \nestimating losses between 1.5 and 5 percent of GDP ($185 billion to \n$618 billion).\n  The National Chicken Council, which represents 95 percent of all U.S. \npoultry producers and processors, has also endorsed the Animal Fighting \nProhibition Enforcement Act, expressing concern that avian influenza \nand other diseases can be spread by the movement of game birds and that \nthe commercial chicken industry remains under considerable threat \nbecause it operates amidst a national network of game bird operations.\n  Avian influenza has not yet crossed the species barrier in this \ncountry, as it has in Asia. But we must do all we can to minimize this \nrisk. Establishing a more meaningful deterrent to illegal interstate \nand foreign movement of animals for fighting purposes is an obvious \nstep we can take to reduce this risk.\n  Besides those associated with the poultry industry, this legislation \nhas been endorsed by a number of other organization including the \nHumane Society of the United States, the American Veterinary Medical \nAssociation, the National Coalition Against Gambling Expansion, the \nLeague of United Latin American Citizens, the National Sheriffs' \nAssociation, and more than 400 individual sheriffs and police \ndepartments covering every State in the country. Those law enforcement \nagencies recognize that animal fighting often involves the movement of \nanimals across State and foreign borders, so they can't do the job on \ntheir own. They need the Federal Government to do its part to help curb \nthis dangerous activity.\n  Our legislation does not expand the federal government's reach into a \nnew area, but simply aims to make current law more effective. It is \nexplicitly limited to interstate and foreign commerce, so it protects \nStates' rights in the two States where cockfighting is still allowed, \nand it protects States' rights the other 48 States--and all 50, for \ndogfighting--where weak Federal law is compromising their ability to \nkeep animal fighting outside their borders.\n  The bill we introduce today is identical to S. 382, which passed the \nSenate unanimously in the last Congress, except for one change. The new \nbill provides for up to three years' jail time, compared to two in S. \n382, in order to bring this more in line with penalties for other \nfederal animal cruelty-related felonies. For example, in 1999, Congress \nauthorized imprisonment of up to 5 years for interstate commerce in \nvideos depicting animal cruelty, including animal fighting, P.L. 106-\n152, and mandatory jail time of up to 10 years for willfully harming or \nkilling a federal police dog or horse (P.L. 106-254).\n  With every week, there are new reports of animal fighting busts, as \nlocal and state law enforcement struggle to rein in this thriving \nindustry. In my own State of Washington, police arrested 5 people on \nChristmas Day at a cockfight in Brewster, and about 50 people ran off, \naccording to recent news accounts. Three days later, six more were \narrested in Okanogan for promoting cockfighting.

State and \nlocal law enforcement will have a tough law on the books necessary to \nhelp them crack down on this interstate industry.

A bill to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets \nAct of 1968 to clarify that territories and Indian tribes are eligible \nto receive grants for confronting the use of methamphetamine; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Native \nAmerican Methamphetamine Enforcement and Treatment Act of 2007.\n  Unfortunately, when Congress passed the Combat Methamphetamine \nEpidemic Act, tribes were unintentionally left out as eligible \napplicants in some of the newly-authorized grant programs. The bill I \nam introducing today, along with Senators Smith, Reid, Baucus, \nFeinstein, Boxer, Feingold, Cantwell, and Murray, would simply ensure \nthat tribes are able to apply for these funds and give Native American \ncommunities the resources they need to fight scourge of methamphetamine \nuse.\n  The recently-enacted Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005 \nauthorized new funding for three grant programs. The Act authorized $99 \nmillion in new funding for the COPS Hot Spots program, which helps \nlocal law enforcement agencies obtain the tools they need to reduce the \nproduction, distribution, and use of meth. Funding may also be used to \nclean up meth labs, support health and environmental agencies, and to \npurchase equipment and support systems.\n  The Act also authorized $20 million for a Drug-Endangered Children \ngrant program to provide comprehensive services to assist children who \nlive in a home in which meth has been used, manufactured, or sold. \nUnder this program, law enforcement agencies, prosecutors, child \nprotective services, social services, and health care services, work \ntogether to ensure that these children get the help they need.\n  In addition, the Combat Meth Act authorized grants to be made to \naddress the use of meth among pregnant and parenting women offenders. \nThe Pregnant and Parenting Offenders program is aimed at facilitating \ncollaboration between the criminal justice, child welfare, and State \nsubstance abuse systems in order to reduce the use of drugs by pregnant \nwomen and those with dependent children.\n  Although Tribes are eligible applicants under the Pregnant and \nParenting Offenders program, they were not included as eligible \napplicants under either the Hot Spots program or the Drug-Endangered \nChildren program. I see no reason why tribes should not be able to \naccess all of these funds.\n  Meth use has had a devastating impact in communities throughout the \ncountry, and Indian Country is no exception. According to NCAI, Native \nAmericans have the highest meth abuse rate among any ethnic group and \n70 percent of law enforcement rate meth as their greatest challenge--\nindeed, a FBI survey found that an estimated 40 percent of violent \ncrime in Indian Country was related to meth use. And last year there \nwas an article in the Gallup Independent newspaper about a Navajo \ngrandmother, her daughter, and granddaughter, who were all arrested for \nselling meth. There was also a one-year-old child in the home when \npolice executed the arrest warrant. It is absolutely disheartening to \nhear about cases such as this, with three generations of a family \ndestroyed by meth.\n  I strongly believe that we need to do everything we can to assist \ncommunities as they struggle to deal with the consequences of meth, and \nensuring that Native American communities are able to access these \nfunds is an important first step. I hope my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting this important measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Chambliss, \n        and Ms. Collins):\n\n[[Page S453]]\n\n  S. 269.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na shorter recovery period for the depreciation of certain improvements \nto retail space; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a series of \nproposals that, once enacted, will reduce not only the amount of taxes \nthat small businesses pay, but also the administrative burdens which \nsaddle small companies trying to comply with the tax laws. Small \nbusinesses are the engine that drives our Nation's economy and I \nbelieve these proposals strengthen their ability to lead the way. I am \npleased to be joined by colleagues from both sides of the aisle as we \nwork to move these important initiatives for small businesses from \nlegislation to law.\n  A top priority I hear from small businesses across Maine is the need \nfor tax relief. Despite the fact that small businesses are the real \njob-creators for Maine's and our Nation's economy, the current tax \nsystem is placing an entirely unreasonable burden on them when trying \nto satisfy their tax obligations. The current tax code imposes a large, \nand expensive, burden on all taxpayers in terms of satisfying their \nreporting and record-keeping obligations. The problem, though, is that \nsmall companies are disadvantaged most in terms of the money and time \nspent in satisfying their tax obligation.\n  For example, according to the Small Business Administration's Office \nof Advocacy, small businesses spend an astounding 8 billion hours each \nyear complying with government reports. They also spend more than 80 \npercent of this time on completing tax forms. What's even more \ntroubling is that companies that employ fewer than 20 employees spend \nnearly $1,304 per employee in tax compliance costs; an amount that is \nnearly 67 percent more than larger firms.\n  For that reason, I am introducing a package of proposals that will \nprovide not only targeted, affordable tax relief to small business \nowners, but also simpler rules under the tax code. By simplifying the \ntax code, small business owners will be able to satisfy their tax \nobligation in a cheaper, more efficient manner, allowing them to be \nable to devote more time and resources to their business.\n  I am introducing legislation today in response to the repeated \nrequests from small businesses in Maine and from across the nation to \nallow them to expense more of their investments, like the purchase of \nessential new equipment. My bill modifies the Internal Revenue Code by \ndoubling the amount a small business can expense from $100,000 to \n$200,000, and make the provision permanent as President Bush proposed \nthis change in his fiscal year 2007 tax proposals. With small \nbusinesses representing 99 percent of all employers, creating 75 \npercent new jobs and contributing 51 percent of private-sector output, \ntheir size is the only `small' aspect about them.\n  By doubling and making permanent the current expensing limit and \nindexing these amounts for inflation, this bill will achieve two \nimportant objectives. First, qualifying businesses will be able to \nwrite off more of the equipment purchases today, instead of waiting \nfive, seven or more years to recover their costs through depreciation. \nThat represents substantial savings both in dollars and in the time \nsmall businesses would otherwise have to spend complying with complex \nand confusing depreciation rules. Moreover, new equipment will \ncontribute to continued productivity growth in the business community, \nwhich economic experts have repeatedly stressed is essential to the \nlong-term vitality of our economy.\n  Second, as a result of this bill, more businesses will qualify for \nthis benefit because the phase-out limit will be increased to $800,000 \nin new assets purchases. At the same time, small business capital \ninvestment will be pumping more money into the economy. This is a win-\nwin for small business and the economy as a whole and I am please to \nhave Senators Lott, Isakson, Chambliss, and Collins join me as \ncosponsors of this legislation.\n  Another proposal that I am introducing with Senator Lincoln, the \nSmall Business Tax Flexibility Act of 2007, will permit start-up small \nbusiness owners to use a taxable year other than the calendar year if \nthey generally earn fewer than $5 million during the tax year.\n  Specifically, the Small Business Tax Flexibility Act of 2007 will \npermit more taxpayers to use the taxable year most suitable to their \nbusiness cycle. Until 1986, businesses could elect the taxable year-end \nthat made the most economic sense for the business. In 1986, Congress \npassed legislation requiring partnerships and S corporations, many of \nwhich are small businesses, to adopt a December 31 year-end. The tax \ncode does provide alternatives to the calendar year for small \nbusinesses, but the compliance costs and administrative burdens \nassociated with these alternatives prove to be too high for most small \nbusinesses to utilize.\n  Meanwhile, C corporations, as large corporations often are, receive \nmuch more flexibility in their choice of taxable year. A C corporation \ncan adopt either a calendar year or any fiscal year for tax purposes, \nas along as it keeps its books on that basis. This creates the unfair \nresult of allowing larger businesses with greater resources greater \nflexibility in choosing a taxable year than smaller firms with fewer \nresources. This simply does not make sense to me. My bill changes these \nexisting rules so that more small businesses will be able to use the \ntaxable year that best suits their business.\n  To provide relief and equity to our nation's 1.5 million retail \nestablishments, most of which have less than five employees, I am \nintroducing a bill with Senators Lincoln, Hutchison, and Kerry that \nreduces from 39 to 15 years the depreciable life of improvements that \nare made to retail stores that are owned by the retailer. Under current \nlaw, only retailers that lease their property are allowed this \naccelerated depreciation, which means it excludes retailers that also \nown the property in which they operate. My bill simply seeks to provide \nequal treatment to all retailers.\n  Specifically, this bill will simply conform the tax codes to the \nrealities that retailers on Main Street face. Studies conducted by the \nTreasury Department, Congressional Research Service and private \neconomists have all found that the 39-year depreciation life for \nbuildings is too long and that the 39-year depreciation life for \nbuilding improvements is even worse. Retailers generally remodel their \nstores every five to seven years to reflect changes in customer base \nand compete with newer stores. Moreover, many improvements such as \ninterior partitions, ceiling tiles, restroom accessories, and paint, \nmay only last a few years before requiring replacement.\n  This package of proposals are a tremendous opportunity to help small \nenterprises succeed by providing an incentive for reinvestment and \nleaving them more of their earnings to do just that. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting these proposals.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the the text of these bills be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the texts of the bills were ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 269\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

I introduced a similar version of this bill in the 108th \nand the 109th Congress, S. 2766 and S. 813, respectively.\n  Americans, specifically senior citizens, pay the highest prices in \nthe world for brand-name prescription drugs. With 46.6 million \nuninsured Americans and many more senior citizens without an adequate \nprescription drug benefit, filling a doctor's prescription is \nunaffordable for many people in this country. The United States has the \ngreatest health care system in the world; however, too many seniors are \nforced to make difficult choices between life-sustaining prescription \ndrugs and daily necessities.\n  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report that in 2005, \nper capita spending on prescription drugs rose approximately 7 percent, \nwith a similar rate of growth expected for this year. Much of the \nincrease in drug spending is due to higher utilization and the shift \nfrom older, lower cost drugs to newer, higher cost drugs. However, \nrapidly increasing drug prices are a critical component.\n  High drug prices, combined with the surging older population, are \nalso taking a toll on State budgets and private sector health insurance \nbenefits. Medicaid spending on prescription drugs rose by 7.5 percent \nbetween 2004 and 2005. Until lower priced drugs are available, \npressures will continue to squeeze public programs at both the State \nand Federal level.\n  To address these problems, my legislation would reduce the high \nprices of prescription drugs to seniors by repealing the prohibition \nagainst interference by the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n(HHS) with negotiations between drug manufacturers, pharmacies, and \nprescription drug plan sponsors and instead authorize the Secretary to \nnegotiate contracts with manufacturers of covered prescription drugs. \nIt will allow the Secretary to use Medicare's large beneficiary \npopulation to leverage bargaining power to obtain lower prescription \ndrug prices for Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Price negotiations between the Secretary of HHS and prescription drug \nmanufacturers would be analogous to the ability of the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs to negotiate prescription drug prices with \nmanufacturers. This bargaining power enables veterans to receive \nprescription drugs at a significant cost savings. According to the \nNational Association of Chain Drug Stores, the average ``cash cost'' of \na prescription in 2005 was $51.89. The average cost in the Veterans \nAffairs (VA) health care system in fiscal year 2006 was $28.61.\n  In the 108th Congress, in my capacity as chairman of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, I introduced the Veterans Prescription Drugs \nAssistance Act, S. 1153, which was reported out of committee, but was \nnot considered before the full Senate. In the 109th Congress, I again \nintroduced the Veterans Prescription Drugs Assistance Act, S. 614, \nwhich was not reported out of committee.\n  This legislation will broaden the ability of veterans to access the \nVeterans Affairs' Prescription Drug Program. Under my bill, all \nMedicare-eligible veterans will be able to purchase medications at a \ntremendous price reduction through the Veterans Affairs' Prescription \nDrug Program. In many cases, this will save veterans who are Medicare \nbeneficiaries up to 50 percent on the cost of prescribed medications, a \nsignificant savings for veterans. Similar savings may be available to \nAmerica's seniors from the savings achieved using the HHS bargaining \npower, like the Veterans Affairs bargaining power for the benefit of \nveterans. These savings may provide America's seniors with fiscal \nrelief from the increasing costs of prescription drugs.\n  I believe this bill can provide desperately needed access to \ninexpensive, effective prescription drugs for America's seniors. The \ntime has come for concerted action in this arena. I urge my colleagues \nto move this legislation forward promptly.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 273\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Prescription Drug and Health \n     Improvement Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. NEGOTIATING FAIR PRICES FOR MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION \n                   DRUGS.\n\n       (a) Negotiating Fair Prices.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 1860D-11 of the Social Security \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-111) is amended by striking subsection \n     (i) (relating to noninterference) and by inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(i) Authority To Negotiate Prices With Manufacturers.--In \n     order to ensure that beneficiaries enrolled under \n     prescription drug plans and MA-PD plans pay the lowest \n     possible price, the Secretary shall have authority similar to \n     that of other Federal entities that purchase prescription \n     drugs in bulk to negotiate contracts with manufacturers of \n     covered part D drugs, consistent with the requirements and in \n     furtherance of the goals of providing quality care and \n     containing costs under this part.''.\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by paragraph (1) \n     shall take effect on the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (b) HHS Reports Comparing Negotiated Prescription Drug \n     Prices and Retail Prescription Drug Prices.--Beginning in \n     2008, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall \n     regularly, but in no case less often than quarterly, submit \n     to Congress a report that compares the prices for covered \n     part D drugs (as defined in section 1860D-2(e) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-102(e)) negotiated by the \n     Secretary pursuant to section 1860D-11(i) of such Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1395w-111(i)), as amended by subsection (a), with the \n     average price a retail pharmacy would charge an individual \n     who does not have health insurance coverage for purchasing \n     the same strength, quantity, and dosage form of such covered \n     part D drug.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Levin, \n        Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Carper, Mr. \n        Durbin, Mr. Pryor, and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 274.

Mr. President, today I rise to reintroduce the Federal \nEmployee Protection of Disclosures Act, which will make much needed \nchanges to the Whistleblower Protection Act, WPA. I am pleased once \nagain to be\n\n[[Page S456]]\n\njoined in this effort by Senators Collins, Grassley, Levin, Lieberman, \nLeahy, Voinovich, Carper, Durbin, Pryor, and Lautenberg.\n  Senator Levin and I first introduced this legislation in 2000. In the \nHouse, Representatives Henry Waxman and Tom Davis, the chairman and \nranking member of the House Government Reform Committee, and \nRepresentative Todd Platts, who has sponsored companion legislation \nsince 2003, have been working to enact strong whistleblower \nprotections.\n  Over the years, we've worked to educate our colleagues on the need to \nstrengthen the WPA and build consensus for the legislation. I'm \nespecially pleased that last year our bill passed the Senate by \nunanimous consent as an amendment to the fiscal year 2007 Defense \nAuthorization Act. While the measure was removed with other non-defense \nspecific material in conference, I believe the Senate's action will \nprovide the momentum to make a real difference for Federal \nwhistleblowers in the 110th Congress.\n  We agree that to ensure the success of any government program there \nmust be appropriate checks in place to weed out mismanagement and \nwasteful spending. A strong and vibrant WPA is a critical tool in \nsaving taxpayer money and ensuring an open government.\n  The Federal Employee Protection of Disclosures Act addresses many \ncourt decisions that have eroded protections for Federal employees and \nhave ignored congressional intent. Our legislation ensures that Federal \nwhistleblowers are protected from retaliatory action when notifying the \npublic and government leaders of waste, fraud, and abuse. If we fail to \nprotect whistleblowers, then our efforts to improve government \nmanagement, protect the public, and secure the nation will also fail.\n  The legislation: clarifies congressional intent that Federal \nemployees are protected for any disclosure of waste, fraud, or abuse--\nincluding those made as part of an employee's job duties; provides an \nindependent determination as to whether the loss or denial of a \nsecurity clearance is retaliation against a whistleblower; and suspends \nthe Federal Circuit Court of Appeals' sole jurisdiction over Federal \nemployee whistleblower cases for 5 years, which would ensure a fuller \nreview of a whistleblower's claim.\n  Given that the United States will be fighting the war on terror for \nyears to come and that funding such operations requires significant \nresources, it is imperative that government funds are spent wisely. \nThat is why Federal employees must be confident that they can disclose \ngovernment waste, fraud, and abuse without fear of retaliation. \nRestoring credibility to the WPA is no less than a necessity. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to pass this critical \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 274\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish the Prehistoric Trackways National \nMonument in the State of New Mexico; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I'm pleased to reintroduce today with \nSenator Domenici a bill we introduced last Congress. The Prehistoric \nTrackways National Monument Establishment Act would protect a site of \nworldwide scientific significance in the Robledo Mountains in my State. \nThe bill would create a national monument to preserve and allow for the \ncontinuing scientific investigation of this remarkable \n``megatracksite'' of 280,000,000 year-old fossils. The Energy Committee \nheld a hearing last year where the Bureau of Land Management testified \nin support; in addition the bill has the support of the local \ncommunity. I appreciate Senator Domenici's support on this measure and \nhope that with the progress we made last Congress we can look forward \nto moving the bill quickly through the Senate this year.\n  The vast tidal mudflats that made up much of modern New Mexico 60 \nmillion years before the dinosaurs preserved the marks of some of the \nearliest life on our planet to make its way out of the ocean. The \nfossil record of this time is scattered throughout New Mexico but, \nuntil this discovery, there were few places where the range of life and \ntheir interactions with each other could be studied.\n  Las Cruces resident Jerry MacDonald first brought the find to light \nin 1988 when he revealed that there was far more to be found in the \nRobledos than the occasional fossil that local residents had been \nseeing for years. The trackways he hauled out on his back, some over 20 \nfeet long, showed that there was a great deal of useful information \nburied in the rock there. These trackways help complete the puzzle of \nhow these ancient creatures lived in a way that we cannot understand \nfrom only studying their fossilized bones.\n  Senator Domenici and Representative Skeen joined me in creating \nlegislation, passed in 1990, to protect the area and study its \nscientific value. In 1994, scientists from the New Mexico Museum of \nNatural History and Science, the University of Colorado, and the \nSmithsonian Institution completed their study and documented the \nsignificant scientific value of the find. Particularly owing to the \nquality of the specimens and the wide range of animals that had left \ntheir imprint there the study found that the site was of immense \nscientific value. The study concluded, in part, ``[t]he diversity, \nabundance and quality of the tracks in the Robledo Mountains is far \ngreater than at any other known tracksite or aggregation of tracksites. \nBecause of this, the Robledo tracks allow a wide range of scientific \nproblems regarding late Paleozoic tracks to be solved that could not be \nsolved before.'' This bill would take the next logical step to follow \nup from these efforts and set in place permanent protections and allow \nfor scientific investigation of these remarkable resources.\n  In addition to permanently protecting the fossils for the scientific \ncommunity the bill would make it a priority that local residents get \nthe opportunity to see these unique specimens and participate in their \ncuration. This should provide a unique scientific and educational \nopportunity to Las Cruces and the surrounding community.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to protect these \nimportant resources and allow for their continuing contribution to our \nunderstanding of life on the ancient earth.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 275\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Prehistoric Trackways \n     National Monument Establishment Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Monument.--The term ``Monument'' means the Prehistoric \n     Trackways National Monument established by section 4(a).\n       (2) Public land.--The term ``public land'' has the meaning \n     given the term ``public lands'' in section 103 of the Federal \n     Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1702).\n       (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) in 1987, a major deposit of Paleozoic Era fossilized \n     footprint megatrackways was discovered in the Robledo \n     Mountains in southern New Mexico;\n       (2) the trackways contain footprints of numerous \n     amphibians, reptiles, and insects (including previously \n     unknown species), plants, and petrified wood dating back \n     approximately 280,000,000 years, which collectively provide \n     new opportunities to understand animal behaviors and \n     environments from a time predating the dinosaurs;\n       (3) title III of Public Law 101-578 (104 Stat. 2860)--\n       (A) provided interim protection for the site at which the \n     trackways were discovered; and\n       (B) directed the Secretary of the Interior to--\n       (i) prepare a study assessing the significance of the site; \n     and\n       (ii) based on the study, provide recommendations for \n     protection of the paleontological resources at the site;\n       (4) the Bureau of Land Management completed the Paleozoic \n     Trackways Scientific Study Report in 1994, which \n     characterized the site as containing ``the most \n     scientifically significant Early Permian tracksites'' in the \n     world;\n       (5) despite the conclusion of the study and the \n     recommendations for protection, the site remains unprotected \n     and many irreplaceable trackways specimens have been lost to \n     vandalism or theft; and\n       (6) designation of the trackways site as a National \n     Monument would protect the unique fossil resources for \n     present and future generations while allowing for public \n     education and continued scientific research opportunities.\n\n     SEC. 4.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the fossilized trackways near Las \nCruces, New Mexico, in Dona Ana County came to my attention in the \nearly 1990's. During the 101st Congress, I cosponsored Senator \nBingaman's legislation that directed the Bureau of Land Management to \nstudy and report on the significance of the prehistoric sites near the \nRobledo Mountains.\n  I believe our Federal lands are truly national treasures, and I \nunderstand the challenges we face in managing our public lands in a \nresponsible and environmentally sensitive manner. Local leaders, \nspecial interest groups, multiple users, New Mexico State University, \nand the Bureau of Land Management, BLM, have identified many land \nissues in the Las Cruces area that need to be addressed. The trackways \nare but one of these issues that can and should be addressed in the \ncontext of a broader lands bill. I continue to believe that \nintroduction of comprehensive or omnibus legislation is a preferable \napproach, rather than the introduction of individual bills to deal with \neach separate issue.\n  The trackways are a remarkable resource that need and deserve \nprotection, and I support the intent of this bill. While I am very \nsupportive of the overall goal to protect these prehistoric trackway \nsites, there are several particulars in this bill that I do not fully \nembrace and on which I want to continue to work with Senator Bingaman, \nsuch as ensuring that we authorize all uses in the area that are not \ninconsistent with the purposes of the bill, and reworking the section \nregarding BLM authority with respect to hunting activities. As we work \nthrough the legislative process, I look forward to working with Senator \nBingaman to accomplish the objective of protecting the prehistoric \ntrackway sites, while at the same time addressing some of the broader \nFederal land issues in Dona Ana County.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Sessions):\n  S. 276. A bill to strengthen the consequences of the fraudulent use \nof United States or foreign passports and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, Senator Sessions and I are introducing \nlegislation today that will enhance our national security by expanding \nand strengthening the current passport and visa fraud laws.\n  The Passport and Visa Security Act bill adds much needed law to \npunish trafficking in passports and visas and clarifies the current \ncriminal law. It also punishes those who engage in schemes to defraud \nimmigrants based on changes in the immigration law.\n  This bill is an improved version of a bill Senator Sessions and I \nintroduced in the 109th Congress. We both have long been concerned \nabout the need to strengthen our national security by strengthening our \ndocument fraud laws.\n  In fact, we introduced our passport fraud bill well before the \ncomprehensive immigration reform bill was passed in the Senate last \nSpring.\n  For that reason, I was pleased that the comprehensive immigration \nreform bill contained important document fraud provisions. This bill \nbuilds on those provisions.\n  The evidence has shown repeatedly that false immigration documents \nprovide a gateway for organized crime and terrorism. The need to take \naction against this crime is clear.\n  For too long, the Federal Government has moved too slowly--or not at \nall--to enhance our border security. According to the 9/11 National \nCommission Staff Report on Terrorist Travel, prior to September 11, \n2001, no agency of the U.S. government thought of border security as a \ntool in the counterterrorism arsenal.\n  Still today, over five years since the tragic attacks on September \n11, the Federal Government has failed to devote sufficient time, \ntechnology, personnel and resources to make border security a \ncornerstone of our national security policy.\n\n[[Page S460]]\n\n  Last year, Congress passed a law to build a border fence. I believe \nthis law was an important first step, but a fence alone cannot \nsufficiently protect our vulnerable borders.\n  In fact, as the 9/11 Commission report demonstrates, individuals with \nfraudulent documents can pose a far greater threat to our national \nsecurity than those traveling with no documents at all.\n  Fraudulent documents give criminals free reign to create a new \nidentity and to plan and carry out attacks in the United States.\n  We know, for example, that at least two of the 9/11 hijackers used \npassports that were altered when they entered this country and as many \nas 15 of the 19 hijackers could have been intercepted by border \nofficials, based in part on their travel documents.\n  The 9/11 Commission Report detailed the way the terrorist operatives \ncarefully selected the documents they used for travel--most often \nrelying on fraudulent ones.\n  The terrorists altered passports by substituting photographs, adding \nfalse visas, bleaching stamps, and by substituting pages.\n  The terrorists devoted extensive resources to acquiring and \nmanipulating passports--all to avoid detection of their nefarious \nactivities and objectives.\n  Today, over five years later, Interpol reports that they have records \nof more than 12 million stolen and lost travel documents from 113 \ndifferent countries. These are only the ones we know about.\n  Interpol estimates that 30 to 40 million travel documents have been \nstolen worldwide.\n  We know that over the past few years, passport and visa forgery has \nbecome even easier thanks to home computers, digital photography, \nscanners and color laser printing.\n  News articles document that passport and visa fraud has become so \nlucrative that gangs are offering franchises in the multimillion-dollar \nscam to forgers.\n  Unfortunately, it's not only foreign passports that can be forged. \nForged and fraudulent United States passports can be the most dangerous \nwhen in the wrong hands.\n  With a U.S. passport, criminals can establish American citizenship \nand have unlimited access to virtually every country in the world.\n  It's no surprise, then, that passport and visa fraud are often linked \nto other, very serious crimes in the United States and abroad: \nnarcotics trafficking, organized crimes, money laundering, human \ntrafficking, and identity theft.\n  For example, this past December, the son of former Liberian President \nCharles Taylor, Charles McArthur Emmanuel, who headed a violent \nparamilitary unit in his father's government, was sentenced in Miami \nfor passport fraud.\n  A day later, a Federal grand jury indicted him on charges of torture \nand conspiracy involving acts committed in Liberia in 2002.\n  Emmanuel, also known as Charles ``Chuckie'' Taylor and Roy Belfast \nJr., was on Interpol's Most Wanted list and the United Nations travel \nwatch list.\n  Nevertheless, he escaped detection by falsifying his passport \napplication, ultimately gaining easy entry and exit from the United \nStates while he perpetrated his crimes.\n  Despite evidence that these crimes are widespread and that millions \nof travel documents are on the black market, in 2004, the State \nDepartment's Diplomatic Security Service reports that it made about 500 \narrests for passport fraud, with only 300 convictions.\n  For these reasons, Senator Sessions and I are introducing a bill \ntoday to strengthen current passport and visa laws in a number of key \nways.\n  First, this bill adds two new laws with strong penalties to punish \nthose who traffic in fraudulent travel documents. The current law makes \nno distinction between those caught with multiple false travel \ndocuments--the very worst offenders who are often part of organized \ncrime rings--and those with only one false document. Our bill would \nchange that.\n  The bill also updates the current travel document fraud laws--using \nplain language advocated for by the practitioners that passed the \nSenate as part of the comprehensive immigration reform bill.\n  Thirdly, the bill adds provisions to the current passport and visa \nfraud laws to ensure that conspiracies and attempts to commit these \ncrimes are investigated and prosecuted just as vigorously as the \ncompleted crime.\n  Fourth--the bill makes explicit that there is extraterritorial \njurisdiction over these offenses, so that individuals who counterfeit \ntravel documents while abroad but are caught trying to enter the United \nStates are still subject to prosecution.\n  The bill also directs the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Commissions to \nreconsider the relatively low sentencing guidelines to reflect the \npotential seriousness of these crimes.\n  Currently, offenders who engage in passport or visa fraud generally \nserve less than a year imprisonment, providing little incentive for \nU.S. Attorney's Offices to expend scarce resources in prosecuting these \ncrimes.\n  Finally, the bill creates a law to punish sham attorneys who cheat \nimmigrants out of thousands of dollars by preying on their fears that \nthey could be forced to leave the country. We know that when Congress \ndiscusses changing the immigration law, scam artists target and exploit \nthese vulnerable populations. These crimes should not go unpunished.\n  This bill provides much needed reform. It strengthens the security of \ndocuments used to illegally gain entry to this country and empowers the \nagents and prosecutors who enforce our borders to take swift and strong \naction against these criminals.\n  I ask my colleagues to join Senator Sessions and me in supporting \nthis legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a bill summary and the text of this bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   The Passport and Visa Security Act\n                                of 2007\n\n\n                              bill summary\n\n       Adds two new crimes to penalize the trafficking in 10 or \n     more passports or visas and creates a 20 year maximum penalty \n     for violating these provisions. Under current law, there is \n     no specific provision punishing the trafficking of multiple \n     fraudulent documents and each document must be prosecuted \n     individually.\n       Simplifies the language of the current passport and visa \n     fraud laws, specifically by changing the required criminal \n     intent from ``knowingly and wilfully'' to ``knowingly.'' The \n     maximum penalty for committing these crimes is amended from \n     10 years for a first or second offense and 15 years in the \n     case of any other offense to simply 15 years.\n       Creates a new crime that would penalize those who engage in \n     schemes to defraud aliens in connection with matters \n     authorized by or arising under Federal immigration laws.\n        Clarifies existing law that the maximum sentence for \n     passport fraud, when used to facilitate a drug trafficking \n     crime, is 20 years; and the maximum sentence for passport \n     fraud, when used to facilitate an act of international \n     terrorism is 25 years. (This change is technical, not \n     substantive, as these are the maximum penalties already in \n     the individual sections of the criminal code.)\n       Adds language to punish conspiracies and attempts to commit \n     passport fraud and other false document crimes.\n       Makes explicit that there is extraterritorial jurisdiction \n     over these offenses, so that the United States can prosecute \n     individuals who may have committed a passport fraud crime \n     while abroad (e.g., the law would reach someone who \n     manufactures fake passports in Cameroon and is arrested in \n     the United States).\n       Adds a definitional section to clarify the terms used in \n     these laws.\n       Directs the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Commissions to \n     reconsider the current low sentencing guidelines to reflect \n     the potential seriousness of these crimes and the changes \n     made by this bill.\n       Creates a rebuttable presumption that a person who commits \n     one of these crimes, or who is found to be unlawfully in the \n     country after having already been ordered deported, is to be \n     detained pending trial.\n       Adds language directing the Attorney General to create \n     binding regulations to ensure that the prosecution of these \n     crimes is in keeping with current U.S. treaty obligations \n     relating to refugees (which states that refugees carrying \n     false passports should not be prosecuted) without creating a \n     private right of action to enforce this provision.\n       Clarifies that the Diplomatic Security Service (of the \n     State Department) has authority to investigate these new and \n     revised crimes (using the language found in the 109th \n     Congress Senate passed immigration bill, S. 2611). The \n     Diplomatic Security Service currently investigates passport \n     fraud, this section just clarifies their authority to do so.\n       Clarifies that the same statute of limitations (10 years) \n     applies to all of the offenses\n\n[[Page S461]]\n\n     added or modified by this bill--again incorporating language \n     from the 109th Congress Senate passed immigration bill, S. \n     2611.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                 S. 276\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Immigration, passport, and naturalization offenses''.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague Senator \nFeinstein for her hard work on document security issues. She currently \nserves as the Chair of the Judiciary Committee's Terrorism \nSubcommittee, Senator Kyl is Ranking Member, and I am looking forward \nto working with her on the document security that issues I am sure our \nsubcommittee will address this Congress.\n  This year will mark the 3rd year Senator Feinstein and I have worked \ntogether on legislation aimed at making it easier to prosecute people \ntrying to enter the U.S. with fraudulent documents.\n  One of the most dangerous document security issues we face is how to \nkeep passports and visas out of the hands of the people we don't want \nto have them.\n  As a 2004 U.S. News and World Report article rightly stated, ``When \nit comes to terrorists' most valuable weapons, passports and visas \nprobably rank higher than bullets and bombs.'' A 2004 study done by the \nDepartment of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General titled ``A \nReview of the Use of Stolen Passports From Visa Waiver Countries to \nEnter the United States,'' found that ``[there are] over 10 million \nlost or stolen passports that might be in circulation.'' As background \nfor the report, the Forensics Documents Laboratory informed the Office \nof the Inspector General that ``criminals consider a passport'' from a \nVisa Waiver Country ``a very valuable commodity.''\n  To keep out terrorists and others we do not want to allow into the \nUnited States, we must be able to identify and effectively prosecute \npeople who lie or give us fraudulent information to obtain a U.S. visa \nor a passport.\n  Additionally, we must be able to identify and effectively prosecute \npeople trying to enter the U.S. with a passport or visa that belongs to \nsomeone else.\n  Perhaps most importantly, we must effectively prosecute those \npossessing multiple passports and visas they intend to distribute to \nothers. We must be able to take these ``career'' document traffickers, \nthose caught with more than 10 fraudulent passports or visas, off the \nstreets.\n  Under current law, violators are not being prosecuted effectively \nbecause there is no statute that specifically makes trafficking in \nmultiple (10 or more) documents its own crime. This bill will add that \nnew crime--punishable by 20 years in jail--to the passport and visa \nfraud sections of the criminal code.\n  In addition to creating a new crime to penalize trafficking in 10 or \nmore fraudulent immigration documents, 20 year maximum sentence, Title \nI of the bill simplifies the language of several of the current \npassport fraud provisions of the criminal code and changes the maximum \npenalties for these offenses from 10 years for the first offense and 15 \nyears for subsequent offenses, to simply 15 years for each offense.\n  The bill also includes a new protection for immigrants. Anyone who \nengages in a scheme to defraud them in connection with matters under \nFederal immigration law, or who pretends to be an immigration lawyer, \nwill be charged under a new crime that carries a maximum penalty of 15 \nyears. Although this provision is not strictly related to passport \nfraud, it will protect immigrants from sham attorneys and legal \n``experts'' who cheat them out of their money by pretending to offer \nthem immigration benefits or legitimate documents.\n  Many of the bill's provisions simply clean up sections of the \ncriminal code. For example--one section modifies the alternative \nsentencing penalties to make sure the penalties for severe passport \nfraud offenses (such as those used to facilitate a drug trafficking \ncrime or an act of international terrorism) are consistent throughout \nthe code.\n  Other provisions codify common law principles needed for effective \nprosecution of document fraud offenses. For example--one section makes \nneeded clarifications on venue. Currently, false statements or \ndocuments are often included in the application which is mailed from \none location but processed in another location. This section makes \nclear that the offense is perpetrated both at the location of the \nmailing and at the location of the adjudication. If the application \ncontaining false statements is prepared overseas, this section \nclarifies that the offense is still punishable in the United States.\n  In March of 2004, Mark Zuckerman, Assistant U.S. Attorney for New \nHampshire, testified before the United States Sentencing Commission. \nNew Hampshire's National Passport Center processed 2 million of the 7 \nmillion passports issued in 2003. The National Passport Center also \nreceives nearly all of the applications for passport renewals filed \nwith the State Department. New Hampshire conducted a passport fraud \ninitiative in its U.S. Attorney's Office as part of its anti-terrorism \neffort. Zuckerman's testimony provides some insight into the problems \nthat arose during the initiative.\n  Though the passport applications were processed in New Hampshire, \ncases of passport fraud resulting from those applications were not \nbeing handled in New Hampshire. Typically, they were sent back to the \ndistrict from which they were mailed. Once returned, they were often \ndeclined for prosecution by their local U.S. Attorney's office.\n  One of the reasons frequently given by the regional U.S. Attorney's \nOffices for declining passport fraud cases was: ``The sentencing \nguidelines do not treat passport fraud as a serious offense for which a \nperiod of incarceration is likely.''\n  I would reiterate what Mr. Zuckerman so astutely pointed out in his \ntestimony. Under the current Criminal Code, the most common forms of \npassport fraud--unless they constitute terrorism or drug trafficking--\nare just class C felonies. When the defendant has no criminal history, \nthe court is simply required to incarcerate the defendant for 0-6 \nmonths. This is the lowest and least consequential sentencing range \nthat can be assigned to any felony under the U.S.\n\n[[Page S464]]\n\nCode. (page 5 of Zuckerman's testimony)\n  The 9/11 Commission also recognized the lack of routine prosecutions \nfor passport fraud offenses. Page 386 of their report noted:\n\n       Fraudulent travel documents, for instance, are usually \n     returned to travelers who are denied entry without further \n     examination for terrorist trademarks, investigation into \n     their source, or legal process.\n\n  Importantly, the bill we are introducing today directs the Sentencing \nCommission to reevaluate the current low sentencing guidelines for \npassport and visa fraud offenses to reflect the potential seriousness \nof these crimes and the changes made by our bill.\n  Additionally, we will require the Sentencing Commission to report \nback to the Congress on the rationale behind their decision to change \n(or not change) the sentencing guidelines as a result of this \ndirection.\n  Majority Leader Harry Reid has repeatedly stated that one of the \nitems at the top of the Democratic agenda early this Congress is the \nimplementation of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. In \naddition to their comments on the lack of prosecutions, the 9/11 \nCommission had a lot more say about the use of fraudulent and altered \npassports and visas in the Commission of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\n  ``[W]e endeavor to dispel the myth that their [the hijackers'] entry \ninto the United States was `clean and legal'. It was not. . . . two \n[hijackers] carried passports manipulated in a fraudulent manner. It is \nlikely that several more hijackers carried passports with similar \nfraudulent manipulation. Two hijackers lied on their visa \napplications'' Preface, 9/11 Commission staff report.\n  ``To avoid detection of their activities and objectives while \nengaging in travel that necessitates using a passport, terrorists \ndevote extensive resources to acquiring and manipulating passports, \nentry and exits stamps, and visas. The al Qaeda terrorist organization \nwas no exception. High-level members of Al Qaeda were expert document \nforgers . . .'' Page 1. 9/11 Commission staff report.\n  ``Travel history, however, is still recorded in passports with entry-\nexit stamps called cachets, which al Qaeda has trained its operatives \nto forge and use to conceal their terrorist activities''. Page 403, 9/\n11 Commission report.\n  ``[C]ertain al Qaeda members were charged with organizing passport \ncollection schemes to keep the pipelines of fraudulent documents \nflowing.'' Page 186., ibid\n  ``For terrorists, travel documents are as important as weapons. They \nmust travel clandestinely to meet, train, plan, case targets, and gain \naccess to attack . . . In their travels, terrorists use evasive \nmeasures, such as altered and counterfeit passports and visas . . .'' \nPage 384. ibid.\n  I hope that Senator Reid plans to include the Feinstein/Sessions \nPassport and Visa Fraud Bill in his 9/11 Commission Recommendations \nImplementation Package.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/11/senate-section/article/S464-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 23--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF FEBRUARY 5 THROUGH \n        FEBRUARY 9, 2007, AS ``NATIONAL SCHOOL COUNSELING WEEK''\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, I rise today with my good friend from \nMaine, Senator Collins, to submit a Resolution Marking January as \nNational Stalking Awareness Month. I introduce today's measure because \nI want to renew our Nation's resolve to fight stalking and to promote \npublic awareness about the newest stalking tool, technology.\n  Imagine that you are a young wife--estranged from your husband. A \ncourt has ordered him to stay away from you, but he shows up everywhere \nyou go. You see him while driving on the road, in the parking lot at \nwork, at a nearby table in restaurants, and at your friends' homes. \nAlthough you haven't spoken to him in months, he always knows exactly \nwhere you are.\n  Last year, the Seattle police received such a report from Sherri \nPeak, whose estranged husband seemed to know her every move. Detectives \nbelieved that Robert Peak was stalking his wife, and they brought \nSherri's car into the city shop to scan for tracking devices. After \nseveral hours of futile searching, one officer popped off the dashboard \ncover and spotted a global positioning system (GPS) and a cell phone \nembedded in the car. Then police checked the victim's home computer and \nfound spyware that allowed her husband to hack into her e-mail. Sherri \nPeak was indeed being stalked--via technology.\n  The Peak case illustrates a disturbing criminal trend and the dark \nside of technology. The devices we use to surf the Internet, e-mail one \nanother, download music, and find our way in unfamiliar towns have also \nequipped stalkers with powerful tools. While ``conventional'' stalkers \nfollow a victim from home to work or place countless phone calls to \ntheir homes, technology-empowered stalkers use GPS to track victims and \ncomputer programs to trace every Web site victims visit and every e-\nmail they send or receive. Stalkers can harass or threaten their \nvictims (or urge others to do so) via e-mail or Web sites set up to \nharm the victim.\n  The potential impact of these tactics is staggering. National \nstatistics show that 1 in 12 women and 1 in 45 men will be stalked \nduring their lifetime. The average duration of stalking is 2 years, and \nmore often than not it is accompanied by physical violence. In one \nstudy, 3 of 4 women murdered by their intimate partners had been \nstalked by that partner before they were killed.\n  Although all 50 States and the Federal Government have stalking laws, \nmany were drafted before the widespread use of e-mail, the Internet, \nchat rooms, Web sites, social networking sites, GPS, cell phones, and \ntiny hand-\n\n[[Page S465]]\n\nheld video and digital cameras. Last year Congress tightened the \nFederal stalking law to take into account these potential stalking \ntools and techniques. Although some States are following suit, I urge \nstate legislators to continually assess the power of their stalking \nlaws to prohibit and appropriately punish acts of stalking with current \nor even future technology.\n  January is National Stalking Awareness Month--the perfect opportunity \nfor parents, lawmakers and community leaders to carefully review State \nand local laws on stalking and insist that laws keep pace with \ntechnology and protect our families. Valuable information on stalking \ncan be found at the Stalking Resource Center (www.ncvc.org/src). We are \nindebted to the Center's expertise and leadership on this issue. For \nimmediate and confidential assistance, I also urge people to contact \nthe National Crime Victim Helpline at 1-800-FYI-CALL.\n  I often watch my grandchildren learn with ever more speed to deftly \nmanipulate technology, everything from making digital movies, \ndownloading music, to surfing the Internet. It is clearly a brave, new \nworld. And one that each of us should embrace, learn and celebrate. But \nwith new rights, always come new responsibilities. Through vigilance, \nboth citizens and officials can combat stalking via technology. Just as \nparents and teens are starting to learn how to protect their privacy \nwhile on-line, we can all learn how to detect high-tech stalking and \nwhat to do if it occurs.\n  Before closing, I would like to thank Senator Collins for her \ncommitment to this issue; it is always a pleasure to work with her.\n\n                               S. Res. 24\n\n       Whereas an estimated 1,006,970 women and 370,990 men are \n     stalked annually in the United States and, in the majority of \n     such cases, the person is stalked by someone who is not a \n     stranger;\n       Whereas 81 percent of women who are stalked by an intimate \n     partner are also physically assaulted by that partner, and 76 \n     percent of women who are killed by an intimate partner were \n     also stalked by that intimate partner;\n       Whereas 26 percent of stalking victims lose time from work \n     as a result of their victimization, and 7 percent never \n     return to work;\n       Whereas stalking victims are forced to take drastic \n     measures to protect themselves, such as relocating, changing \n     their addresses, changing their identities, changing jobs, \n     and obtaining protection orders;\n       Whereas stalking is a crime that cuts across race, culture, \n     gender, age, sexual orientation, physical and mental ability, \n     and economic status;\n       Whereas stalking is a crime under Federal law and under the \n     laws of all 50 States and the District of Columbia;\n       Whereas rapid advancements in technology have made cyber-\n     surveillance the new frontier in stalking;\n       Whereas there are national organizations, local victim \n     service organizations, prosecutors' offices, and police \n     departments that stand ready to assist stalking victims and \n     who are working diligently to craft competent, thorough, and \n     innovative responses to stalking; and\n       Whereas there is a need to enhance the criminal justice \n     system's response to stalking, including through aggressive \n     investigation and prosecution: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate designates January 2007 as ``National \n     Stalking Awareness Month'';\n       (2) it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (A) National Stalking Awareness Month provides an \n     opportunity to educate the people of the United States about \n     stalking;\n       (B) the people of the United States should applaud the \n     efforts of the many victim service providers, such as police, \n     prosecutors, national and community organizations, and \n     private sector supporters, for their efforts in promoting \n     awareness about stalking; and\n       (C) policymakers, criminal justice officials, victim \n     service and human service agencies, nonprofit organizations, \n     and others should recognize the need to increase awareness of \n     stalking and availability of services for stalking victims; \n     and\n       (3) the Senate urges national and community organizations, \n     businesses, and the media to promote, through observation of \n     National Stalking Awareness Month, awareness of the crime of \n     stalking.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/11/senate-section/article/S465-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 25--CONGRATULATING THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA FOOTBALL \n  TEAM FOR WINNING THE 2006 NATIONAL COLLEGIATE ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION \n                    DIVISION I FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida (for himself and Mr. Martinez) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.
