Mr. President, what is the business now?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the House message to accompany H.R. \n3221.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are in the splendor of this beautiful \nSenate Chamber. We have all had a good night's rest. But around America \ntoday, there are people in the West who are just awakening and people \nin the East have been awake for a while. But a lot of those people have \nhad bad nights; they are in danger of losing their homes. They don't \nknow what to do. They realize other homes have gone to foreclosure and \nthe neighborhood is going down. They can see it, and it has put a pall \nover the economic viability of our country. That is what this \nlegislation is all about.\n  Those people will benefit from what was done in the Senate yesterday, \nand we will, I believe, sometime early next week, pass this bill. It is \ngoing to be a tremendous help to those people around America who are \nsuffering as a result of this housing crisis, and they are suffering.\n  Sometimes we don't recognize what we need to do and what we have \ndone. I feel it is extremely important to spread on the record--I have \ntried to do this the last few days--that the work done by the chairman \nof the committee, Senator Dodd, the ranking member, Senator Shelby, is \nexemplary work, bipartisan work. Recognizing the slim majority we \nDemocrats have in the Senate, 51 to 49, anything we do is going to be \nclose, people are going to have to give up some of their ideas as to a \nperfect world and recognize that sometimes we have to compromise. That \nis what legislation is all about.\n  I admire and appreciate the work that was done by the entire Senate \nyesterday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/20/senate-section/article/S5921-7", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5921-S5928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nAMERICAN HOUSING RESCUE AND FORECLOSURE PREVENTION ACT OF 2008--Resumed\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n\n\n                          High Gasoline Prices\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there is no doubt that the subprime \nmortgage crisis is a timely and important issue, and it is a worthy \ntopic for the Senate to have taken up. There is also little doubt that \nthe single most important issue facing Americans at the moment is the \nhigh price of gasoline at the pump.\n  Indeed, it would be difficult to find a single American who has \nescaped the painful effects of the recent record spike in gas prices \nand who is not eager for Congress to do something about it. That is why \nI was so concerned to hear the Democratic nominee for President say \nlast week he was not as concerned about high gas prices as he was about \nthe fact that they rose so quickly. He would have preferred a ``gradual \nadjustment,'' as he put it, to the sudden shock we all got.\n  More concerning, not a single Democrat in the Senate has come forward \nto distance himself or herself publicly from his words.\n  The message of the junior Senator from Illinois was clear: High gas \nprices don't concern him as much as they concern most people. By \nallowing his comments to stand, congressional Democrats are being \nequally clear they agree with him.\n  The fact is, on the issue of lowering gas prices, congressional \nDemocrats have had very little to say. There is a commonsense response \nand that is to increase supply at home in a limited, environmentally \nresponsible way.\n  America floats on top of an ocean of untapped oil reserves three \ntimes the size of Saudi Arabia's. As an immediate response to high gas \nprices, common sense dictates we should be moving immediately to \nincrease our own massive domestic supplies and add American jobs in the \nprocess. In the short term, there is only one answer to high gas \nprices, and that is more American energy now.\n  Looking ahead, there is no doubt something needs to be done about \ndemand. But while congressional Republicans have a solution to the \nproblem, our friends on the other side have shown a stubborn \nunwillingness over the years to do much at all about increasing \ndomestic supply, and the result of yesterday's inaction is the strain \nAmerican families are feeling today in the form of record-high gas \nprices.\n  By failing to address supply, even with gas prices at $4 a gallon, \ncongressional Democrats are telling the American people $4-a-gallon \ngasoline is acceptable, that they should get used to it. Kentuckians \nare not interested in getting used to $4-a-gallon gas and neither am I.\n  Congress has the power to do something about high gas prices, and we \nshould. Americans are looking to Washington for action. What they are \ngetting instead from Democrats in Congress is a lecture on ``gradual \nadjustments.'' Americans do not need a lecture; they need relief.\n  While Americans grow increasingly frustrated with gas prices, \nDemocrats in the House of Representatives are showing where their \npriorities lie. Among other legislative business this week, they \nscheduled a vote on whether to ban the interstate sale of monkeys. \nHouse Democrats also recently took up resolutions commemorating \nNational Plumbing Industry Week and the International Year of \nSanitation. These resolutions are important, no doubt, to some. Yet \nnone of them will do anything to lower gas prices.\n  Americans frustrated about high gas prices are wondering why \nDemocrats in Congress are talking about monkey trade, and I don't blame \nthem. It is time Democrats took the issue of high gas prices as \nseriously as the American people do. It is time Democrats in Congress \njoin with the Republicans and get serious about lowering $4-a-gallon \ngas and lessening our reliance on Middle Eastern oil.\n\n\n    Unanimous-Consent Request--Federal Election Commission Nominees\n\n  Mr. President, I have indicated to my good friend, the majority \nleader, it was my intention to ask consent that we go ahead and confirm \nthe FEC nominees. This agency has been essentially dysfunctional for \nmost of the year because of disputes over the membership. I have given \nhim notice that I would like to do that. I did not wish to surprise \nhim.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that today, at a time to be \ndetermined by the two leaders, the Senate proceed to executive session \nunder the following order: that the Senate begin consideration, en \nbloc, of the following Federal Election Commission nominations: \nCalendar No. 306, Steven T. Walther; Calendar No. 624, Cynthia L. \nBauerly; Calendar No. 625, Caroline C. Hunter; Calendar No. 626, Donald \nF. McGahn; and the nomination of Matthew S. Petersen, PN1765, which is \nto be discharged from the Rules Committee; provided further, that there \nbe 1 hour of total debate on the nominations, en bloc, with the time \ndivided equally between the chairman and the ranking member of the \nRules Committee. I further ask unanimous consent that at the expiration \nor yielding back of time, the nominations be confirmed, en bloc, the \nmotions to reconsider be laid upon the table, the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action, and, finally, the Senate \nreturn to legislative session.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we are very \nclose to being able to accept this. I think the consent agreement is \nappropriate. I think the times laid out are what we need. But I have a \nSenator who still has one more conversation with one of the nominees. \nHe has been diligent. He has met with almost every one of them. He has \none more. That person is in Europe now, and he has agreed to do that by \ntelephone. So, in the next couple days, he will do that.\n  I have every belief that very early next week we should be able to \ncomplete these nominations. A number of these people have been very \npatient. They have been hanging on, basically living off their savings \nor their wife's work, whatever the case might be, but they have not \nbeen working because, as the Republican leader said, it has been \nnonfunctional, they have been out of work.\n  I think we can get this done very quickly. It is very important. It \nis important for Democrats and Republicans. We need a body there that \nquestions can be submitted to, especially in the midst of this \nPresidential election and all the other elections going on around the \ncountry.\n  Based on what I have said, Mr. President, I object.\n\n[[Page S5923]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to hear the majority \nleader shares my concern that we do not have a fully functioning \nFederal Election Commission. In fact, yesterday, the Democratic nominee \nfor President called the system broken. Today is another example of the \nbroken system.\n  This battle has been going on for more than 2 years, believe it or \nnot, starting with the recess appointment of very well-qualified and \nwell-respected experts in this field. The three recess appointments \nexpired at the first of this year, and two nominees have ultimately \nwithdrawn, citing the need for gainful employment, both well qualified, \nbut one, having been unfairly and falsely maligned, ended up \nwithdrawing.\n  So here we are today, after an April 29 commitment by the majority, \nthat a review of new nominees would be simple and a commitment to \nspeedy review. I know that is what the majority leader hoped to \naccomplish but, in fact, here we are still.\n  Let me be perfectly clear, we have gone out of our way, willing to \nconfirm nominees who many on our side believe are completely misguided \non the matter they would be regulating. But in the interest of \nobtaining a fully functioning FEC, it has always been my belief that \nthe Democrats pick their nominees and we pick ours. I can't recall ever \nhaving made a Democratic nominee for the Federal Election Commission \n``controversial,'' but that seems not to be the case when Republicans \npick nominees. They are frequently demonized and declared unqualified.\n\n  Nevertheless, we are where we are, and hopefully we can get this done \nas rapidly as possible. There always seems to be a snag, and the snags \nalways seem to be on the other side. I know this is something the \nmajority leader is not happy about. He has just indicated he wants to \nmove forward, and it is my hope we can get this done as rapidly as \npossible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan article citing the Democratic National Committee's intent to file \nyet another frivolous lawsuit next Tuesday--one that was dismissed once \nbefore--against the FEC, citing their failure to act on a matter \nrelated to Senator McCain.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the only way the DNC can maintain this \nsuit is if there is a nonfunctioning FEC. Thus, in order for the DNC's \nalready failed lawsuit to go forward, this package must be objected to, \nand they have done just that.\n  I hope this continued delay of getting a fully constituted FEC is not \nrelated to the fact that the DNC is trying to, we think, file a lawsuit \non Monday. Those are the kinds of shenanigans which I don't think we \nought to export from the campaign to the Senate. In the Senate, it \nstrikes me we have an obligation to get this Federal Election \nCommission reconstituted and functioning, not to try to give one \nparty's national committee or another some kind of advantage in a \npending lawsuit.\n  So I am encouraged by the majority leader's desire to get these \nnominations completed. I know we are not having votes Monday, but we \nare in Monday. It strikes me that Monday would be a very good time to \nget these nominees confirmed, if, in fact, we can't do it later today \nif the snag the majority leader indicated could be cleared up. I know, \nbecause he has just said, he shares my view that we ought to get this \njob done, and I think the best time to do it would be today. The second \nbest time to do it would be shortly after we convene on Monday.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n           DNC TO AGAIN FILE SUIT ON MC CAIN'S MATCHING FUNDS\n\n                   (By Jonathan Martin) June 17, 2008\n\n       The DNC will today announce that they intend to file a \n     lawsuit next week in U.S. District Court to spur an FEC \n     inquiry over whether John McCain illegally withdrew from the \n     federal financing system.\n       The committee first issued a complaint to the FEC in \n     February, but in April a federal judge ruled that, even \n     though the FEC lacked a quorum, they still could convene \n     before the end of the 120 days they're given to examine \n     complaints.\n       Now, with those 120 days expiring on June 24th, the DNC is \n     acting again in hopes a judge will compel the FEC to act on \n     their complaint, as is allowed by law.\n       At issue is whether McCain locked himself into spending \n     limits in the primary by putting up anticipated matching \n     funds as collateral for the loan that helped keep his \n     underfunded campaign alive at the end of 2007.\n       Democrats hope to puncture a hole in McCain's good \n     government image by pressing the issue while Republicans \n     dismiss it as totally groundless.\n       First, though, the FEC needs to have sufficient members to \n     form a quorum. With one nominee having withdrawn from \n     consideration last month, the Senate appears to be finally \n     ready to confirm additional commissioners in the next few \n     weeks.\n\n\n                       Honoring Our Armed Forces\n\n                     Lance Corporal Justin D. Sims\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a young man \nfrom my home, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, who gave his life in the \nperformance of his duty as a U.S. marine. On April 15, 2006, an \nimprovised explosive device detonated under LCpl Justin Sims's humvee \nas he patrolled Al Anbar Province in Iraq. The Covington, KY, native \nwas 22 years old.\n  For his valor in uniform, Lance Corporal Sims received several \nawards, medals, and decorations, including the Sea Service Deployment \nRibbon, the National Defense Service Medal, and the Purple Heart.\n  At a young age, Lance Corporal Sims had found what many Americans \ntwice his age are still searching for: his life's calling. Justin's \nfamily members agree that even as a child, he aspired to serve his \ncountry in uniform.\n  His mother Alma Sims commented that:\n\n       On 9/11, he was a junior in high school. He said, ``I'd go \n     now if they would take me.'' You would think he was bred to \n     be a Marine. From 4 and 5 years old, his favorite movie was \n     Tour of Duty. The Marines was all he talked about.\n\n  Perhaps Justin was influenced by his grandfather Coleman Luster, an \nArmy veteran. Justin admired his grandfather's service, if not \nnecessarily how he chose to serve.\n  Alma remembers:\n\n       Papaw and Justin would joke around. Justin would say, \n     ``Army was the best thing back then, but the Marines rule \n     now.'' Justin looked up to Papaw. They were real close. My \n     dad would always tease me, ``You did great raising your boy. \n     Let's see how these girls go.''\n\n  These girls were Justin's four sisters, all younger than he was. \nJustin was a kind and caring older brother, and with Alma being a \nsingle parent, he made sure to spend a lot of time with his sisters to \nmake things easier for his mother.\n  Alma said:\n\n       He would take my four girls to school each day whenever I \n     had to go to work early. I told him, ``You don't need to do \n     that because I have a sitter.'' But he insisted on taking \n     care of them. You would think that him being 11 years older, \n     he wouldn't want anything to do with them. It was just the \n     opposite. If there was snow on the ground, he would take all \n     the girls out sledding. There was no hill too large for him.\n\n  Justin started ROTC in the eighth grade and participated at Holmes \nHigh School. He was a marksman with State honors for his ROTC rifle \nunit and participated in sharpshooting competitions all over the \ncountry. Neighbors recall seeing young Justin practicing how to twirl \nhis rifle in front of his house. Once he tried to teach one of his \nsisters, then only 8 years old, how to twirl the rifle. She ended up \nwith a big dent on her forehead.\n  Alma says:\n\n       We still laugh about that today because they told me she \n     had fallen.\n\n  Justin graduated from Holmes High School in 2003 and later that year \nenlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps. He was eventually assigned to the \n3rd Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Division, II Marine \nExpeditionary Force, based out of Camp Lejeune, NC.\n  Before he left, however, while still in his senior year at Holmes, \nJustin worked after school at a restaurant.\n  There, he met a young woman named Leah, who only worked at the same \nrestaurant for a week but kept hanging around to see her friends.\n  Alma recalls:\n\n       He started flirting with her, then told her he was going to \n     ask her out.\n\n  Justin Sims and Leah Matt-Sims were married on December 26, 2004, \nafter changing the date a few times because of Justin's uncertain \ndeployment schedule. The happy couple found time\n\n[[Page S5924]]\n\nto honeymoon in Kentucky before Justin returned to Camp Lejeune.\n  Alma recalls:\n\n       When he came back from his first tour, I said, ``How many \n     people do you know can say, `I have protected the United \n     States'?'' He would say, ``And I do it with pride.'' He \n     considered it an honor to be a Marine and to serve his \n     country.\n\n  As a marine, Justin would periodically return to Holmes High School \nand speak to students in the ROTC Program. He deployed for his second \ntour of duty, this time in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, in March \n2006.\n  Alma said:\n\n       I told him before he left for his last tour, ``I have a bad \n     feeling.'' He said, ``If something would happen to one of my \n     brothers, I would never forgive myself. It would drive me \n     crazy for the rest of my life.''\n\n  At a memorial service for Justin held at Holmes High School in \nCovington, the mayor announced that on that July 4th, the city would \ndedicate the Justin Sims Memorial Park. It is the same park where Alma \nand her daughters would go every Sunday and write letters to Justin \nwhen he was at boot camp.\n  Our prayers are for the Sims family today after the loss of this \ndedicated marine. We are thinking of his wife Leah; his mother Alma; \nhis father Beechie; his stepmother, Linda Gregory; his sisters Tia \nBryars, Briana Bryars, Tiffani Sims, and Maliesa Jones; his \ngrandmother, Mae Luster; and many other beloved family members and \nfriends. Justin was predeceased by his grandfather, Coleman Luster.\n  Mr. President, Justin's mother Alma tells us:\n\n       I miss talking to him every day, but I believe God has a \n     bigger job for him in heaven.\n\n  Those who knew Justin, whether as an ambitious boy in Covington or a \ndedicated warrior in Iraq, would surely agree. I want the Sims family \nto also know that this Senate celebrates the life of LCpl Justin D. \nSims, and we honor his sacrifice on behalf of our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish to respond to a couple of issues.\n  First, on the Federal Election Commission, I wish to underscore that \nwe would have a functioning Federal Election Commission today if the \nRepublicans had accepted our offer before Memorial Day. What was that \noffer? There was one that was held over, but we agreed to confirm the \nfour FEC nominations before Memorial Day. The Republicans objected \nbecause they weren't ready with their new nominee. We offered assurance \nthat the new nominee would be taken care of very quickly, and we have \nfollowed through on that. They rejected our offer. They wanted to wait \nuntil the new nominee came. We waited. Nevertheless, when the new \nnominee came, we waived a hearing on a markup. And the reason we did \nthat is that it was what we said we would do, even though they turned \ndown a functioning Federal Election Commission--the Republicans. We \nsaid: OK, if that is what you want, a full FEC rather than those five, \nthat is fine. We will go along with that. Now we have a Senator, Mr. \nPresident--which I think is very appropriate--wanting to talk to those \nnominees, and he has done that. There is one to go. That person is in \nEurope, and he will do that just as quickly as he can.\n  Again, I underscore the fact that we would have a fully functioning \nFederal Election Commission today if the Republicans had accepted our \noffer before Memorial Day. But we are where we are. We can do a lot of \nfinger-pointing, but we are where we are.\n  We believe in the Federal Election Commission. I wish it were more \npowerful than it is. I wish it could do more than it does. But \ncertainly we should do everything we can to give them the tools they \nneed to function, and one of the things they need to function is \nmembers for the Federal Election Commission. Right now, there aren't \nany.\n  As I said, we will work very hard. I have talked to the Senator this \nmorning to make sure that is the only problem he had, and he has said \nthat is the only problem he has. With the time difference, it has been \nsomewhat difficult to set up the phone call within the last 24 hours, \nbut that will be done.\n  So, Mr. President, the Federal Election Commission will be taken care \nof within a matter of days, but the fact that it is not functioning now \nis not our fault.\n  Let me just say a couple of things about the comments regarding \nSenator Obama by my friend, the Republican leader.\n  It seems there is a lot of effort being made to divert the focus from \nthe issues at hand. The issue at hand is that we offered on this floor \na bill that would do something about gas prices. We have focused on the \nsubsidies to big oil. And the subsidies are huge, costing the American \npeople billions of dollars. We have focused on the fact that there is a \nbipartisan move in this body to do something about OPEC. That focus was \nbrought by Senator Kohl of Wisconsin and Senator Specter of \nPennsylvania. They believe very strongly that OPEC should be subject to \nthe antitrust laws of this country. That is part of our legislation. We \nalso said there should be a windfall profits tax, and we believe there \nshould be something done with the speculation that is taking place. So \nwe offered legislation to that effect, and the Republicans turned down \neven being able to debate that legislation.\n  In addition, we have now pending an issue that is extremely \nimportant. I think it is in the top one, two, or three issues facing \nAmerica today; that is, renewable energy. Renewable energy. We have \noffered a reasonable piece of legislation to give a 6-year tax credit \nto solar--and there are other issues in that legislation--that will \nradically change how we gather our energy. We are told that there are \nhundreds of thousands--not thousands or tens of thousands but hundreds \nof thousands--of jobs waiting to be funded. If this bill passed, that \nwould take place forthwith. Would all 100,000 go to work today? No. But \nthousands of them would go to work within a matter of a month or two, \nand it would keep building.\n  We have before this body, as part of the record, about 400 companies \nthat have signed on to our legislation. Virtually all the Fortune 500 \ncompanies--Fortune 400, whatever it is--have signed on to this and say \nthis is the way to go.\n  What is the holdup of our legislation? It is the Republicans. What is \nthe holdup, Mr. President? They have become addicted to red ink. It is \nas if they are addicted to one of the illegal drugs, but this is red \nink. They are addicted to it.\n  When President Bush took office, the price of gasoline was $1.46 a \ngallon. Now, in Las Vegas, it is $4.47 a gallon. The average around the \ncountry is approaching $4.10 a gallon.\n  The problem with our legislation, according to the Republicans, is \nthat we want to pay for it. Oh, gee whiz. You mean we don't want to \nborrow more money to do something? No, we want to pay for it.\n  When President Bush took office, not only was the price of gasoline \nat $1.46 a gallon, but there was a surplus over the next 10 years of \nabout $7 trillion. We are now approaching $10 trillion in debt this \ncountry owes.\n\n  The so-called pay-fors for renewables on these tax extenders are--for \nexample, we all know the abuses, what these companies have done \noffshore. There is one little island over there where there are 50,000 \ncompanies that are cheating the Federal Government, in my opinion. What \nwe have done is said, OK, the hedge fund operators should not be able \nto use that as a way to hide their money and not pay taxes. Listen to \nthis: The hedge fund operators agree. They say it is unfair: We agree \nwith what the Democrats are trying to do, to pay for these renewables.\n  We have tried and will continue to try to focus attention on the fact \nthat we have long-term needs and short-term needs because energy is a \nproblem.\n  Let's talk about offshore. I was fortunate last night--I got home \nbefore 9 o'clock. As I was eating my little bowl of soup before going \nto bed, there was a wonderful program on television about offshore \ndrilling. They had a map. On that map they showed all the places people \nand companies can drill right now, some 58 million acres. That is a lot \nof acres, 58 million acres. But they are not drilling there. They have \nmade a decision not to drill. Not because there is no oil there, they \nhave made a business judgment not to drill.\n  I would say this about the offshore: Our great country is so \nfortunate to\n\n[[Page S5925]]\n\nhave all the natural resources that we do have, but one of the natural \nresources we do not have is oil. Counting ANWR and all the offshore \npotential, we have about 3 percent of the oil reserves in the world; 97 \npercent of the oil is someplace else. We cannot produce our way out of \nour problems. Can we do a better job of producing? Yes, I believe we \ncan. We can get more out of that percentage.\n  Let's talk about offshore a little more. The President of the United \nStates came out 2 days ago saying: I want Congress to do something \nabout offshore drilling. Listen to that. With the sign of a pen he can \ndo something about it himself. President Clinton, with an Executive \norder, took certain areas offshore so that we couldn't drill there. \nPresident Clinton did that. President Bush has the ability himself to \nchange that with a signature. But he didn't do that, did he? No, \nbecause he worried about Jeb Bush, his brother, who is totally against \noffshore drilling. Why wouldn't he do this himself? Why would he pass \nthe buck to us?\n  I realize Congress controls the ability to take care of a lot of the \noffshore stuff, as we did last year, allowing drilling on the gulf \ncoast, offshore. We expanded that because we thought it was the right \nthing to do. President Bush and Republicans need not lecture us on \nenergy. They are the ones who got us into the problem we have now.\n  I close by saying that John McCain is a person who is an expert on \noffshore drilling. Why? Because he has taken both positions. He said, \nuntil 2 days ago, we should not be able to drill offshore, and he \nswitched his position--the ultimate flip-flop. The next thing I am \nwaiting for him to do is--right now, the election in Alaska is tied \nbetween McCain and Obama. One of the big reasons is John McCain is \nopposed to drilling in ANWR. I guess the people of Alaska expect \nDemocrats to be opposed to it, but they don't expect Republicans to be \nopposed to it, and McCain has been for a long time. Is he going to do \none of his flip-flops on ANWR? Don't be surprised.\n  John McCain doesn't have the temperament to be President. He is wrong \non the war, and he is wrong on the economy.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I would inquire as to what is the \ncurrent business before the Senate?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The motion to concur in the House \namendment is the current business.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to temporarily \nset aside the pending amendment so that I may call up amendment No. \n5008, which is filed at the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nobject, I want to explain to my colleagues who may come over, who are \ndesirous of bringing up amendments also, Senator Sanders has expressed \na strong desire to have an amendment considered regarding LIHEAP, the \nLow-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. There is some difficulty \nwith that. Obviously, there is some objection on the other side to that \ncoming up.\n  Out of respect to Senator Sanders, who could not be here this \nmorning, I object to any effort to set aside the pending amendments \nbefore that matter is resolved.\n  I say that respectfully to the Senator from Georgia, as well as \nothers who may come here to do exactly that. We will be moving forward \non legislation. Today we will entertain debate and discussion on this \nbill but will be constrained from going forward in the absence of a \nlarger agreement that would allow Senator Sanders to bring up his \namendment. So I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, if I might respond quickly, it is \nunfortunate we are in this situation. I commend the chairman, as well \nas the ranking member, for coming up with a pretty good piece of \nlegislation to address a critical issue. It is unfortunate because we \nare not allowed to move ahead with amendments, that we are stuck in \nthis quagmire.\n  I know it is not the desire of the chairman to do anything other than \nmove forward with amendments, amendments that are germane to the \nparticular bill. Unfortunately, the amendment of the Senator is not \ngermane to the pending business before the Senate. My amendment is. I \nthink there are others who have amendments they want to bring up.\n  I know it is not the fault of the chairman we are not allowed to move \nforward, but I certainly hope that by the time we get back next week we \ncan do so and take up amendments that are critically important to the \nissue at hand and that we can remove those amendments that are not \ngermane because it is a very critical piece of legislation.\n  It is a good bill, and my amendment is a good amendment. I hope we \nare able to address it shortly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Pennsylvania \nis recognized.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I wish to speak as in morning business. I \nask consent to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           world refugee day\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise today to recognize June 20 as \nWorld Refugee Day, a day designated by the United Nations General \nAssembly to highlight and celebrate the contribution of refugees \nthroughout the world. World Refugee Day has evolved into an annual \ncommemoration marked by a variety of events in over a hundred \ncountries, including in my home State of Pennsylvania.\n  I am proud to note that, since the mid-1970s, more than 100,000 \nrefugees from more than 30 nations have made Pennsylvania their home, \nenriching the cultural diversity and strengthening the economy of the \nCommonwealth. Over time, most have succeeded in adjusting to life in \nPennsylvania and the majority have naturalized as U.S. citizens and \nactively participate in local community life.\n  This day gives us an important opportunity to pause and appreciate \nthe grave humanitarian situation refugees face worldwide. Forced to \nflee their homes and having lost everything, these people have \nimmediate needs including shelter, food, safety, and protection. But \nthey also have basic human rights--the right to seek asylum, the right \nnot to be returned to a country where they fear persecution, the right \nto work, and the right to send their children safely to school.\n  Between 2001 and 2005, the international community witnessed a \ndecline in the number of refugees worldwide. Unfortunately, this trend \nhas reversed. By the end of 2007, there was a 115 percent increase over \njust 2 years in the number of refugees under the responsibility of the \nUnited Nations High Commission for Refugees--UNHCR. We are now talking \nabout a staggering 11.4 million refugees worldwide. The number of \ninternally displaced people worldwide is also up, from 24.4 million to \n26 million.\n  Among refugees, Afghans and Iraqis account for nearly half of all \nrefugees under UNHCR's care worldwide. Much of the increase in refugees \nin 2007 was a result of the volatile situation in Iraq. It has been 5 \nyears since the fall of Baghdad, and Iraq and her neighbors are in the \nmidst of a humanitarian crisis that threatens the stability of the \nMiddle East.\n  Wherever one stands on the future of the U.S. combat presence in \nIraq, we have a moral responsibility to those innocent Iraqis who have \nbeen driven from their homes and fear for their lives and their \nchildren's lives every day. Violence and sectarian conflict are an ever \npresent reality in Iraq, driving away anywhere from one to two thousand \nIraqis from their homes every day.\n  The numbers are sobering. One in five Iraqis have been displaced. The \nUNHCR estimates more than 4.7 million Iraqis have left their homes, \nmany in dire need of humanitarian care. Of these, more than 2.7 million \nIraqis are displaced internally, while more than 2 million have fled to \nneighboring states, particularly Syria and Jordan. In 2006, Iraqis \nbecame the leading nationality seeking asylum in Europe.\n  I witnessed firsthand the challenges facing Iraqi refugees last \nAugust when I spent time in Jordan meeting with United Nations and \nInternational Organization for Migration personnel. I can report that \nIraqi refugees throughout\n\n[[Page S5926]]\n\nthe region have become increasingly desperate and have nowhere to turn.\n  Since the beginning of the crisis, the Iraqi government has proven to \nbe unwilling and unable to respond to the needs of vulnerable Iraqis. \nWhile the government has access to significant oil revenue, it is \ndivided along sectarian lines and lacks both the institutional capacity \nand the political will to effectively address the growing crisis. \nSectarian militia groups like the Mahdi Army are quickly filling this \nvacuum to provide services. The largest ``humanitarian'' organization \nin Iraq today is the Sadrist movement affiliated with anti-American \nShiite cleric Muqtada al Sadr, whose programs provide shelter and food \nto hundreds of thousands of Shiites in Iraq.\n  The international community, including the United States, has been \nlargely in denial over the magnitude of the humanitarian crisis. Until \nrecently, the conversation was always dominated by talk of \nreconstruction and development rather than addressing the basic, urgent \nneeds of ordinary Iraqis. The United Nations only just issued a common \nhumanitarian appeal for Iraq.\n  Now, we here in the United States have a moral responsibility to do \nright by the millions of Iraqis who have been driven away from their \nhomes, particularly for those who have risked their lives to assist our \ncountry.\n  In 2007, Congress agreed to provide resettlement benefits for special \nimmigrants from Iraq and Afghanistan who helped the United States, \nhelped us, and to increase from 500 to 5,000 the number of special \nimmigrants from Iraq we will admit into this country. Both measures \npassed the Senate by unanimous votes.\n  The American people have responded with their customary generosity \nand caring spirit in welcoming these Iraqis into our Nation. I am proud \nto note that my home State of Pennsylvania has been a leader in helping \nto resettle our Iraqi allies. The city of Erie, PA, alone has resettled \nabout 90 Iraqis during this fiscal year. But the overall progress in \nresettling our courageous Iraqi allies has been frustratingly slow due \nto Government bureaucracy and logjams. Along with colleagues from the \nSenate and the House, I sent a letter to President Bush today \nquestioning the progress the administration is making on processing \nresettlement claims for Iraqis who have worked for us and whose lives \nhave been placed in great danger as a result of such service for us.\n  There is also the larger issue of dealing with the millions of Iraqi \nrefugees in the Middle East. Iraqi refugees are overwhelming the basic \ninfrastructure of Iraq's neighbors, especially Jordan, Syria, and \nLebanon, raising troubling concerns about the region's stability and \nshifting sectarian balances. As Refugee International notes, the Iraqi \nrefugee crisis is essentially exporting Iraq's instability to its \nneighbors.\n  Beyond the obvious humanitarian and moral dimensions, this crisis has \ngrave implications for our national security interests, our U.S. \nnational security interests, in the Middle East.\n  It is time for us to acknowledge the humanitarian crisis in Iraq that \nis spilling over into neighboring countries. We must firmly demonstrate \nour commitment to resettling Iraqi refugees and working with other \ngovernments in the Middle East and in Europe to provide humanitarian \nassistance and support.\n  The Iraqi Government must accept responsibility to care for all--\nall--of its citizens and the international assistance needed to improve \nits capacity to do so in a just manner.\n  Let me conclude by saying how impressed I am, as are all Americans, \nand I continue to be so impressed by our brave men and women who have \nserved in Iraq and Afghanistan and have returned home to advocate that \nmore be done to help Iraqis and those who are in Afghanistan who are at \nrisk, particularly those who have risked their lives in service to the \nUnited States of America. Let us in Congress follow their example and \nkeep fighting to help those in the world who are most in need. After \nall, that is the great legacy of this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n\n\n                 Extending Renewable Energy Tax Credits\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I plan to ask for unanimous consent in a \nmoment, but I would like to say a couple of words about what I am going \nto ask for.\n  We had a vote in the Senate on the renewable energy bill the last \ntime we had the housing debate. That vote was 88 to 8 in favor of the \nClean Energy Tax Stimulus amendment. This was the amendment that I \noffered with Senator Cantwell and others. It included extensions of tax \ncredits for solar, geothermal, fuel cells, wind, and many other forms \nof renewable energy. At a time when we are looking for more green \nenergy in the United States, it is the right thing to do. This body \nspoke very strongly with an 88-to-8 vote. We rarely ever have votes \nlike that around this place. I believe it is important for us to move \nforward with this important piece of legislation.\n  The Democrat majority has been attempting to deal with renewable \nenergy tax credits on other bills. While I appreciate those efforts, we \nhave to make sure this bill is actually signed into law. It was part of \nthe housing bill last time. I believe the housing bill has the best \nchance of any major piece of legislation to become law this year.\n  The bottom line is, do we want the renewable tax credits extended and \nsigned into law? I think this is the best vehicle we can possibly have \nto ensure that.\n  Right now, the Democrat majority has been bringing to the floor--as \nthey did a few days ago--extenders legislation that has many \nobjectionable items that the President said he would veto. All of the \ntax extenders, which both sides support, were coupled up with some very \nobjectionable items, including a $1.3 billion tax earmark. You know, we \nare talking about earmarks around this place; there is a $1.3 billion \ntax earmark in that bill. There are also other very objectionable \nspecial interest projects and tax increases that are in that bill. For \nthese reasons the President said he would veto it. These reasons are \nalso why the Republican minority has been objecting to what the \nDemocrats have been trying to do.\n  So I ask our colleagues, let's join together the way we did before in \nan 88-to-8 vote to extend the renewable tax credits. Let's bring more \ngreen energy to the United States. Let's bring more jobs to the United \nStates. This is good economic policy. It is also good energy policy. We \nhave already recognized that in the Senate. So let's join together \nagain on this amendment, and allow this amendment to be voted on so \nthat we can get this amendment signed into law this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent to temporarily set aside the pending \namendment so that I may call up amendment No. 5020 which is filed at \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, I will repeat what I said a \nmoment ago. Senator Sanders of Vermont is unavoidably absent this \nmorning. He has wanted to bring up the low-income energy assistance \nprogram. While it is not germane, it is relevant, obviously, to the \nsubject matter of the bill--home heating. But there is objection on the \nRepublican side for that amendment to be considered. As a result, he is \nobjecting to any unanimous consent request to lay aside the pending \namendment. So there is a reason that I will momentarily object.\n  Let me also say for clarity that the very provision the Senator from \nNevada has raised here, the renewable energy program, was part of the \nextender bill last week. Obviously, any bill like that is going to have \npieces you like and pieces you don't like. I have rarely seen a piece \nof legislation around here that had the unanimous support of everyone. \nNonetheless, we had an opportunity to deal with that piece of \nlegislation, and because we couldn't get cloture on it, that was \nrejected by the Republican minority. They did not want that bill to \ncome up, so we did not debate it at all. An opportunity to deal with \nthe very provision that enjoyed such broad-based support could have \nbeen part of that and gone down to the President for his signature.\n  So on this bill here, while I have supported this proposal--it was \npart of the earlier housing bill--until we resolve the matter dealing \nwith low-income energy assistance, then, at the request of the Senator \nfrom Vermont and the leadership here, I will object to any effort to \nset aside the pending amendments.\n\n[[Page S5927]]\n\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I am deeply disappointed. I think this is an important \npiece of legislation. I hope the Senator from Vermont, who is a \ncosponsor of the Clean Energy Tax Stimulus Act, will reconsider. There \nare serious objections to what he is trying to do, obviously, on this \nside. And I will say he does not have the kind of support that this \namendment enjoys. This amendment was supported by a vote of 88 to 8 in \nthe Senate. This is an amendment that should be allowed to go through. \nIt should remain part of this bill. We should put away the partisan \nsquabbling and get this bill done. I hope that while we are \nnegotiating, we can make sure this amendment becomes part of the final \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I wish to take a few minutes, if I may, \nand sort of review the events of yesterday, a historic day here in many \nways in that we were able to bring up a rather comprehensive housing \nproposal, thanks to the work of Senator Shelby, my colleague from \nAlabama, the former chairman of the Banking Committee and my ranking \nmember, along with 17 other members of the committee, Republican and \nDemocrats, on a vote of 19 to 2 out of the Banking Committee, that \nbrought forth the final piece of this housing package for the \nconsideration of our colleagues.\n  I heard repeatedly mentioned yesterday that this was a large bill. It \nis. It is 660 or 670 pages. And the question was raised about how we \nhad not had a chance to see this bill. I remind my colleagues that you \nhave already voted for two-thirds of that bill because they are \nprevious matters we have considered on two separate occasions, with \nsome very minor, minor but significant changes, but not voluminous in \ntheir quantity. So the greater part of this legislation has already \nbeen examined and debated extensively on this floor. The remaining \npiece, the one that came out of the committee 19 to 2, was voted out of \nthe committee about a month ago--a little more than a month ago--and \nhas been the subject of significant reporting as to what it included. \nIt is very similar, I might point out, to what was adopted by the other \nbody. So this is a moment where we have had ample opportunity.\n  If you do not hear it on the floor, go back home and listen to your \nconstituents talk about foreclosure problems. As I pointed out \nyesterday, we are now averaging 8,427 filings for foreclosure on a \ndaily basis in the country. So every single day in this country, more \nthan 8,000 people, between 8,000 and 9,000 people are in the process of \nlosing their homes. There are 1.5 million of our fellow citizens who \nhave already lost their homes over the last year or so, and with resets \nof adjustable rate mortgages coming up in July, the estimates are those \nnumbers will explode even further. In fact, it is been reported by \nCredit Suisse and the Mortgage Bankers Association that as many as one \nout of every eight homes in America could be in foreclosure if we do \nnot come up with some means by which we can address this issue.\n  The economic crisis we face in our country has at its heart the \nhousing crisis, which has at its heart the foreclosure crisis. The \nproblems are exacerbated, are expanded, obviously, by the rising costs \nof gasoline and health care, higher education, the fact that now more \nthan 300,000 jobs in the last few weeks have been lost in this country, \nunemployment rates are rising, and inflation is beginning to creep up.\n  This issue of getting our Nation back on its feet economically, \nrestoring confidence and optimism of the American people, particularly \nwhen it comes to the most important asset most Americans will ever \nhave, which is their homes--nothing we can do is more important to the \nstability of our neighborhoods, our communities, and our families, than \nmaking it possible for people to be able to maintain and own their own \nhomes.\n  That is the heart of what we are trying to do. That has been the \neffort over the last number of weeks, with the passage of two previous \npieces of legislation and the adoption now, I hope, in the coming days, \nof this comprehensive bill.\n  Let me review the bidding, if I can, as to what is in this bill. And \nthe efforts that were made yesterday to strip out all of this were \nsoundly defeated by margins that we rarely see in a body such as this \nthat is so equally divided, 51 to 49. But, again, thanks to the \nleadership of both Democrats and Republicans, the leadership of the \nmajority leader, Harry Reid, as well as the cooperation of the minority \nleader, we were able to get to this bill, we were able to address these \nunderlying questions and then vote overwhelmingly to reject the efforts \nthat would have stripped this legislation of its heart.\n  We have a strong regulator in this legislation. This has been an \neffort which has been sought over the last 6 or 7 years. Yet we have \nbeen unable to deal with the problem of the government-sponsored \nenterprises, principally Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are critical \nto the liquidity that is needed in our housing markets. Yet we also \nknow that those institutions have been losing billions of dollars as a \nresult of the housing crisis. A strong regulator is necessary and some \nadditional reforms to make sure that these GSEs, these government-\nsponsored enterprises, particularly Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, will be \non a sound footing. This bill does that, and we were able to achieve \nthat through the cooperation I mentioned a moment ago. That is \nabsolutely essential if we are going to have any hopes at all of \nstabilizing the housing problems.\n  We establish in this bill a permanent affordable housing program, not \na temporary one, not for 1 or 2, 3 or 5 years, but a permanent \naffordable housing program.\n  I cited yesterday the statistics of the millions of Americans who are \nfinding any kind of shelter further and further from their grasp \neconomically. Today when you discover that you have people literally \nspending more than 50, 60, or 70 percent of their income on rental \nhousing and, in some cases, when you talk about people who are \ndisabled, the SSI payments, in fact, don't even equal the cost of the \nhousing they are in today, we need to have a program that provides \naffordable shelter.\n  Decent, affordable shelter has never been a partisan issue. In fact, \n60 years ago, the administration of Harry Truman brought together \nDemocrats and Republicans in 1948 and insisted upon the issue of \naffordable shelter for all Americans. Over the years, Democrats and \nRepublicans, conservatives, liberals, moderates have all worked \ntogether on this issue. As I was growing up, the man who was called Mr. \nHousing was a guy named John Sparkman, a Senator from Alabama, the same \nState as my ranking member from Alabama, Mr. Shelby. John Sparkman was \nMr. Housing.\n  Through the 1950s and 1960s, as a Member of this body, he fought year \nafter year to see to it that we would have affordable, decent shelter \nfor all Americans. We began to slip over the last 15 or 20 years, as \nfewer and fewer dollars are being invested in affordable shelter for \nAmericans.\n  In this piece of legislation, as a result of the efforts of our \ncolleague from Rhode Island, Jack Reed, along with others, we now will \nhave a permanent, affordable housing program in America that will not \nrequire any tax increases. The support of that program will come from \nthe resources coming out of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the GSEs. So \nfor the first time in a long time, if ever, we will have a consistent \nand reliable source of support for decent, affordable shelter for \nAmericans. That is a part of this bill.\n  The legislation also includes the HOPE for Homeowners Act. It will \nhelp at least 450,000 of our hard-working families save their homes. \nAgain, this idea is not new. It was tried years ago, back in the 1920s \nand 1930s during the Great Depression, the last time, I might point \nout, that we had a significant housing crisis such as the one we are in \ntoday.\n  Back in those days, the Congress, working with Franklin Roosevelt, \ncrafted a program that had the Federal Government actually purchase \nhighly distressed, troubled mortgages and then put those families back \non their feet by a fixed-rate mortgage they could afford. That program \nactually produced a surplus for the American Government of some $16 \nmillion. We don't have a program like that, but it is similar. Instead \nof actually purchasing distressed mortgages, we are insuring them by \ninsisting that the\n\n[[Page S5928]]\n\nlender reduce the amount they are asking for and settle on a fixed-rate \ncost that the borrower can afford. Therefore, the lender does not lose \neverything. It costs them in order to take this arrangement, but the \nborrower also gets to stay in their home, and they end up paying that \ninsurance and also contributing back to the cost of the program.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has examined this idea which is \ntemporary, voluntary; you don't have to be in it if you don't want to. \nWe are trying to create a structure to allow people to end up with a \nmortgage they can afford and, for lenders who worry about losing \neverything, an opportunity to get something back out of this rather \nthan losing all their resources. It is estimated by the Congressional \nBudget Office that this program could actually save American taxpayers \n$250 million. That is their estimate of what we may actually have \ncoming back as a result of this effort.\n  This has been a bipartisan proposal--a bicameral one, for that \nmatter. The House has adopted a very similar program in their bill. \nThere was an effort to strip this program out of the bill yesterday. \nOur colleagues voted 77 to 11 to reject such an effort. We don't get \nvotes like that often, but I commend my colleagues, Democrats and \nRepublicans, for sticking with an idea that was recommended to us by a \nbroad consensus on the political spectrum. So it was very important. We \nhad strong votes yesterday for the regulatory reform for GSEs. The \neffort to strip out the affordable housing program was soundly defeated \nas well. The amendment relative to the HOPE for Homeowners Act was also \nresoundingly defeated.\n  We are on the brink of adopting the most comprehensive piece of \nhousing legislation in a long time, and it is not coming any too soon \neither. As I have reported, when you have more than 8,000 people every \nday slipping into foreclosure, with already a million and a half, and \nsome estimates are those numbers will explode in the coming weeks and \nmonths, it is a timely decision for Congress to do everything we can to \nrestore confidence and optimism, to keep people in their homes, and to \nget our economy back on a sound footing. We will not do that in the \nabsence of dealing with the housing crisis.\n  Again, I commend my colleague from Alabama. I thank him immensely for \nhis work. I thank the leadership, principally our majority leader, for \nmaking it possible for us to get to this moment where we could adopt \nthis legislation. My hope is that the other body, the House of \nRepresentatives, will consider what we have done, how difficult it is, \nand how precariously close we have come to having this matter blow up \non us on at least several occasions in the last several days. We need \nto send this package to the President for his signature. He is \nthreatening a veto. I hope he doesn't do that. It would be a great \ntragedy to have the President decide to veto this legislation.\n\n  I am told the reason he wants to veto it is because we include money \nfor the Community Development Block Grant Program, some $3.9 billion. \nThat is an emergency effort. The reason we have that is because our \nmayors, county supervisors, and Governors already have foreclosed \nproperties, many of them in their communities. These moneys are \nexclusively to be used for the rehabilitation of these homes so they \ncan be resold, to make them more attractive and available so we can \nrevitalize neighborhoods that have been affected by foreclosure.\n  I have pointed out on many occasions in the past while debating these \nbills, if you end up with one foreclosure on a city block, the value of \nevery other home on that block declines immediately by more than 1 \npercent. Crime rates go up by at least 2 percent in those \nneighborhoods. You start losing value in other homes, even if they are \nnot on the market. We know today we have some 15 million homes where \nthe debt exceeds the equity. Despite efforts over the years to increase \nthat equity, to become part of retirement and deal with a family \ncrisis, such as a higher education cost, many families now are living \nin homes where the debt on the mortgage exceeds the value of the house. \nThat is an unhealthy situation. We need to do everything we can by \ncleaning up where foreclosed properties exist and getting them back on \nthe market.\n  Let me commend Senator Baucus of Montana and Senator Grassley of \nIowa, chair and ranking member of the Finance Committee, the tax-\nwriting committee. Part of this bill includes provisions to deal with \nmortgage revenue bonds, to deal with a tax incentive approach to take \nforeclosed properties and encourage homeowners who would move into them \nto buy them. We need to do everything we can to allow this market to \nget back on its feet and moving.\n  That is a quick brief of what this bill includes. Again, it is a very \ngood piece of legislation. It is not perfect. If I were writing it \nmyself, it would look different, as I am sure it would if each Member \ncould write the bill. But we serve in a body of 100 Members. We must \nwork with a body that has 435 Members down the hall. Of course, we must \nwork with the White House. That is how our system works. You don't get \nto write these things on your own. You have to work with people with \nwhom you may have fundamental disagreements in order to resolve those \ndisagreements, to find common ground, and then craft ideas that can \nmake a difference for the American people who depend upon us.\n  That is what we have done with this bill. It is a sound, reliable, \nstrong piece of legislation that will make a difference for the \nAmerican people and, particularly, families fearing they may lose the \nmost important and valuable asset they will ever have, the family home. \nWhat a difference it can make to a family to have that house in which \nto raise their family and feel secure that the home they are living in \nand raising their children in will be theirs and not be lost through \nforeclosure.\n  We are hopeful this legislation will be adopted in the early part of \nnext week, and the President will sign it into law. What a greater gift \non Independence Day, as we break for a week to go back to our \nrespective States, than to have the President sign into law a piece of \nlegislation that would allow the American people to enjoy a certain \namount of independence as well in living in their homes without fear of \nforeclosure.\n  I urge my colleagues to continue to be supportive of this effort, and \nI thank those who have been responsible for bringing us to this point.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/20/senate-section/article/S5928-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5928-S5930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Oil Market Speculators\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this morning, watching television as I was \ngetting ready to come to work, I heard a news report about how much \nless Americans were driving. I believe they said 4.5 billion fewer \nmiles driven in our country in April, although it may have been January \nthrough April. I am trying to get that. But the New York Times \nyesterday had the same thing. It says: ``Driving Less: Americans \nFinally React to the Sting of Gas Prices.'' It described that in April \nof 2008, compared with the same month 1 year ago, Americans drove 1.8 \npercent fewer miles on public roads. So round it up. Americans drove 2 \npercent less in April, and presumably they used 2 percent less gasoline \nthan 1 year ago.\n  If that is the case, that gas prices are up so Americans are driving \nless and using less gasoline--then demand is down, isn't it?\n  Well, demand is down--and we know that; it doesn't have to be \nconfirmed by the New York Times yesterday. Demand is down. When gas \ngoes to $4, people are wondering how on Earth do I pull up to the gas \npump and afford to fill the tank? I had a tribal chairman come to the \nSenate yesterday. He described a mother who was driving her\n\n[[Page S5929]]\n\ndaughter, who had threatened to commit suicide, to see a doctor. But \nthe mother didn't have money or enough gas in the car to get back home, \nso she came to see the tribal chairman of this particular Indian tribe \nto try to get some money to put some gas in the tank to be able to \ndrive home after driving her daughter to the doctor.\n  We know these stories. A lot of people can't afford this, so they are \ndriving less. So if demand is down, then why are gasoline prices \nstaying up?\n  Four of the first 5 months of this year, we have seen increases in \ncrude oil inventories. Let me say that again: Crude oil inventory \nsupplies in this country have increased 4 of the last 5 months. So if \nsupplies are up, and demand is down, what justifies a continued \nincrease in the price of oil? It is not justified. It is unbelievable \nspeculation in the commodities markets.\n  I want to talk about that for a moment today. But I want to also note \nthat in the Washington Post this morning, Steven Pearlstein had an \narticle. It says: ``On Energy: Same-Old, Same-Old.'' And he is right \nabout that. Same old thing, isn't it, on energy?\n  We can't live without energy. The fact is, we get up in the morning \nand flip a switch and the light goes on. We plug something in and our \nrazor works. We get in the car, turn the key, and we can drive. We take \nenergy completely for granted, and yet we are prodigious users of \nenergy.\n  But we have a problem: Part of the problem is that divine providence, \napparently, ended up putting most of the oil under the sands way on the \nother side of the planet and most of the demand is here. So we stick \nstraws in this planet of ours and suck oil out every day. Eighty-five \nmillion barrels of oil every day we suck out of this Earth, and one-\nfourth is destined to be used in this little spot called the United \nStates. We use a quarter of the oil every single day that is produced \nin this world.\n  That is pretty unbelievable when you think about it. So we have big \nproblems. We use a quarter of the oil, and much of it is produced \nelsewhere--Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, and Venezuela--in troubled parts \nof the world. We need to be less dependent on finding oil from off our \nshores, which means we need to be more diligent in finding ways to \nproduce more here.\n  But it is not just producing oil, however. There are a lot of ways to \nproduce energy. My colleagues on the other side, who have spent the \nlast several days in this Chamber saying we have to drill here and \ndrill there; that the only way you produce is to drill a hole \nsomeplace. Well, I know people like this. They are the dig-and-drill \ntype. I call them ``yesterday forever.'' Digging and drilling, that is \nthe only way they think you can produce energy.\n\n  What about planting a crop in a farm field and producing ethanol? \nWhat about putting up a wind turbine and producing electricity by \ntaking the energy from the air? What about solar? What about biomass? \nThere is so much more we can and should do with respect to the \nproduction of energy.\n  I will talk about that some more, but I want to come back to this \nissue of speculation. Right now, the price of gas is killing us. We \nhave, I think, 12 airlines that have gone bankrupt in recent weeks and \nmonths. We have a whole lot of trucking companies that are now out of \nbusiness because they cannot afford to continue to operate by paying \ncurrent diesel prices to fill their trucks. We have farmers who can't \nfigure out how they are going to order a load of fuel for spring's work \nand summer's work because it costs too much. We have a lot of families \ndriving up to a gas pump and putting in only five gallons because they \ncan't possibly afford to fill the tank.\n  What is causing all that? Well, we have what is called a commodities \nmarket that has now been infested with hedge funds and investment \nbanks. Investment banks, for the first time in history, and in recent \nyears, are in this commodity market speculating. They have actually \npurchased storage capacity in order to take oil off the market. That is \nnot a particularly good way to bring down prices, is it? But that is \nnot the interest of some of these speculators. They think increasing \nthe price is fine. It is exactly what they want.\n  Will Rogers described all this years ago. He described people who buy \nthings they will never get from people who never had it, making money \non both sides. It wouldn't matter so much if the speculation on a \ncommodity isn't so essential to this country. There is unbelievable \nspeculation on oil and gas prices in this country, particularly oil \nprices at this point, that is damaging our economy. It is damaging our \ncountry, it hurts American truckers, farmers, and others, and we need \nto do something about it.\n  Now, the question is, what? I am going to hold a hearing next week. I \nchair the subcommittee that funds the Department of Energy, among other \nthings, and it funds the Energy Information Administration. That is the \nagency we pay in the Department of Energy to tell us what they know \nabout energy. This is not a policy group, but we spend a lot of money \non the EIA. If somebody is talking about energy and giving you some \nanalysis about energy statistics, it is probably the Energy Information \nAdministration, run by Mr. Caruso. Mr. Caruso is going to testify \nbefore my subcommittee this coming week.\n  But I want to show you this chart. I am not showing this to \ndemonstrate that the EIA is incompetent. That is not my allegation \nhere. However, I wanted to show you what the Energy Information \nAdministration has estimated each month, because they estimate what the \nprice of oil is going to be. Nobody knows, so EIA makes the best \nestimate they can, because they have the best people and the experts. \nSo here is what they have estimated.\n  By the way, this red line is the actual price, okay? Go back here in \nMay 2007, and they estimated the price of gasoline was to be about \nhere. In July 2007, they said here is where we think the price will be. \nIn September of 2007, here is where we think the price is going to be. \nIn November 2007, we think the price will go down, actually. In January \n2008, the price is going to go down. March 2008, it is going to go \ndown, and in April, it is going to go down.\n  Here is what actually happened. Oil prices went straight up, like a \nRoman candle. So the best people we have in the agency instructed to do \nthis analysis say, here is our estimate of oil prices--and the \nfundamentals of the marketplace should reflect supply and demand. I \nassume they probably thought people were going to drive a little less \nas prices went up so that we would have more conservation. But they \nsaid, we think we are going to be okay on supply and have a little less \ndemand and prices will moderate. Instead, prices went like this.\n  How can we be so wrong for so long? That is the question, I guess, \nfor next week. But I have had a chance to ask the head of this agency \nat a previous hearing whether there is some speculation here. My notion \nis this is an unbelievable orgy of speculation, and that is what is \nhappening to this market. The market is broken, doesn't work, it is \nfull of speculators, and they are interested in driving up the price. \nThey do not give a rip about the damage to the economy. But the answer \nfrom the EIA was, well, a little bit of speculation, but, you know, not \nvery much. It was kind of a two-step shuffle with your hands in your \npockets, ruminating. Wearing a gray sweater and smoking a pipe and \nruminating: Well, maybe a little speculation.\n  You know what? I think the truth is--and this chart with these lines \ndemonstrates how wrong we have been for so long--that there is a \nmassive amount of speculation here. There are plenty of experts around \nwho say this market is like a casino, open 24/7.\n  Now, what does it matter? Well, what matters is this is doing \nunbelievable damage to our economy and to our country. I would \nunderstand it--I wouldn't accept it, but I would understand it, if at \nleast the supply and demand relationship here justified an increase in \nprice, but it does not. Refineries in this country in recent months \nhave actually cut back in their capacity because they have had too much \ninventory out there. Drivers are driving less, crude stocks in 4 of the \nfirst 5 months have been up, yet the price of oil continues to rise.\n  Now, the large oil companies that are going to the bank depositing \nour money have a permanent grin. They can't stop smiling. The Saudis \nand the OPEC countries can't stop smiling either because they are \ncontributing\n\n[[Page S5930]]\n\neven more of our money to their bank accounts. This is not bad for \neverybody. This is good for some. It is just bad for most of the \nAmerican people and bad for the economy of this country.\n\n  I believe that speculation is rampant and the regulatory authorities, \nthe people who are supposed to wear the striped shirts and call the \nfouls, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are largely doing \nnothing about it except for the last couple of weeks when someone has, \napparently, lit their fuse or when the Chairman had some sort of \nepiphany overnight and said it looks as if we ought to start \ninvestigating this. The Chairman of the regulatory body has said \nrepeatedly now, for many months: It is just the fundamentals, there are \nno problems here, the market is working fine, just fine. He said it \nlast July, he said it in January, he said it in February, he said it in \nMay, be happy, there is no problem here. The fundamentals of the oil \nmarkets are working just fine.\n  Then, all of a sudden, we had a kind of tipping point. The Chairman \nof the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said: There might be \nsomething wrong. We are going to look at it. And oh, by the way, we \nhave been looking at it for 7 months.\n  It is a little confusing to me and I expect to the American people. \nEither the fundamentals were not right, or they were, back when he was \nassuring the American people everything was fine.\n  Having said all of that, it is pretty clear to me what is going on \nhere. We have a dramatic amount of speculation, a bunch of big \ninterests running up the price of oil on the commodities market--hedge \nfunds, investment banks, and others--speculating, purely speculating in \nthese oil markets.\n  I am going to introduce some legislation next week that addresses \nthat subject. It will be the End Oil Speculation Act. It will require \nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which has largely been asleep \nat the switch, to use the authority it has to do what is necessary to \nseparate legitimate trading for hedging purposes on the commodities \nmarket for oil from trading that is purely speculative. It will \nincrease the margin requirement on trading that is purely speculative. \nIt will do a number of other things that respond to the need to say: We \nbelieve this market should work. We think this market is necessary. But \nwhen a market is broken, the U.S. Congress has a responsibility to \naddress it.\n  My legislation will have time requirements and will make certain that \nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission takes the action that is \nnecessary to wring the speculation out of these markets. I will \nintroduce that early next week.\n  I do want to say with respect to the Stephen Pearlstein article that \nI think he has it right--``same old, same old.'' He said: Somebody \nbrings up offshore drilling, and immediately some say ``no,'' others \nsay ``yes,'' some say ``there,'' others say ``nowhere.'' Should we do \nsome offshore drilling? Sure. I supported offshore drilling in the Gulf \nof Mexico. I was one of four Senators who constructed the legislation \nthat is now law that opens what was called lease 181. Substantial oil \nand natural gas are there. We ought to open much more of that on the \neastern Gulf of Mexico. That is where the highest potential of \nrecoverable oil is, in the Gulf of Mexico. We can do that safely.\n  The fact is, you need to do much more. We are not going to drill our \nway out of this problem. We need much more renewable energy and more \nconservation. By far, the lowest hanging fruit in the energy issue \nwould be to retrofit all buildings in America. The Mackenzie study says \nthat is the quickest and easiest way to achieve substantial savings in \nenergy. There is so much to do and so much available to us in renewable \nenergy, in conservation, efficiency, and also the other elements that \ncome together outside of just drilling and digging.\n  I support some drilling and I support some digging. But that is not a \npolicy, it is just a chant to say: Let's keep doing what we have been \ndoing. That has driven us into a ditch. We want to get out of the \nditch. We don't want to make the ditch deeper.\n  I am going to be introducing legislation next week to address this \nproblem of speculation. My hope is that all those who believe, as I do, \nthat this market is not working right will support this effort. When \nyou have an increase in supply of oil and you have a decrease in \ndemand, you would expect that prices would begin going down, not \ncontinue to go up on a steep path. This market is broken, and I believe \nCongress has a responsibility to fix it. That is what I hope my \ncolleagues and I will be able to do beginning next week.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/20/senate-section/article/S5930-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5930-S5933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SOLICITOR GENERAL PAUL CLEMENT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the service of \nPaul Clement, who recently stepped down as our Nation's 43rd Solicitor \nGeneral.\n  Paul served in that office for more than 7 years, first as Principal \nDeputy to Solicitor General Ted Olson, then as Acting Solicitor \nGeneral, and for three years as Solicitor General. He is a good man and \nan excellent lawyer who was a great Solicitor General.\n  Before speaking about Paul, let me first say a few words about the \noffice in which he served.\n  Congress created the Department of Justice and the position of \nSolicitor General in 1870. Since then, the Solicitor General is the \nonly Federal Government officer actually required by statute to be \n``learned in the law.''\n  As Paul put it during his confirmation hearing in April 2005, the \nSolicitor General sits literally at the crossroads of the separation of \npowers. He is an executive branch official who defends the actions of \nthe executive and legislative branches before the judicial branch.\n  Today, the Solicitor General represents the United States before the \nSupreme Court and manages the United States' participation in thousands \nof lower court cases. That means he must make decisions in individual \ncases with reference to past positions taken by the United States and \nvigilance about how current positions may affect the future.\n  Such a constant, and constantly changing, set of factors makes the \nSolicitor General's job something like the courtroom version of multi-\ndimensional chess.\n  Because of his special relationship with the Supreme Court, the \nSolicitor General is often referred to as the Tenth Justice. Because of \nits astounding breadth and depth of experience and expertise, the \nSolicitor General's office has been called the best law firm in \nAmerica.\n  Paul Clement stands in a line of Solicitors General that includes \nsome of the true giants in the law and in the service of our country.\n  They include many who also served on the federal bench such as \nSupreme Court Chief Justices William Howard Taft and Charles Evans \nHughes; Associate Justices Stanley Reed, Robert Jackson, and Thurgood \nMarshall; and Circuit Judges Kenneth Starr, Wade McCree, and Walter \nCummings.\n  They include some of America's most distinguished legal academics \nsuch as Walter Dellinger, the Maggs Professor of Law at Duke; the late \nErwin Griswold, dean of Harvard Law School for 31 years; and the late \nRex Lee, from my own State of Utah, who was the founding dean of the J. \nReuben Clark School of Law at Brigham Young University.\n  Past Solicitors General also include those who would distinguish \nthemselves in both the academic and judicial worlds such as Charles \nFried, who has taught at Havard Law School since 1961 and served on the \nSupreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts; and Robert Bork, who was the \nBickel Professor of Public Law at Yale and served on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the D.C. Circuit.\n  Like Paul Clement, current Chief Justice John Roberts served as \nPrincipal Deputy Solicitor General.\n  Paul deserves to stand among such legends.\n  A native of Cedarburg, WI, Paul graduated from the Cedarburg public \nschools and went on to receive a bachelor's degree summa cum laude from\n\n[[Page S5931]]\n\nthe Georgetown University School of Foreign Service and a master's \ndegree with distinction from Cambridge University.\n  He then gave Harvard Law School a try and, sure enough, graduated \nfrom there magna cum laude after serving as Supreme Court editor of the \nHarvard Law Review to boot.\n  With that record, it is not surprising that he had the opportunity to \nclerk for truly great judges such as Judge Laurence Silberman on the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, who recently received the \nPresidential Medal of Freedom, and Supreme Court Justice Antonin \nScalia.\n  After a few years in private practice, Paul joined the United States \nSenate family as Chief Counsel of the Judiciary Subcommittee on the \nConstitution, Federalism, and Property Rights, chaired by our former \ncolleague and former Attorney General John Ashcroft.\n  I chaired the Judiciary Committee at the time and remember Paul not \nonly as a smart and hardworking lawyer but as a thoughtful, humble, and \ntruly decent person.\n  It is easy to find someone with either professional talents or \npersonal qualities, but a rare gift to have someone like Paul who has \nboth.\n  After leaving the Senate, Paul returned to private practice and \nheaded the appellate practice group of the distinguished law firm of \nKing & Spalding before joining the Solicitor General's office. A far \nless impressive record spread over a lifetime would suffice for most, \nbut Paul does not achieve the ripe old age of 42 until next week.\n  Three members of this body have been serving here since before Paul \nClement was born. Why, the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, was in \nhis second term when young Paul came into the world.\n  The Senator from Paul's home State of Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, my \ncolleague on both the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, introduced \nand praised Paul at his confirmation hearing. He noted that Paul would \nbe the youngest Solicitor General in more than 50 years and one of the \nyoungest in American history.\n  I do not want to belabor the point, but as I become a more seasoned \ncitizen myself, I am impressed with how much some of these young people \ncan accomplish.\n  Oh, I forgot one item on Paul's jam-packed resume. Last September, \nPaul squeezed in a full 24 hours of service as Acting Attorney General. \nFittingly, that was on September 17, which is the anniversary of both \nthe Constitution's signing and the confirmation of Paul's former boss \nJustice Scalia to the Supreme Court.\n  Paul has argued a total of 49 cases before the Supreme Court. I \nshould perhaps say that he has so far argued 49 cases, as Paul may well \nreturn to the Supreme Court podium in the future. It is the tradition \nand commitment of the Solicitor General to defend acts of Congress if \nthere is a reasonable argument to do so.\n  No one can turn a merely reasonable argument into a compelling \nargument better than Paul Clement. Many who have seen him argue remark \nthat though he speaks without notes, he has an astounding command of \nthe facts and the law in each case.\n  He has vigorously defended the legislation we have enacted on a wide \nrange of issues, from the McCain-Feingold campaign finance law and the \nban on partial-birth abortion to the Solomon Amendment and the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act.\n  I would be surprised if any of my colleagues voted for every piece of \nlegislation Paul has defended before the Supreme Court. I know I have \nnot.\n  But in every case, Paul upheld the highest standards of his office by \ndiligently defending the work of the legislative branch.\n  And while each Solicitor General faces unique challenges and special \ncases, Paul's tenure coincided with the war on terror that we continue \nto fight.\n  He has confronted not only novel, complex, and serious legal issues, \nbut he has borne the burden of knowing that his efforts will \ndramatically affect American lives, and indeed the American way of life \nitself.\n  Paul's combination of experience allowed him to do some truly unique \nthings as Solicitor General. When he earlier served on the Judiciary \nCommittee staff, for example, Paul worked hard on the development and \npassage of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act.\n  I introduced that legislation after the Supreme Court struck down \nprevious efforts to protect religious liberty. The Senate unanimously \npassed the bill.\n  Then in 2005, as Solicitor General, Paul defended the \nconstitutionality of that law and the Supreme Court unanimously upheld \nit.\n  And in the case now before the Supreme Court regarding the District \nof Columbia's ban on firearm possession, Paul argued before the Justice \nfor whom he clerked regarding the opinion of the Circuit Judge for whom \nhe clerked.\n  Some who have compiled such an amazing resume have taken much longer \nto do so. Some who have done so quickly are, quite frankly, not nearly \nso decent and kind as Paul Clement.\n  He and his wife Alexandra have three wonderful children, Thomas \nAntonio, Theodore Gerald, otherwise known as Theo, and the youngest, \nPaul Gregory. The little one, called P.G., made his presence known at \nthe opening of Paul's confirmation hearing. Youngsters are known to do \nthat.\n  We all remember Chief Justice Roberts' son Jack doing the dance of \njoy when his father was sworn in at the White House. At his hearing, \nPaul noted that he and his wife had promised the boys Yugioh cards in \nwhat he said would be direct proportion to how well they behaved that \nmorning. I thought the boys did quite well that day and hope they were \nduly rewarded.\n  I was also touched at that hearing when Paul talked about his wife \nand her role in supporting his work. He said: ``Every day that she \nallows me to practice law outside the home while she stays home with \nour three boys is a personal sacrifice and an indulgence of my \ninterests, for which I am eternally grateful.''\n  I am not the only one to recognize Paul Clement as a very good man \nand a very good lawyer or to applaud his service to our country.\n  I ask unanimous consent to place in the Record following my remarks \nletters sent to me by former Solicitors General Ted Olson and Seth \nWaxman, the current Deputy Attorney General Mark Filip and his \npredecessor Paul McNulty, former Attorney General Edwin Meese, former \nSenator John Ashcroft, Judge Laurence Silberman, and Justice Antonin \nScalia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  I want to highlight a few comments from a few of these letters.\n  Former Solicitor General Ted Olson, for example, wrote to me that ``I \nhave been continuously impressed by his unfailing dedication and \ntalent. I cannot imagine a more productive, honorable and distinguished \nrecord of exceptional government service. . . . General Clement has \nalso been an outstanding steward of the office of the Solicitor General \nthroughout his 7 years of government service. . . . He leaves this fine \noffice in superb condition, fully staffed and in the hands of lawyers \ndedicated to carry on the work of the Solicitor General.''\n  Deputy Attorney General Mark Filip attended Harvard Law School with \nPaul and together they clerked for Justice Scalia. He writes: ``The \nrespect and praise for Mr. Clement is the product of his unique talents \nand work ethic. He is exceptionally bright, and he is a gifted oral \nadvocate. He is also intellectually honest and open-minded . . . Paul \nis a fundamentally decent person, and a true patriot, and the \nDepartment of Justice and Nation are decidedly better because of his \npublic service.''\n  And Justice Scalia wrote to me this way: ``when it was rumored that \nPaul Clement was under consideration to fill the vacancy in the office \nof Solicitor General, the Court (and I speak here of a 9-0 judgment) \nwas delighted. It was the consensus, based on Mr. Clement's\n\n[[Page S5932]]\n\nappearances before us over the preceding few years, that the President \ncould not make a better choice. We have not been disappointed in our \nexpectation. For the past 7 years, General Clement could be relied upon \nto assure that the Government's case was presented forcefully but \nfairly, without exaggeration or obfuscation. The Government did not \nalways win, of course, because sometimes its case was a weak one; but \nthe Office of Solicitor General said for it the best that could be \nsaid. I take special pride in passing along this praise, since as you \nknow Paul was once a law clerk of mine and has remained a good \nfriend.''\n  This is certainly high praise and I share all of it.\n  But Paul Clement is no ordinary super-lawyer.\n  Last year, a profile in the Wall Street Journal noted Paul's \ncredentials and brilliance but also revealed that he is a fan of \nalternative rock music, with his favorite band the grunge group \nNirvana.\n  The Journal speculated that Paul is the first Solicitor General to \nfrequent the 9:30 Club, described as Washington's alternative rock \noutpost.\n  A writer on the Wall Street Journals blog offered this simple yet \nprofound assessment, which I also share:\n\n       Paul Clement rocks.\n\n  I understand that Paul will be staying in the Washington area, \nreturning to teach law at Georgetown and serving as a fellow at the \nSupreme Court Institute.\n  Both institutions and the people they serve are truly blessed to have \nhim.\n  Already in his young life, Paul Clement has touched many lives and \nmade America better.\n  I understand that Paul and his family are today doing some well-\ndeserved traveling abroad.\n  I join so many others in thanking him for his service to America and \nin offering my prayers for him and his family in their lives ahead.\n  This is an exceptional human being. He is a great man. At his tender \nage, he has been a great Solicitor General by all measures. Whether you \nare a Democrat or Republican, you have to acknowledge that. He has \nserved this country well and faithfully. I value his friendship. I \nvalue him as a human being.\n  On behalf of, I think, every member of the Judiciary Committee and \nothers who knew him, we wish Paul the absolute best. We know he will be \ngiving a great deal of knowledge to those young students and others who \nwill learn from him.\n  I am grateful to know him. I am grateful I have had the privilege of \nworking with him. I am grateful I have been able to watch his career as \nhe served in the Solicitor General's office. I am grateful this young \nman has reached the heights he has reached because he deserves it. He \nis a terrific human being, and we all know that.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                  Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 3, 2008.\n     Re Solicitor General Paul D. Clement\n\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC,\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I understand that you will be offering \n     a Senate tribute to retiring Solicitor General Paul D. \n     Clement. You are very kind to do this, and I wanted to take \n     the opportunity to add my praise to the many plaudits that I \n     am sure you have received from others for the outstanding and \n     dedicated service Solicitor General Clement has rendered to \n     the Government of the U.S. and to the people of this Nation \n     during his 7 years as Deputy Solicitor General and Solicitor \n     General.\n       As you know, General Clement served as my Principal Deputy \n     in the Solicitor General's office from 2001 until 2004. As a \n     result, I was able to observe, on a daily basis, his \n     extraordinary talents and dedicated service in the Department \n     of Justice. I also stayed in close touch with his work in the \n     years since I left the office in 2004. I have been \n     continuously impressed by his unfailing dedication and \n     talent. I cannot imagine a more productive, honorable and \n     distinguished record of exceptional government service.\n       General Clement is and has been a superb advocate for the \n     United States before the United States Supreme Court. I \n     personally observed many of his forty-nine arguments before \n     the Court and I am familiar with many of the arguments that I \n     did not witness. His preparation for and delivery of \n     arguments to the Court have invariably been superb. His \n     analysis has been meticulous and insightful, his oral \n     advocacy honest, clear and forthright, and he is eloquent and \n     persuasive in Court. Many of his arguments have involved \n     defending the constitutionality of acts of Congress. Congress \n     could not possibly have had a better advocate. He repeatedly \n     and consistently earned the respect, admiration and \n     appreciation of the Justices.\n       Another part of General Clement's service was managing the \n     appellate practice of the lawyers of the United States in the \n     federal courts. He has worked diligently and conscientiously \n     to insure that the interests of the United States were well \n     served in determining whether to appeal decisions adverse to \n     the United States and to intervene in cases where the \n     interest of the United States required it. The quality of \n     that advocacy has been clear, fair, and consistently of the \n     highest caliber. In developing the position of the United \n     States, he has thoughtfully and painstakingly listened to and \n     helped articulate the views of the Government agencies that \n     he has represented, never overlooking the fact that the \n     people of this Nation were his ultimate clients.\n       General Clement has also been an outstanding steward of the \n     Office of the Solicitor General throughout his 7 years of \n     government service. He has encouraged, supported and guided \n     the exceptional career attorneys and staff members of the \n     Office of the Solicitor General. He leaves this fine office \n     in superb condition, fully staffed and in the hands of \n     lawyers dedicated to carry on the work of the Solicitor \n     General.\n       Solicitor General Clement is a paradigmatical example of \n     unselfish government service. He has earned the respect and \n     gratitude of all citizens.\n       Thank you for expressing the Nation's appreciation and \n     thanks to General Clement for his outstanding personal and \n     professional service as Solicitor General of the United \n     States.\n           Very truly yours,\n     Theodore B. Olson.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 2, 2008.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I'm delighted to add my voice to the \n     chorus applauding Paul Clement's tenure as Solicitor General \n     of the United States. Throughout, Paul conducted himself \n     before the Court in the very finest traditions of the office. \n     I'm delighted that he plans (for now at least) to remain \n     close by, and I look forward to many happy years of continued \n     professional association with this fine lawyer.\n           Yours sincerely,\n     Seth P. Waxman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     Office of the\n\n\n                                      Deputy Attorney General,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 2, 2008.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: In June 2008, Paul Clement completed \n     his tenure at the Justice Department as one of the most \n     distinguished Solicitor Generals in United States history. \n     Mr. Clement leaves the Justice Department with the respect \n     and admiration of a vast group of people within the \n     Department, within the ranks of present and former members of \n     the federal judiciary, and among members of the private bar. \n     The breadth of this group of peop1e--from both sides of the \n     political aisle, from across the spectrum of the federal \n     judiciary, and from his former litigation colleagues and \n     adversaries alike--is decidedly uncommon in our present legal \n     culture. The range of respect for Mr. Clement is even more \n     impressive when one realizes that he has litigated the most \n     high profile cases, concerning the most sensitive issues, \n     before the U.S. Supreme Court over the last seven plus years.\n       The respect and praise for Mr. Clement is the product of \n     his unique talents and work ethic. He is exceptionally \n     bright, and he is a gifted oral advocate. He is also \n     intellectually honest and open-minded. I regard the year I \n     spent clerking with him for Justice Scalia as one of the true \n     good fortunes of my professional career. Paul is a \n     fundamentally decent person, and a true patriot, and the \n     Department of Justice and Nation are decidedly better because \n     of his public service. Thank you very much, Senator Hatch, \n     for appropriately recognizing his contribution.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                       Mark Filip,\n     Deputy Attorney General.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Baker & McKenzie, LLP,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 6, 2008.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: Thank you for the honor to participate \n     in paying tribute to the outstanding service of Paul Clement, \n     former Solicitor General of the United States. I was \n     privileged to be Paul's colleague at the Department of \n     Justice for six years, and I consider him to be one of our \n     country's finest public servants.\n       Since the horrific attacks on America on September 11, \n     2001, our nation has faced the unprecedented challenge of \n     preventing another devastating attack by a largely invisible \n     enemy. This effort has placed an especially heavy burden on \n     our military and law enforcement agencies. It has also \n     presented us with a set of extremely difficult legal issues \n     as we work to protect American lives while remaining faithful \n     to the rule of law. No one in the United States has done more \n     to find the best answers to these complex questions than Paul \n     Clement. At a time\n\n[[Page S5933]]\n\n     when our country needed its best and brightest to step \n     forward and serve, Paul Clement was an answer to the prayers \n     of millions of Americans who earnestly hoped for capable \n     leaders in this historic hour.\n       When I served as United State Attorney in the Eastern \n     District of Virginia, I witnessed his superb argument before \n     the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in the prosecution of \n     convicted terrorist Zaccarias Moussaoui and his excellent \n     judgment and advocacy in the litigation arising from the \n     detention of Yaser Hamdi. Paul's approach was never combative \n     and ``win at all costs''. Rather, he calmly, respectfully, \n     and brilliantly worked through the issues presented in these \n     cases to find answers that were consistent with the letter \n     and spirit of the U.S. Constitution. Later, when I served as \n     Deputy Attorney General, I again had the benefit of Paul's \n     wise counsel and a better seat from which to observe his \n     integrity in action. When Paul was asked where he thought the \n     Supreme Court would go in a particular case, he offered only \n     clear and honest assessments with the utmost respect for \n     every person and perspective. It is no small irony that at a \n     time so marked by emotion-filled arguments and about \n     constitutional fidelity in the war against terrorism, our \n     nation's top advocate for the government has been a man of \n     unfailing civility and intellectual integrity who cares far \n     more about the Court getting it right than his own scorecard \n     of success.\n       As Paul now enters a new phase in his extraordinary legal \n     career, I wish this man of faith and devotion to family all \n     the best. I also hope that some day, once again, he will be \n     the answer to America's prayer for a devoted public servant \n     in a time a great need.\n       Senator Hatch, I greatly appreciate your support for Paul, \n     the Department of Justice, and your many years of leadership \n     in the United States Senate.\n           Respectly yours,\n                                                  Paul J. McNulty,\n     Former Deputy Attorney General.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      The Heritage Foundation,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 10, 2008.\n     Re Paul Clement\n\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: It is a pleasure to join you in \n     recognizing the excellent work of Paul Clement as Solicitor \n     General of the United States.\n       Having served as Attorney General, I know of the importance \n     of his position as the key official responsible for all the \n     appellate work done on behalf of the people of this Country. \n     The Department of Justice has an enviable record of high \n     quality legal appellate work, thanks to a succession of fine \n     Solicitors General. Paul has continued that tradition and has \n     provided the personal leadership and professional competence \n     which has won the acclaim of the Justices of the Supreme \n     Court as well as the attorneys that make up the Supreme Court \n     Bar.\n       In summary, Paul Clement has done an outstanding job as \n     Solicitor General of the United States. His commitment to the \n     rule of law and the Constitution, as well as his legal \n     knowledge and expertise, has contributed to a distinguished \n     record of service to the Country.\n       Thank you for your efforts in leading this commendation of \n     an outstanding public official.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Edwin Meese III,\n\n                            Attorney General of the United States,\n     (1985-1988).\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      The Ashcroft Group, LLC,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 2, 2008.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: The opportunity to thank Paul Clement \n     for his years of superlative public service is one for which \n     I am grateful.\n       It is a personal pleasure and profound honor to have had \n     the privilege of working alongside Paul in various settings. \n     We first worked together when he served as Counsel to the \n     Constitution Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the \n     Judiciary. Following my appointment as U.S. Attorney General, \n     I had the satisfaction of working with Paul in the Office of \n     the Solicitor General.\n       In all of his service, integrity has been thoroughly \n     sustained; his wisdom as a Counselor has been unsurpassed and \n     the industry with which he has approached every challenge has \n     been unflagging. Even so, Paul never allowed the excellence \n     of his intellect to interfere with his cordial friendships \n     with coworkers.\n       I know of no record of public service more worthy of praise \n     than that of Paul Clement. The U.S. Senate is to be \n     congratulated for its foresight and wisdom in confirming him \n     as U.S. Solicitor General to defend our nation's interests in \n     the judicial system.\n       I am truly grateful for Paul's professional and personal \n     friendship. May God bless him and his family in the days \n     ahead.\n           Sincerely,\n     John Ashcroft.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            U.S. Court of Appeals,\n\n\n                                 District of Columbia Circuit,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 19, 2008.\n     Hon.

Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Orrin: The following tribute to Paul Clement is being \n     sent to you for submission into the Congressional Record:\n\n       ``Paul Clement is a superb lawyer and was a splendid \n     Solicitor General with almost invariably good judgment.''\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Laurence H. Silberman,\n     U.S. Senior Circuit Judge.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           Supreme Court of the United States,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 6, 2008.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I have sometimes remarked that one does \n     not fully appreciate, unless and until he becomes a judge, \n     how appropriate it is for counsel to be called ``officers of \n     the court.'' Judges make the decisions, to be sure. But they \n     rely upon counsel to bring forward the best of what can be \n     said for each side of the case. And when counsel fail to do \n     that, the outcome may suffer.\n       Thus, when it was rumored that Paul Clement was under \n     consideration to fill the vacancy in the office of Solicitor \n     General, the Court (and I speak here of a 9-0 judgment) was \n     delighted. It was the consensus, based on Mr. Clement's \n     appearances before us over the preceding few years, that the \n     President could not make a better choice.\n       We have not been disappointed in our expectation. For the \n     past 7 years, General Clement could be relied upon to assure \n     that the Government's case was presented forcefully but \n     fairly, without exaggeration or obfuscation. The Government \n     did not always win, of course, because sometimes its case was \n     a weak one; but the Office of Solicitor General said for it \n     the best that could be said. I take special pride in passing \n     along this praise, since as you know Paul was once law clerk \n     of mine and has remained a good friend.\n       For a successful lawyer, a 7-year commitment to government \n     service involves massive financial sacrifice. The sacrifice \n     is all the greater, and is shared, when the lawyer has a wife \n     and three young children. So not only does Paul deserve the \n     Nation's thanks for making a significant contribution to \n     federal justice, but so does Alexandra for letting him do so.\n       He has our best wishes and confident expectations for \n     continuation of a brilliant career in the law.\n           Sincerely,\n     Antonin Scalia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/20/senate-section/article/S5933-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO FRANK WOODRUFF BUCKLES\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this week, I was pleased to participate in a \ncelebration of a true American hero, a West Virginia legend, and a \nfriend, Mr. Frank Woodruff Buckles, the last surviving American veteran \nof World War I.\n  His has always been a life of excitement and adventure, an example of \nliving life to the fullest. His career in the steamship business in the \n1920s and 1930s took him to Nazi Germany, where he saw the German \ndictator, Adolph Hitler, at the 1936 Olympics, and witnessed the great \nJesse Owens win 4 Gold Medals. In the 1940s, his work took him to the \nPhilippines, where he was captured and spent three and one-third years \nuntil the end of World II in a Japanese POW camp. Here he led his \nfellow prisoners in calisthenics, as well as a number of Japanese \nguards who put down their guns and joined in.\n  That would have been more than a lifetime of experiences for most \nmortals, but not Mr. Buckles. His life had just begun because, after \nthe war, he married and became a West Virginian and a farmer!\n  For the next 50 years, Mr. Buckles has experienced and enjoyed life \nas a farmer in the eastern panhandle of West Virginia. At 107 years of \nage, he still operates his 330-acre cattle farm. He remains an avid \nreader. For example, he recently read my book, ``Losing America.'' \nEvery year, on his birthday, he takes my staffer, Ms. Martha Anne \nMcIntosh, out to dinner at the Bavarian Inn in Shepherdstown.\n  Now that is impressive! At the age of 107, he is still reading, \nworking, and engaging in an active social life! Mr. Buckles is my role \nmodel.\n  Maybe his long, productive, and happy life is a product of breathing \nthe good, clean West Virginia mountain air! More likely, it is the \nresult of his healthy attitude toward life itself because, as the Bible \ntells us, ``A merry heart doeth good like a medicine.'' (Proverbs, \n17:22).\n  Mr. Buckles is eternally young, and for that, we appreciate him, as \nwell as honor him for a life that exemplifies the American ideals of \nbravery, patriotism, and perseverance.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/20/senate-section/article/S5934-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5934]]\n                    TRIBUTE TO NELDA BARTON-COLLINGS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a good \nfriend, Nelda Barton-Collings. Mrs. Barton-Collings is a well-respected \nKentuckian and businesswoman, recently retired after serving 28 years \non the Republican National Committee.\n  Mrs. Barton-Collings resides in Corbin, KY, where she was married to \nDr. Harold Bryan Barton. After the passing of Dr. Barton she took on \nthe ownership and operation of his two nursing homes. At the same time, \nshe took night classes to become a licensed nursing home administrator. \nShe has since grown those two nursing homes into numerous nursing homes \nand banks throughout eastern Kentucky.\n  Mrs. Barton-Collings used her vast business skills to serve her \ncommunity, State, and eventually her Nation by committing to public \nservice. She started out as a precinct chair, and then rose to become \nKentucky's national committeewoman for the GOP. In 1982, President \nRonald Reagan appointed her to the Federal Council on Aging. In 1990, \nshe was the first woman elected chairman of the Kentucky Chamber of \nCommerce while serving on the President's Council on Rural America and \nthe National Advisory Council to Small Business Administration, through \nan appointment by President George H.W. Bush.\n  She has long been a voice of great leadership on the Republican \nNational Committee, where she was the first woman from Kentucky to \naddress the RNC and call the meeting to order. Her position gave her \nopportunities to extend democratic ideas and philosophy to the former \nSoviet Union. She and 40 other political and business professionals \nvolunteered to visit the Soviet Union in 1990 to discuss the \nfoundations of a democratic government. ``They want freedom so badly; \nwe hoped that we have helped them in some way,'' she said of her \nexperience in the Soviet Union.\n  Nelda has given the good people of Kentucky and this Nation over 28 \nyears of public service, and I would like to ask my colleagues to join \nme in honoring this committed public servant. The News Journal in \nCorbin, KY, published an article highlighting her accomplishments and \nwhat a champion she is for the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the News Journal, May 28, 2008]\n\n          Longtime Supporter Honored With Portrait, Classroom\n\n       On Sunday, May 18, friends and family of Nelda Barton-\n     Collings gathered at Cumberland Inn on the campus of \n     University of the Cumberlands to recognize this extraordinary \n     woman at a luncheon given in her honor.\n       As Dr. Jim Taylor, UC president said, ``Today we honor a \n     lady who has made, and who continues to make a significant \n     and substantial contribution to our area, to our state, and, \n     indeed, to our nation. Dr. Nelda Barton-Colllings truly is a \n     legend in her own time.'' After the luncheon, the assembly \n     proceeded to the Hutton School of Business, where a portrait \n     of Mrs. Barton-Collings adorns a special classroom, which \n     bears her name, in recognition of her faithfulness and \n     support of UC.\n       A native of Providence, Webster County, Kentucky, Barton-\n     Collings attended Western Kentucky University for two years \n     before she entered the Norton Memorial Infirmary in \n     Louisville, where she became a certified medical \n     technologist. In Corbin, as the wife of Dr. Harold Bryan \n     Barton, she became active in local organizations and held \n     leadership positions in church, political, civic, medical, \n     youth, educational and women's groups.\n       After Dr. Barton's death, she took over his business, which \n     consisted of two nursing homes, and completed the \n     Williamsburg Nursing Home, then under construction. At that \n     time, she enrolled in night classes at University of the \n     Cumberlands and later became a Kentucky Licensed Nursing Home \n     Administrator. She and her business partner continued to \n     build or buy a total of eight long-term healthcare facilities \n     in Eastern Kentucky. A business woman ahead of her time, \n     Barton-Collings has owned banks, pharmacies, rental \n     properties, weekly newspapers, a cinema, and several other \n     businesses. The newspapers, long-term care facilities and \n     banks have won state awards and recognitions.\n       In 1990, Barton-Collings became the first woman elected \n     chairman of the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce. In 1982, she \n     received a Presidential appointment from President Ronald \n     Reagan to the Federal Council on Aging, where she served \n     until 1987. From 1990-92, she served on the President's \n     Council on Rural America and the National Advisory Council to \n     Small Business Administration, appointed by President George \n     H.W. Bush.\n       As an active member of the Republican Party for more than \n     50 years, Barton-Collings moved up the ranks from a precinct \n     chair to Republican National Committee member representing \n     Kentucky, a position she held for 28 years. Elected vice \n     chair for an eight-year term and secretary of the Republican \n     National Committee for another eight years, Barton-Collings \n     earned the honor of calling to order the Republican National \n     Convention in 1996.\n       But, this was not her first convention appearance, as she \n     was the first woman from Kentucky to present an address at a \n     Republican National Convention, when, in Detroit, Michigan, \n     in 1980, she spoke on ``The Business of Caring for the \n     Elderly.'' During her tenure on the Republican National \n     Committee, she was a charter member and appointed secretary-\n     treasurer of the National Institute on International Affairs, \n     and she served on the Foreign Affairs Committee, which \n     allowed her to travel extensively to foreign countries to \n     promote democracy.\n       Recently honored by the Kentucky Commission on Women as a \n     ``Kentucky Woman Remembered'' for her many achievements, \n     Barton-Collings's portrait now hangs in the Kentucky State \n     Capitol.\n       Through the years, she has received numerous other awards \n     and honors, including an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from \n     University of the Cumberlands, as well as the Kentucky \n     Medical Association's Outstanding Layperson Award, the John \n     Sherman Cooper Distinguished Service Award from Kentucky \n     Young Republicans and the Dwight David Eisenhower Award.\n       Currently, the chairman of the board of Bretara, LLC and \n     Tri County Cineplex, LLC, Barton-Collings also serves on the \n     Kentucky Economic Development Partnership Board; as secretary \n     of the University of Kentucky Center on Aging; and as chair \n     of University of the Cumberlands Board of Visitors.\n       Married to Dr. Jack Collings of Owensboro, Kentucky from \n     March of 1992 until his death in 2000, Barton-Collings is the \n     mother of five, grandmother of ten, step-grandmother of \n     twelve, and great-grandmother of two.\n       Dr. Jim Taylor, University of the Cumberlands president, \n     said, ``It is entirely appropriate that Mrs. Barton-\n     Collings's picture hangs in this room where our students will \n     study business principles and practices, for she certainly \n     exemplifies the ideal of a true businesswoman.\n       Through her remarkable career and her stellar service to \n     her fellow humans, she is a role model for our aspiring \n     business leaders, and we are honored that she is an alumna of \n     University of the Cumberlands, Nelda, as we say here in these \n     beautiful mountains, `You do us proud.'

Mr. President, as a Senator from West Virginia, I \nwish to pay tribute to our State on the commemoration of our admittance \ninto the Union on this day in 1863--and to honor the nearly 2 million \npeople who are proud to call it home.\n  When people think of West Virginia their thoughts turn to our \nmountains, our rolling green hills, and rivers. It is a place of \nimmense natural beauty and scenic wonders. Still others may think of \nour most abundant natural resource, coal, or even our steel. Every \nfall, many college sports fans turn their thoughts to our incredible \nfootball teams.\n  West Virginia, without question, is all of these things. But what \ntruly sets us apart from other places is our people. West Virginians \nare the hardest working, nicest people you all ever have the chance to \nmeet. They are the reason that so many people choose to come back again \nand again to our State. They are real people who possess an abundant \nspirit of hope, optimism, and authenticity. More than anything else, \nthey are the heart and soul of our great State.\n  So it seems only fitting on this West Virginia Day that we pause for \na few moments and think about the lasting contributions that our coal \nminers, steel workers, teachers, public servants, and next door \nneighbors have made not just on our State, but on our Nation.\n  West Virginia is rooted in rich culture. Our Appalachian heritage is \nimmortalized in song and prose. It is a place where the pioneering \nspirit is still alive and well. Our communities are not just bound \ntogether by ZIP Codes but in sharing responsibility to care for and \nlook out for each other. We are still a place where neighbor helping \nneighbor is a way of life, and our children are raised to honor their \nfamily and to love our country.\n  West Virginia is place where values such as compassion, self-\nreliance, loyalty, love, unselfishness, and faith are both timely and \ntimeless.\n\n[[Page S5935]]\n\n  This is the West Virginia that embraced me and later my family. These \nare the people who helped to give me a true sense of purpose and shape \nme deep into my core.\n  This Senator is incredibly proud of our coal miners that do the \nhardwork of mining the coal that provides the Nation with its \nelectricity and of our steel workers who forged the tracks for our \nNation's railroads, the girders for our skyscrapers, and the bridges \nthat span the country; I am proud of those West Virginians who are now \nbuilding planes, trucks, and doing cutting-edge research into disease \nprevention and biometrics; of those West Virginians who have dedicated \nthemselves to be our communities' guardians as first-responders, or in \nthe National Guard; and of those in our State who have entered into \npublic service--especially our teachers--and of those rural health care \nprofessionals who provide essential and life-saving services to some of \nour most vulnerable.\n  And of course, our entire State is tremendously proud of those West \nVirginians who have earned the honored title of veteran.\n  Emblazoned on our State flag is our motto, ``Mountaineers Are Always \nFree.'' It is in that spirit that West Virginians have always answered \nthe call of duty in our country's time of need.\n  Earlier this week, the Senate honored Frank Buckles, the last \nsurviving solider from World War I, who now lives in Charles Town. As a \nteenager, he went to war to defeat the Kaiser, and he was imprisoned by \nthe Japanese for 3\\1/2\\. He is truly a living legend, a touchstone to \nour past, and we are so proud to have him in WV.\n  West Virginia's sons and daughters have fought on the Korean \npeninsula, in the jungles of Vietnam, the mountains of Afghanistan, and \nthe desert of Iraq--and in conflicts in between.\n  We always have a special place in our heart for our Gold Star \nMothers--and for those who gave their last full measure of devotion and \nnow rest in fields that were once made infamous by war.\n  I could go on and say many more flattering things about our beloved \nState, our people, and our future, but as West Virginians we know that \nwe are truly blessed. Perhaps that is why humility is one of our \ngreatest virtues, because we know that no matter what challenges we \nface, as a State we will stand together, harness our ``can-do'' spirit, \nand overcome them. That is what we do. We are fighters, in every sense \nof the word.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/20/senate-section/article/S5935-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                    Staff Sergeant Tyler E. Pickett\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute and express \nour Nation's deepest gratitude to a remarkable young soldier and his \nfamily. I was saddened to receive word last week that on June 8, 2008, \nArmy SSG Tyler E. Pickett of Saratoga, WY, was killed in the line of \nduty while serving our country in the war on terrorism. Staff Sergeant \nPickett died from injuries he sustained when his unit came under attack \nby enemy forces using improvised explosive devices in Kirkuk Province, \nIraq. He was serving his second tour of duty in Iraq, and had also \nserved a tour in Afghanistan.\n  Staff Sergeant Pickett served with the 2nd Battalion, 22nd Infantry \nRegiment, 1st Brigade Combat Team, of the 10th Mountain Division out of \nFort Drum, NY. He moved to Wyoming at the age of 14 and joined the Army \nshortly after his graduation from Saratoga High School in 1999. His \nmother said that serving his country in the Army was always a part of \nhis plan. He came from a family with a strong history of military \nservice, and he knew what he wanted to do. He made friends everywhere \nhe went, and it didn't matter where he was--he was always touching \nsomeone's life. He looked forward to retiring from the service one day \nand spending his life in the mountains of Wyoming.\n  It is because of Tyler Pickett that we continue to live safe and \nfree. America's men and women who answer the call to service and wear \nour Nation's uniform deserve respect and recognition for the enormous \nburden that they willingly bear. They put everything on the line \neveryday, and because of them and their families, our Nation remains \nfree and strong in the face of danger.\n  This past weekend, Americans celebrated Flag Day. Like so many before \nhim, Staff Sergeant Pickett fought under the flag of the United States \nof America. He fought and died for the Republic for which it stands. \nWords cannot express the gratitude we owe him.\n  In the book of John, Jesus said that, ``Greater love has no man than \nthis, that he lay his life down for his friend.'' SSG Tyler Pickett \ngave his life, that last full measure of devotion, for you, me, and \nevery single American. He gave his life defending his country and its \npeople, and we honor him for this selfless sacrifice.\n  Staff Sergeant Pickett is survived by a loving family including his \nwife Kristin and their children, his mother Sheri Peterson and father \nEd Pickett. He is also survived by his brothers and sisters in arms of \nthe U.S. Army. We say goodbye to devoted family man and an American \nsoldier. Our Nation pays its deepest respect to SSG Tyler E. Pickett \nfor his courage, his love of country, and his sacrifice, so that we may \nremain free. He was a hero in life and he remains a hero in death. All \nof Wyoming, and indeed the entire Nation, is proud of him. May God \nbless him and his family and welcome him into his home on high.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/20/senate-section/article/S5935-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5935-S5936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                ETHIOPIA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, Ethiopia has increasingly been an active \nparticipant in the international community and a leader on the African \ncontinent--as a charter member of the United Nations, a cofounder of \nwhat are now the African Union and Intergovernmental Authority on \nDevelopment, and a key partner in combating international terrorism. \nAfter decades, and some would say centuries of civil strife, the 1994 \nConstitution and election of the coalition Ethiopian People's \nRevolutionary Democratic Front, EPRDF, in 1995 seemed to herald the \nbeginning of an era of peace, democracy, and development. Efforts to \nreform the economy and political dynamics, while slow, reversed the \ndevastating impact of the Derg and gave the people of Ethiopia some \nhope that a robust democracy was really taking root. In fact, in the \nrunup to the 2005 elections, there was a deliberate and significant \nopening of political space--which included broad media coverage of \nopposition parties, relatively unimpeded access for opposition \ncandidates to their constituents, and live televised debates between \nopposition candidates and ruling party incumbents. But in the aftermath \nof that May 2005 election--which ended in a deeply flawed process and \naggressive tactics against the opposition--the ruling party has \nratcheted up its rhetoric while backtracking significantly on its \ncommitment to democracy. A newly proposed bill, called the Charities \nand Societies Proclamation, is the most recent indication of this \nbacksliding.\n  Indeed, for years, the U.S. State Department has reported \n``widespread human rights abuses'' in its annual country report on \nEthiopia. Among the most consistent violations listed are the \nintimidation, beating, abuse, and arbitrary arrest and detention by \nGovernment security forces of journalists, opposition supporters, union \nleaders, and others who dare to challenge the ruling party. Some of the \nmore egregious examples associated with the growing opposition began in \n2005 and include the arrest and prosecution for capital offenses of 131 \nmajor opposition leaders and the arbitrary detention of 30,000 to \n50,000 civilians without charge. The ruling party also forcibly closed \nopposition political offices that same year and kept them closed \nthrough the eve of local elections this past April. Such conduct is a \nclear violation of regional and international human rights laws, to \nwhich Ethiopia is a signatory, and directly contradicts the country's \nown Constitution, still only 12 years old.\n  Over the past year, I have become increasingly concerned by reports \ncoming out of the Ogadan region of Ethiopia regarding military attacks \non civilians and Government blockades of essential humanitarian and \ncommercial supplies. National and international aid organizations with \nfield missions in the area describe security forces burning villages \nand Government officials ordering entire village populations to move to \nspecific ``resettlement'' locations that lack sufficient\n\n[[Page S5936]]\n\nfood, water, medical services, and sanitation facilities. Despite the \nnumerous credible reports coming out of the region, the Ethiopian \nGovernment has denied that such violations may be occurring and has \nrefused to even investigate these allegations and/or permit independent \nassessments of conditions in the region. Such stonewalling only further \nundermines the rule of law and the Government's obligation to protect \nits civilian population.\n  The aid organizations now struggling to keep these Ethiopian \ncivilians alive, as well as national and international human rights \ndefenders, democracy advocates, independent journalists, and \nhumanitarian organizations seeking to consolidate and extend peace, \ndemocracy, and development in Ethiopia, are already facing cumbersome \nbureaucratic rules and sometime succumb to self-censorship to avoid \nGovernment reprisals. The Ethiopian Government's new law, if passed in \nits current format, would make it almost impossible for these groups \nand individuals to continue their important efforts. Under the \nCharities and Societies Proclamation, non-Ethiopian organizations would \nbe prohibited from engaging in democracy, human rights, good \ngovernance, or conflict resolution activities, and national civil \nsociety groups would have to forgo foreign funding and submit to strict \nGovernment regulation.\n  To reaffirm and facilitate Ethiopia's commitment to and progress \ntowards democratic development, eliminating extremism, good governance, \ncombating HIV/AIDS, improving agricultural productivity, and reducing \nchronic hunger, the U.S. Government has provided billions of dollars \nworth of assistance in recent years with more than $700 million already \nin fiscal year 2008. The majority of this support is delivered through \nU.S.-based nongovernmental organizations that offer essential services \nand supplies to civilians as well as valuable technical assistance and \nresources to strengthen Ethiopian institutions and infrastructure. The \nnew restrictions and regulations would severely limit or even prohibit \nmuch of this assistance and should cause the United States as well as \nother international donors to reconsider whether contributions to \nEthiopia can further democracy, development and accountability.\n  The Ethiopian Government claims the new regulations are aimed at \nimproving the accountability and transparency of civil society \norganizations operating in Ethiopia. But what the provisions would \nactually do is erode the Government's own accountability and \ntransparency by impeding these organizations' ability to serve their \nessential watchdog functions. This is not the time or place for tighter \ncontrols. Instead, the Ethiopian Government should support improvements \nin the quality and capacity of these groups, which are vital to the \ncountry's continued political, economic, and social development.\n  The United States needs to work with our partners--both on the \ncontinent and off it--and strongly oppose the imposition of this new \nproclamation to protect the gains Ethiopia has made in recent years and \npave the way for further consolidation of growth and democracy. If \npassed in its current format, this bill would have a devastating impact \non our foreign policy objectives and Ethiopia's development as a robust \ndemocracy. And, even if revised and amended, passage of this bill would \nstill send a negative message, that of a government desperately seeking \nto hold on to power and dismantle any groups that might expose its \nfailures or limitations. We must stand with the people of Ethiopia and \nwith the principles that Americans hold dear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/20/senate-section/article/S5936-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           WORLD REFUGEE DAY\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today, on World Refugee Day, we \nrecognize the millions of innocent people who are living as refugees \ndue to violence, unrest, and natural disasters. Each day, refugees \nstruggle to survive in an unstable environment where they are often \nunable to further their education, make a living for themselves, or \nobtain adequate health care.\n  The struggles refugees face are unimaginable. Being forced to flee \nyour home, often to encounter precarious, crowded living conditions in \na strange place, is particularly treacherous for women, given the \npervasive problems of sexual abuse, beatings, and sometimes torture. \nDisplaced people who make it to refugee camps have often already \nsurvived extremely difficult situations as they cling to the hope that \nthey will one day be able to return to their homes.\n  Protracted conflicts and humanitarian crises increase instability and \nnegatively impact the livelihoods of refugees we have seen this in \ncountries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, eastern \nChad, Jordan, and Syria. In each of these countries and in many other \nplaces around the world, national and international nongovernmental \norganizations confront challenging circumstances to meet the basic \nneeds of refugees and protect their human rights. The international \ncommunity and host governments must make it a priority to ensure \nsupport and access for these groups so that they can serve vulnerable \nrefugee populations. Every time a refugee dies from an easily \npreventable disease or from living in unsanitary conditions, we are \nfailing to live up to our collective responsibility.\n  But we cannot accept disaster response as the only option. We must be \nworking harder to create systems that anticipate and prevent conflicts \nfrom arising so we can stop mass displacement before it even begins. We \nneed to use all our resources to prevent such crises from occurring.\n  As we recognize World Refugee Day, we acknowledge the strength and \nsurvival of refugees, and we commit not just today, but every day, to \nwork towards creating a world where governments fulfill their basic \nresponsibility to protect their citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/20/senate-section/article/S5936-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               BOY SCOUTS AT THE LITTLE SIOUX SCOUT RANCH\n\n  Mr. ENZI.

As the \nMidwest continues to experience devastating storms that have shocked us \nall, I would like to take time to remember four young boys from that \narea who were recently laid to rest.

As an Eagle \nScout myself, I share a deep connection with these boys from Iowa and \nNebraska, along with all Scouts throughout America. The path to \nbecoming an Eagle is much like the path our future leaders should take, \nand although the lives of these four young boys were ended abruptly, \nthey were on that path.\n  As I recall the Scout motto of ``Be Prepared,'' I can't help but to \nthink of the emergency drill these Scouts practiced the day before the \ntornado or how the Scouts moved swiftly to assist with their first-aid \nskills the 48 who were injured. The Scouting community has suffered a \ngreat loss. My thoughts and prayers go out to the families, friends, \nand Scouts whose lives were touched by these four boys.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/20/senate-section/article/S5936-3", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5936-S5937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO COLONEL GREGG P.

Gregg Olson, \nUSMC, who will complete his 2 year tour of duty with the United States \nMarine Corps' Office of Legislative Affairs on June 24, 2008. I have \nhad the pleasure to work with Colonel Olson on many occasions. In his \nrole as the Director of the Marine Corps' Senate Liaison Office, he has \nprovided superb support, acting as the principal conduit for \ninformation between the Marine Corps and many members of the Senate. \nHis affable personality and attention to duty contributed to a highly \nsuccessful relationship between the United States Senate and the United \nStates Marine Corps. Though he will continue his service to the Marine \nCorps and the country, he will be sorely missed.\n  A native of Rhode Island, Colonel Olson attended the United States \nNaval Academy, and received a commission as a Second Lieutenant in the \nUnited States Marine Corps in 1985. His career as a Marine officer has \nbeen exemplary, serving with distinction in every post he has been \nassigned. Prior to his assignment to the United States Senate, he \nserved two tours in Iraq,\n\n[[Page S5937]]\n\nfirst as an Operations Officer to a Marine Expeditionary Unit in 2003, \nand then as a Battalion Commander in Fallujah, Iraq in 2004. His \nbattalion was involved in the Battle of Fallujah, which saw some of the \nmost intense house-to-house fighting of the war. Many proud Marines \nunder his command gave their lives in that battle.\n  Over the past 24 months, his unselfish devotion to duty, exceptional \nperformance, and outstanding professionalism have translated into \ninvaluable service to the Senate. He has advised Members and Senate \nstaff members on matters of great importance to the United States \nMarine Corps. In the fluid nature of the legislative cycle, he \ndistinguished himself by establishing and developing great working \nrelationships with Senators and their staffs. He responded to thousands \nof congressional inquiries, ranging from such sensitive issues as \nnotification of combat casualties, to providing timely information on \nthe operations and budget of the Marine Corps.\n  He also planned and executed approximately 15 international \ncongressional delegations. I had the pleasure of traveling on several \nof these congressional delegations with Colonel Olson. His acumen for \nsocial interaction carried over into Colonel Olson's ability to \nrepresent his service at numerous Marine Corps and Joint Service social \nevents on Capitol Hill. Among others, these events included the Marine \nCorps Birthday Commemoration, the Joint Services Reception, and several \nMarine Corps fall and spring receptions--all important events that \nenabled me and my Senate colleagues to maintain close relationships \nwith the Marine Corps' senior leadership.\n  On behalf of the Senate, I thank Colonel Olson for his continued \nservice to the Nation and the United States Marine Corps, and I thank \nhis wife, Dawn, for her steadfast support while he fulfilled this \nessential duty. As Gregg departs the Senate to assume command of the \n11th Marine Expeditionary Unit at Camp Pendleton, CA, we in the U.S. \nSenate wish him all the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/20/senate-section/article/S5937-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HONORING TROOPER DAVID SHAWN BLANTON, JR.\n\n  Mr. BURR.

David \nis the 59th North Carolina State Trooper to have been killed in the \nline of duty.\n  David was only 24 years old and was a 2-year veteran of the North \nCarolina Highway Patrol. He was a native of Sylva, NC, and a 2002 \ngraduate of Smoky Mountain High School where he was a football and \nwrestling star.\n  We are all grateful for David's dedication to protecting the citizens \nof North Carolina. He lived in Cherokee with his wife Michaela, who had \njust given birth to their son Tye 2 weeks ago.\n  David was a member of the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indian Tribe \nand the first member of that tribe to serve with the Highway Patrol. In \naddition to being a State trooper, David volunteered as the Junior \nVarsity softball coach at Smoky Mountain High School.\n  Along with his wife Michaela and son Tye, David is survived by his \nfather, David S. Blanton, Sr., mother, Jennifer Blanton, and younger \nbrother, Jesse Blanton.\n  David's friends, family, fellow troopers, and the people of North \nCarolina are mourning this very tragic loss.\n  I know there are no words I can offer to help comfort Michaela and \nother members of the Blanton family, but I hope my colleagues in the \nSenate will join me in keeping them in our thoughts and prayers.\n  David gave his life in service to our State, and this ultimate \nsacrifice should never be forgotten.\n  I send my deepest condolences to all who had the privilege of knowing \nthis young man who gave his life in service to our State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/20/senate-section/article/S5937-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5937-S5939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, earlier this week, I asked Idahoans to \nshare with me how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and \nthey responded by the hundreds. The stories, now numbering over 1,000, \nare heartbreaking and touching. To respect their efforts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through energy_prices@crapo \n.senate.gov to the Congressional Record. This is not an issue that will \nbe easily resolved, but it is one that deserves immediate and serious \nattention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. Their stories not only \ndetail their struggles to meet everyday expenses, but also have \nsuggestions and recommendations as to what Congress can do now to \ntackle this problem and find solutions that last beyond today. I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record today's letters.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Senator Crapo: We are not going to be able to take any time \n     to enjoy our great state of Idaho this summer as with years \n     past. The gas to go and return from our favorite spots like \n     Stanley basin, Warm Lake, McCall's Ponderosa State Park is \n     just too much to make it enjoyable. The cost of food clearly \n     is reflective of the fuel pricing. This just makes it far too \n     expensive to go anywhere this summer. I am absolutely \n     disgusted in the way our government is allowing this to \n     happen to the American people.\n       I look forward to a movement to begin re-commissioning our \n     own drilling rigs that still sit idle in the Gulf of Mexico.\n       I look forward to a movement to begin drilling on our own \n     land for oil that we all know is right under our own borders.\n       I look forward to a movement to release and discontinue the \n     excessive storage of emergency fuels.\n       I also know that I am not alone in monitoring the existing \n     administration who will not lobby for these items I list to \n     be addressed and resolved. It is time we start taking care of \n     our own with our own resources. This includes limiting the \n     impacts on the greater population by the loud concerns of a \n     few groups. With today's technology we can certainly drill \n     and protect our environment and begin to reduce greatly our \n     dependence on foreign oil(s).\n           Respectfully,\n     Bill, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo: As one of those who voted for you I am \n     pleased to provide a bit of input on the costs of fuel and \n     the impact on myself, my family, and my business.\n       Just like the majority of Idaho families, our family has \n     been directly impacted by the very high prices of gasoline \n     and the way it happened . . . so quickly and without reprieve \n     or real alternatives.\n       In my business, I must have a good supply of gasoline in \n     order to function. I operate a flight training school for \n     pilots in Nampa. My costs for fuel are always around $10,000 \n     per year and that is normally my one major expense associated \n     with my business outside of the other normal overhead costs \n     any other business has. Even so, it is the Numero Uno cost \n     for my business, and now it is about 50% increased from that \n     already very high price. What compounds this loss is that so \n     many people have become too financially short that my \n     customer base is very low now.\n       Normally, in the past 7 years, I would be looking at a full \n     student schedule, with at least 3 or 4 on a waiting list. \n     This year, I have a 20% load and no waiting list. It is that \n     sparse due to the economy, then compounded by the very high \n     fuel costs.\n       Thanks for the opportunity to provide some direct input on \n     the subject to your office.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Gary, Nampa.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator: The biggest impact that gas prices has had on \n     me affects our family. We have six married children and one \n     single daughter spread throughout the west. One in Colorado \n     Springs, CO; another in Mesa, AZ; two in the Orem, UT, area; \n     another in dental school at Marquette; and two in the Boise \n     area. We plan a family reunion every summer, which is usually \n     our once-a-year gathering. We have cancelled our reunion this \n     year, scheduled for Colorado Springs, CO, because of the cost \n     of fuel for everyone. I just can't tell you how disappointing \n     it is to all of us not to have an opportunity to be together \n     this year. We hope that it will not stop us next year.\n       I hear all of the reports that America has ample supplies \n     but legislation and environmentalists prevent us from \n     developing the natural resources. We are too late for today, \n     but tomorrow will be here and we need to be prepared to \n     provide for ourselves. All that you can do to make this \n     possible is needed and necessary. Please do your best to make \n     it happen.\n     Doug.\n                                  ____\n\n       PLEASE pass emergency legislation to exploit America's \n     natural resources. Authorize drilling wherever oil companies \n     think there might be oil or natural gas, authorize nuclear \n     energy and wind power. Set up drilling stations off America's \n     shores instead of letting Cuba and China take our oil. Show \n     some resolve and Yankee ingenuity!\n       Americans will downsize and conserve--the market will take \n     care of that, but you should have had us energy independent \n     years ago. We could be sending money to America instead of \n     supporting people who do not have our country's best interest \n     at heart.\n\n[[Page S5938]]\n\n       Americans used to take care of problems before this \n     developed into such a serious situation. We used to take care \n     of people who wanted to cause us harm instead of insisting on \n     being ``politically correct''. Strong countries do not get \n     attacked. Weak countries like what we are becoming do! \n     Congress and the rest of us have all seen this problem coming \n     for many years. Do nothing now and we are on our way to \n     becoming a second-class country.\n       Please show the leadership that you were elected to use. \n     Make us energy independent. It does not matter if it takes \n     ten years. Ten years ago, if Congress had ``taken care of \n     business,'' we would not be in this dire situation now. Every \n     drop of oil that is produced in this country is one drop that \n     does not have to be imported from another country.\n     Stan, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo: Thank you first for this opportunity to \n     voice my concerns, which I'm sure are no different than \n     millions of others. The energy price effect on me is no \n     different than on, I'm sure again, millions of others. It \n     means no vacation, less ``extracurricular'' activities and \n     simply prioritizing vehicle use. Unfortunately, the energy \n     prices have a ripple affect on a lot of things, but I suspect \n     what has the largest impact is the price of food, which is \n     also increasing substantially as it costs so much more to \n     transport it.\n       I think Congress' number one priority right now should be \n     reducing the cost of oil/gasoline; however, it is done. I \n     believe that, by doing so, you will resolve and/or improve \n     the majority of other inflation concerns, i.e., the cost of \n     food, clothing. By reducing energy costs, it would likely \n     free up businesses to expand and provide additional jobs, \n     thus reducing unemployment. I see gasoline prices as the \n     ``bane'' of our life right now and anything you can do to \n     resolve this problem is much appreciated.\n     Ket, Emmett.\n                                  ____\n\n       You and Congress know what needs to be done. Drill now--\n     drill HERE! Join China and Cuba off our own shores and become \n     self reliant again. Start drilling in Anwar. Start drilling \n     in Montana. Start using the resources in Colorado in shale. \n     And build more refineries--and you--CONGRESS--loosen the \n     hurdles that make it impossible for anyone drilling and/or \n     building those refineries we need so much--as well as provide \n     alternatives (such as nuclear and solar). Stop wasting time \n     telling ``stories''--and loosen the restrictions that \n     environmentalists have shackled us with! Do your job.\n       Just let us become a self reliant nation again!\n     Unsigned.\n                                  ____\n\n       The rising gas prices have really affected my life. I am a \n     widow who is on a very limited budget--every nickel counts. I \n     am still working and live about 15 miles from my work. There \n     is no public transportation out where I live in Kuna, ID, so \n     I have to bite the bullet and pay these exorbitant prices at \n     the pump, do without going to the movies, out to dinner or \n     buying the new pair of sandals I need for the summer. My \n     elderly mom lives with me and requires lots of travel into \n     town for doctor appointments, which take gas. I usually take \n     her each summer to Wyoming to her home town for a visit. No \n     way can I do it this year what with the gas prices, rising \n     motel costs, food costs, etc. I was in hopes I could look at \n     retiring in a couple of years, but that is definitely on hold \n     now. I can't afford not to work with gas costing me over $50 \n     each week to fill up my car. Sure hope Congress gets going \n     and allows us to start drilling for our own oil!\n     Louise, Kuna.\n                                  ____\n\n       What I would like to see is a two-pronged approach, One is \n     drilling offshore in Alaska, and oil shale in Utah/Colorado/\n     Wyoming, Montana and North Dakota, along with nuclear, solar \n     and wind.\n       The other is conserving in ways such as: by 2010 all \n     appliances sold are Energy Star-rated; all houses and mobile \n     homes to be built to the Energy Star rating. Instead of the \n     government giving big grants for research, why not do like \n     the X-prize for space travel and put up money for benchmark \n     improvements in things such as 100-mpg cars, solar \n     improvements, wind generator improvements, home energy use \n     improvements, etc. I used to own a hatchback in the late \n     1980s that I would get 42-44 miles to the gallon on the \n     highway. Why cars of that size can't get 60+mpg now is beyond \n     me.\n       Without the Republicans acting more like Teddy Roosevelt \n     and less like George Bush, the Democrats will never go along \n     with the offshore or Alaskan drilling. The other thing that \n     you and other Republicans need to do is to go before the \n     American people and say ``The Democrats in Congress are \n     against the middle class jobs and real living middle class \n     wages and benefits that would be provided with the opening of \n     these locations. Norway can drill safely off their shores, \n     and I know the American people can do an even better job of \n     protecting the environment then they can.\n       Thanks for your time,\n     Unsigned.\n                                  ____\n\n       For us personally the high costs of fuel and heating oil \n     have caused some huge changes in our lives. We are senior \n     citizens on a fixed income and the rising costs of fuel and \n     food are way greater then our income and projected cost of \n     living raises that we get from Social Security. Recently we \n     had a death in our family--in another state. The cost of \n     driving or flying there made it very hard for us in our \n     decision not to go. Also we are staying home a lot more. We \n     cannot afford pleasure trips so we have to make every trip to \n     town count. We see people who have to drive out of town to \n     work--and the fuel costs can outweigh the benefits of \n     working. I see American aid poured out to other countries who \n     are in crises and yet the crises right here at home are being \n     overlooked.\n       Please take care of Americans first! Stop this oil from \n     going any higher!\n           Sincerely,\n     Ray and Vi Mueller, Priest River.\n                                  ____\n\n       We are an average family of five--Dad, Mom, 16-year-old \n     boy, 9-year-old girl, and 4-year-old girl. My husband is in \n     new home construction, and I am an accounts payable clerk for \n     a university. We both work full-time jobs, and both of us \n     work part-time night and weekend jobs to help make ends-meet. \n     My daughter was diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis \n     a year ago, so we have some very big medical expenses. We \n     have had to travel to Primary Children's Hospital in Salt \n     Lake City, Utah, from our home in Rexburg, Idaho, every six \n     weeks for the last year. Because of the rise in gas prices \n     and the rising medical costs, I have to work a second job to \n     pay for these expenses. Our vehicle is a 2005 Yukon that gets \n     about 16 miles to the gallon, so this trip is not economical, \n     but I don't have any choice but to make this trip every \n     six weeks. Because of the rise in gas, I can't even trade \n     my SUV in on another car because the car dealers won't \n     trade with me. My employer provides medical insurance with \n     my monthly premium costing $250 for my family. My \n     daughter's medication is almost $200 per month and I pay \n     hospital/doctors/lab bills almost $300 per month. With \n     each increase in our monthly expenses, it becomes more \n     difficult to pay our bills. We need help! I am hoping and \n     praying for something good to happen that will help reduce \n     our monthly expenses.\n           Thank you,\n     Taunya, Rexburg.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo: As you know the driving distance in our \n     state is unlike most states. My husband and I both travel \n     over 23 miles one way to work every day. Due to the continual \n     increase in cost of the gas we have been carpooling together \n     for over a year now. The biggest problem we have is with \n     every increase in gas so does the increase of everything else \n     you buy, but the wages have not gone up with it.\n       Every time we fill our tank, it takes away from groceries \n     and other necessities; with every increase, we are to the \n     point there is not much more to give up. The cupboards are \n     bare, and we try to get by on what is the cheapest and bare \n     minimum, if it continues to go up as it has, we will get to \n     the point were we have to choose between the mortgages and \n     utilities or gas in the tank. If it were not so far away, we \n     would consider riding horses to work every day.\n       I think as long as the environment and nature is preserved \n     and monitored, domestic production is OK along with \n     alternative sources. We need to quit being so reliant on \n     foreign oil and start helping ourselves not only for now but \n     for the future.\n     Esther, Athol.\n                                  ____\n\n       Sir: I am fairly new to Idaho only been here for five years \n     now. I was from Texas. I had some very good friends who [had \n     to cap their family well, which put out 10 to 15 barrels a \n     day]. A lot of people were hurt, not only in Texas, but in \n     other states as well. We should move forward much faster on \n     the part gas/part electric cars for now even the big one to. \n     We should use our own oil and move to anything that we can \n     make for ourselves. I don't like it, but we have to stop \n     being everyone's go-to-guy and start taking care of us for a \n     change.\n     Philip.\n                                  ____\n\n       I do not wish to share my story but I would like to \n     recommend that we quit sending the Alaskan oil to Japan and \n     use it within the United States.\n       I also would like to see Congress open up the known oil \n     fields in the United States today (not someday). Many have \n     been shut down and capped for years. Plus we need to explore \n     for new sites as well as start drilling where we already know \n     there is oil. We need to start building refineries and \n     updating the current ones that we have. Why we ever got \n     ourselves in this mess is beyond me.\n       I would also like to recommend that you talk with John \n     McCain and help him get his head on straight. I am not sure \n     why our party has chosen a Socialist for its candidate. If I \n     didn't feel like I was throwing my vote away and maybe even \n     help elect Obama, I would vote for Barr.\n       If the Congress continues to do nothing about the energy \n     problem, I think this nation will come down on Congress with \n     a vengeance.\n     Suzette.\n                                  ____\n\n       The cost of fuel has certainly changed the way I am now \n     living my life. After my retirement, I was planning on visits \n     to my sister (Arizona), my grandkids (Portland) and my \n     cousins in Missouri and New Mexico.\n       Now I am tending my garden, growing as much of my food as \n     possible to supplement and help offset the high price in the \n     grocery store. I am not using my clothes dryer; I am lucky \n     enough to live in a subdivision that still allows clothes \n     lines. This might seem minor, but I am cringing at the cost \n     of heating my home this winter and am applying extra money to \n     the gas company.\n\n[[Page S5939]]\n\n       I do not go out to lunch with my friends; we talk on the \n     phone but do not have lunches out.

Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize the presentation of the Diane Reese Award to \nMarilyn J. Smith for her work as the president and cofounder of the \nAbused Deaf Women's Advocacy Services in Seattle, WA. The presentation \ntook place in the Library of Congress during a major conference on \ndomestic violence.\n  This award is much more than recognition of an individual who has \ngone above and beyond to help those who have and still are suffering \nfrom the terrible domestic violence abuses happening daily. This award \nrecognizes a way of life that has inspired and helped countless people \nthat are in need. I would like to commend Marilyn J.

Although Ms. Reese's \nsocial justice work started long before her life moving journey to the \ncoalfields of West Virginia, it was that journey that connected both of \nour lives together.\n  I was able to witness firsthand Diane's ability to gracefully build \nthe West Virginia Coalition Against Domestic Violence. Working with Sue \nJulian, who still is a team coordinator at the Coalition, they provided \nthe leadership to create a strong program that has grown into a network \nof shelters, outreach centers, and support groups throughout West \nVirginia. Diane inspired many thanks to her steady, quiet but fully \ncommitted life. Sue and the rest of the coalition continue that work.\n  Visiting the various shelters Diane helped set up in the early 1990s \nwas a very moving opportunity that I feel very fortunate to have \nexperienced. Working closely with Ms. Reese and the coalition, we \nfought together for the passage of the first Federal Violence Against \nWomen Act and its subsequent reauthorizations. I have continued to work \nwith the coalition and have tried to help with vital Federal grants. \nDiane, Sue, and the coalition have played a pivotal role in advising me \nabout the Violence Against Women Act over the years.\n  In West Virginia, Diane Reese touched the lives of so many with her \nunique ability to heal and serve those in need. Throughout her years of \nserving the public, Diane became an adjunct faculty at Southern WV \nCommunity College and was an active member in the Mountaineer Food \nBank, the Appalachian Research and Defense Fund Board, the National \nCoalition Against Domestic Violence, just to name a few. As you can \nsee, Diane certainly went above and beyond the norm with her generosity \nand charity.\n  Just last year the West Virginia Coalition Against Domestic Violence \nthat Diane helped to create provided support to over 15,000 people, \nincluding children. As you can tell, the numbers of those touched by \nher life are enormous. Her community organizing efforts, spirit for \nsocial justice, and expert skills as an educator made her a good \ncounselor and dear friend.\n  I and all the people who knew and worked with her were saddened to \nlose her, and we mourn her still. But Diane has an extraordinary legacy \nthat lives on in the work of the coalition in West Virginia and the \nnational award that continues to inspire and acknowledge the next \ngeneration of advocates. Diane Reese pursued every obstacle she faced \nwith knowledge, kindness, respect, expertise, and conquered each one of \nthem with grace and optimism. Those of us lucky enough to know her \npersonally will also remember her, and the award in her memory \ncontinues to inspire all of us. And, I know that with the great \nchallenges that still face the victims and survivors of domestic \nviolence, Diane would be urging us to continue the work she began and \nreminding us that the goal of securing peace at home for everyone is a \ngoal upon which we must never give up.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/20/senate-section/article/S5939-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5939-S5940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HONORING LIEUTENANT COLONEL CRAIG M. GREENE\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and pay \ntribute to LTC Craig M. Greene, deputy chief, Army Senate Liaison \nDivision, Office of the Chief of Legislative Liaison, who will retire \nSeptember 1, 2008. I wish to commend and congratulate Lieutenant \nColonel Craig Greene upon his retirement.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Greene's distinguished career as an infantry \nofficer embodies all of the Army's values of loyalty, duty, respect, \nhonor, integrity, and personal courage and spans 20 years, during which \nhe has distinguished himself as both a soldier and leader.\n  Upon graduating from the University of Massachusetts, Lieutenant \nColonel Greene served as an infantry officer in command and staff \npositions in a number of infantry units. Prior to Lieutenant Colonel \nGreene's assignment to the Office of Chief of Legislative Liaison, he \nwas assigned to the 25th Infantry Division, Light, Schofield Barracks, \nHI, from 2001 to 2003. His experience in the Army's Officer Personnel \nManagement Command led to Lieutenant Colonel Greene being selected to \nserve as the brigade S-1 for the 2nd Brigade ``Warriors'' and the \nsecretary to the General Staff for the Commanding General. The \nconsummate professional, Lieutenant Colonel Greene revised internal \nsystems to streamline information flow and the decisionmaking process \nto include instituting a ``Battle Rhythm'' for the division staff \neliminating redundant meetings and events.\n  In his more recent position as a congressional liaison, I have come \nto know and respect Lieutenant Colonel Greene. A natural at building \nand maintaining relationships with Members of Congress and their \nstaffs, Lieutenant Colonel Greene was invaluable as the Army faced many \nchallenges associated with its budget and real-world combat operations \nin the global war on terror. Members knew they could count on \nLieutenant Colonel Greene for his counsel, professional advice, and \nunwavering integrity.\n  While assigned to the Office of Congressional Legislative Liaison, \nLieutenant Colonel Greene prepared members of the Army staff for over \n20 hearings and orchestrated over 150 congressional engagements to \nensure Congress understood the Army programs and budget requirements to \ngrow and transform the Army. Lieutenant Colonel Greene escorted over 50 \ncongressional delegations worldwide.\n  His expertise concerning congressional affairs, his strategic, \noperational, and tactical knowledge of the Army, combined with his keen \nintuition and ability to develop key relationships have been \ninstrumental in enabling the chief of legislative liaison and the Army \nto meet the Army's legislative objectives. Lieutenant Colonel Greene \nhas escorted 12 delegations to Iraq and Afghanistan, in support of \nOperation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. I was \nprivileged to have Lieutenant Colonel Greene as an escort on several of \nmy own trips.\n  A tireless worker, he coordinated with all of the relevant agencies \nand individuals to ensure my overseas travel was always successful. I \nam extremely grateful for the service he provided me and my staff \nduring those trips.\n  During his distinguished Army career, Lieutenant Colonel Greene has \nbeen awarded numerous accolades, including the Defense Meritorious \nMedal, four Meritorious Service Medals, five Army Accommodation Medals, \ntwo Army Achievement Medals, the Expert Infantry Badge, the Ranger Tab, \nand Parachutist and Air Assault Badge.\n\n[[Page S5940]]\n\n  Lieutenant Colonel Greene's faithful service, leadership, loyalty, \nand dedication to duty uphold the highest traditions of military \nservice, and he has repeatedly stood for the defense of this Nation. \nHis devotion to the defense of liberty epitomizes the words soldier, \npatriot and American.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in thanking Lieutenant Colonel \nCraig M. Greene for his service to our Nation and the U.S. Army. I \nthank his wife, Michelle, and his sons, Jackson and Austin, for their \nsupport while he fulfilled this essential duty to our country. I \npersonally wish the Greene family all the best as they celebrate \nLieutenant Colonel Greene's richly deserved retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/20/senate-section/article/S5940-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               NIKE INC.\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I wish to highlight the importance \nof acknowledging and celebrating extraordinary efforts by individuals \nand companies that are leading the way in protecting and preserving \nAmerica's natural resources. I am honored to congratulate the \nleadership and employees of Nike Inc., headquartered in my State of \nOregon.\n  According to a new scorecard released by nonprofit group Climate \nCounts, Nike ranked first among the United States' most climate-\nfriendly companies. The scorecard, first released in June 2007, grades \nmajor corporations in well-known consumer sectors from apparel to \nelectronics to fast food--on their commitment to reversing climate \nchange. Nike was judged to have one of the strongest and most \ntransparent programs to reduce climate change among well-known brands \nacross nine industry sectors.\n  Nike has taken aggressive steps to address climate change, including \nestablishing clear goals for lowering carbon emissions at its \nfacilities around the world, designing sustainable products with \nenvironmentally preferable materials, purchasing renewable power, and \noffsetting the emissions from Nike business travel. More importantly, \nNike is exporting not only their world class products, but they are \nalso exporting the values of sustainability throughout the world as \nthey continue their efforts to reduce the company's carbon footprint in \nits contract manufacturing facilities in Asia.\n  We can also see Nike's commitment to this effort in another very real \nway. Nike has been a leader in developing sustainable products and \ncomponents since its inception. Most recently, Nike unveiled the Air \nNative N7 shoe designed for Native Americans. The N7 in the name is a \nreference to the seventh generation theory, used by many Native \nAmerican tribes to look to the three generations preceding them for \nwisdom and the three generations ahead for their legacy. By designing \nthis sustainable shoe, Nike is looking ahead to a future that must \ninclude greater awareness in protecting our environment and natural \nresources for the generations to follow.\n  My home State of Oregon continues to build on a long history of \ninnovation in environmental policy and practice. Nike proves once again \nthat everyone doing their small part can achieve huge successes. Nike's \nlegacy continues to grow as they lead the way as an extremely \nsuccessful company but not forgetting about how important it is to \npreserve and protect the natural resources around us. I commend the \nleadership and employees with the Nike team for their stellar efforts \nand pledge my full support as they move forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/20/senate-section/article/S5940-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:35 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the amendments of the Senate to an amendment of the House to \nthe amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 2642) making \nappropriations for military construction, the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n2008, and for other purposes, with an amendment; and has agreed to the \nSenate engrossed amendment with an amendment.\n  The message also announced that the House has passed the following \nbills, in which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 5511.

A bill to amend part E of title IV of the Social Security \nAct to allow children in foster care to be placed with their parents in \nresidential family treatment centers that provide safe environments for \ntreating addiction and promoting healthy parenting; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise before you today to introduce \nthe Keeping Families Safe Act of 2008 which seeks to keep families \ntogether when a parent is in a residential substance abuse treatment \nfacility. Numerous studies have shown the benefits of keeping families \nunited as a parent undergoes substance abuse treatment. In fact, one \nstudy found that 60 percent of mothers who participated in the Pregnant \nand Postpartum Women and Their Infants program were completely clean \nand sober six months after their discharge. This same study found that \n88 percent of these children were still with their mothers six months \nafter the mother was discharged. However, only 5 percent of all \nsubstances abuse treatment facilities are able to accommodate children.\n  Congress has shown support for comprehensive family based substance \nabuse treatment facilities in the past. In 2006, Congress passed the \nDeficit Reduction Act, which included a $40 million grant program, to \npromote two key goals, substance abuse services for families in the \nchild welfare system, and regular caseworker visits.\n  The Keeping Families Safe Act is one way to invest in children and \nfamilies. This legislation would allow children, who are in foster \ncare, to be with their parent while he or she is receiving treatment at \nresidential comprehensive family-based substance abuse treatment \ncenters. These facilities provide comprehensive services to both parent \nand child. If this family based approach is not available, these \nchildren would often be forced to claim Federal funding in the foster \ncare system. By using these funds instead to go to the residential \nfacility with their parent, the chances for success are much greater.\n  Family based substance abuse treatment centers have proven to be an \neffective means of treating substance abuse and reuniting families. \nMany of the parents in treatment are there in hopes of overcoming their \naddiction and reuniting with their children. This bill is designed to \ngive them that chance. I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation to help keep families together and provide another funding \nsource for these important facilities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nplaced in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3173\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Keeping Families Safe Act of \n     2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The 2001 report by the Center for Substance Abuse \n     Treatment (CSAT) of the Pregnant and Postpartum Women and \n     Their Infants Program, which provides comprehensive, family-\n     based treatment for substance abusing mothers and their \n     children, found that at 6 months post treatment--\n       (A) 60 percent of the mothers remained alcohol and drug-\n     free;\n       (B) drug-related offenses declined from 28 percent to 7 \n     percent; and\n       (C) 75 percent of the mothers had physical custody of 1 or \n     more children.\n       (2) The 2003 evaluation of the Center for Substance Abuse \n     Treatment (CSAT) of the\n\n[[Page S5942]]\n\n     Pregnant and Postpartum Women and Their Infants Program of 24 \n     residential family-based treatment programs 6 months after \n     treatment revealed the following successful outcomes for \n     mothers and their children:\n       (A) 60 percent of the mothers in the programs remained \n     completely clean and sober 6 months after discharge.\n       (B) 44 percent of the children in the programs were \n     returned to their mothers from foster care.\n       (C) 88 percent of the children treated in the programs with \n     their mothers remained stabilized and living with their \n     mothers, 6 months after discharge.\n       (3) The Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) of the \n     Pregnant and Postpartum Women and Their Infants Program has \n     found that rates of premature delivery, low birth weight, and \n     infant mortality were improved for women who participated in \n     the program, the costs of treating such women were offset by \n     as much as 3 to 4 times the savings that resulted from \n     reduced costs of crime, foster care, Temporary Assistance to \n     Needy Families (TANF) assistance, and adverse birth outcomes.\n\n     SEC. 3.

RECOGNITION MONTH''\n\n  Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Hagel) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 597\n\n       Whereas ``Wait Wait . . . Don't Tell Me!'', the National \n     Public Radio news quiz show, which uses current news stories \n     for questions and comedy, is celebrating the 10th anniversary \n     of the show's premiere in 1998;\n       Whereas the programming and content created and distributed \n     by National Public Radio is based on 3 core values, qualities \n     of mind, qualities of heart, and qualities of craft (and \n     despite those core values, National Public Radio still airs \n     shows like ``Wait Wait . . . Don't Tell Me!'' with a straight \n     corporate face);\n       Whereas, in 2008, ``Wait Wait . . . Don't Tell Me!'' was \n     named a winner of the George Foster Peabody Award, the oldest \n     and most prestigious award in broadcasting (probably due to \n     George Foster Peabody's lifelong commitment to self-\n     aggrandizing entertainers, spectacularly dumb criminals, and \n     overly earnest scientists, who comprise the inspiration for \n     the show);\n       Whereas ``Wait Wait . . . Don't Tell Me!'' carries on the \n     tradition of humor that is part of our Second City by taping \n     its show in the Chase Auditorium in downtown Chicago, \n     Illinois (which may be the only place in the United States \n     where people pay for tickets to watch a radio show that is \n     broadcast for free);\n       Whereas President John F. Kennedy once said, ``I look \n     forward to an America which will steadily raise the standards \n     of artistic accomplishment and which will steadily enlarge \n     cultural opportunities for all of our citizens.'' (making it \n     clear that President Kennedy never could have imagined ``Wait \n     Wait . . . Don't Tell Me!'');\n       Whereas notable Americans such as Supreme Court Justice \n     Stephen Breyer, actor Tom Hanks, United States Attorney \n     Patrick Fitzgerald, New York Times columnist William Safire, \n     and White House Press Secretary Dana Perino have appeared on \n     the show (and luckily, few have suffered any significant, \n     long-term damage to their careers);\n       Whereas ``Wait Wait . . . Don't Tell Me!'' host Peter Sagal \n     and veteran newsman Carl Kassell have been described as ``the \n     perfect team to liven up a Saturday'' (rendering them \n     entirely unsuitable for any gainful employment);\n       Whereas ``Wait Wait . . . Don't Tell Me!'' finds expression \n     through a recognition that you don't have to be a \n     professional comedian to be humorous (a premise proven each \n     week by a rotating panel of humorists, journalists, and \n     others, including Roy Blount, Jr., Tom Bodett, Amy Dickinson, \n     Adam Felber, Kyrie O'Connor, P.J. O'Rourke, Paula Poundstone, \n     Paul Provenza, Charlie Pierce, Roxanne Roberts, and Mo \n     Rocca); and\n       Whereas ``Wait Wait . . . Don't Tell Me!'', produced by \n     National Public Radio and Chicago Public Radio, airs on \n     nearly 450 National Public Radio member stations, and its \n     audience has grown in every ratings period since its premiere \n     in January 1998 (growth that is directly proportional to the \n     boundless egos of the show's creator and Executive Producer \n     Doug Berman, Senior Producer Rod Abid, producers Mike \n     Danforth, Emily Ecton, and Melody Kramer, technical directors \n     Lorna White and Robert Neuhaus, and limericist Philipp \n     Goedicke): Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 2008 as `` `Wait Wait\n     . . . Don't Tell Me!' Recognition Month''; and\n       (2) celebrates the show for its contributions to the \n     Nation's enduring creative spirit and for always bringing \n     smiles to America's Saturday mornings.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/20/senate-section/article/S5942-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 5020.
