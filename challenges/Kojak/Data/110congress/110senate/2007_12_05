Mr. President, those who watch C-SPAN and people who are \nwatching us in other ways are many times well versed in Senate \nprocedure. People would note today that we didn't come into session \nuntil 12 noon. With all the many things we have to do, why are we \ntaking the morning off, so to speak? We have so much work to do. But \nyet most people's work day is half completed and we are just starting.\n  The reason is we have another example of obstructionism. The reason \nwe had to come in late today is because we have an extremely important \npiece of legislation that is being marked up in a committee. The \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee has been scheduled to begin to \nmark up a crucial piece of legislation today, a bill that will take a \nmajor step forward in the fight against global warming. If there were \never an occasion when we had to unite as a country and as a world \ncommunity to fight, it would be against the scourge of global warming \nwhich is taking place everywhere. You can't listen to the news without \nhearing about something global warming has affected. Yesterday on \npublic radio there was a wonderful piece about Finland, how the \nglaciers are melting in Finland.\n  Under Senate rules, any Member has the power to object to a committee \nmeeting after the first 2 hours after the Senate is in session. That is \nwhy we had to start the Senate late today, so that committee could go \nforward with its markup so they can hopefully report a bill to the \nfloor by 2 o'clock this afternoon. Had we started at 9, they would have \nhad to stop at 11 because we were told that Republicans would object to \nthe hearing going forward.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. There were no objections on this side. I think maybe \nthe leader was anticipating an objection that did in fact not exist.\n  Mr. REID. That could be the case, Mr. President. We started at noon \ntoday because under the rules anyone can stop us from holding a hearing \nbeyond that time and we were told that was what was going to happen and \nthat is why we did this. It is very easy for people to say we didn't do \nit. Of course they didn't do it, but had the meeting started at 10 \no'clock, they would have done it. We were told that is what they were \ngoing to do. It is easy now to come here after the fact and say we \nwouldn't have done that.\n  We can see from what is taking place in the committee, about the \namendments being offered to try to stop this\n\n[[Page S14750]]\n\nbill from coming forward. The committee that is meeting has one \nRepublican who is joining with us, John Warner from Virginia. Every \nother member of that committee, unless there is some sudden light one \nof them sees, is going to vote against that bill and they indicated \nthey would do everything they could to stop the markup from being \ncompleted today.\n  I am very happy that now the Republicans are saying we would not have \ndone that. The only way we can protect ourselves, after having been \ngiven a direct warning that was what was going to take place, was start \nthe Senate late.\n  If this were the only case of the Republicans doing everything they \ncould to slow us down, then maybe it would be something that would need \nto be looked at very closely. But this doesn't have to be looked at \nvery closely. It is everything that we have tried to do since we took \nthe majority, and a slim majority it is. As we all know, about a year \nago Senator Johnson was stricken with a bleed in the brain. He almost \ndied. So our majority on that day went from 51 to 50--50 to 49 was our \nmajority, and we have struggled with that until Senator Johnson was \nable to return a couple of months ago.\n  During this period of time this year, the Republicans have done \neverything they could to slow down and many times stop what we were \ndoing. Look at the numbers. We are now at 57 cloture motions we have \nhad to file. As I said yesterday, this is filibusters on steroids. \nWithin a few days, it will break the record for a Congress of having \nclotures filed, necessary clotures filed.\n  We were forced to begin this session late, as I have indicated, to \ngive the committee a chance to begin its work. It is unfortunate we \nhave reached this point of overt obstructionism. If this Republican \nblocking tactic is a sign of what is going to come--we have already \nseen it; it can't get worse than what it already is, I don't believe--\nthe remaining weeks are going to be interesting. We know we have been \nstopped from going forward on the farm bill. We tried everything we \ncould to move forward on the farm bill. I even said you can have 10 \namendments, we will have 5. They said no. I talked with Senator Harkin \ntoday. He said--I don't know the exact numbers--I think we can do it \nwith 17 and 14, or something such as that. I said, if you can get a \ndeal like that, take it. We want to move forward on legislation and we \nare having a difficult time doing that.\n  Global warming is something we should be joining together to work on, \nto solve the problem. The work done by Senators Lieberman and Warner is \nbipartisan in the true sense of the word. It is a way to address global \nwarming in an important way. Nations throughout the world are \ndemonstrating their commitment to reducing greenhouse emissions. As we \nspeak, there is a conference taking place in Bali. We have 10,000 \npeople there, worried about global warming. Australia, with the change \nof leadership they had there in recent elections within the past couple \nof weeks, has now signed the Kyoto protocols. Which is the only \nindustrialized nation not to have signed those? This administration; \nthis country.\n  President Bush would not acknowledge the words ``global warming'' \nuntil the past 6 months. He has now at least been able to say the words \nand is doing some futile things to help, and even those small gestures \nare welcome to this country and to the world.\n  I want to talk a little bit more about the farm bill. I have spoken \nto Senator Chambliss on a number of occasions. I have not sought him \nout. We have been on the floor and talked. I don't want to go around my \nfriend, Senator McConnell, unless I tell him I am going to do that, but \nI have had conversations in front of everybody. He indicates he would \nlike to do the farm bill. We want to do the farm bill. At this time \nthere are 287 amendments pending on the farm bill, amendments dealing \nwith driver's licenses for illegal immigrants, all kinds of other \namendments that have nothing to do with the farm bill. As a result of \nsome of my conversations with my friends on the other side of the \naisle, it does not appear we can work anything out on the farm bill.\n  How much more reasonable can we be? I have said if 10 and 5 is not \ngood, how about taking, as I have just said, Harkin and Chambliss, who \nsupposedly, according to my conversation with Senator Harkin this \nmorning, have now worked it out to less than 40 amendments. That will \nbe fine, too. Let's move forward. I have even said, to show we are \nreasonable, have a couple of nongermane amendments. That is fine. We \nwill be happy to take a shot at those. I don't know what they would be. \nI have been told--I think one of them may be dealing with driver's \nlicenses. But we will be happy to do whatever needs to be done to help \nthe American farmers and ranchers get some relief that they need.\n  We have also pending something that I think is pretty important. In \naddition to the farm bill, we have AMT. AMT is a buzzword for a tax \nproposal that was passed during a Republican administration, which had \ngood intent when it started. Congress wanted to make sure and the \nPresident wanted to make sure that even people making a lot of money \npaid a little bit in taxes. But with inflation having risen its ugly \nhead, as it does, it is affecting people no one anticipated would be \naffected. Right now, unless we change the AMT, people making between \n$75,000 and $500,000 would be hit with a tax they ordinarily would not \nget. The average tax, I understand, is less than $2,000. Somebody \nmaking $75,000 would get a very small tax; somebody making half a \nmillion dollars a year would be paying a larger tax.\n  That was not the intent of the tax. The vast majority of American \npeople don't make 75,000 a year and they certainly don't make a half-\nmillion dollars a year.\n  But we want to try to change that. We want to put in a patch so it \ndoesn't affect those people this year. We have tried everything that I \nknow legislatively possible, that is reasonable, to take care of this. \nRight now, a cloture motion is ripening, our 57th, and that would be on \nwhether we can proceed to legislate on the House-passed bill. The \nHouse-passed bill patches it, but it is all paid for. We Democrats \nbelieve that tax cuts and any new programs should be paid for. The \nHouse has passed a bill and sent it to us which does that. I have been \ntold by my Republican colleagues that it is extremely doubtful we will \nget cloture on that. I hope we can get a few brave Republicans to say \nwe want to legislate on this.\n  The President said we should do something to fix AMT. That being the \ncase, why doesn't he place a call or have one of his staff call the \nSenate and say, Why don't you let them proceed on this? We can offer \nsome amendments once it is there. We will try to be reasonable in what \namendments we offer and they offer on this AMT fix. But I think we \nshould at least have the opportunity to move forward. They are creating \nthe worst of all worlds. They are going around saying we have to fix \nAMT, but they are not allowing us to legislate on it.\n  Under our Constitution, all revenue matters have to originate in the \nHouse. We have what the House wants to do. On this, I have said let's \nsee what we can do. We will vote on the House version and we will go \nwith the 60-vote margin. I am happy to do that. We will vote on what \nSenators Grassley and Baucus have reported out of the Finance Committee \nhere in the Senate, and that is the AMT is not paid for. I don't agree \nwith that, but that is what the committee has done so I accept that. \nAlso as part of that package it has certain tax extenders that are paid \nfor. I said, Let's vote on that. No.\n  Senator Lott, the Republican whip, said he wanted to eliminate AMT \nforever.\n  That is more than $1 trillion. But we are willing to vote on that. We \nhave gotten no takers on that. I do not know how we can be more \nreasonable.\n  I do not want to get into the inner workings of the proposal made \nbetween Senator McConnell and myself because I do not think that would \nbe appropriate to talk about, some of the things. I would be happy to \ndo that if he wants to, but some of the other suggestions made--I do \nnot want to do my negotiating out here on the Senate floor. But I think \nthe suggestions they have made have been very unreasonable. I don't \nknow how we can be more reasonable than what we have done.\n  Now, I would hope we can work something out on AMT. As I said to my \ndistinguished friend, the Republican leader, today, if the President \nwants an AMT fix and the Republicans say they\n\n[[Page S14751]]\n\nwant one, why can't we move forward on doing something? I do not \nunderstand why we could not do that.\n  One of the other alternatives I have not suggested, but maybe what we \ncan do is have a vote on not even paying for it, which I disagree with, \nbut if that would be the will of the Senate, fine, we could set \nsomething up in that regard. We could have those votes out of the way \nthis afternoon. We would not have to do the cloture vote in the \nmorning. And we would see what the will of the Senate is. The way it is \ngoing to be, I have been told that the Republicans have been given \ntheir marching orders, as happens all of the time around here, that \nthey are not free agents, that they cannot vote to invoke cloture on \nthis alternative minimum tax, which I think would be a shame.\n  As I told my friend, the senior Senator from Kentucky, we would like \nto finish the business of this body by 2 weeks from Friday. That is our \ngoal. I hope we can do that. I hope we do not have to work--we are not \ngoing to work on Christmas, but I hope we do not have to work Christmas \nweek. It is possible we may have to do that. We have a number of \nimportant issues around here. We have an energy bill that is going to \nbe sent either today or tomorrow from the House. I spoke to the Speaker \nthis morning. We have to complete the alternative minimum tax. I think \nit would be the right thing to do to see what we are going to do on the \nPresidents's wiretapping proposal, as to how we can make that a better \npiece of legislation. We have gotten something that is bipartisan that \nhas come out of the Judiciary Committee. The Judiciary Committee has \nmet on a bipartisan basis. They have some things they want to change on \nthat. But if we have to jump through all of the hoops and file cloture \non that, that bill--the legislation that is now in force expires I \nbelieve on February 5. I think it would be good if we can complete that \nbefore we leave. There are certain other things we need to do before we \nleave. But it is a lot of work to do.\n  There is one minor little problem I did not talk about. We have to \nfigure out some way to fund the Government for the rest of the year, \neither with some type of spending program to involve the Appropriations \nCommittee or a last resort--something that both the Republican leader \nand I don't want--would be a continuing resolution which, in effect, \neliminates the legislative branch of Government from being involved in \nwhat money is spent in the country for the next year.\n  Having said that, I would hope we can hold hands here a little bit in \nthe next couple of weeks and see what we can get done: alternative \nminimum tax, farm bill, spending bills for our country, and if we \nreally get fortunate, see if we can finish the FISA legislation, the \nwiretap legislation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

No such warning was given to the other side. The \npractice is for the committees to request permission on the day they \nmeet. We did not indicate there was any objection.

Mr. President, reclaiming the floor, I know for \nanybody who might be watching on the outside that all of this \nparliamentarian talk probably makes your eyes glaze over. But the \nfundamental problem is this: As recently as a year ago, my party was in \nthe majority, and I had the same problem--Senator Frist and I had the \nsame problem my good friend from Nevada has: Our members do not want to \ncast any dangerous votes, any votes they do not want to cast.\n  The first session of the previous Congress, the 109th, was the most \nproductive legislative session of my time here in the Senate. I recall \nSenator Frist and myself saying over and over and over again to our \nmembers that if we are going to pass this bill, we are going to have to \ngive the minority their votes. And people were whining and complaining \nabout having to cast votes. I recall the Democratic whip, the Senator \nfrom Illinois, saying: The Senate is not the House, and making the \npoint that the minority is going to get its votes in order to advance \nlegislation.\n\n  I understand that my good friend from Nevada gets complaints from his \nmembers about having to cast votes, but the fundamental responsibility \nof the majority is to pass legislation. In order to do that in the \nSenate--we do not have a rules committee--you have to work with the \nminority, and you have to give the minority side a reasonable number of \namendments. That is the case on the consideration of the alternative \nminimum tax fix, and that is also the case with regard to the farm \nbill.\n  Now, my advice both privately and publicly to my good friend, the \nmajority leader, on the farm bill is take it up and go forward, which \nis the way we have done it in the past, and it is amazing how quickly \nyou move along. You can sometimes spend more time trying to get a \nconsent agreement, which by its very nature requires every single \nMember of the Senate not to object--we could have made more progress on \nthe farm bill by simply going to the bill, taking up amendments, and \nmoving forward. That was my advice. It is still my advice. If we turned \nto the farm bill, even if we didn't have a very narrow amendment list, \nwe would make dramatic progress and make it quickly. Why? Because I \nthink there are significant numbers of Members of this body on both \nsides of the aisle who want to pass a farm bill. There may be a few who \ndon't but a significant number do.\n  So here is where we are, December 5. We have nearly a full year's \nworth of work to finish before we adjourn for Christmas. It is a little \nafter noon, and we are talking about why we are getting started now--I \ngather based on some misunderstanding about phantom objections that, in \nfact, did not exist on this side to the Environment Committee meeting.\n  We have offered our good friends a path forward on the AMT, on troop \nfunding, on appropriations, on the Energy bill, and the farm bill. Yet \nwe cannot seem to get the kind of bipartisan agreement that allows the \nminority to have some say over amendments in moving forward.\n  On the AMT, the chair of the Finance Committee called the Republican \nproposal constructive and said that it was the beginning of an \nagreement. That was yesterday. We want to make sure 23 million people \nare not ensnared by this middle-class tax hike and that the tax returns \nof 50 million Americans are not further delayed. The consequences of a \ndelay will be felt by millions of taxpayers who will see a delay in \ntheir refunds next year.\n  It is, however, important to virtually every member of my conference \nthat the alternative minimum tax, a tax that will never be levied and \nnever be collected, not trigger a tax increase on a whole lot of other \nAmericans. The effort to ``pay for'' the AMT is highly offensive to \nmembers on my side of the aisle, and I think the majority knows that, \nand the way to get the AMT and the extenders passed is not to ``pay \nfor'' them--in other words, not to go out and raise taxes on a lot of \nother Americans in order to continue basically the status quo. We know \nwe are never going to levy the AMT, and we are never going to collect \nit. The same is true with the extenders. We know we will pass that \npackage. That is existing tax relief. Why should we raise taxes on some \nother Americans in order to maintain the status quo, which is the \nabsence of an alternative minimum tax and the extension of the \nextenders? That is a very strongly held principle, and I believe that \nis the view of enough Senators to insist that is the way it goes \nforward.\n\n[[Page S14752]]\n\n  Now, we know what they plan over in the House. They are going to send \nthe AMT over there, and they are going to pay for it and send it back \nover here. I think that is a huge mistake; it is an excuse for raising \ntaxes on a whole lot of Americans.\n  With regard to the remaining appropriations bills, the Democratic \nleader and I have had a number of constructive conversations. We are \ngoing to be talking to the administration later in the day on that \nsubject. Any discussion of finishing up the year is going to have to \ninclude funding for the troops in Afghanistan and Iraq. We know we have \nhad this debate a lot of times--at last count, 63 Iraq votes in the \nHouse and Senate this year. We know that even when the war was going \npoorly and there was great opposition to the surge, at the end of the \nday the funding was there. Now the surge is succeeding, and the war is \ngoing better. Why would we not continue the funding now that things are \ngoing better when even the majority, which did not favor the effort in \nIraq, provided funding when it was going poorly? As part of any \nsettlement of the 11 appropriations bills, we are going to have troop \nfunding into next year.\n\n  On FISA, I think we have a way forward. The majority leader and I \nhave talked about it. I think we both have the view that the underlying \nbill will probably be the intelligence measure. I think we should be \nable to construct some kind of consent agreement in that particular \ninstance where I don't think there is much of a demand for amendments--\nsome amendments but not a whole lot--that will allow us to go forward.\n  On energy, Senator Domenici tells me that he had an understanding \nwith the majority leader and with the chairman of the Energy Committee \nin the Senate as to what would and what would not be in an energy bill \nthat we would finally pass. It is my understanding that an energy bill \nthat the House may act on, I gather today, I am not sure--is it today? \nDoes someone know? It is likely to include tax hikes and utility rate \nincreases for those of us in the Southeast. Now, in what way would an \nenergy bill that raises taxes, when oil is about $100 a barrel, and has \nthe practical effect of raising utility rates all across the Southeast \nbe beneficial? My understanding was that the majority leader and \nSenator Domenici and Senator Bingaman agreed that was not going to be a \npart of the proposal. I do not know whether it will be a part of the \nproposal when it comes over from the House, but that agreement ought to \nbe kept and those provisions ought to be removed.\n  Finally, at the risk of being redundant, let me say again on the farm \nbill that we have enough time. Most of the negotiations that are going \non, are going on off the floor. We do have floor time. It remains my \nadvice to the majority leader to get on to the farm bill, process \namendments, and move forward. I think that would be a way to make \nprogress. It is probably going to be very challenging to get as tight a \ntime agreement on amendments, as tight a number on amendments as the \nmajority leader would like. We spend so much time doing that; we could \nbe processing amendments here on the floor and moving forward with the \nbill.\n  Let me say in conclusion that we do want to be cooperative, but the \nreason we have had a lot of impasse this year is because a very narrow \nmajority is, in effect, trying to dictate amendments to the minority. \nThat will not work in the Senate. One of the prices of being in the \nmajority--it is better to be in the majority than not. I would rather \nbe in majority than not. But one of the prices you pay for being in the \nmajority is you have to take votes you do not want to take in order to \nadvance legislation.\n  So I would say to my good friend from Nevada, he is going to have as \nmuch cooperation as I can possibly muster. I am anxious to help us move \nforward on all of these issues he and I have been discussing here this \nmorning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/05/senate-section/article/S14752-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14752-S14753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nSenator McConnell and I have used not be counted against the hour for \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been in the minority; I understand \nhow that works. But the record is very clear that on rare occasions did \nwe oppose motions to proceed. We did but on rare occasions.\n  Keep in mind, as I have said, during this period of time--not even 1 \nyear yet--records for filibusters will be broken for a 2-year session.\n  We have involved the minority. We did it on the minimum wage. We did \nit on ethics and lobbying reform. We have done it on U.S. attorneys \nindependence. When we passed a supplemental appropriations bill, there \nwas total involvement of House Republicans and Senate Republicans. That \nwas good. We were able to finally get money for Katrina and wildfire \nrelief. We have worked together on veterans legislation we have done. \nIt has been a bipartisan move forward.\n  One of the rewarding things for me is the work we have been able to \nget out of the HELP Committee. Two diametrically opposed political \nminds, Kennedy and Enzi, have worked together and produced a lot of \ngood things on which we have been able to move forward--mental health \nparity, the Head Start Program, a number of other items.\n  We have passed legislation that has paid for our troops. The only \nwords of disagreement Senator McConnell and I have had on a private \nbasis has been over the Energy bill; that was a misunderstanding. Those \nthings happen, and I have forgotten about that. Other than that, we do \nour best to represent our caucus and our country. I have no personal \nanimosity toward my friend.\n  On the Energy bill, I do want to say this before we leave that. To \nframe this issue, understand we are in the middle of a debate on the \nEnergy bill. The issue was whether we would have a $32 billion tax on \nthe Energy bill. There was objection from my Republican friends. Before \nvotes were taken, one of my friends, a Democratic Senator, stood and \nsaid: It doesn't matter what you do here. We will take care of it in \nconference.\n  I stood and said: This will not take place in conference. We will not \nhave this matter in conference.\n  The problem is, we have never been able to get to conference. We \ntried numerous times to have a conference on the Energy bill, and they \nwouldn't let us do it. So now we are going to get from the House \ntomorrow something they have done. Republicans have been involved, \nRepublicans in the House and in the Senate. But, remember, in the House \nthey have a little different procedure. Because the power is with the \nparty that has the most votes, they can do most anything they want.\n  I have kept my word. There is nothing that has been added in \nconference. We haven't had a conference. I can't control Speaker \nPelosi. I hope everybody understands that. She is a strong, independent \nwoman. She runs the House with an iron hand. I support what she does, \nbut no one needs to come and tell me I didn't keep my word. You check \nthe record, which we have. I said this matter would not be added in \nconference, and it has not been added in conference. We haven't had a \nconference.\n  I have spoken to Senator Domenici. He is my friend, and I have great \nrespect for him. He has served his State and the country well. Senator \nDomenici and I have worked as the two leaders of the Energy and Water \nSubcommittee on Appropriations for a long time. He was either the \nchairman or I was. We get along very well. I talked to him last night. \nI explained to him the situation. I think he understands what took \nplace. We have not had a conference. If that bill comes to us and those \ntax provisions are in it, we will take a look at it.\n  I do know this: As I have been told, the tax portion of that, if it \nis tied on to the Energy bill, would be $12 billion less than the one \nproposed in the Senate. I hope we can get some cooperation on the \nEnergy bill. That would be great. It is something this country needs.\n  A couple of other things I want to say. On the farm bill, I say with \nthe most genuine respect I can that my friend is not being fair in his \ndescription of why we don't move forward on the farm bill. Remember, \nthe last bill\n\n[[Page S14753]]\n\nwe had to move forward on was Amtrak, a bill that had been in the \nRepublican leadership for years not moving forward. We decided we would \nmove forward on it, and we passed it. What was the first amendment \noffered? A tax amendment. It had absolutely nothing to do with Amtrak. \nWe can't have these bills in the waning weeks of this Congress, when \npeople are waiting around for all kinds of things they want to do on \nIraq and Afghanistan and the military and immigration.\n  I guess the Republicans think they have a good issue on immigration, \nto bash immigrants. They have all kinds of issues they want on \nimmigration. They are waiting in the wings to offer these amendments. \nWe can see that on the farm bill. A number of the 287 amendments filed \nhave been dealing with immigration. We can't open the farm bill during \nthe time we are trying to pass FISA, trying to pass the farm bill, AMT, \ndo our spending bills.\n  How much more reasonable could I be in trying to shorten the time? I \nsaid: Republicans take 10; we will take 5. No. So Senator Harkin comes \nto me and Senator Chambliss. They have it down to less than 40. I said: \nTake the deal; we will agree to it. We don't even want time agreements \non the amendments. How much more reasonable can we be? We can't be. \nWhatever we come up with, the Republicans would not agree to it because \nthey do not want us to have a farm bill. So why don't they just \nacknowledge that. They are acknowledging it by their stopping us from \nhaving any kind of agreement.\n\n  I agree with the Republican leader, once we got on the bill, we could \nmove forward with these amendments quickly. But that is where we are.\n  According to my friend--and I think these are the words he said--it \nis offensive to pay for these tax cuts. Let's follow this. It is \noffensive to pay for the tax cuts? That has been the Republican mantra \nfor 7 years. And where are we? When President Bush took office, there \nwas a $7 trillion surplus over 10 years. Where are we now? We are \napproaching a $10 trillion debt. Everything the Republicans have done \nwith their spending has not been paid for, and their tax cuts have not \nbeen paid for.\n  As with the Clinton administration, we adopted pay-go. That is in our \nbudget. If we have a program that is new, we have to pay for it. That \ndoesn't sound unreasonable. That is what the American people want. If \nthey buy a new car, a new refrigerator, they have to pay for it. There \nis only so much credit in the world. This Government has exceeded its \ncredit limit. The credit card no longer works.\n  We also believe the tax cuts, which have given us red ink as far as \nyou can see, created by the Republicans, should come to an end. If \nthere are going to be further tax cuts, we should pay for them. That is \nthe right thing to do. That is all we are saying with the AMT. Pay for \nthese tax cuts. This is a tax cut. It should be paid for. I don't know \nwhat is offensive about that.\n  I would further say we are willing to meet the minority more than \nhalfway--halfway, of course, but more than halfway. We have proven that \nas we have worked through legislation this year. It has been hard. It \nhas been a slog. I understand how disappointed the Republicans are that \nwe are in the majority. It was a surprise to a lot of people when last \nNovember we took the majority of the Senate. We won seats that no one \nexpected us to win. But we are in the majority, no matter how slim. We \nhave had some accomplishments, and we are proud of those. But more \nimportantly, we believe in change. We believe we are agents of change \nfor America. The Republicans are agents of the status quo. The American \npeople will have to judge whom they want to support. Do they want to \nsupport those who want to keep things the way they are in Iraq and \nevery other bad situation we find ourselves in as a country or do they \nwant to move forward with us and work for change? That is where we are.\n  I think we are on the right side. I hope during these next couple of \nweeks we can work together and do some good things for the country. We \nare willing to go more than halfway. Take AMT, for example. Let's go \nover that again. I have tried everything I can, offering unanimous \nconsent requests which have been objected to. Vote on the House bill. \nNo. Vote on what we have in the Senate. No. Vote on what Senator Lott \nwants: just to repeal it and have another trillion dollars of red ink. \nNo. Not willing to do that.\n  So today I said: OK, let's vote on not even paying for it. How about \nthat? I have heard no clamor from the Republicans, yes, that sounds \nlike a good idea. What more could we do?\n  The word is that there are people--and how big the number is we don't \nknow, but we know in the Senate it doesn't take a big majority to cause \nproblems--there are many Republican Senators who don't want us to put \nthe patch for AMT so they can go around, as I told Senator McConnell \nthis morning, pointing fingers at each other about whose fault it is \nthat these people in America with $75,000 to $500,000 in income are \ngoing to get a tax increase. How much more reasonable could we be? Have \nwe gone more than halfway? The answer is obviously yes. We want to \nlegislate. We do not want to block things from happening.\n  If someone can show me how I am unreasonable with my proposal on AMT, \nI would be happy to sit down and talk to them. I don't know how I could \nbe more reasonable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, others have been waiting patiently to \nspeak. Let me say with regard to AMT, this is existing law we are \ntrying to extend. With regard to the extenders, there is existing law \nwe are trying to extend. We should not use that as an excuse to raise \ntaxes on a whole lot of other Americans. That is something that \nvirtually every member of my conference feels strongly about. We are \ngoing to continue to talk about it. I am still optimistic we are going \nto be able to get this worked out. The majority leader and I are good \nfriends, and we are going to continue to work on all these issues in \nthe hope that we can go forward in the few weeks remaining before \nChristmas.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/05/senate-section/article/S14753-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We\n\n[[Page S14754]]\n\nhad a hearing yesterday in the Homeland Security Oversight Subcommittee \non credit card bills. There was some very revealing information. I \nthink the Senator is addressing a problem we need to look at on the \nSenate floor.

Mr. President, let me, first of all, take a minute to \ntalk about this bill for which unanimous consent was just requested. I \nthink it is important in light of what the majority leader just said. \nHere we have a bill for which unanimous consent was requested. The \nAmerican people need to understand what it means to get unanimous \nconsent. It means all of us agree to it. It does not need to be further \namended, it does not need to be changed, and it should be passed \nwithout ever having a vote on it.\n  This bill has a section in it that so far has lost over $3.5 billion \nof your money doing venture capital investing by the Small Business \nAdministration. The OMB analysis says there is absolutely no need for \nthis venture capital investment, especially because of the fact it has \nlost such a great amount of money. And venture capital investing itself \nis a highly risky business that requires tremendously acute knowledge \nand people of great acumen in terms of investing, and they lose lots of \nmoney investing.\n  The last thing we ought to be doing at the end of a session is \npassing a bill without vetting it, without debating it, without talking \nabout the problems that are in the bill. This portion of the bill, the \nportion that is the Small Business Venture Capital Act, if anything, \nshould come out of this bill. We should not reauthorize something that \nhas lost already in excess of $3 billion, and something for which we do \nnot get to look at the results until 10 years after it happens.\n  The last thing we ought to be doing is investing the American \npeople's money in venture capital when we cannot pay for the things we \nneed to be paying for that the American people are dependent on. I look \nforward to working with Senator Kerry. I have had a good relationship \nwith him. We will sit down and talk about this bill. But I think it \nhighlights what we need to be doing and not spending time in quorum \ncalls but spending time debating bills.\n  I also want to spend a minute on this issue. I think the American \npeople ought to be asking us about this. Here we sit, and we have one \nappropriations bill passed for the year that started October 1. I think \nI am correct. Other than the THUD bill, there has been no objection \nraised by the minority to proceeding to any of the appropriations \nbills. As a matter of fact, the choice was made not to bring up the \nappropriations bills in a timely manner and debate them because of the \nchoice it was not a priority.\n  I do recall the tremendous criticism we rightly received for what \nhappened last year in the appropriations process. What is going to \nhappen? I am happy to be here for Christmas to do the business we \nshould have already done. But let me lay out what will happen, and then \nlet me also give a warning. At the end of sessions, what happens is we \nget the request to pass all sorts of legislation--much like this bill \nto which I just objected. Committees do good work on legislation. But a \nbill that has passed committee has to be agreed to by a majority of the \nSenators to be able to become law.\n  When we do unanimous consents, that means we are going to let it pass \nwithout looking at it, without amending it, and without voting on it. \nWell, at the end of the year, the time pressure comes. Everybody wants \nto get something passed. So what happens is we do a poor job of \nlegislating because we do not look at it. We do not amend it. We do not \nhave a debate so the American people can know about it. We just pass \nit.\n\n  I sent a letter to all of my colleagues today outlining and \nreinforcing four statements I made at the first of this year. I will \nobject to any bill coming forward by unanimous consent at the end of \nthe session unless it meets the requirements I laid out. That means no \nnew authorizations unless you deauthorize something else. We are not \ngoing to grow the Government any more when we cannot pay for the \nGovernment we have. No. 2, it has to be constitutional. It has to be a \ntrue duty of the Federal Government, not an obligation of the State \ngovernments that we are going to stand up for, when they have a $6 \nbillion to $7 billion surplus. Easily, when you look at any combination \nof any 10 States, they have an over $36 billion surplus totally, and we \nare running, in real numbers--non-Enron accounting but real numbers--a \n$250 billion surplus.\n  I am not going to allow--unless we want to put it on the Senate \nfloor, unless we want to debate it--I am not going to allow us to pass \nbills at the end of the session by unanimous consent. So if you have a \nbill that you want to try to pass by unanimous consent, I would suggest \nwe sit down and talk about it now, not 2 weeks from tomorrow but now. \nIf they come in the last week, we will not have the time to look at \nthem. So not agreeing to unanimously consider the bill as passed will \nbe the standard fare.\n  Now, let's talk about the appropriations process. What we have is $23 \nbillion more than what we agreed we are going to pass in total for the \nappropriations bills, not counting the emergency things we have already \ndone that we have charged to our grandchildren. As the game is played \nin Washington, what will come is the pressure of chicken. We are going \nto play chicken because we chose not to do the appropriations bills at \nthe appropriate time, and lots of Members have lots of earmarks in \nbills.\n  So they do not want us to continue to fund where we are. They want us \nto have an omnibus bill where we can have all these earmarks, about $26 \nbillion worth of earmarks, so we can look good at home--not \ncompetitively bid, not based on priorities but based on our political \npriorities individually as Senators. We are going to spend about $23 \nbillion more than what we said we are going to spend. That $23 billion \nis almost $300 billion over the next 10 years. And we are fighting \nabout $80 billion on an AMT fix for 1 year. But we are not \nconcentrating on the fact we are going to institute $300 billion worth \nof more spending.\n  I will remind my colleagues again, we do not have to raise taxes. We \ncan eliminate the AMT. What we do not want to do, and what we fail to \ndo, is get rid of the waste, fraud, abuse, and duplication that numbers \nin excess of $250 billion every year--every year--because we will not \ndo the hard work of oversight.\n  So we are going to line up, and we are going to get a package from \nthe House, and we are going to get a chance to vote on it, and the \nPresident has already said he is going to veto it if it has this excess \nnumber and all these earmarks in it. I would think this would be better \nthan playing chicken: Why don't we live within our means like every \nfamily has to? That $250 billion comes to 20 percent of everything we \nspend in the discretionary budget. If you ask homeowners and families \nwho are having a lot of pressure now, would they dare waste 20 percent \nof their budget, would they dare not look and reconsider how they are \nspending their money when it comes to their family budget, they would \nnot. Yet we continuously refuse to do the hard work of oversight. We do \nnot want to offend anybody. In the process we are offending the next \ntwo generations. My hope is we don't end up here at Christmas, but I \nwas dead serious when I took my oath. I am going to defend the \nConstitution and I am going to work to make sure bills that are outside \nof that Constitution don't pass this body. I am going to defend my \nobligation to the next two generations and the heritage this country \nwas built on--one generation sacrificing for the next--so future \nopportunity is there. I am going to do everything in my power to not \nlet $23 billion of extra spending go through this Senate at the end of \nthe year. Now, I may not be successful in that, but at the end of the \nday, I am going to sleep real well knowing I am fulfilling my oath, \nknowing that I know what the Constitution says. When we get outside the \nbounds of the Constitution, in terms of Federal responsibility, what we \ndo is we say in name we are helping somebody and we are charging it to \nour grandchildren and undermining the very opportunity we all \nexperience.\n\n[[Page S14755]]\n\n  My hope is we can come together during this season and say: Let's get \nit right. Let's not spend a bunch of extra money. Let's put it back. We \ncould be facing some pretty severe economic times in this country in \nterms of how things look, especially people who were sold homes and \nmortgages they didn't qualify for and now are struggling. How are we \ngoing to address that? How are we going to help them through that? How \nare we going to accomplish that which empowers people, not Government? \nWe need to be working on those things. We do not need to be spending \nthe extra money now that we may, in fact, need to spend later. We may, \nin fact, need to borrow money later. So we should be doing the job \nright the first time, staying within our means, doing what is \nnecessary, even though it offends people who might not get something \nfrom the Federal Government through an earmark.\n  I believe the people of the Senate are great people. I believe, \nultimately, they want what is great for this country. I know all of \nthose who have children and grandchildren wish and hope for the very \nbest for their lives and to experience the kind of opportunities we \nhave had. But I wish to tell my colleagues it is at risk. It is not a \nsmall risk, it is a great risk. Mr. President, 2012 is coming fast; \n2012, that day when the baby boomers are taking both Social Security \nand Medicare, when we start down this road of $79 trillion worth of \nunfunded mandates. How can we be trusted to fix those problems when we \ncan't even live within our own budget?\n  I said before, about a year and a half ago on this floor, that there \nis a rumble in America and it is real. The American people are sick and \ntired of the partisan games we play. They don't want to see Republicans \npointing their fingers at Democrats. They don't want to see Democrats \npointing their fingers at Republicans. What they want us to do is the \njob of governing within our means.\n  Our problem is we have difficulty identifying what is most important: \nOur political careers or the future of the country. What gets in front \nof us too often is how do we look good at home rather than how do we \nlook good in the future so we secure the promise America stands for. My \nhope is we will work together.\n  One final comment on the farm bill. We need a farm bill, but we don't \nneed a farm bill that continues to have programs that wealthy people \nwho aren't real farmers take advantage of--people who aren't farmers, \nyet suck the money out of the farm program. Twenty percent of our \nfarmers produce 80 percent of our goods, but a large portion of the \nfarm program goes to gentlemen farmers--doctors, lawyers, who happen to \nown a small acreage and then suck the programs dry for their own \nbenefit for things they could very well afford to pay for. So the farm \nbill isn't going to go forward until we have an open amendment process.\n  I agree with the majority leader. We shouldn't have all of these \nvotes that aren't necessarily related to the farm bill, but we should \ncertainly fix the crop insurance program. We should certainly mandate \nthat if you are getting a government benefit as a farmer, you ought to \nbe a farmer. You shouldn't be an investor who is investing in making \nmoney off the hard-earned tax dollars of middle-class America. That is \nwhat too much of the farm program is. We shouldn't be setting about \nsaying that if we are going to incentivize to get greater production, \nand then all of a sudden if somebody is successful at it, then you \ncan't do it anymore. If an incentive is put in place to work, then \nlet's make it work. We haven't done that with ethanol. We haven't said \nyou can only produce so much ethanol. So if an incentive works, we \nought to use it. But we ought to make sure the people getting those \nincentives are real farmers.\n  Again, I thank the Chair for his indulgence and I yield back the \nremainder of my time.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today the Senate tried to call up and pass \nan amended version of S. 1662, the Small Business Venture Capital Act \nof 2007. There was objection to the bill based on a concern that it \nreauthorized the SBA's Small Business Investment Company Participating \nSecurities program, a program which the Office of Management and Budget \nhas predicted will have losses of about $3 billion.\n  The amendment pending before the full Senate does not reauthorize the \nSBIC Participating Securities program. That provision was taken out of \nthe bill in October when the committee first circulated the proposed \namendment to colleagues and the parties notified their members that the \ncommittee would like to pass the bill by unanimous consent.\n  Equity financing like the SBIC Participating Securities program is \nimportant to the continuum of small business financing, and testimony \nbefore our committee this summer emphasized the need for a reformed \nprogram to fill the void left by the private sector. However, as the \nreport to S. 1662 clarifies, Congress could not find common ground with \nthe administration on reforming the program and so the committee \nincluded a token reauthorization amount to signal to the business \ncommunity that it understood the need for small equity investments and \nthat there was support for the Small Business Investment Company \nprogram in general.\n  The bill reauthorizes through 2010 the Small Business Investment \nCompany Debenture program, and the New Markets Venture Capital program. \nVenture capital is a critical driver of our economy and job creation. \nSince the creation of the SBIC program almost 50 years ago, the country \nhas benefited from hundreds of thousands of jobs. Some examples of \nsuccess stories include businesses that are now household names--\nCalaway Golf, Intel, Jenny Craig, Outback Steakhouse, and Federal \nExpress. Through the SBA's New Markets Venture Capital program, which \nhas only been making investments for a couple of years, businesses in \nareas with the highest national employment, such as in the Appalachia \nregion of Kentucky, have gotten access to more than $48 million in \npatient investment capital and created hundreds of jobs with \nsustainable wages and health care benefits. Senator Snowe and I worked \nwith the SBA in drafting S. 1662, and the committee of jurisdiction \nadopted it unanimously--by a vote of 19 to 0.\n  Further, we understand concerns about moving legislation last minute \nand we try to avoid that. In this case, our committee voted out this \nbill in June, giving colleagues with concerns more than 5 months to \nreview the legislation. And in anticipation of moving this bill by \nunanimous consent committee staff reached out to other offices in \nOctober. We have tried for 6 weeks to discuss the bill and identify any \npossible concerns. We gave those offices copies of the bill, the \nreport, the CBO cost estimate, explained what was in the amendment to \nbe hotlined, and provided a copy of the revised CBO cost estimate that \nreflected striking the section that reauthorized the SBIC participating \nsecurities program and the section that triggered direct spending. The \nbill has a very modest cost, reduces the historic authorization levels, \nand has the potential to have a very positive impact on the economy, \nthrough investment and job creation. We would be happy to work with our \ncolleagues to try and clarify any other misunderstandings and to work \nthrough any substantive concerns. I ask unanimous consent that a copy \nof the amendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nabout a statement made by the majority leader, Senator Harry Reid, \nyesterday that:\n\n        . . . President Bush, he is the man who is pulling the \n     strings on the 49 puppets he has here in the Senate.\n\n  I have had my staff advise his staff that I intended to make some \ncomments about that so he would be notified and could come to the floor \nif he chose to do so. His office is right adjacent to the floor. He is \na minute or 2 away. I believe that is a very inappropriate statement.\n  I refer to rule XIX of the Senate rules, which provides:\n\n        . . . No Senator in debate shall, directly or indirectly, \n     by any form of words impute to another Senator or to other \n     Senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a \n     Senator.\n\n  It is my view that being called a puppet is in direct violation of \nthat rule. I don't think there is much doubt about it. That is a term \nof derision, of ridicule, of censure, and it is an opprobrious term to \nmake that statement.\n  I am especially concerned about it because in the immediate past \nthere have been many Senators who have directly disagreed with the \nPresident--hardly puppets of President Bush or hardly puppets of \nanyone. Under our Constitution, the separation of powers makes the \nCongress separate from the executive branch and from the courts. That \nseparation and that independence is something that Senators prize so \nvery highly. So I don't take it lightly, and I don't think the other 48 \nof my colleagues take it lightly to be called puppets.\n  Let's look at the record. Within the past month, on November 8, 35 \nRepublicans voted to override President Bush's veto of the Water \nResources and Development Act. The veto was overridden; 35 disagreed \nwith the President. It hardly sounds like there are 35 puppets there to \nvote to override the President's veto.\n  On April 11, 18 Republicans joined in support of the Stem Cell \nEnhancement Act of 2007. That is an issue that this Senator has worked \non extensively since 1998, when stem cells first came upon the scene, \nand I was chairing the Appropriations Subcommittee on Health and Human \nServices. We have had some 20 hearings. Twice we enacted legislation to \nauthorize the use of Federal funds for embryonic stem cell research. It \ndoesn't sound like the 18 Senators who bucked the President's position \nare puppets.\n  On November 13, less than a month ago, 17 Republican Senators voted \nto support the SCHIP program, which the President was on record as \nopposing. He didn't like the amount of money that was involved with \nchildren's health. On November 7, 10 Republican Senators voted in \nsupport of passage of the Labor, Health, Human Services and Education \nAppropriations bill, despite the President's promised veto. He did veto \nit.\n  So here you have 4 situations readily at hand, where 35, 18, 17, and \n10 Republican Senators disagreed with the President. It doesn't sound \nlike the Senators are puppets in that context.\n  Yesterday Senator Reid also complained about the necessity to file \ncloture some 56 times. Well, each time cloture was filed, there is a \ncomplex story behind the cloture. On a good many of those occasions, \ncloture was filed and the so-called tree was filled, which precluded \nSenators from offering amendments. There was a time when Senators \nproudly said that any Senator could offer any amendment on any bill at \nany time. There might be some limitations postcloture on germaneness or \non some rules, but a practice has developed in this body to foreclose \nthat. The jargon is the ``filling the tree,'' and when the tree is \nfilled, nobody can offer an amendment.\n  Regrettably, that has been done by Republicans as well as Democrats. \nWhen it is hard to affix blame around here for the logjam, for our \ninability to get much done, you can usually divide it 50/50 between the \nparties. So to say Senator Reid has had to file cloture on 56 occasions \ndoesn't tell you very much.\n  Then the issue he took up yesterday in filing for cloture on the AMT, \nalternative minimum tax, Senator Reid filed for cloture on the House \nbill, which stands very little chance of passing the Senate because it \nis fully offset with controversial revenue raisers. Now it is true that \nSenate Democrats offered to remove the offsets but to keep them in \nplace for the tax extenders. The Republican position has been that it \nis illogical to use permanent tax increases to offset a temporary \nextension of current tax policy. So there is a good reason for what is \nbeing done here.\n  There is no doubt the AMT has to have a fix. If it is not done, there \nwill be some 23 million Americans who will be taxed instead of the 3 \nmillion now. So we are all dedicated to that proposition. If you take a \nlook at the Record on August 2 of this year, I offered an amendment to \nthe small business tax relief bill to repeal the 1993 AMT rate \nincrease.\n  On July 20, 2007, I voted in support of a Kyl amendment to the \neducational reconciliation bill, which fully repealed the AMT.\n  On March 23 of this year, I voted in support of a Lott amendment to \nthe budget resolution that would have allowed for repeal of the 1993 \nAMT rate increase.\n  Again, on the same day, March 23, I voted in support of a Grassley \namendment to the budget resolution that would have allowed the full \nrepeal of the AMT.\n  The same day, I voted in support of the Sessions amendment to the \nbudget resolution that would have allowed families to deduct personal \nexemptions when calculating their AMT liability.\n\n  The Record is full of good-faith efforts to solve this problem. But \nas indicated, as stated, the course which the majority leader has taken \nis unsatisfactory to people on this side of the aisle. Whether it is \nsatisfactory or unsatisfactory, it is not appropriate to call 49 \nRepublican Senators puppets. We are trying to move through the business \nof the year--the people's business. We have 2\\1/2\\ weeks. Not a whole \nlot has been done. We were in on Monday; no votes. In yesterday; one \nnoncontroversial vote. We didn't come in until noon today.\n  I have been around here a substantial period of time and I wonder how \nwe are going to get through all of the unfinished appropriations bills \nand the many other matters that are pending on the calendar. When the \nmajority leader makes a proposal and asks for Republican assistance, \nmany of us have been willing to listen to what he has to say. But he \ndoesn't improve his case when he starts calling us puppets. I wonder if \nhe is up to the job when he resorts to that kind of a statement, which \nonly furthers the level of rancor and insults and animosity with that \nkind of an insulting comment.\n  I would be interested in the majority leader's reply, if he cares to \nmake one. I will be near by the Senate floor.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/05/senate-section/article/S14757-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14757-S14758]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE FARM BILL\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about the \nnegotiations on the farm bill and to ask my Republican colleagues to \nthink very carefully--especially the farm State colleagues--about the \ncircumstance we face with respect to the farm bill.\n  The majority leader made an offer to the Republican leader during the \nbreak that we would have a chance to move forward if they could do 10 \namendments on their side and we can do 5 amendments on our side; that 2 \nof their 10 be unrelated to the farm bill, and that we have 2 \nadditional amendments, and the bipartisan amendments that have been \nfiled would not count against either allocation. That offer was made to \nSenator McConnell, and Senator McConnell has not yet answered or \ncounteroffered.\n  I hope the Republican leader will indicate how we could proceed. If \nthere is\n\n[[Page S14758]]\n\na need for additional amendments--apparently, Senator Harkin indicated \nit would be reasonable if there were 17 perhaps on their side and 14 on \nour side. Whatever the number is that would help us reach a conclusion \nwould be very important for our being able to advance the legislation \nthat came out of the committee, without a dissenting vote.\n  There are 21 Members of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Republicans \nand Democrats. This farm bill came out without a single dissenting \nvote. It is paid for, it is less costly than the President's farm \nproposal, and it has the beginnings of reform.\n  This is a reasonable offer. Certainly, Senator Reid made it. If you \nlook at previous farm bills, typically the number of recorded votes \nhave been about 20 amendments, sometimes a bit more, sometimes a bit \nless. On average, there have been around 20 amendments that have \nactually been voted on. Senator Reid's proposal would have 17 rollcall \nvotes before final passage. So that would be a bit below the average. \nThe leader has made clear that if there are some additional amendments \nthat are required in order to advance this proposal, he is open to \ndoing that.\n  The current farm bill expires this year. Farmers need to know and \ntheir bankers need to know what the rules of the road are going to be. \nSo it is absolutely essential we get this legislation through the \nSenate and we have an opportunity to go to conference with the House to \nwork out the differences in the early part of next year.\n  Let me make one final point, if I may. Some are saying just extend \nthe current farm bill by a year or two. First of all, we know that if \nit is a 1-year extension, it will be 2 years because next year is an \nelection year. Beyond that, our colleagues should know the baseline for \nwriting a farm bill is based on the last 5 years of experience with \nfarm legislation. That baseline is already down substantially because \nthe last farm bill cost $17 billion less than the estimates at the time \nit was written. That baseline is going to go only in one direction for \nthe commodity provisions at least, and that is down.\n  So anybody who is concerned about writing a farm bill that meets the \nneeds of the American people--not just the commodity title but \nnutrition, conservation, research, and all the rest--should understand \nthis noose is going to do nothing but get tighter. It is already very \ntight--very tight.\n  I hope our colleagues on the other side bend their best efforts to \ncome up with a response to the proposal the majority leader made to \nreach conclusion, and I hope they do it soon. The clock is ticking. \nAmerican farm and ranch families across this country are waiting. We \nshould not ask them to wait past Christmas. So much needs to be done, \nso many decisions need to be made, but Congress needs to act now.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/05/senate-section/article/S14758-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14758]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 3074\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on behalf of the Republican leadership, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to make \nsure the record is clear on the difference between what is being said \nin Washington, DC, today and what is actually taking place.\n  Yesterday, President Bush took to the microphones to complain for the \nsecond day in a row that Congress was not getting its work done. For a \nsecond day in a row, he complained that Congress is not sending him \nappropriations bills that fund the most basic functions of Government. \nAnd for a second day in a row, our minority leader, Senator McConnell, \nfollowed suit. He came out on the Senate floor and complained that \nCongress has not sent the appropriations bills to the President.\n  Let's be clear, I made a request to pass the final conference bill \nfor the transportation-housing appropriations bill so it could be sent \nto President Bush. What was the result? The Republican Senators blocked \nit from going to the White House, and that was not the first time that \nhappened. They blocked the transportation-housing appropriations bill \nfrom going to the White House twice before. Mr. President, 2\\1/2\\ weeks \nago on November 15, they blocked it; 2\\1/2\\ weeks ago on November 16, \nthey blocked it; and then they blocked it again today.\n  Let me tell you what is going on here. President Bush and the Senate \nRepublican leadership are trying to quietly block our progress on \nfunding the needs of the American people while loudly complaining about \nour failure to make progress.\n  I would understand the actions of the Senate Republican leadership if \nour transportation-housing bill was partisan or divisive, but the \nconference agreement we are trying to move again today has the support \nof every single Republican who sat on the conference committee in the \nHouse and in the Senate. That bill originally passed the Senate with 88 \nvotes. That conference agreement has already passed the House with 270 \nvotes.\n\n  This is not a controversial bill. It makes critical investments in \nsome of the most urgent needs of the American people and their local \ncommunities. That bill provides $195 million to replace the I-35W \nbridge that collapsed in Minnesota, an issue all of us came out on the \nfloor and said we would move rapidly to take care of. It is sitting \nright here in the Senate, one step away from getting it to the \nPresident to be signed into law, and the Republican leadership said no. \nSo they are loudly complaining about our failure to make progress.\n  I would understand the actions of the Senate Republican leadership if \nthey had not taken a look at this bill and realized the critical \nfunding in it. Besides the $195 million for the I-35W bridge, we have \n$1 billion in enhanced highway formula funding so all our States--all \n50 States--can inspect and make repairs to their most deficient \nbridges, an issue we all agreed was important.\n  We have $75 million in new housing vouchers that will shelter \nhomeless veterans, including our struggling veterans who have returned \nfrom Iraq and Afghanistan. This is critical funding for which our \ncommunities and our veterans are waiting.\n  It rejects hundreds of millions of dollars in cuts that were \noriginally proposed by the White House, cuts that would have thrown \nAmtrak into bankruptcy and made the congestion at our airports worse, \nnot better.\n  Our bill also includes $200 million which is urgently needed to \nprovide housing counseling services to keep struggling mortgage holders \nin their homes.\n  I wish to take a moment to talk about that last item, the $200 \nmillion for housing counseling. This Nation is in the middle of a \nhousing crisis. Millions of homeowners are at risk of losing their \nhomes in the next few quarters as interest rates on billions and \nbillions of dollars in mortgages are being adjusted upward.\n  On Monday, a few days ago, the President's own Treasury Secretary, \nHank Paulson, and his Housing Secretary, Alphonso Jackson, made \nspeeches on the need for Congress to address the many steps necessary \nto minimize this crisis. Secretary Paulson complained at a national \nhousing forum about the number of borrowers who were entering \nforeclosure without contacting either their lender or their mortgage \ncounselor. He said:\n\n       For this public outreach campaign to be successful, there \n     must be enough trained mortgage counselors to answer the \n     phone when homeowners call. The administration requested \n     funding for NeighborWorks America and other nonprofit \n     mortgage counseling operations in its budget.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/05/senate-section/article/S14758-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14758-S14759]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as I was saying, Secretary Paulson has \nbeen complaining about the need for mortgage counseling, and he said:\n\n       For this public outreach campaign to be successful, there \n     must be enough trained mortgage counselors to answer the \n     phone when homeowners call. The administration requested \n     funding for NeighborWorks America and other nonprofit \n     mortgage counseling operations in its budget. But the \n     appropriations bill has yet to be finalized; Congress needs \n     to get it done quickly.\n\n  That was not me, that was Secretary Paulson. We can do that right \nnow. In fact, we could have done it last month. We are trying \ndesperately to send this bill in its final stages that includes \ncritical investment in housing counseling to the White House, just as \nSecretary Paulson said he wanted us to do.\n  The bipartisan conferees on this bill agree that the amount the \nPresident asked for was too low to meet the demand for housing \ncounseling, given the size of the problem. Congress acted. We increased \nit substantially. But even though every Republican conferee on our bill \nsigned onto that plan, we are now being blocked from sending it to the \nWhite House. I only wish the Senate Republican leadership would follow \nthe words of Secretary Paulson and Secretary Jackson about the need for \nthis urgent initiative.\n  Yesterday's Washington Post published an article on our $200 million \nhousing counseling initiative. I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record the Washington Post article.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Dec. 4, 2007]\n\n                   Nonprofit Groups Take Center Stage\n\n                            (By Renae Merle)\n\n       In the middle of his speech yesterday on the \n     administration's efforts to fix the mortgage crisis, Treasury \n     Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. paused to carefully spell out \n     a toll-free telephone number that troubled homeowners can \n     call for help.\n       The hotline is not staffed by government officials or \n     mortgage lenders. Rather, the calls are answered by consumer \n     counselors from nonprofit groups, which are taking an \n     increasingly high-profile role in helping borrowers with \n     mortgage problems.\n       The groups are acting in some cases as a buffer between \n     lenders and homeowners. Legislation is pending before \n     Congress that would tap NeighborWorks America, a national \n     nonprofit group, to distribute $200 million to local \n     counseling centers. In October, the Neighborhood Assistance \n     Corporation of America, often a vocal critic of mortgage \n     lenders, signed a deal with Countrywide Financial, the \n     nation's biggest mortgage lender, to help restructure loans \n     for struggling Countrywide clients.\n       However the administration addresses the mortgage crisis, \n     ``they are going to need the nonprofit community,'' said \n     Kenneth D. Wade, chief executive of NeighborWorks.\n       His group is training new housing counselors and plans to \n     double its counseling staff by next month. ``We think every \n     consumer needs a mortgage adviser,'' he said.\n       Nonprofit organizations around the country are already \n     seeing a soaring demand for their services. St. Ambrose \n     Housing Aid Center in Baltimore, which usually sees about 700 \n     families a year, says it has met with almost 2,000 so far \n     this year.\n       At the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, where \n     about half the counselors at its member agencies focus on \n     housing issues, President Susan Keating says: ``We are very, \n     very busy.''\n       Government and mortgage industry officials don't often \n     agree on what caused the mortgage crisis, what its impact \n     will be, or how to cure it, but they all say that reaching \n     homeowners before they go into foreclosure is difficult.\n       If a homeowner with an adjustable-rate mortgage that is \n     about to reset, or one who is behind in payments receives \n     mail from his lender offering help, the homeowner responds 3 \n     to 5 percent of the time, according to Hope Now, a new \n     alliance of mortgage industry and nonprofit organizations. If \n     the offer comes from a community group, the response rate is \n     about 25 percent. About 50 percent of homeowners who go into \n     foreclosure do so without ever contacting their lender.\n       ``If we are to make a difference, that number has to be \n     reduced,'' Paulson said.\n       The best hope, many think, may be through the nonprofit \n     community. The toll-free number Paulson touted--888-995-\n     HOPE--has seen a spike in volume, to 3,000 calls a day from \n     300 a year ago.\n       There are 180 consumer counselors from six nonprofit groups \n     answering those calls. That will increase to 250 by the end \n     of the year, according to the Homeownership Preservation \n     Foundation, which manages the hotline.\n       With an estimated 2 million adjustable-rate mortgages \n     scheduled to reset in the next two years, even that likely \n     will not be enough. ``We are definitely not going to be \n     stopping at 250,'' said Tracy Morgan, a spokeswoman for the \n     foundation, which is largely financed by the mortgage \n     industry.\n       The counselors focus on diagnosing the homeowners' \n     problems, then direct them to a local community group for \n     help or guide them through a call with their lender. The \n     initial call usually lasts about 45 minutes as the counselor \n     puts together a detailed budget analysis and creates an \n     action plan for the homeowner, according to the foundation. \n     That could include getting a second job or reducing spending. \n     The foundation does not charge homeowners for the service.\n       In a separate program, the Neighborhood Assistance \n     Corporation of America acts as a go-between, working out \n     deals with lenders on behalf of borrowers. Under its deal \n     with Countrywide, the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of \n     America has restructured about 200 loans.\n       Like many nonprofit groups, it has seen demand for its \n     services climb in the past year and attributes most of the \n     increase to homeowners with adjustable-rate mortgages. To \n     keep up with demand, the organization is opening five offices \n     around the country and is hiring about 30 employees a month.\n       ``This is just the beginning. It is going to get far \n     worse,'' said Bruce Marks, the group's chief executive.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this article describes the importance of \nnonprofit housing counseling agencies and all they can do to help keep \nour mortgage holders in their homes.\n  Finally, I wish to say this: In the recent days, the storms in my \nState of Washington highlight how critical and important this bill is. \nDevastating mud slides and floods in my State of Washington and the \nState of Oregon have swamped out homes and washed out roads all across \nour States. It has been devastating. Families are hurting. People \ncannot get to work. People cannot get to where they need to go. Many of\n\n[[Page S14760]]\n\nour roads are closed, including a 20-mile stretch of Interstate 5, a \nmajor artery connecting Seattle and Portland, which will be closed \nthrough Thursday, possibly longer, and the floods have virtually \nisolated communities across the Pacific Northwest. My heart goes out to \nall these families who have been affected.\n  We are going to be feeling the effect of this storm you have been \nwatching on television for days, weeks, possibly months. That is not \njust because it caused serious damage to our roads and bridges. The \nclosure of I-5 forced cars and trucks traveling from Seattle to \nPortland to detour all the way to the Tri-Cities. That is a drive that \nnot only takes 4 hours longer, but it means our drivers have to go \nacross a high mountain pass, not once but twice, to get to Portland. \nThink about the effect that is going to have on our businesses and our \neconomy.\n  The impact of that storm reinforces how important transportation \ninfrastructure is to every single one of us. We need to make those \ninvestments in our roads, in our bridges, in our airports, in our \nrailways because one rain storm, one bridge disaster, one airport \ndisruption can have huge impacts on our families and our economy \nthroughout the region and throughout the country.\n  I am deeply disappointed the Republican leadership has said no. This \nis a bill that has passed the conference committee, passed the House, \nand it has one more step to make it to the President. It has bipartisan \nsupport. There is no reason we cannot finish this business, send it to \nthe President, and get one of the critical appropriations bills done \nthat he has been yelling we have been holding up. It is here. We are \nready. We are waiting for a response.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I hear the distinguished Senator from \nWashington and other Members on that side of the aisle complain about \ntheir inability to get things done. But I have to remind them, here we \nare on December 5, 2007. We have been operating on a continuing \nresolution because the majority has failed to pass and send to the \nPresident 11 appropriations bills. We are not doing the basic work \nCongress is supposed to do to keep the lights on, to keep the \nGovernment working. Unfortunately, it doesn't stop there.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will not yield.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I think the Senator from Washington made a point to show \nthe Senator from Texas is incorrect.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will reclaim my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has the floor.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will be glad to respond to the distinguished Senator \nafter I conclude my remarks.\n  The fact now is that we have before us an effort--a misguided \neffort--to protect 23 or so million Americans from a middle-class tax \nincrease. We know health care providers and physicians are going to be \nsubjected to Draconian cuts in their reimbursement rates. We know our \nintelligence community needs a permanent solution to the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act, which will expire in February. And we \nknow that instead of providing the funding to our troops that they need \nin order to protect us and our allies in the global war on terror, we \nare seeing strings attached, other qualifications insisted upon by the \nother party, which have impeded and slowed down and, indeed, to this \npoint stopped our ability to fund our troops.\n  I wish to particularly, though, focus on the tax increase that, as a \nresult of the inaction of the majority--the so-called alternative \nminimum tax--is going to take place unless we find some way to work our \nway through this issue without a tremendous tax increase on other hard-\nworking Americans.\n  If there were ever a misnomer for a tax, this would be it because for \nan increasing number of Americans the alternative minimum tax is \nneither alternative, nor is it minimal.\n  Congress, it should be remembered, created the AMT almost 40 years \nago in response to the testimony of the then-Secretary of the Treasury \nthat 155 taxpayers paid zero Federal income tax on their 1967 tax \nreturns. Unfortunately, but I guess predictably, this tax, created to \ntarget the very rich, the 155 who paid no taxes, has now grown to cover \nroughly 6 million people today and will grow to cover roughly 23 \nmillion people next year unless action is taken. It has, in the \nprocess, grown to cover more and more taxpayers and now will capture \nunsuspecting middle- class taxpayers by surprise unless Congress acts. \nThis is because, unlike the regular income tax, the AMT is not indexed \nfor inflation. This means that over time, economic growth and inflation \nhave caused a steady increase in the number of middle-income taxpayers \nwho will get hit by the AMT. Working parents who have children and \nqualify for deductions and credits under the standard tax system get a \nrude awakening when they discover they are subjected to the alternative \nminimum tax, which literally cancels out many of these deductions. This \nwill add unnecessary complexity to the Tax Code and increase tax \ncompliance costs and complicate taxpayers' decisions.\n  In recent years, Congress has enacted temporary fixes to prevent the \nAMT from hitting millions of taxpayers with a higher tax bill. While \nthis solution is not perfect, it did at least limit the reach of the \nAMT.\n  Now, the Senate has considered legislation on five different \noccasions that would have either eliminated the AMT or greatly scaled \nit back. In one instance, not a single member of the majority party \nvoted to fully repeal the AMT, and only one Democrat supported a \nproposal that would have rolled the increase in the AMT back to rates \nthat took place under President Clinton. Of course, history tells us \nthat President Clinton himself vetoed the bill that would have \neliminated the AMT back in 1999.\n  We know the majority leader has now filed cloture on H.R. 3996, known \nas the Temporary Tax Relief Act of 2007. Note, Mr. President, the \ntitle, ``Temporary Tax Relief.'' While the bill provides limited \ntemporary relief for taxpayers, it, at the same time, permanently \nincreases taxes on America's entrepreneurs and makes it more difficult \nfor the United States to remain competitive in the global capital \nmarket. In other words, it makes taxpayers pay for the mistake Congress \nmade 40 years ago when it created the AMT.\n  The bill makes fundamental changes to the laws affecting the taxation \nof partnerships. These partnerships have successfully encouraged the \npooling of capital, ideas, and skills in a manner that promotes \nentrepreneurship and risk-taking, and, not to be overlooked, jobs. The \nbill raises taxes on capital formation in the United States and will \nincrease the cost of and thus decrease the availability of capital to \nbusinesses throughout the country. The bill will severely handicap a \nvibrant and growing part of the U.S. economy in terms of our global \ncompetitiveness.\n  International competition for capital is a driving factor for \nbusiness. At a time when many of us are raising concerns regarding the \ncompetitiveness of U.S. capital markets and pointing out that our \neconomic competitors are doing everything they can to emulate the \nsuccess of our capital markets, the last thing we should want to do is \nto put the United States and U.S. businesses to a disadvantage by \nincreasing taxes on capital formation and driving investment dollars \naway to other markets. We simply can't afford for the Senate to tax \nlong-term investments in a way that puts America at a competitive \ndisadvantage.\n  Many on the other side would argue that any AMT relief should be \n``paid for'' by raising revenue in order to neutralize the effect of \nthe AMT cut. They say they can't just fix the AMT because it is revenue \nthey have already anticipated. This is a revenue which, in fact, they \nneed to fund the ever-increasing growth of the Federal Government, \nunfortunately demonstrated by pork-laden appropriations bills and a \nbloated budget. At every turn throughout the year's appropriations \nseason, we have seen the majority push for more and more spending. \nThreatened with a Presidential veto, they have dared the President to \nveto these bloated spending bills, only to find us in the mess we are \nin today.\n  Those on the other side of the aisle have been counting on the \nincreased revenue from the AMT to fund their growth of the Federal \nGovernment.\n\n[[Page S14761]]\n\nThey seem to consider the mistaken growth of the AMT to be some kind of \nwindfall profit, and, in fact, they seem to have forgotten where the \nmoney comes from in the first place. We all should know it comes from \nhard-working American taxpayers, families, people in my State of Texas \nwho already pay their fair share of taxes and can't afford to bear the \nburden of the Government's mistakes. So rather than fix the AMT and \nprotect taxpayers from this unwarranted and unexpected tax increase, my \ncolleagues would prefer to replace the AMT revenue with a new tax under \na new name. I have to tell you that this kind of shell game is a too \ntypical Washington approach.\n\n  Instead of figuring out ways to keep the hands of Washington \nbureaucrats in the pockets of taxpayers, this Congress ought to \ncontinue to do all it can to protect millions of middle-class taxpayers \nfrom a tax that no one ever intended for them to have to pay in the \nfirst place. Taxpayers already work for 4 months out of the year to pay \ntheir local, State, and Federal taxes. The last thing Congress should \nbe doing is increasing the number of days American taxpayers work for \nUncle Sam instead of for their families.\n  What is worse, Congress's inability to provide timely AMT relief will \nalso cause unnecessary delays in processing tax returns and getting \nrefunds to taxpayers who are entitled to them. The IRS Oversight Board, \nan independent board created by Congress as part of the IRS \nRestructuring and Reform Act of 1998, told Congress just last month \nthat a delay threatens the IRS's ability to process returns and issue \nrefunds in a timely manner and will impose a significant burden on \ntaxpayers. But that is where we find ourselves today as a result of the \nmismanagement of our agenda.\n  According to the IRS governing Oversight Board, delaying the filing \nseason by just 2 weeks would delay the processing of 6.7 million \nreturns, putting a hold on $17 billion in refunds owed to hard-working \nAmerican taxpayers. If the tax season is delayed by 1 month, this would \ndelay 40 million returns from being processed, and $87 billion in \nrefund checks owed to taxpayers would remain in the Federal Treasury. \nThis is real money to real Americans, and the political games \nsurrounding it ought to end. We should not be using the AMT relief as \nhostage to be exchanged for tax-and-spend policies and the growth of \nthe Federal Government. Taxpayers can't afford it and neither can the \nAmerican economy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, if I understand the Senator from Texas \ncorrectly, he is essentially complaining that Congress has not passed \nlegislation to prevent the alternative minimum tax from going into \neffect for American taxpayers for calendar year 2007. I think that is \nbasically what he is saying. I might say, Mr. President, there is not \none Senator on the floor who disagrees with that--maybe one or two, but \nthis Senator wants to fix AMT so Americans do not have to pay an \nadditional tax in calendar 2007 when they are preparing their tax \nreturns next year. I daresay virtually every Member on this side of the \naisle has that same belief. We do not want to force that additional tax \non Americans for all the reasons he correctly stated; namely, this was \na provision which was enacted in the code back in the early 1960s \nintended to ensure--I think there were 200 only, very wealthy Americans \nwho were not paying income taxes and who should pay some income taxes. \nThat was the genesis of the alternative minimum tax. Unfortunately, as \nhas been stated by many speakers, it was not indexed, so over the years \nmore and more middle-income taxpayers have had to pay this additional \ntax, and frankly, ironically perversely, the most wealthy Americans \nhave escaped.\n  So this alternative minimum tax does not do what it was intended to \ndo. It was not a tax on the most wealthy because basically the capital \ngains provisions in it are so low, the net effect is the basic rate is \n26 percent for the first $75,000 and 28 percent just above, and so it \naffects taxpayers who make between $75,000 and $500,000. That is who it \nhits. We want to repeal that for 2007. Virtually every Senator here \nwants to repeal that for 2007. We are trying to do it. We are trying to \nget that enacted--the repeal for 2007--so taxpayers don't pay it.\n  What has happened? We are being blocked. We are being blocked. Just \nas the Senator from Washington was trying to get an appropriations bill \nup, she was blocked in her effort by the other side of the aisle. Just \nas the President of the United States says: Congress, do your work, do \nyour work, pass appropriations bills, he is, in effect, instructing his \nminions here to do the opposite--to block. That is what is happening.\n  The Senator from Texas, I would daresay--and it is a presumption to \nsay this--would probably vote against efforts here on the floor to \nbring up a way to fix AMT. There is a cloture motion pending right now, \nMr. President. It is basically on the House-passed bill to fix AMT. The \nleader offered a couple suggestions. What are they? One is, well, if we \ncan't do that, let's take up the measure proposed by myself and the \nranking member of the Finance Committee, Senator Grassley. What does it \nprovide? It basically says: Okay, repeal AMT. We have the AMT patch \nunpaid for, 2007. In addition, we have to pass these so-called tax \nextenders for 1 or 2 years and pay for it. Nobody seems to complain \nabout that; the complaint is whether the AMT should be paid for. We are \nwilling, myself and Senator Grassley, to bring up and advocate the \npassing of that legislation. Blocked. We couldn't get consent to bring \nthat up. Not paying for AMT but paying for extenders blocked.\n  Well, Mr. President, I have another suggestion. In fact, it was even \nmentioned by our leader. Let us bring up AMT not paid for alone. Will \nthe Republicans object to that? So far, they have. I am waiting. Where \nis the Republican Party? Do they or do they not want AMT fixed in 2007? \nWhat could be easier? Bring it up--alone, unpaid for. Where are they? \nWhy don't they accept it? What is going on here, Mr. President? What \ncould be easier? What could be more appropriate? What could be more \nRepublican? Lowering taxes, unpaid for. No, they do not want to do \nthat, either, which is a good indication to me that what is really \ngoing on here--what is really going on here--is that side of the aisle \nwill do whatever is possible to prevent the Congress from even passing \nlegislation that is very good for the American people.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Will the Senator from Montana yield for a question?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Montana, within \nthe extenders package is the deduction of the State sales tax \nextension, something that has been granted by Congress for the last 7 \nyears to a number of States that were, prior to a few years ago, not \nable to deduct their State sales tax. That is very important to people \nin my State. We need to have this extender passed. I wish to ask the \nSenator from Montana if that is one of the issues that is being blocked \nnow by the Republicans as they object to going to this package because \nas we come up on the end of the year, as families are looking at what \nto purchase for Christmas, this is something extremely important to \nthem. If this is not going to be extended, it will impact their incomes \nat a critical time, when we are facing rising gas prices, the cost of \nour mortgages, and people are worried about everything else.\n  So I would ask the Senator from Montana, is the State sales tax \ndeduction part of that extension that is now being blocked?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I say to my dear friend from Washington that it is part \nof the extender package that is in there. So if that were extended this \nyear and that would go into effect, the good people of the State of \nWashington would not have to pay that.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator from Montana. It is very important \nto our State and a number of other States--I believe Texas and other \nStates here. I hope the Republicans don't continue to block this so we \ncan indeed make sure our constituents are taken care of.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I appreciate that. I may also say I suspect--I am only \nguessing here--the objection from the other side of the aisle is in \npart mischievous. Senators from the other side of the aisle wish to \nforce some votes on some other measures which are not apt at this \nmoment. What are they? President Bush's tax cuts, extending the tax \ncuts, extending the 2001 tax cuts. Some\n\n[[Page S14762]]\n\nSenators on the other side want to force a vote on that. That doesn't \nexpire until 2010. This is 2007; AMT applies to 2007. We have to act \nnow. This isn't 2010.\n  Others wish to vote on the 2003 tax cuts, which expire--when? Again, \n2010. Not now; in 2010.\n  I see my time is expiring. I strongly urge people to focus on what is \ngoing on here--not the rhetoric, just look at the facts. The facts are \nthat I, as chairman of the Finance Committee, am willing and do \nadvocate bringing up legislation to repeal the alternative minimum tax \nas it applies to taxpayers for 2007. There are various ways to do it. \nOne is the House-passed bill. If that doesn't work, we will do the \nmeasure proposed by myself and Senator Grassley, which is AMT, not paid \nfor, but the tax extenders paid for. If that doesn't work, I am even \nwilling to go so far as to see AMT alone, not paid for. That is where \nwe should be and what we should do.\n  Finally, I don't know if I am known as a partisan guy. I think I tend \nto be perceived as somebody who tries to work things out, tries to be \npragmatic, tries to get things done, not flail in a partisan manner, \nnot engage in flowery rhetoric for the heck of it, getting headlines, \nand so forth. There comes a time when you have to call it like it is, \nsay it like it is. That is what I am trying to do. I am trying to be \npractical and pragmatic here by calling it, saying what is going on \nhere, and that is, despite the cries from the other side, despite the \ncries from the White House for Congress to fix AMT, they themselves, \nbehind the scenes, indirectly, are blocking it. They are blocking it. \nThey are saying one thing and doing something else.\n  As my father used to tell me, it is deeds, not words. They have the \nwords but they also are blocking the deeds. I hope very much they \nchange their minds and allow us to pass legislation here to fix AMT, \nbecause it is up to them to let us do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Georgia is on the \nfloor. I know it is our custom to take turns on each side of the aisle, \nbut I ask his indulgence. I have to chair a subcommittee hearing at \n2:30. Unless he has a scheduling conflict, if he would allow me to go \nfirst, I would appreciate it.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. As a Bears fan, I will be happy to relinquish the time \nto the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you. We need all the help we can get.\n  Mr. President, what I have heard this afternoon on the floor of the \nSenate is nothing short of incredible. The Senator from Washington came \nto the floor and asked to bring an appropriations bill up for us to \nconsider. Have you noticed how much business we are doing around here? \nThe answer is none. So there is nothing to conflict with it. We have \nplenty of time. Shouldn't we earn our paycheck today by doing \nsomething? The bill she wanted to bring is an appropriations bill and \nit is a conference report that has been signed by every Democrat and \nRepublican--bipartisan. Everybody is agreed on it.\n  She asked to bring it to the floor to consider it, and there was an \nobjection from the Senator from Texas. Senator John Cornyn objected.\n  Senator Murray tried to explain what was in this bill, how important \nit is. He didn't waiver. He said that is it, we object to considering \nthis bill.\n  Eventually she yielded the floor to Senator Cornyn who stood up and \nsaid, Do you know what is wrong with this Senate? We are not \nconsidering any appropriations bills. Just minutes before it was \nSenator Cornyn of Texas who objected to considering an appropriations \nbill. That is a matter of record.\n  But beyond that procedural experience, look what was in that bill. It \nis not just--just?--transportation and housing and urban development; \n$200 million is in there for housing counselors across America. What \nare they going to do? They are going to try to help families work \nthemselves out of this mortgage foreclosure crisis we are facing. This \nmoney is desperately needed. Senator Murray worked to put it in the \nbill so people would have a helping hand to save their homes when they \nare facing foreclosure.\n  How big an issue is this? Mr. President, 2.2 million Americans face \nforeclosure on their mortgages. If they go forward with those \nforeclosures, 44 million American homes will lose value.\n  You see, the mortgage crisis is not just your neighbor's problem, it \nis your problem. If that house on your block is foreclosed upon, the \nvalue of your home goes down. That is a fact. So 44 million homeowners \nacross America are waiting to see if this Government will do anything.\n  Senator Murray comes to the floor and tries to move the bill to do \nsomething. The Republicans object.\n  I tell you, this is an issue that strikes home in Illinois. Cook \nCounty, where Chicago is located, has the second highest number of \nforeclosures of any county in America--56,000 mortgage foreclosures. As \na result, two out of three homes in Cook County, IL, will lose value. \nThis is a crisis. It is not only a housing crisis, it has put our \neconomy in a tailspin. We are trying to move and act and do something \nabout it, and the Republicans say no. No, we don't want to do that.\n\n  That is unfortunate. It is unfortunate for the homeowners who need a \nhelping hand. It is unfortunate for their neighbors who do not realize \nthat this kind of effort by the Republican Senators is not in the best \ninterests of America or its economy.\n  It troubles me as well because this bill includes money to rebuild \nthe bridge near Minneapolis, the one that came crashing down, with \ndeaths involved and real concern across America about the quality and \nsafety of our infrastructure. Senator Murray, on this bill, on a \nbipartisan basis, puts money in--$1 billion, is it?--for bridges across \nAmerica, including the bridge in Minneapolis.\n  I would beg Senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota to speak to Senator \nCornyn of Texas and ask him to take his hold off this bill, to stop \nobjecting for the good of his own home State of Minnesota and for all \nof our States. I hope Senator Cornyn of Texas will reconsider his \nposition; will remove his objection to this bill; will let us move to \nthis appropriations bill in a timely fashion.\n  This is not the only time we have run into this. Senator Conrad of \nNorth Dakota was here a moment ago, begging for the farm bill to come \nto the floor. Every 5 years we have a new farm bill. It takes a lot of \nwork to put it together. It is a very important bill to Illinois and \nalmost every State, and the Republicans have stopped it in its tracks. \nWe waited here on this floor for 2 weeks and did nothing because the \nRepublicans refused to reach an agreement on moving this bill forward. \nThe Senate rules are written so that even a minority party can stop \nbusiness. Senator Conrad said, let's agree on a list of amendments. You \ncan have yours, we will have ours, but let's get going, let's get to \nwork. And the Republican answer is no.\n  It is not the first time. Fifty-six times so far this year, the \nRepublicans have filibustered, stopping debate, stopping legislation, \nstopping attempts to make America better--56 times.\n  You might say, I am sure that goes on every day, doesn't it? No. The \nrecord in the Senate is 61 filibusters over a 2-year period of time. \nThe Republican Senators this year are about to break the record for \nfilibusters in one Congress in 1 year. It tells you what they are all \nabout. It is not doing the people's business. It is not trying to solve \nthe housing crisis, dealing with the farm issues. It is about stopping \nthe business on the floor of the Senate. They are using that \nopportunity and that authority to do that.\n  I want to correct the Record. Staff just advised me that Senator \nSpecter and not Senator Cornyn was directed on behalf of the Republican \nleadership to object to the earlier bill. I want to make it clear and \napologize to my colleague Senator Cornyn--we are friends--and I \nmisrepresented his position on that because it was, in fact, Senator \nSpecter of Pennsylvania speaking on behalf of the Republican \nleadership, Senator McConnell of Kentucky, who objected to the \ntransportation bill. I hope the Record reflects that, and my apologies \nto Senator Cornyn for mentioning his name improperly.\n  But the position still stands. A Republican leadership position, \ndirected to stop the appropriations bill, and\n\n[[Page S14763]]\n\nthen Republicans coming to the floor saying, Isn't it a shame we can't \nmove appropriations bills.\n  The last thing I want to mention is the alternative minimum tax. This \nwill affect 19 million Americans if we don't change it. Some are in \nhigher income categories. Many are not. We want to make sure we correct \nthis problem and move forward with it. I think the responsible thing to \ndo is, if you are going to cut a tax, either raise another tax or cut \nspending. I think that is responsible. Republicans reject that. They \nsay we want to cut taxes and we don't want to pay for it. We want to \nadd to the deficit and it is OK, and they can prevail because we don't \nhave 60 votes. It takes 60 votes to accomplish something here on the \nSenate floor of controversy.\n  So what we offered to them is their way of looking at the world. We \nwill let you cut this tax and not pay for it, just add to the deficit, \nthe old Republican way of doing things. You prevail. You win. And their \nanswer? No, we won't even let you go to the bill under those \ncircumstances. It is pretty clear; it is a question of blocking and \nintransigence.\n  In addition to the fact that the Republicans are blocking the farm \nbill, an attempt to deal with the mortgage crisis in America, bridge \nbuilding for the State of Minnesota and all other States, and dealing \nwith the alternative minimum tax, it is pretty clear they want this \nCongress to end without any accomplishments. They had a do-nothing \nCongress which cost them control in the last election. They are \ndetermined to do everything they can to make sure we do nothing in this \nCongress.\n  Sadly, the message to the American voters is we need more votes. If \nyou want real change in Congress, we need more Senators to come to this \nfloor who want to accomplish things, rather than stop things and block \nthings. That is what we have seen repeatedly here, this day and every \nday during the course of the session. I had hoped a handful of \nRepublican Senators would stand up and say: Enough. We have a \nresponsibility to the people of this country, a responsibility that \ngoes beyond our party responsibility. We need to pass a farm bill, we \nneed to do something about the housing crisis, we need to give real tax \nrelief to American families.\n  We are still waiting for those voices, and I hope they will come to \nthe floor and accomplish that. In the meantime, we will continue to \nmake our offers to the Republican leadership, to find a responsible way \nto move forward. I hope they will accept this opportunity and I hope we \ncan get something accomplished. It is clear, as this empty Chamber \npasses hour after weary hour doing nothing, the American people are fed \nup with it. I think they are fed up with it enough to want real change \nin the next election.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week the Middle East observed a \nhistoric anniversary, in fact, a historic anniversary for all of \nmankind, for the 29th of November was the 60th anniversary of the U.N. \nresolution partitioning the State of Israel and providing a homeland \nfor the Israeli people. I had the opportunity to be in Israel while \nthat celebration was taking place. Another event took place in \nAnnapolis, MD, the home State of the Presiding Officer, last Tuesday, \nthe 28th of November, when 18 Arab Nations, the Palestinian Authority, \nand Prime Minister Olmert of Israel met in Annapolis, to try to begin \nthe process for the roadmap for peace in the Middle East. I think all \nof us are encouraged, happy, and rewarded that the result of that \nconference was an agreement between the Palestinian Authority and \nIsrael to try, over the next 12 months, to reach an agreement by the \nend of 2008, which will in fact bring about peace in the Middle East.\n  All of us have great hope, but all of us have great wonder how we get \nfrom the agreement to try to actually having that happen. Since I had \nthe occasion to be in Israel, I thought I would share for a second the \nfact that, as complex as the Middle East is, as challenging as the \nissues are that face the nation of Israel and the Palestinian \nAuthority, there are some simple steps upon which we can build to \npossibly get to a true roadmap to a lasting peace in the Middle East.\n  There is no question, from having gone there, that the first step is \nsecurity. The State of Israel deserves the security to live in peace \nand without intimidation and without threat. Not long ago, Israel took \nits settlements out of Gaza, moved those settlements out of Gaza to its \nperimeter. Within months, Hamas took over as the leading authority in \nGaza, a Palestinian area, and instead of securing it for themselves \nbegan a method of intimidation and threat and terror against the people \nof Israel. Last Saturday, I stood on the last Israeli outpost \noverlooking Gaza, talking to an Israeli man and Israeli woman who lived \nin the settlement outside of Gaza, as a rocket went off and was fired \ninto that very settlement, a practice that every day continues to take \nplace, to intimidate, to threaten, and to terrorize.\n\n  As long as elements of terror such as Hamas and Hezbollah in Lebanon \ncontinue to disrupt, we will never be able to reach a platform upon \nwhich we can have a roadmap to peace. But security could possibly take \nplace. I want to commend the Palestinian Authority on its initial steps \nin the West Bank, one village at a time, to attempt to bring about \npeace and security on that side of Israel and in that area of the \ndilemma.\n  I met with the Foreign Minister, Riyad Maliki, of the Palestinian \nAuthority, who passionately convinced me that he and his leadership are \ninterested in seeing to it that they deliver on that security, because \nthey understand that without security there can never be any peace, \nwithout peace there can never be a Palestinian State.\n  This President, George Bush, whom I commend for bringing about the \nAnnapolis conference, was very courageous 6 years ago when as President \nof the United States he declared he would support a homeland and \nsecurity for the Palestinian people, right after the Palestinians and \nthe people of the Middle East accepted and acknowledged Israel's right \nto exist and respected its state.\n  I believe the desire is in the Palestinian people to have their \nhomeland. I believe the will is there to see to it that is \naccomplished. But as long as terror, through the elements of Hamas and \nHezbollah, continue to threaten and intimidate the people of Israel, it \nwill never happen.\n  So the first step, following that agreement at Annapolis, is for the \nPalestinian Authority to secure Gaza and to secure the West Bank. But \nyou do not go to the Middle East, as I have four times in the last 5 \nyears, and not realize in the end it is also all about Iran.\n  As long as there are state sponsors of terrorism, whether it be \nHezbollah or Hamas or whether it be infiltration of terrorists or IEDs \ninto Iraq, you can never truly have peace and security.\n  But this President deserves great credit for setting up the \nconference at Annapolis. Condoleezza Rice deserves great credit for \nfive times traveling to the Middle East, from one Arab state to the \nother, encouraging those states to attend. It should not go unnoticed \nby anybody, us in America and Ahmadinejad in Iran, that when finally \npressed, the 18 Arab states all came to Annapolis because, in the end, \nthey all want peace. But in the absence of security and the presence of \nterror it cannot happen.\n  I commend our President for bringing about the conference in \nAnnapolis. I commend the people of Israel for making the first step in \nGaza and acknowledge their concern now that that first step has only \nbeen rewarded with acts of terror against their own people and \nencourage the Palestinian Authority to continue to work in the West \nBank, and later in Gaza, to root out terrorism, bring about security, \nso the State of Palestine and the State of Israel can live in harmony. \nAnd for us in the free world, one of the biggest threats to our \nsecurity is lessened because people are living together in peace and \nnot in terror and not in fear.\n  In closing, I wish to acknowledge the great ally we have in Israel, \nthe resilience of their people, to that young man and woman I met on \nthe hill overlooking Gaza, who daily meet the threats of rockets coming \nfrom terrorists, and let them know that we in America are with them, \nand one day peace and security can become a reality if we begin to get \nthe security in\n\n[[Page S14764]]\n\nthe areas of the West Bank and in Gaza.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, what is happening in the Senate is going \nto give frustration a new meaning. I cannot begin to explain how \nunbelievably frustrating it is for people elected to come to this body, \nthey say the greatest deliberative body, to be at parade rest day after \nday after day, unable to move because of two simple words uttered \nalmost routinely every day by the minority: I object. I object to \neverything. I object. I object.\n  Mark Twain once was asked if he would engage in a debate. And he \nsaid: Of course, as long as I can take the negative side.\n  They said: We have not told you what the subject is.\n  He said: That does not matter. The negative side will take no \npreparation.\n  It takes no preparation to say ``I object,'' to take the negative \nside of everything. Yet that is what has happened. We have people \nposing as a set of human brake pads, determined to stop everything in \nthe Senate. Maybe that would make not much difference if there were not \nthings that were so urgent and in need of being done.\n  I sat here for a while this afternoon and saw something quite \nstunning. My colleague stood up and said, on the appropriations bill \nthat passed the Senate by a wide margin, over 80 votes on \ntransportation-housing and so on, she wanted to bring the conference \nreport up to the Senate. There was an objection by the Republican \nleader of the Senate: I object.\n  Then, immediately afterwards, Senator Cornyn from Texas stood up and \nsaid: I do not understand what all of the problem is, the way the \nmajority is running this place, why do we not get appropriations bills \nto the floor of the Senate?\n  This was immediately after his side had already objected to bringing \nan appropriations bill to the floor of the Senate. It is as if they \nthink no one is watching. These are illusionists who provide no \nillusion. Nobody is watching, they think. This is all done in broad \ndaylight. They say: We object to bringing appropriations bills to the \nfloor of the Senate. Then they stand up and seek recognition and ask: \nWhy are you not bringing appropriations bills to the floor of the \nSenate? Do they believe people do not watch and listen and understand?\n\n  It is absolutely beyond me. Now, let me describe this ``I object'' \nstrategy. I object to appropriations bills, they say. Do you know this \nyear we even had to file a cloture petition to shut off a filibuster on \na motion to proceed to the appropriations bill that would fund homeland \nsecurity needs.\n  We are in this process of waging a war on terrorism to protect our \ncountry, and we cannot bring a bill to the floor earlier this year on \nhomeland security appropriations to fund the programs without having a \nfilibuster by the other side on a motion to proceed, not even on the \nbill, but a motion to proceed to the bill. That describes what the \nother side has done all year long.\n  Now, in December, they come to the floor and they say: Well, where \nare the appropriations bills? Well, I will tell you where they are; you \nobjected to all of them. You took all the action necessary to try to \nprohibit us from moving these appropriations bills. That is the case.\n  Alternative minimum tax, they call it AMT. It is a fancy way of \ndescribing an alternative tax system that recalculates your tax. It is \ngoing to affect millions more Americans. We should fix that. Why have \nwe not fixed that today? Because the other side has objected. The \nRepublican leader has objected. That is why we have not fixed it.\n  The farm bill. Why have we not finished the farm bill? Because the \nRepublicans have objected. We wanted to come out here and finish it. We \nhave made unanimous consent requests. We have an offer in front of them \nnow with the amendments and so on, but they continue to object.\n  I have said often, if farmers behaved the way this Congress--and \nespecially the minority--behaves, they would not have a crop to plant \nbecause they would not get time. They would not have a crop to harvest \nif they got it planted because they would not have time. They would \nobject. They would not milk the cows when the cows were fresh. I mean \nthey would not have a crop or cows. You cannot put all these things \noff, nor should the Senate put them off.\n  An energy bill. Well we tried to go to conference on an energy bill. \nThere was an objection on the Republican side. So now we are hoping to \ntry to be able to consider an energy bill that comes from the House. I \nhope we can round up the votes for it. But we never got to conference \nbecause of an objection on the Republican side.\n  Now my colleague, as I listened this afternoon, said the proposal on \nthe alternative minimum tax by the Democrats was more taxes on the \nAmerican people, a substitution of taxes and to accommodate the growth \nof Government.\n  Let me take both those proposals. This issue of the growth of \nGovernment is fascinating to me because this President has proposed \nmore spending than any President in the history of this country, by \nfar. We have in front of this body right now a proposal by this \nPresident for $196 billion, none of it paid for, to support the war in \nIraq and Afghanistan.\n  Now, $196 billion, that is $16 billion a month, $4 billion a week, \nall of it added to the Federal debt, none of it paid for. We have \nsomeone over there stand up and say we are the big spenders, we are the \nones who want to spend money, after the President has asked for $196 \nbillion in additional spending that he wants.\n  He said that $22 billion we wanted to invest in this country was too \nmuch money. We were $22 billion apart, with respect to the President's \nbudget and our bipartisan approach on the appropriations committee. He \nsaid: No, that is too much money, that $22 billion to invest in our \ncountry's roads and bridges and health care and energy. That is too \nmuch money to invest in our country, but I want $196 billion, none of \nit paid for, all of it outside the budget, for my priorities, the \nPresident said.\n  It is interesting to me that even as we are told by my colleague from \nTexas and others that this is growth in spending and that somehow the \nprofligate spenders are on this side of the aisle, and I must say I \nhave held now 12 hearings on the issue of waste, fraud, and abuse in \nthe countries of Iraq and Afghanistan in the prosecution of these wars. \nWaste, fraud, and abuse by contractors, a massive amount of money \nshoveled out the door by this administration to contractors.\n  Let me tell you what the result has been: A blind eye. No one seems \nto care. You want some nails? I know where there are 50,000 pounds of \nnails lying in the sand. You know where it is? In the country of Iraq, \n50,000 pounds of nails lying in the sands of Iraq in a pile.\n  You know why? Because the contractor ordered the wrong size. But it \ndid not matter, throw them away, reorder. It is a cost-plus contract. \nThe American taxpayers are picking up the tab. Do you want to see \nwaste, fraud, and abuse? This is a hand towel provided to American \nsoldiers.\n  I ask unanimous consent to show the item on the floor of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This was provided to American soldiers by the subsidiary \nof Halliburton Corporation. They ordered hand towels under their \ncontract for the American soldiers. Well, guess what. The guy who \nordered these was the order manager sitting in Kuwait. His name was \nHenry Bunting. He came and testified before my hearing. He said: I \nordered these towels, but I ordered white towels, plain white towels. \nMy supervisor said: You cannot do that. You need for our name, Kellogg, \nBrown and Root, the subsidiary of Halliburton, to be embroidered on the \ntowel.\n\n  He said: Well, that is going to triple the cost. He was told: It does \nnot matter. It is a cost-plus contract. The American taxpayer pays for \nthis. Katy bar the door. Spend whatever you like. The American taxpayer \nwill pay for it. Two hundred and twenty million dollars to a contractor \nto rehabilitate health clinics in Iraq. The $220 million is gone. The \ncontractor has it all, and there are 20 health clinics built.\n\n[[Page S14765]]\n\n  And a physician goes to the Health Minister and says: I want to see \nthese 220 health clinics the American taxpayer paid for; the Health \nMinister of Iraq said: Well, those, you have to understand, are \n``imaginary'' clinics.\n  Seven thousand six hundred dollars a month to rent an SUV, $45 a case \nfor a case of Coca-Cola, $85,000 trucks that have a flat tire and they \nare left beside the road to be torched in Iraq because they cannot fix \na flat tire.\n  American taxpayer is going to pay for all of that. It is a cost-plus \ncontract. You have a truck with a plugged fuel pump, do not worry, \nleave it behind. Yeah, it will get torched, but the American taxpayer \npays for that. So when I hear somebody talking about profligate \nspending, I say to them this: We have had four votes on the floor of \nthe Senate to set up a Truman Committee of the type Harry Truman led \ndedicated to root out waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  Four times we lost that vote. I am proud to tell you every Member of \nthe Senate on this side of the Senate voted with me, but four times we \nhave lost because there are some who talk a lot about spending but do \nnot care how much is spent.\n  This is the greatest waste, fraud, and abuse that has occurred in the \nhistory of this country with this profligate contracting. I have only \ndescribed the tip of the iceberg. I could spend an hour out here \ntelling you stories about the way the American taxpayer has been \nfleeced by the massive amount of money that is shoveled out the door \nand the $196 billion the President now wants; a substantial portion of \nit will also go to corporations and still no one is watching the \nstore. Still no one is watching the store. In Iraq itself, $8.9 billion \nis missing. Think of that. I daresay no one is looking for it.\n\n  Growth in government has a pretty hollow sound, it seems to me. The \ngrowth of spending, the waste, fraud, and abuse that is occurring under \nthe nose of this administration, an administration that seems \nunconcerned, is the most significant waste, fraud, and abuse in the \nhistory of this country. We need to stop it. I will offer again the \nissue of a Truman commission to set up a special committee to \ninvestigate this and put an end to it.\n  On the question of who pays taxes, my colleague says: This is fixing \nthe alternative minimum tax, but you are charging some others \nadditional taxes. Let me remind my colleague who is going to pay \nadditional taxes. The person who ran a hedge fund last year and made \n$1.7 billion was the highest paid person in this country that we know. \nIf you are adding that up, if someone asked: What is your monthly \nsalary, that person would have to say, it is about $145 million a \nmonth. Some would ask: What do you earn in a day. About $4.5 million a \nday. That is a pretty big salary.\n  Do you know something more interesting about that? The people earning \nat that level are paying an income tax rate in most cases of 15 \npercent. Think of that. There are no Americans going to work this \nmorning working in ordinary jobs who are paying 15 percent income tax. \nI guarantee they are paying much more.\n  One of the richest men in the world, Warren Buffett from Omaha, said \nin his offices they got permission from his employees to figure out \nwhat happened with respect to the percentage of taxes paid by the \nemployees. It turns out in that office, the lowest tax rate paid in his \noffice is paid by the second richest man in the world, Warren Buffett. \nHe said that is an outrage.\n  He said: I pay a lower percent of taxes from my income than my \nreceptionist does. That is an outrage. Some want to correct that. I do.\n  My colleague from Texas would say: You are going to hurt people \nengaged in capital accumulation. Well, it seems to me the issue is one \nof fairness. Why is it that one group of people who makes hundreds of \nmillions gets to pay a 15-percent tax rate. But a whole lot of other \npeople who work hard all day, take a shower at night because their \nlabor is important, come home with a meager paycheck and haven't made \nmuch progress with their salary in recent years, they look at their tax \nbill and are paying 25, 30, 35 percent, plus their Social Security \ntaxes.\n  When my colleague talks about the growth of government, I say: Look \nin the mirror. When my colleague talks about taxes, I say: Look in the \nmirror and ask yourself whether you want a fair tax system.\n  More important than that, I want to talk for a moment about \npriorities. When we are told that $196 billion ought to be made \navailable, none of it paid for, for the President's priorities, and we \ndon't have enough money for things at home, I ask a question about this \nyoung lady. Her name is Ta'shon Rain Littlelight. She is a beautiful \nyoung Indian girl from the Crow Reservation in Montana. Ta'shon was 5 \nyears old. Ta'shon died.\n  I held a hearing in Montana with Senator Tester on the Crow \nReservation. This little girl's grandmother came to the hearing and \nheld up this picture. She said Ta'shon died a very painful death, was \nin pain month after month. The kind of health care that should have \nbeen available to diagnose an illness which later became terminal was \nnot available to this little girl. So she lived a painful last 3 months \nwith a terminal illness and never got the health care she should have \nreceived. Not enough money for that, just not enough. Yes, this 5-year-\nold girl died. Not enough money for Indian health to deal with her.\n  I have shown my colleagues a picture of a little girl named Avis \nLittlewind. She was 14. She is dead as well. She took her own life. She \nlay in bed 90 days in a fetal position, missing school, 90 days, and \nsomehow it didn't raise alarms anywhere. She took her own life. No \nmental health treatment, no mental health treatment available on that \nreservation for that young lady.\n  I have shown my colleagues a picture of a woman brought into an \nemergency room--a Native American woman, as well. She had an 8-by-10 \npiece of paper attached to her thigh by a piece of masking tape, being \ntransported on a hospital gurney from the ambulance to the hospital \nwith a piece of paper attached by masking tape to her thigh that said \nto the hospital: If you accept this patient, understand that the \ncontract health care money is gone for the year. You accept this \npatient on your own dime and at your own risk, this patient with a \nheart attack.\n  We don't have enough money for our domestic needs. The President \nsays: No, I want $196 billion for my priorities. I have just described \nthe massive waste, fraud, and abuse with respect to the priorities of \ncontracting in Iraq. I care about Indian health care for a lot of \nreasons. I chair the Indian Affairs Committee. We have struggled \ndesperately to try to get the money we need for Indian health. That \nmoney is not available. Why? Because investment at home is not the \npriority. The fact is, these issues are life or death for a little girl \nlike Ta'shon Rain Littlelight. This Congress can do something about it.\n  One hundred years from now, we will all be dead. But historians can \nunderstand who we were. They can look at what this country decided to \ndo, what kind of decisions this Senate made by what we spent our money \non. What did we think was important? Someone once asked the question, \nif you were charged with the task of writing an obituary for someone \nyou had never met, and the only information you had was the check \nregister from that person's checkbook, what could you write about that \nperson? What you could write about that person is what you knew that \nperson to value based on what they spent their money on. What did they \ninvest in, contribute to? What was important to them? What was their \nvalue system?\n  The same will be true when historians evaluate what was important to \nus, what our value system was. So we have this dispute these days with \nPresident Bush and those on the other side of the aisle who are loyally \nsupportive of the President's priorities at this point. I am not \nsuggesting that we shouldn't work together. In fact, all of us have \nreached out to say: Let's find a way to reach compromise. But on issue \nafter issue after issue--the alternative minimum tax, the Energy bill, \nthe farm bill, appropriations bills--we have had great difficulty \ngetting anything other than a cold shoulder from the White House. \nDemocracy works and this system of government works only with \ncompromise. It is the only way it can work.\n  The majority leader was here today once again seeking an opportunity \nto have unanimous consent requests\n\n[[Page S14766]]\n\nagreed to or negotiated. The farm bill is an awfully good example. We \nhave now sent to the other side a list of things that we hope perhaps \nthey might agree to. And if they don't agree to that, to give us a list \nback. Let's find a way to have common lists of amendments to bring the \nfarm bill to the floor and finish it. That is a reasonable thing to do. \nYet we can't get that done, can't get the first baby step in the right \ndirection. All we get is hot air, a lot of rhetoric, discussion such as \nI heard this afternoon that somehow the majority is a group of \nprofligate spenders, and the majority wants to increase taxes. What a \nbunch of nonsense. It is completely at odds with the facts. It is as if \nthey believe that there are not cameras here and this isn't being \nrecorded.\n  I was thinking, as I was sitting here, about a story I heard when I \nwas a kid of Joseph Montgolfier from rural France. The story was in \n1783. He was sitting in a big, overstuffed chair looking at his \nfireplace in his country home. And as he watched the fireplace he saw \nsparks and smoke go up the chimney. As he contemplated the smoke and \nthe sparks, he thought: There is something taking the smoke and sparks \nup the chimney. That must be some sort of energy. And so several months \nlater he was in a meadow in rural France with burlap bags he had \ndampened and straw he was burning and he fashioned the first balloon. \nAnd it was the first recorded evidence of powered flight. He discovered \nthat hot air rises and used hot air to lift a balloon.\n\n  I was thinking about hot air today because I listened to what is \nsupposed to somehow pass for informed debate, and it is nothing but hot \nair. Why don't you pass the appropriations bills. OK. Let's try one. I \nobject, he says.\n  I don't understand that at all. Don't ask us to pass bills you are \ngoing to object to, if you are going to continue to stall and object. \nIf you want us to pass legislation, appropriations, energy, AMT, if you \nwant us to pass legislation, come to the floor this afternoon. Let's \nwork together and work out a process by which we pass legislation that \nadvances this country's interests. It is not as if we don't have \nsignificant challenges and significant interests. We do.\n  No one in this Chamber can suggest somehow that with the price of oil \nbobbing at around $90 to $100 a barrel that we don't have serious \nchallenges and a need to pass an energy bill. The House of \nRepresentatives is doing an energy bill. We did one in the Senate prior \nto this. We tried to go to conference, and there was objection. So we \ncouldn't even get to conference. But we will, I think and I hope, have \nthe Energy bill the House is going to pass and then send over to the \nSenate next week. There is an urgent need to have conservation, \nefficiency, and renewable energy, as well as continue to use fossil \nfuels without injuring the environment. We can do all of those things, \nand should, but we will need some cooperation. We are not asking for \nthe Moon. We are just saying this country faces obvious challenges.\n  No one party can do it alone. We have a 51-49 majority. All we need \nis some cooperation. All we need is for people who continue to come day \nafter day after day with a two-word vocabulary, ``I object,'' to see if \nthey can't add a few words and say ``I accept.''\n  Let's work together. Let's join together to get things done. That is \nall we are asking. We only have a few days left in this session, \nprobably a maximum of 12 or 13 days. I would hope all of us who are \npaid to work here and do the public's business would want to make those \ndays productive on behalf of the country. We live in a great place. We \nshould give thanks every day for this opportunity. Let's find a way to \naddress these issues, invest in this country's priorities, pass an \nenergy bill that we can be proud of that makes us less dependent on \nforeign oil, pass an AMT bill that is going to help avoid increased \ntaxes for a lot of Americans who do not deserve to have an increased \ntax bill. We can do all of those things if we work together.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in a period of morning business.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, if there is \ndiscussion of AMT today, that my remarks be placed in the Record at \nthat point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/05/senate-section/article/S14766-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14766-S14770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  AMT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased we are finally discussing \nsolutions to the alternative minimum tax problem that is poised to \nswallow 19 million more filers this year. I would have rather gone \nthrough this process several months ago but better late than never.\n  Over the course of the year, I have given many speeches analyzing the \nAMT and describing the problem it poses for middle-class taxpayers in \ngreat detail. On February 12, I gave a speech on the history of the \nAMT. On February 13, I highlighted how the AMT affects individual \nincome tax liabilities. On February 15, I discussed ways to reform the \nAMT and made the case that complete repeal is the best way to deal with \nthe AMT.\n  Incidentally, I made the case that dealing with the alternative \nminimum tax 1 year at a time could be problematic, and current events \nhave proven me right.\n  On March 20, I pointed out the Democrats' budget had no room for AMT \nrelief, not even for 1 year. On March 22, I explained why we need to \nrepeal the AMT. On April 18, I made an appeal for quick action on the \nAMT to help taxpayers making estimated payments who are already paying \nthe price for the lack of action in Congress. On May 14, I explained \nwhy the AMT relief or repeal should not be paid for with a tax increase \nsomeplace else on other people. On May 17, I criticized the conference \nreport on the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution for not realistically \naddressing the alternative minimum tax problem. On that same day, I \ngave another speech exposing how Democratic offsets to the AMT relief \nwould result in massive tax increases on other people.\n  On June 13, I discussed the inadequacy of the lead trial balloons \nHouse Democrats were floating as possible fixes for the AMT. This was \nto mark the occasion of the second quarter estimated tax payments \ncoming due because we had taxpayers who file quarterly already being \nhit by the lack of action on the part of the Congress.\n  On July 24, I introduced legislation to protect taxpayers who should \nhave been making estimated payments for 2007 but weren't because they \ndid not realize Congress was failing to protect them from the AMT. In \nother words, if they didn't have to pay the AMT in 2006, why would they \nthink they had to pay the AMT in 2007? By not doing it, they were \nviolating our tax laws, probably innocently.\n  On September 19, I marked the occasion of the third quarter estimated \ntax payments coming due by again discussing the AMT problem and how \nlittle congressional leadership was doing about it.\n  I just cited 12 speeches delivered on the Senate floor over the past \nyear. That doesn't even include press conferences, Finance Committee \nmeetings, and other events where I have talked about the need for \nrepeal of the AMT or, in the case of a shorter term fix, just making \nsure it was fixed for this 1 year and kicking the can down the road. I \nhave been talking about the alternative minimum tax literally all year \nnow. House Democrats finally managed to introduce a bill on October 30, \nand the majority leader turned to it in the Senate right before the \nThanksgiving recess. Democratic leadership cannot blame Republicans for \ntheir own failure to act until almost literally the last minute.\n  As I said, I am glad we are finally discussing solutions, and the \nSenate leadership seems to realize that the AMT should not be offset. I \nalso want to thank my good friend, Chairman Baucus, for all his hard \nwork this year,\n\n[[Page S14767]]\n\nand for several years, to protect middle-income taxpayers from the \nalternative minimum tax. Chairman Baucus is doing our country a great \nservice now by trying to work out a compromise between those who want \nto pay for the AMT relief and extenders with a tax increase and those \nwho are opposed to tax increases to offset AMT. He has consistently, \nmeaning chairman Baucus, avoided bitter partisanship and always worked \nto do the right thing.\n  Those obsessed with pay-go--and for the public watching, that is pay \nas you go--those who are obsessed with pay-go, who want to raise more \ntaxes to pay for a tax that was never meant to raise revenue, are \npunishing the American taxpayers for their obsession. Unfortunately, \nright now, I cannot support a package with roughly $45 billion of \noffsets in it for the extenders, even though the AMT relief is not \noffset.\n  I am still reviewing some of the revenue raisers, but my issue is not \nwith the raisers themselves. I will only support a raiser if I think it \nis good policy and will not support a raiser simply for the revenues.\n  I am concerned then if we send this package to the House, they will \ntry to use the offsets not for what we put them in for, for the \nextenders, but send it back to us as offsets against the AMT, \nincreasing taxes on others to pay for a tax that was never meant to be \ncollected, and then still not get the extenders passed, as we should be \npassing them right now.\n  The House has shown it does not respect the need to get 60 votes in \nthe Senate, and I do not expect that to change right now. If the \nmajority leader is serious about reaching a compromise, and really \nrespects the minority, as he claims, he needs to get his colleagues in \nthe House on board. I have been around long enough not to make it too \neasy to stab me in the back by having things that even leadership in \nthe House has suggested could happen with this tax ping-pong operation \nthat might go on here.\n  It is unfortunate congressional leadership took so long to deal with \nthe alternative minimum tax and that some are still putting an \nobsession with pay-go and narrow partisan interests over the wellbeing \nof their own constituents. We can talk until we are blue in the face, \nbut the bottom line is we need to change the tax laws with respect to \nthe alternative minimum tax. That law change needs congressional action \nand a Presidential signature, and anything else is just plain talk.\n  I would like to end this part of the remarks I am making today with a \nsuggestion. I hope we get all parties to an agreement by changing the \nlaw on the AMT patch. By all parties, I am referring to House \nDemocrats, House Republicans, Senate Democrats, Senate Republicans, \nand, of course, nothing is going to happen if the President can't sign \nit. Without an agreement, we will not get a law. And without a law \nchange, this is what is going to happen: 23 million families face an \nunexpected tax increase that is going to average about $2,000 per \nfamily. Without a law change, we make worse the filing season fiasco \nfor yet another 27 million families and individual taxpayers. That is \non top of the 23 million who, for the first time, are being hit by the \nalternative minimum tax.\n  So here is my suggestion. It is simple. It is black and white. It is \nin a letter from Chairman Rangel and Chairman Baucus and ranking \nRepublicans McCrery in the House and myself for the Republicans in the \nSenate Finance Committee. We are the senior tax-writing committee \nmembers from the Congress. That letter was dated October 31 this year \nassuring Treasury Secretary Paulson and Acting IRS Commissioner Stiff \nthat we would work to pass an AMT patch bill expeditiously. That letter \ncontains the test that ought to be applied to any proposal in substance \nand process on an AMT patch.\n  Let me remind you, this is a bipartisan letter by the most senior \ntax-writing Members of the Congress. And it starts with ``we,'' meaning \nChairman Rangel, Chairman Baucus, and ranking Republican members, \nMcCrery and Grassley. Here is what that sentence says:\n\n       We plan to do everything possible to enact AMT relief \n     legislation in a form mutually agreeable to the Congress and \n     the President before the end of the year.\n\n  That is the end of the quote, but I want to put emphasis within that \nquote on these words: Passing legislation in a form mutually agreeable \nto the Congress and to the President before the end of the year, \nmeaning the end of 2007. Chairmen Rangel and Baucus and their ranking \nmembers made it clear in this letter.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the letter I have been \nreferring to be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Tax Writers Notify IRS of Upcoming AMT Fix\n\n\n  Finance Ways and Means leaders intend to prevent tax from affecting \n more Americans, urge IRS to begin planning now for accurate tax forms\n\n       Washington, DC.--Leaders of the congressional tax writing \n     committees notified the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) today \n     of imminent changes to the alternative minimum tax, and \n     encouraged the agency to plan now to produce accurate tax \n     forms for the 2007 filing season. Senate Finance Committee \n     Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.), House Ways and Means Chairman \n     Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.), Finance Ranking Republican Chuck \n     Grassley (R-Iowa), and Ways and Means Ranking Republican \n     Member Jim McCrery (R-La.) sent a letter to Acting IRS \n     Commissioner Linda Stiff, indicating their intention to \n     complete legislation preventing the AMT from affecting any \n     additional American taxpayers for 2007. The AMT was \n     originally meant to ensure that wealthy Americans paid some \n     income tax, but without indexing for inflation it has begun \n     to affect middle-income American taxpayers.\n\n  The text of the Tuesday letter follows here.\n\n                                                 October 30, 2007.\n     Ms. Linda E. Stiff,\n     Acting Commissioner, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Acting Commissioner Stiff: Under present law, more \n     than 23 million taxpayers will be subject to higher taxes in \n     2007 unless legislation is enacted to limit the reach of the \n     Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). We realize that this fact is \n     causing concern for many taxpayers and is creating \n     administrative difficulties for the IRS as the agency \n     prepares for the upcoming filing season.\n       As the leaders of the Congressional tax-writing committees, \n     we want to assure you that legislative relief is forthcoming \n     so that no new taxpayers will be subject to the AMT for \n     taxable year 2007. To accomplish this, we are committed to \n     extending and indexing the 2006 AMT patch with the goal of \n     ensuring that not one additional taxpayer faces higher taxes \n     in 2007 due to the onerous AMT. In addition to allowing the \n     personal credits against the AMT, the exemption amount for \n     2007 will be set at $44,350 for individuals and $66,250 for \n     married taxpayers filing jointly.\n       We plan to do everything possible to enact AMT relief \n     legislation in a form mutually agreeable to the Congress and \n     the President before the end of the year. We urge the \n     Internal Revenue Service to take all steps necessary to plan \n     for changes that would be made by the legislation.\n       Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Max Baucus,\n       Chairman, Committee on Finance.\n     Charles E. Grassley,\n       Ranking Member, Committee on Finance.\n     Charles B. Rangel,\n       Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means.\n     Jim McCrery,\n       Ranking Member, Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Now, our leaders in both the House and the Senate need \nto back up the tax writers. We Senators need to pass a package that is \nagreeable to the President and to the House. What do we all agree on? \nWe agree the patch needs to get done right now. So that is the base of \nwhat should pass the Senate, if we are to get a law enacted. House and \nSenate Democrats insist on offsets for a patch.\n  The old joke is that you better make certain the light at the end of \nthe tunnel isn't a train coming toward you. Unfortunately, the joke is \non the American people when it comes to the upcoming tax-filing season. \nBecause of the failure of the Congress to act, the taxpayers are going \nto feel as if they have been hit by a freight train come April 15. The \nsad part is this was not necessary. Congress could have done the right \nthing. Congress could have acted. We have never in this century gone \nthis late without passing the AMT patch and having it in place. The IRS \nand the Treasury have made it clear that the failure to act would cause \nvery real problems in the filing season, in terms of confusion and in \nterms, especially, of a delay in providing taxpayers their refunds.\n\n[[Page S14768]]\n\n  I am astonished when I hear that some in the Democratic leadership \nare telling reporters these claims of a filing fiasco are all somehow a \nbluff. The Democratic leadership certainly didn't think the problems of \nthe filing season were a bluff when we were delayed in passing an \nextenders package last year. That is when the Republicans were in \ncontrol. I strongly advocated then that we needed to pass the extenders \npackage and warned of its negative impact on the filing season, and I \nwas not listened to by my Republican leadership. But Democrats, now in \nthe majority but back then in the minority, joined me in those \nstatements. Now the clamor is much smaller with the alternative minimum \ntax which will affect 25 million taxpayers and will be, in many ways, \nsignificantly more disruptive to the filing season than the extenders \ndelay last year.\n  As you can see from a chart I have here--I am going to ask my staff \nto hold that chart up. We all know the story of Chicken Little. But \nevery once in a while, Chicken Little is right. When it comes to the \nfiling season, the sky is falling.\n  It is important that my colleagues understand that by failing before \nThanksgiving, we have already gummed up the works. As my colleagues can \nsee from this next chart, the deadline of October 15 for finalizing \nforms and instructions has already passed. We have passed the November \n7 deadline for printing the tax forms--as you can also see in the \nchart--and the absolute drop dead date for printing was November 16.\n  Every week that we don't act, this problem will get worse and worse.\n  I should make it clear that we are not only hearing from the IRS that \nthe delays have created a filing fiasco; the tax preparer community is \nmaking it clear that the problems are real and they are big.\n  We recently received a letter from the independent IRS Oversight \nBoard that voiced ``grave concerns about the serious risks to the 2008 \nfiling season if legislation to change the AMT is delayed.''\n  The IRS Oversight Board makes it clear that there is a big, big \ndifference from Congress passing AMT relief this week as opposed to the \nthird week of December. The board specifically says that another 2 or 3 \nweek delay by Congress could mean that another 31 million taxpayers \nwill face a delay in filing returns and that another approximately $70 \nbillion in refunds could be delayed.\n  These numbers would be on top of the 6.7 million taxpayers who \nalready face a delay in filing returns and the $17 billion in refunds \nthat are going to be delayed because we have not acted to pass the AMT \n``patch.''\n  So if we continue to dilly-dally and delay on AMT relief until \nChristmas, it will be a total of 37.7 million return filings delayed \nand $86.9 billion in refunds delayed. These delayed refunds are not \njust paper; they represent real money that many working families are \ncounting on to help them to pay the bills, make an important purchase \nor even have an important medical procedure done.\n  To be blunt, we are already in the soup and it is a question of how \nbad it is going to get.\n  I recently joined the ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee \nin writing to Ms. Stiff, the Acting Commissioner of the Internal \nRevenue Service, asking that the IRS do the following:\n  No. 1, take steps to educate taxpayers about the possible changes in \nthe law and tax forms;\n  No. 2, work closely with the tax preparation community to keep them \naware of the IRS to update programming and minimize delays and to \nencourage the tax preparation community to inform their clients and \nconsumers about likely delays in processing returns and distributing \nrefunds;\n  No. 3, ensure that all IRS call center employees are fully informed \nabout the status of the tax filing season and can provide accurate and \ntimely information to callers;\n  No. 4, within available resources, increase staffing of IRS call \ncenters to accommodate the increased call volume that will likely \nresult from taxpayer confusion.\n  I think these steps will allow us to do the best we can with a very \nbad hand. But there should be no doubt, the real answer is to pass AMT \nrelief and pass it now.\n  For many years now, and certainly many times this year, I have tried \nto shed light on the monstrosity that is the alternative minimum tax \nand how the failure to index the AMT for inflation threatens middle-\nclass taxpayers. While I have consistently fought for full repeal of \nthe alternative minimum tax, I have had to be content with enacting a \nseries of provisions, since 2001, to increase the exemption amounts \npertaining to the AMT to prevent new taxpayers from being caught by it. \nHowever, similar action has not yet been taken for tax year 2007. \nDespite plenty of advanced warning, congressional leadership's failure \nto act means that time for proactive action has already passed.\n  The IRS is printing tax forms and making other arrangements to \nprocess tax returns submitted for the upcoming filing season. Any \nlegislative fix undertaken now to check the advance of the AMT will not \neliminate a problem, but will only manage it. Despite being deeply \ndisappointed that congressional leadership has not seen fit to act \nfaster, I was hopeful that the magnitude of around 19 million \nadditional tax filers paying the AMT for tax year 2007 was finally \nbeginning to hit home. The AMT finally seemed to be getting the \nattention it deserved, but recent rhetoric has again put me into a \nnegative frame of mind.\n  Rather than offer new ideas and insights into how to solve the AMT \nproblem, which in the case of many would be to offer any ideas at all, \nsome of my colleagues are merely recycling the same old and tired \ntalking points of years past. More specifically, I'm referring to the \naccusation, made by left-leaning think tanks and also by the House \nCommittee on Ways and Means majority, that advocates of tax relief in \n2001 and 2003 deliberately--I want to emphasize they are accusing use \nof deliberately using the AMT as a trick to minimize the revenue cost \nto the Federal treasury as a result of those policies. While it is true \nthat some families benefit less from 2001 and 2003 tax relief than they \notherwise would have, to say this is by design, as is indeed done in a \nCommittee on Ways and Means press release issued on November 14, is \nabsolutely ridiculous.\n  Republicans have consistently fought, even before the 2001 tax relief \nbill, to curtail and eradicate the alternative minimum tax. In 1999, \ncongressional Republicans passed the Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act of \n1999, which completely repealed the AMT, and this bill was vetoed by \nPresident Clinton.\n  Getting back to the Ways and Means press release of November 14, in \nit I myself am cited as critiquing President Bush for not doing more in \nhis 2001 and 2003 tax packages to counteract AMT effects. I do \nabsolutely want to make clear that despite my belief that the AMT was \nalso a pressing problem at that time, I wholeheartedly supported tax \nrelief in 2001 and 2003 and still think it was absolutely the right \nthing to do. In fact, I think the provisions in both bills should be \nmade permanent.\n  In order to counteract the effect of the AMT, Congress passed and \nPresident Bush signed into law a series of provisions to increase AMT \nexemption amounts to keep inflation from pushing new tax filers into \nthe clutches of the AMT. If Ways and Means Democrats were serious in \ntheir implied concern for the effectiveness of 2001 and 2003 tax \nrelief, they could do two very simple things: First, House Democrats \ncould make 2001 and 2003 tax relief permanent; second, they could fully \nrepeal the AMT. Of course they have shown no sign of doing either of \nthese two things. In fact, opposition to the 2003 tax relief package \nwas so intense among Democrats that the Vice President was called upon \nto break a tie during a vote in the Senate.\n  The provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax relief bills were not made \npermanent because doing so might have made it impossible for the bills \nto overcome Democratic opposition. I believe that including AMT repeal \nin those bills would have had the same effect.\n  Aside from being quoted in the November 14 Ways and Means press \nrelease, I found it unintentionally humorous in that it reveals that \nHouse Democrats are doing exactly what they accuse Republicans of \nhaving done since 2001. While they accuse Republicans of using the AMT \nas a budgeting\n\n[[Page S14769]]\n\ngimmick, they are using the AMT as a gimmick to make it appear they are \neasing the tax burden when they are not.\n  In the release, Ways and Means Chairman Rangel is quoted saying ``The \nhouse passed a bill to prevent the AMT from hitting 23 million families \nthis year without hurting the economy by adding to the national debt.''\n  What this means is that the House is protecting some people from the \nAMT by subjecting other filers to additional taxes. This is the same as \nif your community's animal control officer caught a rabid dog on your \nstreet and let it go someplace else across town. Your problem appears \nto have been immediately solved, but in the longer-term, the \nfundamental problem still exists. The fundamental problem with the AMT \nis the massive amount of unintended revenue it is forecast to collect, \nand the unwillingness of many of my colleagues to forego that revenue.\n  If Ways and Means Democrats are serious in their appeal to the \nadministration regarding the AMT to ``work with Congress to do the \nright thing and kill it,'' they will abandon any notion that revenues \nnot collected because of AMT relief or repeal ought to be offset.\n  Finally, I want to address the baseless claim that the Bush \nadministration's tax priorities were responsible for the AMT problem on \na technical level.\n  This exact point was raised in 2005 by Democratic Ways and Means \nstaffers in a letter to ``Tax Note,'' a prominent publication for tax \nprofessionals. At the time I requested that the nonpartisan Joint \nCommittee on Taxation look into this matter. Their analysis showed \nthat, as I have long maintained, the biggest problem with the \nalternative minimum tax was it was never indexed for inflation.\n  In response, I received from the Joint Committee on Taxation a letter \ndated October 3, 2005. I have requested an update of that document and \nwill discuss the updated numbers as soon as they are available. That \nestimate could be interpreted to indicate that if the Bush tax cuts \nwere repealed, alternative minimum tax revenues could be expected to \ndrop by $302 billion, or 27 percent.\n  At the time, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimate also found that \nextending and indexing the hold-harmless provision in effect at the \ntime would reduce alternative minimum tax revenues by around $667 \nbillion, or 59 percent. Of course, the analysis of this question is \ncomplicated by the fact that the variables we are examining overlap and \ninteract with each other. But responsible analysis of available \ninformation certainly does not support the allegation that the tax \nrelief packages signed by the President in 2001 and 2003 are \nresponsible for the explosion of the alternative minimum tax. If \nanything, House Democrats and their pet think tanks have illustrated \nthe fallacy of using projected revenue reductions as a proxy for \npercentage causation.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the October 2005 Joint \nCommittee on Taxation revenue estimate I referred to be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                  Joint Committee on Taxation,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, Oct. 3, 2005.\n\n\n                               memorandum\n\n     To: Mark Prater and Christy Mistr\n     From: George Yin\n     Subject: AMT Effects\n       This memorandum responds to your request of September 29, \n     2005, for an analysis of the portion of the AMT effect (AMT \n     liability plus credits lost due to the AMT) which can be \n     attributed to the failure to adjust the AMT exemption amount \n     to inflation, assuming alternatively that the EGTRRA and \n     JGTRRA tax cuts (``tax cuts'') are either permanently \n     extended or repealed. We also explain how this information \n     compares to information previously provided to you on August \n     31, 2005 and September 16, 2005.\n       For the purposes of this analysis, we have first assumed \n     that the tax cuts are repealed. The first set of figures in \n     Table 1 compares the AMT effect under this assumption if, \n     alternatively, (1) the AMT exemption amount hold-harmless \n     provision is not extended beyond 2005; (2) such provision is \n     extended permanently; and (3) such provision is extended \n     permanently and indexed after 2005. The second set of figures \n     presents the same comparison under the assumption that the \n     tax cuts are permanently extended. All of the information \n     provided in this table was previously provided to you in our \n     September 16, 2005 memo, except in a different format.\n\n                                 TABLE 1\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                             AMT effect\n                           Item                             (billions of\n                                                              dollars)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTax Cuts Repealed:\n    (1) Hold-harmless provision not extended..............         399.9\n    (2) Hold-harmless provision extended permanently......         212.0\n    (3) Percentage of AMT effect attributable to failure             47%\n     to extend hold-harmless provision (((1)-(2))/(1))....\n    (4) Hold-harmless provision extended permanently and           169.7\n     indexed..............................................\n    (5) Percentage of AMT effect attributable to failure             58%\n     to extend and index hold-harmless provision (((1)-\n     (4))/(1))............................................\nTax Cuts Extended Permanently:\n    (6) Hold-harmless provision not extended..............       1,139.1\n    (7) Hold-harmless provision extended permanently......         628.5\n    (8) Percentage of AMT effect attributable to failure             45%\n     to extend hold-harmless provision (((6)-(7))/(6))....\n    (9) Hold-harmless provision extended permanently and           472.0\n     indexed..............................................\n    (10) Percentage of AMT effect attributable to failure            59%\n     to extend and index hold-harmless provision (((6)-\n     (9))/(6))............................................\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       In the information provided to you on August 31, 2005 and \n     September 16, 2005, we analyzed the portion of the AMT effect \n     attributable to the tax cuts. In the analysis described \n     above, we identify the portion of the AMT effect attributable \n     to failure to adjust the AMT exemption amount to inflation. \n     There is, however, interaction between these two contributing \n     factors to the AMT effect. In order to avoid double counting \n     of interactions, a stacking order is imposed. The \n     apportionment of effects to each contributing factor will \n     vary depending on the stacking order, even though the total \n     effect remains constant.\n       This phenomenon is illustrated by Tables 2 and 3 below. The \n     first two columns of Table 2 show the portion of the AMT \n     effect attributed to the tax cuts, consistent with the \n     information provided on August 31, 2005 and September 16, \n     2005. The second two columns of Table 2 show the portion of \n     the AMT effect attributable to the failure to extend and \n     index the hold-harmless provision, consistent with the \n     information provided in Table 1 above. Note that if these two \n     contributing factors were completely independent of one \n     another, the information in Table 2 would suggest that the \n     two factors together contribute to more than 100 percent of \n     the AMT effect. In fact, as shown in Table 3, the two factors \n     together contribute to only 85 percent of the AMT effect. \n     Thus, there is substantial overlap between these two factors.\n\n                                                                         TABLE 2\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                         AMT effect                                                                          AMT effect\n                         Item                           (billions of                                  Item                                  (billions of\n                                                          dollars)                                                                            dollars)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBaseline..............................................       1,139.1                                                              Baseline       1,139.1\nRepeal tax cuts.......................................         399.9                          Extend and index AMT hold-harmless provision         472.0\n                                                       --------------                                                                      -------------\nDifference............................................         739.2                                                            Difference         667.1\nPercentage of baseline................................           65%                                                Percentage of baseline           59%\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                                 TABLE 3\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                             AMT effect\n                           Item                             (billions of\n                                                              dollars)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBaseline..................................................       1,139.1\nRepeal tax cuts and extend and index AMT hold-harmless             169.7\n provision................................................\n                                                           -------------\nDifference................................................         969.4\nPercentage of baseline....................................           85%\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, as I said, I will discuss those \nupdated numbers when they are given to me by JCT.\n  I mentioned earlier that the argument that our recent tax policies \nare responsible for the wild growth in the alternative minimum tax is \nan old and a very tired argument, intellectually dishonest. The Ways \nand Means press release of November 14, 2007 refers to a letter of \nMarch 6, 2001, sent by Mr. Rangel to President Bush.\n  I just talked about a Democratic staffer making the same point in Tax \nNotes in 2005. I am not bothered by these arguments in and of \nthemselves. They are based upon poor analysis, if that, and it is easy \nfor me to respond to them. What does bother me, however, is that \nclearly many people are more interested in trying to make cheap \npolitical points than actually dealing with the alternative minimum\n\n[[Page S14770]]\n\ntax. If House Democrats were concerned about the tax burden, they would \nrepeal the alternative minimum tax without raising taxes on other \ntaxpayers to replace revenue that was never supposed to come into the \nFederal Treasury, because these 23 million middle-income taxpayers were \nnever supposed to be hit by the alternative minimum tax, because it was \nonly meant to be paid by the superrich.\n  I have made the point many times, that this alternative minimum tax \nwas never meant as a revenue source, and I do not care if I made it \ntwice in a row, three times in a row, it is a fact of life: These 23 \nmillion people were never meant to pay it. The alternative minimum tax \nis only supposed to hit the superrich--it was an unsuccessful attempt--\nwhen the alternative minimum tax was passed in 1969, to promote tax \nfairness. This point has not been challenged.\n  Rather, my friends in the House and elsewhere have distorted that \nargument into a claim that Republicans intended to use the alternative \nminimum tax to secretly diminish the impact of the 2001 and 2003 tax \nrelief packages. I have shown how that argument is flawed every time it \nis dug out of the closet by someone. The alternative minimum tax \ncertainly is not a secret. But it is a mystery how so many people can \nengage in so much pointless discussion when what we need now right now, \nactually several months late, is urgent action.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill.) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I come to the floor to plead with my \ncolleagues that we move forward to address the issues of agriculture \nand rural communities and food security for our country in moving \nforward with consideration and passage of the 2007 farm bill. In this \nChamber, there needs to be more champions of rural America and \nagriculture. Those farmers and ranchers around our Nation who today are \nthe ones working to provide food for the tables of all of America, \nthose farmers and ranchers, when you meet them--because when you shake \ntheir hand in communities in my State, places such as Lamar or Craig or \ndown in Dove Creek, in my home area of the San Luis Valley, Manassa, it \nis a rough hand. It is a rough hand that is weathered through the \ndifficult times of having had to eke out a living from the soil and \nwhat oftentimes is a very difficult time.\n  Rural America, in my opinion, is part of the forgotten America. Rural \nAmerica has been forgotten by Washington, DC for far too long. Rural \nAmerica has been forgotten by this President and this administration \nfor far too long. Now we have an opportunity with legislation crafted \nin the spirit of bipartisanship, through the leadership of Senators \nHarkin and Chambliss and a number of other members of the Agriculture \nCommittee and the Finance Committee, under the leadership of Senators \nBaucus and Grassley, to make sure that rural America is not forgotten. \nWe have an opportunity to open a new chapter of opportunity for rural \nAmerica. We can do this with the 2007 farm bill.\n  Rural America is in trouble. When you look at this map of the United \nStates, when you look at both the red and yellow zones, they are all \npart of what we consider to be rural America. There are about 1,700 \ncounties in what is characterized as rural America in this great land \nof ours, the United States. More than half of those counties have been \ndeclining in population. Across the heartland of the United States, you \nsee great swathes of red where we see towns and communities that are \nwithering on the vine. This 2007 farm bill will help revitalize rural \nAmerica in a way that has not happened before.\n  When we look at the towns and counties across each one of the 50 \nStates, I am sure any one of us could find many places such as this \nstorefront in Brush, CO where half of the main street in many of the \ntowns has essentially been closed down. This is the main street of \nBrush. There is a for sale sign on this building. When you go to the \ntowns in my native valley, in Conejos County, Costilla County, I can \ntell you that in the town of Antonito, CO, at one point in time, 15 \nyears ago, there were four or five gas stations on the main street. \nToday there is one gas station. I remember a few years ago there were \nmultiple grocery stores. Today there is one small grocery store. I \nhaven't done the count when I have gone through the main street of \nAntonito, as I often do back in the San Luis Valley, but I would guess \nthat 60 to 70 percent of the entire main street of the town has been \nboarded up and is either not being used or is for sale.\n  The town of Antonito, like the town of Brush, like so many towns and \ncommunities across rural America, is calling out for Congress to do \nsomething to help revitalize rural America. We, in the 2007 farm bill \nthat has been crafted in the best spirit of bipartisanship, are \nattempting to do so. It will be a shame for Washington, DC and for this \nChamber to allow the politics of obstructionism we see going on here to \nessentially kill the promise of rural America represented in the 2007 \nfarm bill.\n  Over the last several days and over the last month, we have seen many \nefforts to try to move forward to a conclusion. Yet we haven't been \nable to move forward because there is a filibuster in place. I have \nheard the majority leader come to the floor and say: Let's move forward \nand consider the farm bill. We will make an agreement where we will \nallow 10 Republican amendments and 5 Democratic amendments and 2 other \namendments, a total of 17 amendments. What has happened when he has \npropounded that unanimous consent request? It has been objected to. He \nhas said, as Senator Harkin has suggested, let's take 10 amendments on \neither side or 12 amendments on either side. Let's come up with an \nagreement that puts us on the pathway of making the farm bill even \nbetter through the amendment process but getting the farm bill passed.\n  Yet what is happening in our inability to move forward? There are \nobjections on the other side because there is a paradigm that has \nbecome evident in this place. And that is to try to slow walk any kind \nof progress we might be able to make on this legislation, on AMT, on \nthe Energy bill, or anything else.\n  We hopefully will find the courage in this Chamber to make sure that \nthe public purposes for which we were elected will ultimately triumph \nover the politics of division which we see taking place. Doing nothing \nis not an option. Obstructionism essentially is leading to that result \nof doing nothing.\n\n  The farmers and ranchers of America don't see this as a Democratic \nand Republican issue. They want results. They want us to work together \nto try to get results and to pass this 2007 farm bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to redouble their efforts to try to find \nagreement so we can move forward, so we can have a farm bill that is \ngood for America.\n  As we talk about the farm bill, it is also important, as my good \nfriend from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, has said, to understand that \nthis is much more than just about conservation and energy and rural \ndevelopment, the things I care so much about. It is also about another \nthing all of us care a lot about, and that is the nutrition of those \nwho are most vulnerable in society. That is why in this farm bill about \n67 percent of all the money that goes into this farm bill actually goes \ninto nutrition programs for America. Yes, newspapers across the country \nthat sometimes are critical of the commodity parts of the farm bill are \nwrong, because they don't focus on the other parts of the legislation. \nThey don't talk about what we do for nutrition in this farm bill. They \ndon't talk about what we are trying to do with the fresh fruits and \nvegetables program\n\n[[Page S14771]]\n\nincluded in this bill at a level which has never been done before.\n  For my small State of Colorado, what it basically means is there is \ngoing to be $45 million available to provide fresh fruits and \nvegetables to those young kids in our schools so they can grow up \nhealthy and learn in the schools they currently attend. What we are \ndoing is, we are spreading what has been a pilot program for fresh \nfruits and vegetables across the entire 50 States. That is a good \nprogram. We should remind Americans that when we talk about the farm \nbill, we are talking about nutrition.\n  I also want to talk a bit about one aspect of this farm bill and that \nis title 9, the energy part. When I look at what is happening across \nAmerica today, I think that the energy opportunity for America presents \none of the signature opportunities for this Nation and for this world \nin the 21st century. There is no doubt that we have come to realize, \nprogressives and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans, that the \naddiction we have to foreign oil is something that must end. It is in \nthe fields of rural America that we will find a significant part of the \nanswer to get rid of our dependence on foreign oil. That conclusion is \none that will sustain a clean energy revolution in our country for not \nonly years but for decades to come. We will find ways of harnessing the \npower of the Sun, the power of the wind, the power of biofuels, the \npower of geothermal capacities to get us to the point of energy \nindependence.\n  When I think about the fact that Brazil, a Third World country in \nSouth America, could become an energy-independent country and we here, \nthe most powerful Nation on the globe, have not been able to do that, \nwe have gone in reverse, we have had a failed energy policy. When we \nhave gone from a point in time in the 1970s when Richard Nixon, then \nPresident, coined the term ``energy independence'' and President Jimmy \nCarter stood before the Nation and said we had to attack our energy \naddiction with the moral imperative of war, at that point we were \nimporting 30 percent of the oil from foreign countries. Today, in March \nof this year, we imported 67 percent of our oil from foreign countries. \nSo we need to become energy independent and, yes, this farm bill in \ntitle 9 invests significant resources in rural America that will help \nus become energy independent.\n  This picture is a wind farm in Prowers County, CO. We invest \nsignificant resources in wind power in my State, not only for these \nlarger wind farms which can produce several hundred megawatts of power \nbut also for small farms and industrial areas where you see these small \nwindmills that can actually produce enough electric generation to meet \nall the needs of a farm or a small business area or to help make sure \nwe are providing electricity to places that are remote and far away.\n  When we look at this 2007 farm bill, one of the marquis aspects of \nthis bill is that it helps create a new opportunity for rural America \nand helps us grow our way to energy independence. On that one ground \nalone, we should all be willing to move forward to come up with an \nagreement that will allow us to move this farm bill forward.\n  Two years ago, when I went back to Colorado, shortly after having \nbeen elected to the Senate, I asked people to try to find a place where \nI could go and visit an ethanol plant. There were none at that time. \nToday we now have four ethanol plants like the one that is located in \nSterling, CO in this picture. We are just beginning to see the energy \nrevolution that is revitalizing that whole red part of the eastern \nplains of the State of Colorado. This farm bill will help us move \nforward in that continuing positive direction.\n  Another aspect of this bill which is so important, and we must keep \nreminding people, is conservation. When you think about conservation \nand what this farm bill does, this is the most significant investment \never made in conservation in the history of the United States under \nthis farm bill. Through these investments we will be able to help make \nsure the water--which is the lifeblood of our rural communities; which \nis the lifeblood of the Nation; which is the lifeblood, certainly, of \nmy State, which is the mother of rivers in the western part of the \nUnited States of America--that we are able to take advantage of using \nthe water resources of our country in a positive and constructive way.\n\n  Shown in this picture is an EQIP project which is in northern \nColorado, where you can actually see an EQIP project which is \nconserving water in the livestock tanks that have been placed out here \non this ranch.\n  But it goes beyond water tanks and water conservation. There are also \na whole host of other programs that we deal with in conservation. There \nis a Grassland Reserve Program. There is a Conservation Reserve \nProgram. There is a CSP. There is a Wetlands Reserve Program.\n  This picture is taken of a pond which has been restored in the \nnorthern part of my State which is part of the Wetlands Reserve Program \nthat helps us make sure we have quality wetlands.\n  I want to make this quick point about conservation. When you think \nabout the people who care about our land and our water, farmers and \nranchers know about the importance of land and water because they know \nthat is their way of life. If they do not take care of their land and \nwater, they know the next year's crop is not going to be there because \ntheir way of living is taken away from them. So farmers and ranchers \nare among the best environmentalists, among the best conservationists \nwe know.\n  Seventy percent of our lands across this great United States of \nAmerica are owned by farmers and ranchers. So the conservation program \nthat we have in the national farm bill, in this 2007 farm bill, is \nabsolutely essential for us to be able to protect the lands and waters \nof these United States.\n  So I hope all of the conservation organizations that are out there, \nknowing we are working on the farm bill today, and the millions of \nAmericans who care about conservation make sure their Senators know we \nshould move forward on this farm bill in order to achieve the \nconservation objectives of this farm bill. They should let their \nSenators know this gridlock, this obstructionism we see is allowing \npolitics to triumph over the very important public purposes which we \nare trying to achieve in conservation.\n  Let me finally say, there are many other aspects of this farm bill \nwhich are important, including the safety net which takes a small \nportion, about 13 percent or so, of the entire farm bill budget, and \nthat is the support system to make sure we are able to keep farmers and \nranchers on the land.\n  As part of what we have done in trying to be innovative and moving \nforward with programs that will help rural America and will help \nfarmers and ranchers, we, for the first time, under the leadership of \nSenator Baucus and Senator Grassley, have included a fund to be able to \ndeal with the disasters that affect rural America so often.\n  In this picture behind me, you see what has become the norm in my \nState over the last 6 years, where we have seen some of the record \ndroughts in Colorado. In fact, we had the most severe drought in my \nState of Colorado in almost 500 years just a few years ago which \ndevastated agriculture across the State from corner to corner.\n  Shown in this picture is a cornfield in Washington County. Now, some \npeople will see this cornfield, and they will say: It looks like a \nbunch of dead plants. A farmer looks at this cornfield, and a farmer \nsees a dream--a dream that will not be realized.\n  In this picture, a farmer will look at it, and the farmer will \nremember the day when he went out and tilled the soil, when he \nfertilized the soil, when he planted the seed. The farmer will look at \nthis picture, and he will remember the day when he saw the first green \ncome through the soil as these corn seeds became plants.\n  In this picture, he also will see the dream he had at that point, \nwhich was that he would be able to produce enough corn from his farm to \nbe able to make a living, to be able to pay off the operating line at \nthe bank, to be able to make the mortgage payment for the land. The \nfarmer will see a lot in this picture. Yet we have not had a \nresponsible disaster program for agriculture in Washington, DC, for the \nlongest of times. So every time there is a disaster somewhere, we have \nto come multiple times to the Senate, to the Congress, to try to find \ndisaster emergency relief, which takes a lot of time.\n  We have been through that effort dozens of times over the last 20 \nyears. So it is time we fund a permanent disaster fund, which is \nincluded in this\n\n[[Page S14772]]\n\nlegislation, thanks to the leadership of Senator Baucus and Senator \nGrassley and other members of the Finance Committee who have worked on \nthis issue so hard.\n  Let me, in conclusion, say once again, I have come to the floor to \nspeak about the farm bill because it is something we can easily do. We \nhave 2\\1/2\\ weeks before Christmas. This is legislation we have worked \non for a very long time. Under the leadership of Senator Chambliss, \nseveral years ago, he held hearings on reforms to the farm bill all \nover this country. Under the leadership of Chairman Harkin, this year, \nthe first hearing on the farm bill was held in my State in Brighton, \nCO, in Adams County, one of the largest agricultural counties in my \nState. The effort has yielded a farm bill which is a good farm bill \nwhich should allow us to move forward to have a final farm bill coming \nout of the Senate.\n  Now we have seen, again, Senator Reid come to this floor, and he has \nsaid to the Republican leadership: We want to move forward on the farm \nbill. Senator Reid has said: We will take 10 Republican amendments to 5 \nDemocratic amendments. Let's have a debate on those. Let's set up some \ntime constraints on that debate, and let's get down to the point where \nwe can have a final vote on this very important bill. Yet the answer \nis: We object--on the other side--to anything happening here on this \nfarm bill.\n  I am hopeful the champions of rural America, the champions of \nagriculture on the Republican side, come over to join us to help us \nmove this farm bill forward.\n  I hope the people of America put pressure on the Members of the \nSenate to move forward to bring us to a conclusion on this 2007 farm \nbill so at the end of the session we can go home for Christmas and we \ncan say we have done something good for the food security of our \nNation.\n  We ought to remember that sign on my desk that says: ``No Farms, No \nFood.'' ``No Farms, No Food.'' Every American eats. This farm bill is \nessential to make sure we maintain the independence and the food \nsecurity we have had with food in America.\n  I am very hopeful we are able to move forward with this farm bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/05/senate-section/article/S14772-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14772-S14773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 PAYING FOR THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport fairness in our Tax Code and fiscal responsibility in our \nbudgets and appropriations.\n  Sometime in the next 2 weeks, the Senate will likely be asked to vote \non legislation to fix the alternative minimum tax--what we call the \nAMT. The issue before us is not whether the AMT ought to be fixed. \nFixing it is the only fair thing to do for America's middle-class \nfamilies. The real issue is whether we are going to fix it in a way \nthat is fiscally responsible, so that we do not leave our children and \nour children's children to foot the bill--yet again--for our spending.\n  After 6 years of runaway deficits and Tax Code revisions that have \ndisproportionately benefited the wealthiest among us, Democrats \ncommitted during the 2006 election that we would reinstitute fiscal \nresponsibility. We pledged to play it straight with taxpayers: we said \nwe will not run up deficits with the cost of new legislation; we will \npay for what we legislate. That pledge applied to program increases, to \nnew programs, and to tax cuts. The Democrats' fiscally responsible, \npay-as-you-go pledge is the only way we have been able to temper \ndeficit spending that has once again become the norm in Washington over \nthe past 7 years.\n  So far we have held firm on the so-called ``pay-go'' commitment. But \nfixing the AMT carries a cost of $51 billion, and pressure is mounting \non the Senate to break that commitment and add to the record $9 \ntrillion national debt that is already threatening future generations. \nIn the name of fairness and fiscal responsibility, the Senate should \nresist that pressure.\n  President Bush has recently used the rhetoric of fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  President Bush said, ``You have to have some fiscal discipline if you \nwant to balance the federal budget.''\n  The distinguished minority leader, Senator McConnell added that it is \ntime ``to get us out of the business of political theater and back to \nthe business of governing in a fiscally responsible way.''\n  I agree with those sentiments even if they are 6 years too late. But \nbeing fiscally responsible as we fix the AMT will require the Senate to \ndo more than talk the talk about fiscal discipline; it will require the \nSenate to walk the walk by paying for any tax reductions, and not \npaying for them by increasing the national debt.\n  Unfortunately, some of our Republican colleagues have a blind spot: \nthey call for fiscal discipline when Congress wants to pay for an \nearmark or a new program, but when tax cuts are on the line, fiscal \ndiscipline is suddenly tossed into the legislative trash can. True \nfiscal discipline means we have to look at the bottom line for \ntaxpayers no matter what kind of legislation we are debating, including \na fix for the AMT.\n  The AMT was intended, when adopted in 1969, to ensure that every \nAmerican with significant income contributes at least some taxes to \nthis great country. It was designed to stop the highest income \ntaxpayers from using tax loopholes to escape contributing one thin dime \nto Uncle Sam, ensuring that they shoulder their fair share of the tax \nburden.\n  The AMT included exemptions to make sure that middle class Americans \nwere not forced to pay higher AMT taxes instead of their normal tax \nburden. But in recent years the AMT has gone wrong. The problem is that \nthe AMT's exemptions protecting the middle class have not been adjusted \nfor inflation, and the AMT is now loading additional taxes onto the \nbacks of working families who already pay their fair share.\n  In 2006, 4 million taxpayers had to pay higher taxes due to the AMT. \nIn 2007, with no fix, 23 million Americans will have their taxes \nincreased because of the AMT. That includes 830,000 taxpayers in \nMichigan, which is 18 percent of all the taxpayers in the State. Only a \nfew of these Michigan taxpayers are upper income, and most are not \ntaking advantage of unfair tax loopholes. But if they are caught by the \nAMT, all 830,000 Michiganders could be hammered with hundreds or even \nthousands of dollars in additional taxes.\n  There is a consensus in Washington that the AMT exemptions ought to \nbe expanded so that the AMT impacts only upper income Americans, and \nnot middle class Americans already working hard just to get by. The \nonly issue is whether we are going to pay for it.\n  Protecting the middle class from AMT taxes in 2007 will cost the \nTreasury about $51 billion over 10 years. Faced with this cost, the \nHouse has taken the fiscally responsible course of action. It has sent \nus a bill, H.R. 3996, which would protect the middle class from the AMT \nsledgehammer in a way that is revenue neutral and does not add to our \nnational debt.\n  The House bill includes three fiscally responsible provisions that \nwould raise $52 billion to pay for the AMT fix. These measures would \nensure fairness in the taxes levied on stock profits and in the taxes \npaid by hedge fund managers. Each provision represents an important tax \nreform in its own right that merits our support as a matter of tax \nfairness.\n  The first of the House measures would require stock brokers to start \nreporting the cost basis of the securities they sell for their clients \non the 1099 forms that brokers already send to those clients and to the \nInternal Revenue Service, IRS. Reporting the cost basis on these forms \nis a simple way to help ensure that the stock owners accurately report \nto the IRS any profits earned from the sales of the stock, and it \nenjoys broad, bipartisan support. It is expected to generate about $3.4 \nbillion in added tax revenues over the next 10 years.\n\n  The next two House provisions would affect the income taxes paid by \nhedge fund managers, a small group of investment advisers who are among \nthe wealthiest in America today.\n  Hedge funds are private investment funds accessible only to wealthy \nindividuals and large institutional investors. The experts who decide \nhow to invest these dollars are typically called hedge fund managers. \nIn 2006, there were about 2,500 hedge funds registered with the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, SEC. Hedge funds take money only \nfrom sophisticated investors such\n\n[[Page S14773]]\n\nas pension funds, university endowments, and individuals who have at \nleast $5 million in investments. By taking investment dollars only from \nsophisticated investors, hedge funds can avoid complying with SEC \nregulations that apply to mutual funds and other investment funds \navailable to the general public.\n  Last year, press reports indicate that the top U.S. hedge fund \nmanager made $1.7 billion in compensation. That's billion. The average \ncompensation for the top 25 hedge fund managers was around $570 \nmillion. Each. Think about that. For comparison, the 2006 median income \nfor U.S. households was less than $49,000, which is less than one ten \nthousandth of the income collected by those top hedge fund managers.\n  Hedge fund managers make their money by charging their clients a \nmanagement fee equal to 2 percent of the funds provided to the hedge \nfund for investment and, in addition, by taking 20 percent of the \nprofits earned from those investments. The 20 percent share of the \ninvestment returns from hedge funds is known as ``carried interest.'' \nUnder current law, most hedge fund managers claim that this carried \ninterest qualifies as capital gains subject to a maximum tax rate of 15 \npercent, rather than as ordinary income subject to a maximum tax rate \nof 35 percent.\n  When hedge fund managers take 20 percent of their clients' investment \nreturns, they are being compensated for managing those client funds; \nthey are not collecting profits from investing their own money. \nCharacterizing this compensation as capital gains is a tax dodge that \nhas been allowed to go on for too long. This tax loophole allows hedge \nfund managers to pay a 15-percent capital gains rate on millions--or \neven billions--of dollars in income. Meanwhile, a receptionist in the \nsame office receiving a $50,000 salary pays at a regular tax rate. \nMaking a salaried worker pay a higher tax rate than the managers who \nare making hundreds of millions of dollars is a tax travesty, and it \nhas got to stop.\n  The House bill would restore fairness by putting an end to this tax \nloophole. The second provision of the House bill would make it clear \nthat the 20 percent carried interest is, in fact, taxable as ordinary \nincome, making hedge fund managers pay the same income tax rates as \nordinary Americans. If enacted, it would raise about $25.6 billion over \n10 years, half the cost of fixing the AMT.\n  The third provision in the House bill would address a smaller group \nof hedge fund managers--those routing their compensation through \noffshore corporations located in tax havens.\n  The hedge fund managers participating in this tax dodge typically \ndon't live or work in the tax haven where the offshore corporation is \nincorporated. The offshore corporation often doesn't have any physical \npresence in the tax haven either--it functions as a shell company with \nno full-time employees or physical office. The whole arrangement is a \nphony setup to enable the hedge fund manager to appear to get paid \noutside the United States, direct the offshore corporation to place the \ncompensation in an offshore retirement plan, and defer payment of any \nU.S. taxes on that compensation until sometime in the future. In the \nmeantime, the offshore corporation can invest the funds tax free and \naccumulate investment returns for the hedge fund manager. The result of \nall this tricky maneuvering is that hedge fund managers are able to \ndefer U.S. income taxes and circumvent parts of the U.S. Tax Code that \nlimit tax free contributions to retirement plans. Some are able to \ndefer paying taxes on hundreds of millions of dollars of annual income.\n  The House bill would put an end to this offshore tax dodge by \nrequiring hedge fund managers to pay taxes on any earnings from their \ndeferred offshore compensation, as those earnings accrue. The tax-free \nride would be over. If enacted, this provision would raise $23.8 \nbillion over 10 years.\n  Requiring accurate reporting of stock profits, applying the same tax \nrates to carried interest as to the income of ordinary Americans, and \ntaxing deferred offshore investment income are provisions that promote \ntax fairness and make a lot of sense. Together, these three House \nprovisions would raise more than $52 billion over 10 years, enough to \npay for the entire $51 billion AMT fix so that we can protect middle \nclass Americans from the AMT sledgehammer without running up the \nnational debt.\n  So why is the Senate hesitating to enact the House bill?\n  Some claim that forcing hedge fund managers to pay their fair share \nof taxes would somehow put an end to the capitalist spirit in America. \nWhatever the merits of the argument for lower taxes on capital gains, \nthose arguments certainly do not make any sense when applied to income \nearned for servicing and managing other peoples' capital. Surely the \nperson who earned $1.7 billion would have had that same capitalist \nspirit and zeal for investing whether his take home pay was $1.7 \nbillion or $1.1 billion.\n  Some of my colleagues argue that the Senate just should add the $51 \nbillion cost of the AMT fix to the deficit and leave it at that. But \nwhen some taxpayers are given a free ride, the rest will inevitably be \nasked to make up the difference, whether it is through increased debt \nor higher taxes down the road. We all know that there is no free lunch, \nand there is no free tax cut, and history shows that when upper income \ngroups avoid paying taxes, the middle income groups end up footing the \ntax bill. Unfortunately, some continue to grasp onto the fiscally \nirresponsible attitude that, in just the last 7 years, has added $3.5 \ntrillion to the $9 trillion debt ditch already threatening the economic \nwell-being of the next generation. And they would dig that debt ditch \ndeeper--instead of paying for the AMT tax cut--primarily to protect \nhedge fund managers from paying their fair share of taxes.\n  I don't understand how some can claim that the deficit matters when \nthe debate is over $22 billion in appropriations for health, education \nor veterans, but not when the issue is $51 billion in tax benefits for \nthe wealthiest Americans.\n  The bottom line is that the House found the political will to impose \ntax fairness on hedge funds when they passed H.R. 3996. The Senate can \nand should do the same. If we don't--if we give in to the pressure to \nbreak the pay-as-you-go rules that have so far held firm in the \nSenate--it will be that much easier to break the rules again in the \nfuture. Giving up on pay-go would let down American taxpayers who are \ncounting on us to act responsibly and pay for what we legislate.\n  If the Republican filibuster continues and succeeds, and if we cannot \nmuster 60 votes to break it, we would then be forced with the choice of \nraising taxes on 23 million working families or violating our pay-as-\nyou-go rules. I would protect my constituents at the expense of an even \ndeeper national debt. But we don't have to go that way, and we \nshouldn't. With the House bill we can protect our constituents from \nunintended tax increases, we can ensure fairness in the tax code, and \nwe can avoid increasing the Federal deficit.\n  I urge my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, to take a look at \nthe tradeoffs presented in the House bill. The House bill will allow us \nto fix the AMT for a year, and at the same time ensure that the \nwealthiest among us contribute their fair share to this great country. \nI urge my colleagues to take seriously Congress's commitment to fiscal \nresponsibility as well as fairness, and to pass H.R. 3996.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the \nmandatory quorum call be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to proceed to calendar No. 487, H.R. \n3996--I am happy to see my friend, the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia on the floor. I believe my friend from Georgia knows how hard I \nhave tried to get some way to proceed forward on this farm bill. We \ndon't have farms in Nevada. We do have some. We have lots of ranches. \nAs I have said on the floor before, the one crop we are very proud of \nis onions. We are the largest white onion producer in the world--in the \nUnited States--I am sorry. And in Lyon County, we produce lots of \nstuff: onions, garlic, and in Mason Valley, lots and lots of alfalfa. \nThe greenbelts of Nevada are shrinking because of the population growth \nwe have. But we still have ranches--ranches that were owned by Bing \nCrosby--I mean that were famous ranches. They still are. But even they \nare being hit by the population growth.\n  We are very proud of our ranching community. There are things in this \nfarm bill that have direct impact on my constituency in the State of \nNevada. That is one reason I have tried everything I know to move to \nthis bill.\n  We have tried moving forward amendment by amendment. The Dorgan \namendment under the bill is still pending. That is a bipartisan \namendment. I have suggested let's have X number of amendments, and \nfinally I got so desperate I said let's have the Republicans have 10 \namendments and we will have 5. Still no takers on that. We heard from \nSenator Harkin today who said: Senator Chambliss and I now have \nthe amendments down to less than 40. I said: Oh, good. Let's enter into \nan agreement that we will have 40 amendments, or whatever it is, and we \nwill proceed to work on those. No time agreements. No deal.\n\n  The only agreement we have had on this bill is we have locked in a \nfinite number of amendments. But it is 287 amendments--287 amendments--\nwith issues that are so pertinent to the farm bill, like immigrants' \ndriver's licenses, just for beginners. There have been some \nsuggestions: Well, why don't you just move to the bill. We are in the \nwaning days of this year, and we have to proceed and complete a number \nof issues. But I was a little bit lax. I said: Well, maybe we are \nworking here, trying to work together on things, and the Amtrak bill \nhasn't been done for 5 or 6 years and people are crying for something \nto be done about this. We have one Republican Senator for years who has \ntried to kill Amtrak. He came very close to it a few times and we \nalways were able to survive. So this year, I said let's move to it. On \na bipartisan basis we had people who wanted to do that bill. We opened \nit up. What is the first amendment? A tax measure. A tax measure. We \nfinally got that bill passed. But we can't on this farm bill open it \nup.\n  I have heard the distinguished Republican leader come forward and \nsay: Well, that is what we have done in the past. I have been through \nthis before, but let me repeat for everyone: The average number of \nnongermane amendments on farm bills has been one--one per bill--one. In \nmy efforts to be fair and to move forward, I said, OK, on the 10 \namendments the Republicans want to do on this bill, we will have two of \nthem nongermane. I didn't ask what they would be. There was no taking \nof that. So I have done literally everything I can do.\n  The farming and ranching community of this country, they know why we \nare not moving forward on the farm bill. They know what is going on: \nThe Republicans do not want to move on the farm bill. Maybe they don't \ncare about it. Maybe they think it would be some kind of a victory for \nDemocrats who are in the majority in the Senate--not much of a \nmajority, but we are in the majority. I don't understand what this is \nall about. But Friday morning we are going to have a cloture vote \nagain. Is that so unreasonable that if people believe in the farm bill, \nthen they would still have 30 hours to offer amendments relating to the \nfarm bill? They would have to be germane amendments. But what would be \nwrong with that?\n  We have had one cloture motion. It has been defeated. We have waited \nweeks now. We have offered all kinds of suggestions to move forward. We \nhave not heard a single proposal back from the Republicans other than \nto say: Well, open it up for amendments. Open it up for amendments so \nwe can ask that we initiate a flat tax, or open it up to an amendment \nthat we push forward on Bush's tax cuts that have put this country into \nsuch a terrible hole financially. That is what the plan is, and we are \nnot going to be a part of that plan. We want to do a farm bill. We want \nto do it fairly and reasonably.\n  While we are talking about schedule, I have spoken to the Speaker \nseveral times today and she is going to complete either today or \ntomorrow an energy bill. That being the case, that will come here as a \nmessage from the House and we will have a cloture vote on that. The way \nthings now are, if it gets here tomorrow, we will file a cloture motion \non that and we will have a vote on that Saturday. So everyone should \nknow that unless there is an agreement to change that, we will have a \nvote on Saturday. We have Senators leaving for Bali and Senators \nwanting to go to some celebration at Pearl Harbor, and a lot of other \nplaces people want to go. But the country has a lot of business that \nneeds to be attempted to be completed, and we are going to do that. I \nhope we can work together to solve some of these issues.\n  But to show the futility of our trying to progress, take, for \nexample, the AMT, this tax proposal which was passed by a former \nRepublican administration. Unless we place a so-called\n\n[[Page S14775]]\n\npatch on it, 20 million people or so will have an added tax. Some who \nmake as much as $75,000 to $500,000 will be affected by this \nlegislation if we don't do something to patch it. I have done \neverything I can except turn a back flip off of the Presiding Officer's \nchair to see if we can figure out a way to move forward on AMT. I ask: \nHow could we be more reasonable than what we have suggested?\n  The House has passed a bill. It is over here. I said: Let's vote on \nthat by unanimous consent. Let's vote on it. In addition to voting on \nthat, let's vote on Senator Lott's proposal. Senator Lott's proposal is \nto do away with the AMT. The only problem with that is it would cost \nabout $1 trillion, but we are willing to vote on it. Senator Grassley \nand Senator Baucus have a measure out of the Finance Committee that \nsays we are going to have tax incentives, which people believe in, and \nthey are all paid for. With that is an AMT that is not paid for. Nope, \nwe can't do that. I said: Well, I have a new idea. Let's have a vote \nand not pay for it. Nope, can't do that. So if there were ever a book \non being reasonable, I hope they include a paragraph or two about what \nwe have tried to do the last few days. We have tried to be reasonable.\n\n  Think about this: What else could we agree to do on AMT? They don't \nwant to vote on it if it is paid for. They don't want a vote if it is \nhalf paid for, they don't want a vote if it is repealed, and they don't \nwant a vote if it is not paid for. I don't know what other iterations \nof this anyone could come up with, but I think I have covered the \nbasics. We have been told by the Republicans no vote on any of them.\n  If there is a closure of this congressional session and the AMT \nhasn't passed, it can be directed where most everything is directed--\nwith the Republicans marching in lockstep with the White House. The \nRepublicans. If there is no AMT patch, it is the fault of the \nRepublicans. They won't let us vote on anything.\n  So I say through the Chair to the distinguished Senator and my friend \nfrom Georgia: Do you know how we can complete the farm bill?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, first, I thank the majority leader for \ncoming down to the floor and providing one more chance to discuss this. \nI regret that the majority leader has taken this action to file \ncloture. But I can tell you what the answer is and I can tell you how \nto complete the farm bill. This is our fifth week on this bill, \nliterally. We had 2 weeks before the Thanksgiving recess. We have been \nout 2 weeks, and our staff has been working extremely hard during those \n2 weeks, and here we are back in the fifth week. If we had had an open \nprocess initially, this farm bill would be in conference today. I think \nthat still can happen. The distinguished majority leader referred to \nthe number of amendments that are out there. I don't remember what the \nnumber was, but 286, I believe, is what he said, and I think that is \ncorrect. A little over half of those were Democratic amendments and \nabout half were Republican amendments. We have hotlined our bill once \nagain today, and through work of the staff on both sides, we have cut \nour number in half again today, and I daresay I can cut it by two-\nthirds in very short order. So we are moving south. We are moving in \nthe direction of getting amendments not only that are germane, but as \nthe distinguished majority leader said, we have always had a couple of \nnongermane amendments on farm bills. As I looked at the list of the \nDemocratic amendments, there were a number--I daresay more nongermane \namendments on there than there were amendments that are germane to the \nfarm bill. So I don't think it serves any purpose for us to argue about \nthe germaneness or nongermaneness, obviously, with the exception of the \ncloture vote, what effect it will have on that.\n  But here is my point. This has been a bipartisan effort, as the \nmajority leader knows. I worked very closely with Senator Harkin and \nSenator Conrad and we have developed not only a bipartisan farm bill, \nbut we, in a bipartisan way, have been whittling down the amendments. \nWe are going to continue to do that, in spite of the cloture motion \nbeing filed, and I am very hopeful that whether it is Friday of this \nweek or Monday of next week or Tuesday of next week, whatever the date \nmay be, we can come back to the majority leader as well as the minority \nleader and say: OK, here is where we are. This is the final number of \namendments that we can finally have votes on, and if no agreement can \nbe negotiated on that basis, then perhaps we can't come to some \nconclusion of it. But we have stood ready from day 1 to have an open \nprocess of amendments being filed, amendments being debated, and votes \non those amendments, and some of those amendments I have significant \ndisagreements with. But I was willing to debate those amendments and if \nwe win, we win; if we don't win, we don't win, and we move on, but we \nget a bill off the floor of the Senate. The House passed their bill in \nJuly, and here we are in December and our work has not been completed.\n  I would simply say to the majority leader, if he asks me, as he did, \nhow can we get a farm bill? Let's start it. Call it up. Let's let \namendments be filed, debated, and voted on. I assure you we will move \nthis farm bill. I am here Saturday, Sunday, nights, holidays, whatever \nthe majority leader suggests.\n  We are here to do a farm bill, and I think I also speak for Senator \nHarkin that he will be here, and we will get this done.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Harkin told me today Senator \nChambliss and he had agreed to about 40 amendments; is that valid?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. We have not agreed to that. We have been working \ntogether.\n  Mr. REID. See, Mr. President, this is the problem we have all the \ntime. The Chairman, Senator Harkin, said Senator Chambliss and he had \nagreed to have less than 40 amendments. I said, fine. But it is always \nthis rope-a-dope--no, it is not 40; we are still working on it. Of the \n287, half of those are gone. And I guess half of that would be 143. We \nare down on the Republican side. Maybe they can get rid of two-thirds \nof them.\n  There is always some reason we cannot go to the bill. It is very easy \nto say if we had had an open process, we could have been to conference. \nThat is foolishness. I repeat, we know what farm bills are. It takes a \nwhile to work through them. But in recent history, we have averaged one \nnonrelevant amendment per farm bill. I am willing to take nonrelevant \namendments, but no one will tell us what they will agree to. I agreed \nto 10, 5, and then Senator Harkin said we can have 40. I said sign them \nup, let's do 40.\n  The ranking member of the committee says: Well, we are still working \non it. That is what we have had. I want all ranching and farming \nfamilies to hear what is going on here, which has gone on for weeks. \nWhether the purpose is to stop Democrats from passing a farm bill, I \ndon't know. Maybe the ranking member simply doesn't want a bill. There \nmay be reasons for that. We had a bipartisan bill. Twenty percent of \nthe Senate voted on the bill. Twenty-one Members of the Senate are \nmembers of the Agriculture Committee, and they voted to report the bill \nout here. But there has been no movement on it. Cloture is ripening \nnow, and we will move forward.\n  To show what is going on, we have filed cloture on AMT, the bill that \ncame from the House. We filed cloture on the farm bill; we are going to \nfile cloture tomorrow on the Energy bill. Everything we do, we have to \nprocedurally go through all of these hoops because the Republicans are \non steroids as it relates to filibusters. They are going to break all \nrecords. They will break a 2-year record this year. I think the \nAmerican people are seeing what is going on.\n  The Republicans are demanding the status quo, in spite of our \naccomplishments. We have had a lot of accomplishments, Mr. President. \nWe can run through the list, but we need not do that. But there have \nbeen large, significant, and important accomplishments. Accomplishments \nare not enough. We believe in changing the status quo. We believe in \nthe agents of change. They are agents of keeping things the way they \nare.\n  The American people want things changed, and we want to be part of \nthat change. We hope we will be joined by our Republican colleagues to \nchange a few things. Let's have a new farm bill. Let's not have to \nextend the farm bill\n\n[[Page S14776]]\n\nthat is now in existence. Let's try to do something with AMT, rather \nthan walk out of here and have people saying it is too bad the \nDemocrats didn't do AMT.\n  I have said that I defy anybody to come up with a way to do AMT other \nthan the way I have suggested: Vote on the House bill, which is fully \npaid for; do the Lott proposal, which eliminates it and costs a \ntrillion dollars; do what Senators Grassley and Baucus reported, that \nwe pay for the extenders, not for the AMT. This morning I suggested \ndon't pay for it. But, no. Silence.\n  I am disappointed but not surprised at how we have been treated \ntoday.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, let me respond to the distinguished \nmajority leader by saying that when he says I don't want a farm bill, \nnothing could be further from the truth. I already voted for this farm \nbill. I am ready to vote for this farm bill that came out of the \nAgriculture Committee tonight.\n  But when he says also that they are the advocates of change, what he \nis proposing is a change in the process when it comes to farm bills. We \ndo think the status quo on farm bills is the direction we ought to go, \nwhich is a free and open amendment process, to let the will of the \nSenate operate relative to farm policy.\n  This is a critical 5-year bill for every farmer and rancher in \nAmerica. If we limit the ability of folks to certain areas of concern, \nthen we are not giving every farmer and rancher in America the \nopportunity to have their case made in the Senate. So I simply say I am \nready to bring a farm bill to the floor. I have been ready for 5 weeks \nto do it. Senator Harkin and I have not even had a discussion today \nabout 40 amendments. I am not sure where that came from. There has been \nabsolutely no conversation between Senator Harkin and myself about \nthat.\n  I am prepared to move forward. If the majority leader will call up \nthe farm bill, let's start the amendment process, debate, and votes. I \nam here to do it.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Georgia \ntalking about his experience here. But I have a little bit of \nexperience, too. I have been here a quarter century. I know how farm \nbills work. Anybody can look at the record. Farm bills have been \nhandled the way I have talked about them being handled.\n  If the Senator from Georgia so likes this bill that he voted for, \nwhat would be wrong with voting cloture with us and allowing people who \nhave germane amendments to the farm bill to offer them? What in the \nworld is wrong with that? I say, respectfully, that the Senator is \nspeaking out of both sides of his mouth when he is saying he supports \nthis bill, when he is not willing to vote for cloture and accept \ngermane amendments. He wants some other process so they can deal with \ndriver's licenses for illegal immigrants and other issues that have \nnothing to do with the farm bill. They are trying to send a message. I \nhave said we will accept x number of amendments, and I spoke to Senator \nHarkin and he said they worked on this today. I thought he had spoken \nto the Senator from Georgia. Maybe it was staff driven, but he said \nthey agreed to 40 amendments. I said sign the deal up. Or let's agree \nto 50 amendments. But we cannot get any agreement. We are in a rope-a-\ndope, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this sounds somewhat similar to the \ndiscussion the majority leader and I had earlier today, so I will not \nbelabor this. Sometimes it is harder to get a consent agreement \nlimiting Members' opportunities to offer amendments than it is to call \nup a bill and process amendments, which is the way we have done farm \nbills in the past.\n\n  Six years ago, a Democratic majority filed cloture a couple times and \ncloture was not invoked. The bill was put aside, and we came back later \nand finished it in a week, with no consent agreements, no limitations, \nnothing. We disposed of the amendments. That is the way to pass this \nbill.\n  With regard to the AMT, this is a bill upon which there is a \npossibility of a consent agreement limiting amendments. In fact, I \noffered one yesterday that would limit the AMT consideration to four \namendments. So we can get, on the AMT, a consent agreement that would \nmake that possible to be dealt with in short order.\n  I repeat my request of the majority leader to take a look at that and \nsee if we cannot enter into a consent agreement to wrap up the AMT.\n  Regarding floor time, we have spent the whole day doing nothing. \nToday, we could have been on the farm bill processing amendments and \nmoving us down that path. Senator Chambliss indicated, before I came to \nthe floor, that the list on our side could be significantly narrowed. \nWhy don't we, at some point, look at that, and we will have fewer and \nfewer amendments to deal with. I don't know what we intend to do on the \nfloor next week, but if most of the work of the Senate right now is \ngoing on in negotiations off the floor, why not be doing the farm bill \non the floor and processing amendments and moving forward like the \nSenate normally does?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is interesting that when you offer to \nthe Republicans the opportunity to have a farm bill and debate the \nissues on the bill, they reject it. They want to debate a lot of other \nthings. They want to bring up a lot of other issues. I recall the list \nof amendments, including one from the Senator from Alaska regarding the \nExxon Valdez litigation. That is an important issue, but is it a farm \nbill issue? Would the Senator from Georgia argue with me that that has \nno place on the farm bill? Why would that be on the list? I am sure it \nis a valid idea.\n  When it comes to AMT, 19 million Americans are going to get hit with \nthis tax if we don't do something. The Senator from Kentucky says we \nshould engage in a debate on the Senate floor on the flat tax. What? \nYes, the flat tax. That is one of their amendments. They want to toss \nout the entire Internal Revenue Code and replace it with a flat tax. We \nhave to argue that before we take up the AMT. That is what we are \nhearing from the Republicans.\n  Does that sound like it is responsible, like it addresses the issues \nwe were sent to deal with? Every time we get to a substantive issue, \nSenator Reid comes to the floor and says let's narrow the amendments, \nhave the debate, and decide it up or down. We will give you your chance \nto offer amendments related to the bill, and we will see how it ends. \nHow much fairer can that be? They reject it.\n  Time and again, they reject it because they don't want us to achieve \nanything in this session. Fifty-six times this year they have created a \nfilibuster situation. Now, people who don't follow the Senate may not \nknow what that means, but if you saw ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' \nand watched Jimmy Stewart crumple at his desk when he had run out of \nsteam and could not talk anymore, that is what a filibuster is all \nabout. That is what the Republicans are all about--talk, talk, talk--or \nin the modern era, recess, quorum call, recess, quorum call.\n  Some Senator said to me it reminds him of when Abraham Lincoln \ncontacted a general during the Civil War and said: If you are not going \nto use the Army, can you let me use it to execute the war?\n  If we are not going to use the Senate floor to do the business of the \nAmerican people, can we set up a flea market or something, so that \nsomething positive is happening?\n  The Republicans are determined to stop anything substantive from \nhappening. We want to take up the AMT tax and protect 19 million \ntaxpayers. They are going to stop us. When they stop us, they are going \nto blame us. We saw that earlier in the day. The Republican leadership \nstopped a bill, and a Senator said we are just not taking up \nappropriations bills. They cannot have it both ways.\n  I listened to Senator Reid, and I detected a note of frustration. How \nmany weeks have we wasted trying to get through a farm bill that passed \noverwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis? They want to consider an \namendment on the Exxon Valdez spill on the farm bill. I am sorry, but \nthere are important things in that bill that need to pass, and they \nshould not be held hostage to the whim of every Senator on the \nRepublican side who has an idea. I am sure we could have a spirited \ndebate about the future of the flat tax. But it is getting close to \nChristmas, and we\n\n[[Page S14777]]\n\nare supposed to get this done before we leave. We will never get it \ndone if every Senator on the Republican side who dreams up another \ndebate topic is given another half day or 2 days to pursue it.\n  At some point, leadership involves responsibility. At this point, I \nthink the Republicans are being irresponsible because they refuse to \nlet us do the people's business. They want to protect the status quo. \nThey don't want this to change. They want to make this a do-nothing \nCongress just like the last Congress, when they were in charge. We are \ntrying our best to avoid that. The honest answer may be that we need \nmore votes on this side of the aisle so we can stop this, so we can \nmove ahead and make some real changes in farm policy and tax policy. We \nwould not reach that point if the Republican strategy continues--\nfilibusters and blocking, coming up with excuses, and spending months \non a bill that should have taken days.\n  That is their plan, their policy. That is what they believe in. That \nis the best they can offer the American people. That is why the \nRepublican Party leadership in the Congress has been summarily rejected \nby the American people. They are sick of it. They want bipartisan \ncooperation, progress, and they want change.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/05/senate-section/article/S14777-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, especially Senator \nMurray and Senator Menendez, for their courtesy. I will be brief.\n  Today the House and Senate announced a historic package to address \nthe energy crisis facing our Nation. But in addition, as part of that \nimportant legislation, the agreement contains more than $1.8 billion in \ndesperately needed funding for our Nation's rural schools, counties, \nand communities.\n  Without the safety net funding provided as part of the energy \nlegislation, rural communities across this country could literally be \nwiped off the map. Without this critical funding, rural counties across \nAmerica will once again be staring down into a precipice and a future \nfilled with closed schools, terminated services, and deteriorating \nroads. Within months, pink slips could again be sent to teachers and to \ncounty workers.\n  Fortunately, some help for those rural communities is now on the way. \nThe energy package contains an extension of the Secure Rural Schools \nProgram that I authored in 2000. This proposal closely mirrors the \nlegislative proposal that was crafted with Senators Baucus, Bingaman, \nReid, and myself, a proposal that passed overwhelmingly in this body by \na 74-to-23 vote as an amendment that I offered to the war emergency \nsupplemental spending bill last spring.\n  Specifically, the new energy package provides 4 more years of funding \nfor the Secure Rural Schools Program, commonly known as the County \nPayments Program. A year of full funding for the payment in lieu of \ntaxes program has also been included. By providing funds through 2011, \nthis deal gets our rural counties off the fiscal roller coaster and \nback to stable funding so they can get at the real work of planning for \nthe future. Today's announcement would mean $1.8 billion in critical \nfunding for school and road programs across America.\n  In our home State of Oregon, particularly when folks are suffering \nbecause of the bad weather, it would mean hundreds of millions of \ndollars for schools and public safety, roads, and other essential \ncounty services. This program has been a successful one. It has been \nbuilt around collaboration among counties, environmentalists, timber \ninterests, and others, and the funds are absolutely critical to our \nrural communities.\n  The legislation that has been agreed to today, the Energy bill, is \nvery important to our country's future. But equally important is the \nlegislation known as the County Payments Program for rural communities.\n  I am grateful to my colleague, Senator Murray, and Senator Menendez, \nwho have been waiting patiently for the chance to make this \nannouncement, and it is my hope that with the unflagging support of \nrural folks from across the country that this much-needed energy \nlegislation will move forward and the country can look to a brighter \nfuture for rural communities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Jersey for \nallowing me to speak before he does. I wish to speak today because, as \nwe all know, in the last several days, the Pacific Northwest has been \nhit by devastating storms. We have seen wind and dangerous floods and \nmud slides that have cut off our roads, our homes, cut off power to \nliterally thousands in my State.\n  Today, the pouring rain thankfully has subsided a bit, but thousands \nof people are coping with the damage in my State, in my region. We will \nnot know the full impact of this storm for some time, but our Governor \nhas already estimated that the cost is going to be in the billions of \ndollars.\n  My heart goes out to everyone in my home State of Washington and in \nOregon who are coping with the aftermath of this tremendous storm. \nThose people are in my thoughts constantly. I am working with all of \nour State, local, and Federal entities to be sure everyone gets all the \nservice and support they need at this critical time.\n  I especially thank and mention our Governor, Governor Gregoire of \nWashington State. She has been very strong in her leadership throughout \nthis disaster and has been working tirelessly to coordinate the rescue \nefforts.\n  I especially today send a very heartfelt thanks to all of our rescue \nworkers. They have been working out in these torrential rains, night \nand day, rescuing people from flooded homes and vehicles. They have \nbeen flying in supplies to people who are stranded. They have been \nworking very hard to clear roads and railways that are still tonight \nswamped.\n  So far, the Navy, the Coast Guard, the National Guard, and all of our\n\n[[Page S14778]]\n\nagencies have rescued about 300 people by helicopter alone. This is our \nState's largest aerial search-and-rescue operation in over a decade.\n  Let me paint a picture for all my colleagues of the damage that has \noccurred so far.\n  Parts of southwest Washington now look like a sea of brown water. \nHomes are flooded up to their roofs. Entire communities have been \nisolated by swamped roads. Out on our coast, winds of up to 100 miles \nan hour have knocked out power to literally thousands of homes. People \nfeel very isolated today. They don't have power, they don't have \ntelephones, and, in some areas, it is very tough to even assess how bad \nthe damage is yet because we cannot even get to these people who do not \nhave power or telephones.\n  I know a lot of relatives in the region and across the country are \ndesperately trying this evening to reach their loved ones who have been \naffected, and our office, along with Governor Gregoire, Senator \nCantwell, and others, is doing everything we can to help.\n  Finally, I wish to mention one of the hardest hit areas, and that is \nInterstate 5. This is the major artery that links Portland, OR, and \nSeattle, WA. That highway has been closed since Monday, and some are \nsaying it is going to be several more days before we even get it open. \nThis has forced cars and trucks that are traveling from Seattle to \nPortland or Portland to Seattle to detour through the Tri-Cities. For \nthose who don't know my State, that means they have to go over a \nmountain pass that is snow packed right now, take 4 extra hours, if the \nroads are good and the snow and ice has not stopped them on the pass \nused to get to Portland. So this is a major nightmare in our area.\n\n  It is very hard to explain the impact of all this damage, but \nestimates of cost to businesses from delays on that highway alone have \nbeen placed at $4 million a day to our businesses that rely on this \nmajor artery to get their goods quickly and safely back and forth.\n  As I said in a speech earlier today on the floor, the impact of these \nstorms reinforces how important our transportation infrastructure is to \nabsolutely everyone. We are all one rainstorm, one bridge disaster away \nfrom huge impacts to our economy and to families' lives.\n  Again, I wished to come to the floor this evening to send my \nheartfelt thanks to everyone who is working so hard in my State of \nWashington and to all those people who have been affected so \ndevastatingly by these storms. They are all in my thoughts every \nminute. My heart goes out to them, and I know everyone stands ready to \nbe by their side.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/05/senate-section/article/S14778-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14778-S14779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          COST OF THE IRAQ WAR\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, for more than 4 years now, President \nBush has been declaring victory or progress in Iraq. The thousands of \nsoldiers who have lost their legs, gone blind or suffered horrible \nnightmares might be finding it hard to celebrate. The families of those \nmen and women might not be cheering very loud about the President's \nview of success. Thousands more whose children, whose mothers and \nfathers are lost forever might be finding it hard to share in the \nlatest cries of victory.\n  Yes, the number killed last month dropped to 37, and we certainly \nrejoice in the fact that fewer soldiers are dying. That is still \nanother 37 families who have no reason to rejoice. More American troops \nhave died this year than any other year.\n  No matter how much military progress has been made in Iraq, that kind \nof security can only go so far. No amount of troops will force Iraqi \npoliticians to agree on a fair distribution of oil revenues. No Abrams \ntank can build trust between Shiites and Sunnis.\n  The whole point of this surge was to create the conditions necessary \nfor Iraqis to make political progress. But 2 weeks ago, the Washington \nPost ran a headline that said: ``Iraqis Wasting an Opportunity, U.S. \nOfficers Say.''\n  Iraqi security forces are still unable to operate on their own. Any \ncease-fire between factions could evaporate in minutes. We started \ndrawing down troops to pre-surge levels, but we have to wonder whether \nwe are going to be told again we have to re-surge, do it all over again \nbecause the Iraqi Government and security forces are largely still at \nsquare one.\n  Our generals in Iraq have been the first to admit that a solution to \nthe country's conflict has to be more than a military solution; it has \nto be a political solution. A political solution is up to Iraqi \nleaders. Right now there has been practically zero progress on the core \ncritical issues necessary to bring a lasting peace.\n  The administration set 18 benchmarks for the Iraqi Government to \nmeet. They have barely met three. So is it time to turn up the pressure \nor let them keep squabbling while Americans pay and Americans die?\n  There is more corruption in Iraq than almost anywhere else on the \nface of the Earth. We simply don't know where our money is going. It is \na pit of quicksand when it comes to money. Some estimates say that as \nmuch as a third of the money we spend on Iraqi contracts and grants \nwinds up unaccounted for or stolen--a third of billions of dollars, \nwith a lot of it going straight to Shiite or Sunni militias. Let me \nrepeat that: $1 out of every $3 we pay gets either lost or stolen--lost \nor stolen. Even after billions and billions and billions of dollars in \nfunding, Iraqi society is still dysfunctional.\n\n  American money went toward improving, for example, municipal water \nsystems in Iraq. The Iraqis now break open the pipes and steal the \nwater. American money went toward books for schools. Iraqis steal them \nfrom the Ministry of Education and sell them on the street at three \ntimes the price. Government officials have sold the furniture right out \nof their offices. That is what the American taxpayers are funding.\n  So is it time to change our strategy, or do we ignore the corruption \nwhile Americans pay and Americans die? Here is the message we send to \nIraqi politicians by sending them a blank check with no expiration \ndate: Continue your squabbles. We will continue to see the loss of \nAmerican life and continue to empty our treasury for you for as long as \nyou like. That message is: You can sit back while Americans pay and \nAmericans die. I think it is time for a different message, Mr. \nPresident.\n  After seeing a surge in the military that has lasted for months do \nnothing about a splurge of corruption that has lasted for years, the \nconclusion we have to draw from that is clear: The only way Iraqis will \ntake charge of their own country and make the tough compromises \nnecessary to form a functional society is when they believe we won't be \nthere forever. That is the only way. It is long past time for the Iraqi \nGovernment to take charge, and the only way they are going to step up \nis if we begin to transition out. A reduction in fighting is not an \nexcuse for a reduction in planning for our involvement to end.\n  The fact is, the violence has not stopped and the costs of this war \nhave only gone up. The war is costing us $10 billion or so per month. \nThe debt our Government is taking on, and that taxpayers are going to \nbe responsible for, is exploding at the rate of $1 million a minute. I \nheard our colleagues earlier today, when I was Presiding Officer, talk \nabout fiscal responsibility and what we bequeath to the next \ngeneration. Well, we are bequeathing them $1 million a minute of debt, \nbecause none of the money the President asked for is paid for--none of \nit. Yet when we try to invest in America, we are told there is no money \nfor it. But it is okay to continue to saddle the next generation of \nAmericans with a huge debt, $1 million a minute.\n  When the numbers are that high, every American taxpayer has to ask \nhim or herself a basic question: How does the President plan to pay for \nthe war?\n  Well, last week, we got a small part of that answer. He wants to cut \nfunding for counterterrorism at home. According to a leaked \nadministration document, President Bush wants to cut counterterrorism \nfunding for cities by more than half. When I saw that article, I had to \ndo a double-take. When I read that, I thought the report had to be \nwrong. It had to be wrong. Coming from the State of New Jersey, which \nlost 700 people--700 of my fellow citizens on that fateful day, and \ncoming\n\n[[Page S14779]]\n\nfrom a nation that lost 3,000 fellow Americans--to hear that we are \ngoing to continue to pump money into this war, a blank check, unpaid \nfor, but that we will not take care of our security here at home, that \nhad to be wrong.\n  His reported budget would slash funding for police, firefighters, and \nrescue workers. It could mean fewer security guards at ports, less \nreliable detection of explosives, and less training for security \npersonnel. Basically, it would undermine the entire effort to prevent \nterrorism that our Nation realized that September day, one of the most \nurgent challenges we have ever faced. Cutting counterterrorism funding \nis simply outrageous.\n  Now I certainly hope the Congress is not going to stand for it, and \nthe people who live in those cities definitely will not stand for it. \nBut is it necessary to remind the President how important it is to \nprotect our homes and families from terrorist attacks? Do we have to \nsay that we must do everything within the bounds of possibility and the \nlaw to prevent a terrorist attack from happening again? And this \nsuggestion that we are ultimately spending our efforts and lives and \nnational treasure there so we don't have to spend it here is a \nfalsehood. That is a falsehood.\n  Is anyone here in America going to feel safer at the end of the day \nwhen counterterrorism funding is cut for their hometown security, which \nas we found out on that fateful day on September 11 is how we \nresponded--with local police, local firefighters, local emergency \nmanagement? It was not the Federal Government but the local public \nsafety entities. Is that a risk President Bush wants to take, to cut \nwhat amounts to .06 percent of the Federal budget, especially when the \nwar in Iraq has eaten up $455 billion and counting; when the amount he \nwants to take away from police and firefighters, the people who \nrespond, should, God forbid we have an attack, is an amount we spend in \nIraq every 5 days? The money we are talking about for protecting us \nhere at home in America is what we spend every 5 days in Iraq. What are \nour values? What are our priorities, Mr. President?\n  The President has requested $1 billion for the Iraqi police, but he \nwants to cut funding for the community-oriented policing program that \nfights crime in America's communities. So he will spend anything on the \nstreets of Baghdad, but he suddenly thinks we should be stingy when it \ncomes to security on the streets of our hometowns. The President wants \na blank check for Iraq, but nothing for America.\n  That ties into what you have been seeing on the floor over the last \nseveral days. The reason we can't get appropriations bills out is \nbecause Republicans object to the type of domestic priorities the \nAmerican people elected a new majority to achieve. He wants a blank \ncheck for Iraq, but nothing for America. From children's health to \ncancer research to crucial water resources, the President has vetoed \nwhat is most essential: our health, our safety, and in essence, our \nliberty. He has repeatedly said it is all too expensive. Meanwhile, he \nis requesting $200 billion more to fight a war in Iraq that has \nachieved nothing for any of us; that has ultimately seen the deaths of \nthousands of Americans and has left us more disliked around the world \nas a nation than at any other point in recent history. He wants a blank \ncheck for Iraq, but nothing for America. If he submits a budget that \ncuts funding for counterterrorism, I think he will truly be laying a \nfinal brick in the Department of Homeland Hypocrisy.\n\n  In high school many of us read George Orwell's book ``1984,'' which \nwas about a nightmare world where words mean the exact opposite of what \nthey should mean. America is starting to understand what the word \n``security'' means to the President. He apparently thinks funding \nfirefighters, police officers, and emergency responders is excessive, \nbut he wants to spy on Americans without warrants, he wants to tap \npeople's phones without any oversight, he condones procedures even the \nU.S. Army itself considers torture, he wants to throw people in jail \nwithout trials, and he basically ignores the most basic tenets of the \njustice system of the United States since the Constitution came into \neffect in 1789.\n  President Bush wants to cut funding to stop terrorism in order to \nfund a war that has created terrorists. We didn't have al-Qaida in Iraq \nbefore we invaded Iraq. We have al-Qaida in Iraq after we invaded Iraq.\n  America isn't just ready to turn the page on this administration; we \nare ready for a whole new book. I hope, as we move forward, we can get \nsome of these domestic priorities that the Nation wants to see. I \ncannot believe we would spend $200 billion for Iraq but not a fraction \nof that to be able to ensure that millions of American children can \nhave health care. I cannot believe we would spend $200 billion more for \nIraq but not enough to handle police, firefighters, and emergency \nmanagement in our communities across the landscape of this country. I \ncannot imagine approving $200 billion for Iraq but not being able to \ndeal with the alternative minimum tax relief, a measure Senator Reid \nhas tried to bring to the floor.\n  On issue after issue, the obstructionism, the roadblocks, the \ncoordination between the White House and our colleagues here in the \nSenate to impede the progress the American people want to see is \nincredible, as it is equally incredible to continue this course by \nasking for a blank check for Iraq, but nothing for America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/05/senate-section/article/S14779-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14779-S14780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PERU FREE TRADE AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am a longtime supporter of policies \ndesigned to open foreign markets to our Nation's exports through trade \nagreements. I have fought to break down barriers that many other \ncountries have erected to block our exports and to create unfair \nadvantages. The fact is that mutually beneficial trade agreements serve \nto improve farm income and create jobs here at home, and American \nconsumers receive benefits as well, including lower prices and a \ngreater variety of goods.\n  I supported the fast track procedure in the 1988 Trade Act. I voted \nfor the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Uruguay Round GATT \nAgreement. However, trade agreements are not only about commercial \ntransactions. Trade agreements also have major environmental impacts, \nand they have major implications for the legal rights and working \nconditions of laborers. All of these factors must be carefully \nconsidered in determining whether to support a given trade agreement.\n  Certainly, there are modest positives in this Peru Free Trade \nAgreement. The American Farm Bureau Federation has estimated that the \nagreement would generate a net increase in U.S. agricultural exports of \nmore than $700 million annually once the agreement is fully implemented \nin 2025. I note, however, that, in today's dollars, that would \nrepresent only roughly one-half of 1 percent of current U.S. \nagricultural exports.\n  In addition, this agreement would level the playing field for the \nUnited States vis-a-vis other major agricultural exporters in South \nAmerica. Both Brazil and Argentina enjoy preferential access into \nPeru's markets because of Peru's associate membership in Mercosur, and \nthis FTA would make it easier for our products to compete with exports \nfrom Brazil and Argentina. However, I have always considered these \ncountry-by-country trade deals to be far less than ideal. It would be \nfar better to negotiate a successful global trade agreement under the \nauspices of the World Trade Organization.\n  Despite these modest benefits, I believe that, on balance, the Peru \nFree Trade Agreement falls short. I am particularly concerned about the \nagreement's deficiencies with regard to fighting child labor.\n  As many of our colleagues know, I have been working to reduce abusive \nand exploitative child labor around the world for a decade and a half. \nI first introduced a bill on this issue in 1992. Over the years, I have \nworked hard to improve the labor provisions in various trade measures, \nconcentrating particularly on abusive and exploitative child labor. I \nbelieve strongly that trade agreements should support and reinforce \nexisting international child-labor standards, not undercut them. On \nthis criterion, the Peru FTA falls short.\n  According to the best estimates by the International Labor \nOrganization, ILO, there are at least 218 million child laborers \nbetween the ages of 5 and 17 in today's global economy. Of these 218\n\n[[Page S14780]]\n\nmillion child laborers, more than 100 million have never seen the \ninside of a classroom. An estimated 126 million children are working \nunder the most hazardous circumstances in mines, in fishing operations \nand on plantations. These children are being robbed of their \nchildhoods. Many are being denied an education. They are deprived of \nany hope for a brighter future. In the years ahead, they will grow up \nilliterate and exploited, and this will create a wellspring of future \nsocial conflict and strife, and even terrorism.\n  We have made progress in recent years by increasing funds for \nprograms to rehabilitate child laborers through our contribution to the \nILO's International Program for the Elimination of Child Labor. In \n2000, I successfully amended the Trade and Development Act with a \nprovision directing that no trade benefits under the Generalized System \nof Preferences, GSP, will be granted to any country that does not live \nup to its commitments to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. I \nrequired that the President submit a yearly report to Congress on the \nsteps being taken by each GSP beneficiary country to carry out its \ncommitments to end abusive and exploitative child labor.\n  I want to explain clearly to my colleagues what I mean when I refer \nto abusive and exploitative child labor. I am not talking about \nchildren who work part time after school or on weekends. There is \nnothing necessarily wrong with that. What I am referring to is the \ndefinition set out by ILO Convention 182 on the Worst Forms of Child \nLabor. This is not just a Western or a developed-world standard; it is \na global standard that has been ratified by 163 countries. It was \nratified by Peru in 1999. The United States was the third country in \nthe world to ratify this convention.\n  It is true that we have made some modest progress in including labor \nprotections in this Peru Free Trade Agreement. But we all know that \nlabor protections in trade agreements mean nothing in the absence of \npolitical will to enforce them. I am also concerned that, on the very \nsame day that the deal to include new labor provisions in the Peru FTA \nwas announced, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said, ``We \nare encouraged by assurances that the labor provisions cannot be read \nto require compliance with ILO Conventions.'' Clearly, this statement \nsends a powerful message that the labor provisions in the Peru FTA \nshould be ignored.\n  Under the Peru deal, the only party that can seek enforcement of \nlabor violations in Peru is the U.S. administration. There is no \nmechanism for an outside party, such as a nongovernmental organization, \nto bring a complaint, as exists under the GSP. This would actually take \nus, and the world, a step backward when it comes to protecting \nchildren. That is right. This free-trade agreement with Peru, which \nreplaces GSP provisions in governing trade between our two countries, \nwill take us backward with respect to combating abusive and \nexploitative child labor.\n  Under the current U.S. GSP provisions, the President now must report \nto Congress annually regarding Peru's child labor practices. Under GSP, \nif Peru is not meeting the obligations that it undertook as a signatory \nto the ILO Convention 182, if it is not acting to eliminate the worst \nforms of child labor, then trade sanctions are imposed immediately to \nrequire enforcement in Peru of internationally recognized standards. \nThis protects children. It also ensures that our workers will not be \nsubjected to unfair competition from abusive and exploitative labor \nabroad. Unfortunately, under the Peru Free Trade Agreement, trade \nsanctions are not automatic.\n  I remind our colleagues that we voted 96 to 0 to include those \nprotections, which I offered to GSP. It was a Harkin-Helms amendment, \nand it received unanimous, bipartisan support. None of us wanted to \nhave those child labor protections undercut by our trade negotiators in \nan agreement with Peru or any other country but that is exactly what \nhas happened. Now, because of fast-track rules which don't allow us to \namend this legislation, we won't even be able to vote to restore the \nGSP protections in this agreement. If we vote for this trade agreement, \nwe are voting to remove the protections that all of us who were here in \n2000 voted to put in place.\n  On the matter of child labor, this Peru Free Trade Agreement takes us \nin the wrong direction. Abusive and exploitative child labor is wrong \nas a matter of principle. And it is also wrong as a practical matter. \nOur workers and our small businesses should not have to compete with \nabused and exploited child laborers abroad.\n  I am sorry to say that this is not an academic or rhetorical issue in \nthe case of labor practices in Peru. Peru is far from the worst \nGovernment, even in our hemisphere, when it comes to meeting its \ninternational obligations to protect children from abusive and \nexploitative labor. I don't mean to single out Peru. But there is broad \nagreement among international observers--including our own Department \nof Labor, the Department of State, UNICEF and the International Labor \nOrganization--that the problem of abusive child labor persists in that \ncountry. As many as 1.9 million Peruvian children between the ages of 6 \nand 17 are working rather than attending schools as they should. There \nare an estimated 150,000 child laborers in the capital city of Lima \nalone. The Government of Peru may be seeking to reduce the problem, as \nit should, but we should not be weakening our sole existing trade \nmechanism that allows us to monitor its progress. That is not the way \nforward for free and fair trade. And it is certainly not the way to \nlift up the Peruvian economy. Abusive child labor perpetuates the cycle \nof poverty across generations. No country has achieved broad-based \neconomic prosperity on the backs of working and exploited children.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate that improvements were made to this \nagreement thanks to my Democratic colleagues in the House. But this \nremains a flawed agreement, one that we are not allowed to correct \nthrough amendments. I was eager to support an agreement promoting freer \ntrade with Peru, but I cannot support a flawed agreement that takes a \nstep backward from current law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/05/senate-section/article/S14780-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14780-S14781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PASSAGE OF S. 1327\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to welcome the passage of \nS. 1327, which will reestablish temporary judgeships where needed in \nthe district courts and extend other temporary judgeships that are \nabout to expire.\n  The bill will reestablish a 10-year temporary judgeship in the \nEastern District of California, where it is sorely needed. It will also \nreestablish a temporary judgeship in Nebraska and extend the terms of \nexisting temporary judgeships in Hawaii, Kansas, and Ohio.\n  The Eastern District of California had a temporary judgeship from \n1992 to 2004. At the end of that period, the caseload in the district \nwas the second-highest in the Nation: 787 filings per judge. That was \nalmost 50 percent more than the national average.\n  Still, the temporary judgeship expired in the fall of 2004 as \nrequired by law. Since then the situation in the Eastern District has \ngrown even more dire. Average caseloads across the Nation have \ndeclined, but in the Eastern District they have increased by 18 \npercent.\n  The most recent statistics show that the Eastern District of \nCalifornia has the highest caseload in the country: 927 filings per \njudge. That is twice as many cases as the national average.\n  It is no exaggeration to say that the judges of the Eastern District \nare in desperate need of relief. They have continued to serve with \ndistinction in the face of the crushing caseloads. Two of the court's \nsenior judges still carry full caseloads after taking senior status. \nTwo other senior judges are also continuing to hear cases.\n  In recent months, the caseload has become even more crushing with the \ndeparture of chief judge David Levi. He stepped down from the bench \nafter 17 years of service to become the dean of the Duke University \nSchool of Law.\n  It is clear that the Eastern District of California needs our help to \nensure that cases continue to be handled with the care, attention, and \npromptness that are essential to the fair administration of justice. \nReestablishing the expired temporary judgeship is one way to help.\n  This bill is also a crucial first step toward getting California all \nof the\n\n[[Page S14781]]\n\njudges it needs. According to the 2007 recommendations of the Judicial \nConference of the United States, California needs a total of 12 new \njudges--more judges than are needed in any other State in the Nation. \nFour of those judges are needed in the Eastern District. By adding a \ntemporary judgeship in the Eastern District, this bill will begin to \nmeet that need.\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this bill and pleased that the \nSenate has passed it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/05/senate-section/article/S14781-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      INTERNATIONAL VOLUNTEER DAY\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to recognize the \nUnited Nations International Volunteer Day for Economic and Social \nDevelopment, IVD. I strongly support international volunteering because \nof the mutual personal and cultural benefits it yields to both those \nwho volunteer and those who benefit from volunteer efforts. \nVolunteering is one of the more meaningful ways for us to address very \nsignificant needs and develop a common understanding throughout our \ninterconnected world.\n  Volunteering overseas regularly changes perspectives for the better. \nMy constituents often share their stories about these international \nexperiences, and I am always pleased to hear them talk about how it \nbroadened their understanding and deepened their compassion for other \ncultures. Today, some of the greatest threats to our national security \nare based on, or feed upon, a false impression of who the American \npeople are and what we care about. To reverse these erroneous \nimpressions we need to share and make clear the qualities of empathy \nand kindness that are central to our heritage. American volunteerism \nabroad is not only a simple act of benevolence--an effort to improve \nthe lives of others--but it is also one of our best resources to create \ngreater, more meaningful interaction and common points of reference and \nto build strong relationships throughout the world.\n  Claudia from Milwaukee wrote me recently about her first \ninternational volunteer experience. She said, ``I have always had a \ndesire to travel and explore. . . . Most recently, I had the \nopportunity to volunteer internationally with Cross-Cultural Solutions \nin Lima, Peru . . . which brought out every emotion we have. While in \nLima, I worked with the elderly of Villa El Salvador, many of whom are \nabused, neglected and in poor health. Villa El Salvador, which is \noutside of Lima, is a shantytown built on the sand dunes in 1970. The \nwarmth and love felt from the people was unbelievable. I also had the \nopportunity to participate in home visits. Seeing how people live with \nvery little, most with only one or two rooms, many with dirt floors and \nsome having no indoor plumbing, makes me realize that it's not the \npossessions we have in life but life itself. . . . We are one world, \none planet. We do need to share it as one.''\n  I believe every American should have the opportunity to volunteer \noverseas and experience firsthand, like Claudia, how crucial this kind \nof assistance is to building meaningful personal understanding and \ninternational relationships as well as contributing to the development \nof nations. For this reason, I introduced the Global Service Fellowship \nAct, S. 1464, which creates an international volunteer program designed \nto provide more opportunities for people-to-people engagement. The bill \nreduces two key barriers that Americans face when volunteering \noverseas--cost and time limitations. First, the Global Service \nFellowship Act reduces financial barriers by awarding fellowships that \ncan be applied towards airfare, housing, or program costs, to name a \nfew examples. By providing financial assistance, the Global Service \nFellowship Program opens the door for every American to be a program \nparticipant--not just those with the resources to pay for it.\n  Second, this bill offers flexibility in the length of time for which \nan individual can volunteer. I often hear from constituents who do not \nseek opportunities to participate in Federal volunteer programs because \nthey cannot leave their jobs or family for years at a time. The Global \nService Fellowship Program provides a commonsense approach to the time \nconstraints of many Americans who seek volunteer opportunities by \noffering a timeframe that works for them--from a month up to a year.\n  My bill would broaden the spectrum of Federal volunteer opportunities \nalready made available by our Government. Given the increasingly \nnegative perception of the United States overseas, we need more support \nfor international volunteerism now more than ever. My constituents who \nengage in such opportunities are proof of how we can both inform \nourselves of the needs and nature of our foreign neighbors and also \ndirectly change attitudes about the United States for the better.\n  For these reasons, today marks a special day for me and, in \nparticular, for my constituents who have shared with me their stories \nof hope and fulfillment from their international experiences. It is my \nwish that all of us will have these types of experiences and that this \nday will remind us of--and encourage us to participate in--the very \nmeaningful opportunities and benefits offered by international \nvolunteer initiatives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/05/senate-section/article/S14781-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ED SHINODA\n\n Mr. AKAKA.

Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to congratulate the Haleiwa Super Market of Haleiwa, HI, on \ncelebrating its 100-year anniversary. The store was opened by Kasaku \nSakai, a Japanese plantation contract worker, and has since been run by \nfour generations of the Sakai family.\n  Since opening in 1907, the store has expanded from a small grocery \nstore to a full service supermarket. The business has changed locations \nseveral times in order to accommodate the store's increasing size. It \nhas provided the residents of Haleiwa town with an invaluable resource \nthroughout its many years. For example, during WWII, the store operated \nby credit, and its customers were not required to pay interest on their \noutstanding balances. Debts were often forgiven for families that were \nunable to pay. Now, both tourists and locals stroll the aisles of the \nHaleiwa Super Market for its fresh\n\n[[Page S14782]]\n\nproduce, fish, wines, and its line of Haleiwa Super Market logo items.\n  For 100 years, the Haleiwa store has remained a family run business. \nEveryone in the family has contributed to the business since the time \nthey were young. It is now operated by Robert and Roy Sakai. They \ncredit the success of the company to their great employees.\n  People continue to enjoy the Haleiwa Super Market for its friendly \nemployees and family atmosphere. Many people have helped to keep the \nmarket a flourishing business, and although we cannot name them all, we \nhonor them through the celebration of the centennial anniversary. \nWithout the support and dedication of the owners, employees, and \ncustomers of the Haleiwa Super Market, the store could not have \nsurvived these 100 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/05/senate-section/article/S14782-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14782-S14783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                REMEMBERING BROTHER J. STEPHEN SULLIVAN\n\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, on January 9, 2007, Brother J. \nStephen Sullivan, Manhattan College's 17th president from 1975 to 1987, \npassed away at the age of 86 in Lincroft, NJ. A noted teacher, scholar, \ntheologian, and administrator, Brother Sullivan served Manhattan \nCollege tirelessly for more than a quarter century. A champion for \nCatholic higher education, he was dedicated to establishing new \nprograms, which enhanced the landscape of the college. He is credited \nwith fully implementing the transformation of Manhattan College into a \ncoeducational institution and ensuring the integration of women into \nthe entire curriculum. The college had become coed just prior to \nBrother Sullivan's move into the president's office. Brother Sullivan \ntouched and enriched the lives of so many, and I am pleased to ask to \nhave the below moving tribute to the life and accomplishments of \nBrother Sullivan, written by Brother Luke Salm, F.S.C., a longtime \nprofessor and trustee of Manhattan College, printed in the \nCongressional Record.\n  The material follows.\n\n  The Late Brother J. Stephen Sullivan, F.S.C., President, Manhattan \n                        College, Bronx, New York\n\n       ``What is so rare as a day in June?'' says the poet. June \n     25, 1920 was a rare day, indeed, that saw the birth of \n     Jeremiah Thomas Sullivan to the delight of his parents, \n     Bridget Quirk and John Joseph Sullivan. The child grew in \n     wisdom, age and grace in a typical Irish Catholic family in \n     the Boston suburbs, a family that would give to the Church \n     not only this Christian Brother but also a Jesuit priest and \n     a Sister of Charity. In due time, young Jeremiah attended the \n     distinguished Boston Latin School, but after two years, \n     contact with the Brothers in nearby Waltham was the \n     instrument of Providence that led him to heed the divine call \n     to become a disciple of St. John Baptist de La Salle. With \n     joy and fervor he entered the junior class in the Barrytown, \n     New York, juniorate in 1936. The novitiate inevitably \n     followed, where, on September 7, 1938, he was invested with \n     the religious habit and given the name Brother Casimir \n     Stephen.\n       In those days, the year of novitiate in Barrytown was \n     followed by the scholasticate at De La Salle College in \n     Washington in an extension program of The Catholic \n     University. The scholasticate was supposed to continue the \n     spiritual formation begun in the novitiate, while at the same \n     time and often more successfully, providing a solid academic \n     grounding for future assignments to classroom teaching. \n     Brother Stephen was one of those chosen souls, lured by \n     Brother Charles Henry, into the major in Latin and Greek that \n     was usually reserved for the intellectual elite. Brother \n     Stephen did very well and graduated magna cum laude and Phi \n     Beta Kappa.\n       There was more to the scholasticate experience than prayer \n     and study; manual labor and recreational activities provided \n     humanity and balance. In the early 1940s, Brother Abdon Lewis \n     presided over the student tailor shop where Brother Stephen \n     was assigned to the ironing board. Monastic silence was \n     rarely observed and duels were fought, sometimes with words, \n     sometimes with yardsticks. In a student production of \n     Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, Brother Stephen played the cameo \n     role of Cicero opposite Brother Leo Chorman's Cassius. \n     Although always willing to wax eloquent as occasion \n     warranted, Brother Stephen never attained the oratorical \n     eloquence for which the historical Cicero has been known \n     through the ages. Student athletics were also much in vogue \n     in those days, with organized leagues on Thursday afternoons \n     and in the summers, but Brother Stephen, like most of his \n     fellow Latin majors, such as Austin O'Malley, James Kaiser, \n     Joseph Warganz and Luke Salm, never got beyond handball and \n     an occasional try at the free-for-all version of basketball \n     known as horse-O. Leo Chorman was an exception.\n       After four years, the carefree student days, as all good \n     things do, came to an end. In September 1943, Brother Stephen \n     and his classmates set forth to face the challenges of the \n     classroom, extracurricular activities, graduate study and \n     community life. For Brother Stephen, the venue was St. \n     Peter's in Staten Island, where he taught mostly Latin, his \n     major, but also, as needed, algebra, geometry, English, \n     history and French. After school and during summers, he \n     pursued successfully a master's degree in Latin at Manhattan \n     College under the direction of the rigorous and relentless \n     Brother Alban Dooley. In 1948, Brother Stephen was assigned \n     to St. Mary's in Waltham, Massachusetts, as teacher and sub-\n     director of the community. He was, thus, able to be close to \n     his family and at the same time attend courses at Boston \n     College, earning a second M.A., this time in philosophy.\n       With such a strong background in classical languages and \n     philosophy, in 1953 Brother Stephen was sent back to The \n     Catholic University to study for the doctorate in sacred \n     theology, a program only recently made available to the \n     Brothers. In addition to full-time study, the assignment also \n     involved full-time teaching of the classics and theology to \n     the scholastics and, in due time, administrative duties as \n     pro-director and director of studies. One of his signature \n     courses was on God, One and Three, that earned for him the \n     nickname ``God.'' When Brother Cornelius Luke, the Visitor \n     General, heard of it, he was not amused. Writing under the \n     inspired direction of Father Eugene Burke, Brother Stephen \n     successfully defended his thesis on what the Council of Trent \n     had to say about grace and merit, was awarded the STD degree \n     in 1959, and then assigned to Manhattan College.\n       At Manhattan, Brother Stephen was an important addition to \n     the department of theology, still in the process of becoming \n     an academic department with a qualified and professionally \n     active full-time faculty. Brother Stephen regularly attended \n     the meetings of the Catholic Theological Society and the \n     College Theology Society for which he served as treasurer \n     from 1960 to 1970. He authored the article on merit for the \n     New Catholic Encyclopedia and his collection of articles \n     entitled Readings in Sacramental Theology was published by \n     Prentice-Hall. Meanwhile Brother Abdon Lewis was nudging \n     Brother Stephen in the direction of administration, at first \n     having him assist in the dean's office, then urging Brother \n     Gregory to name him academic vice president and later \n     executive vice president and Provost. Thus, Brother Stephen \n     became a hands-down choice to become president of the College \n     when Brother Gregory Nugent resigned in 1975.\n       By that time, the student unrest of the late 1960s had \n     pretty well quieted down, the cooperative program with the \n     College of Mount St. Vincent was well underway, and Manhattan \n     itself had officially gone coed, bringing and ever-increasing \n     number of female students to the campus. In 1978, Brother \n     Stephen presided over the celebration of the College's 125th \n     anniversary that was followed in the next year by the \n     construction of the Draddy Gymnasium. During his presidency, \n     programs for teaching the handicapped were introduced, as \n     well as an M.B.A. program and courses in professional ethics, \n     biotechnology and computer science. In 1979, he was awarded \n     an honorary doctorate of laws by La Salle College in \n     Philadelphia. Determined to keep the Brothers in the \n     forefront, he commissioned Fabian Zaccone to paint a new \n     mural for the reredos in the College chapel, which was \n     renamed the Chapel of De La Salle and his Brothers. He had \n     the same painter do a mural for the president's dining room \n     depicting the successive Brother Presidents and their \n     contributions to the College. For the tercentenary of the \n     Institute in 1980, he sponsored a series of lectures that \n     were then published. In addition, he made arrangements to \n     have the shrine of St. De La Salle in St. Patrick's Cathedral \n     redecorated to include the newly canonized Brothers Miguel \n     and Mutien-Marie.\n       Although Brother Stephen certainly enjoyed being president, \n     not all his record breaking twelve years in that office were \n     full of sweetness and life. There were the inevitable \n     conflicts with administrators and faculty, and some serious \n     problems with a declining enrollment and consequent financial \n     strain. He had always been close to his family and in \n     constant touch with his brother John, a Jesuit priest at \n     Boston College, and Sister Margaret de Sales, who was then \n     principal at Paramus Catholic High School. He felt very \n     deeply the deaths of his mother, his older sister, and that \n     of his brother John. In 1980, Brother Stephen suffered the \n     first of a series of heart attacks that eventually required \n     surgery. After having organized and financed the first \n     session of the Buttimer Institute of Lasallian Studies, it \n     was a disappointment for him when the facilities of the \n     College proved inadequate and the program was moved to \n     California. Eventually it became clear to Brother Stephen \n     that he no longer had the energy to complete his third five-\n     year term. On his retirement from office in 1987, more than \n     600 guests gathered at a banquet in the Draddy Gymnasium to \n     honor his achievement. In that same year, the College of \n     Mount St. Vincent honored him with the honorary doctorate in \n     humane letters.\n       After leaving Manhattan College, Brother Stephen moved to \n     Lincroft, where he took charge of the development office. He \n     initiated an outreach program to the entire\n\n[[Page S14783]]\n\n     Lasallian family, especially relatives of the Brothers and \n     former Brothers, based on the concept of stewardship for the \n     Lasallian tradition. ``Associates in Stewardship'' was a \n     constant theme in his quarterly publication called Lasallian \n     Notes. He took special care to celebrate the lives of the \n     deceased Brothers and to keep in contact with their families, \n     most notably through the annual Memorial Mass. Involved as he \n     was in public relations for the district, Brother Stephen \n     never lost his association with Manhattan College. He rarely \n     missed a formal college event, alumni gathering, funeral or \n     social occasion, traveling from Lincroft by hired limo when \n     he could no longer drive and serving as a kind of informal \n     public relations person for the College. When the strain of \n     his very active retirement proved to be too much for his \n     declining physical resources, he retired reluctantly but \n     gracefully in 2004, at age 83, and took up residence in De La \n     Salle Hall. There, he died peacefully on January 9, 2007.\n\n       --Luke Salm, F.S.C.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/05/senate-section/article/S14783-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO GEORGE TOOKER\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge the lifetime \nwork of the artist George Tooker. Earlier this month, President Bush \npresented him with the National Medal of Arts, our Nation's highest and \nmost prestigious award for artistic excellence.\n  George Tooker, born in New York City, is a resident of Hartland, VT. \nAfter studying English literature at Harvard and then studying painting \nat the Art Students League of New York, he found a world of modern \npossibilities in the medieval and Renaissance medium of egg tempera, \nhelping to begin a revitalization of that technique. The choice of egg \ntempera gave his paintings an archaic and otherworldly feel, creating \nwonderfully rich juxtapositions as Tooker often used contemporary \nsubjects and circumstances as the theme of his work. For instance, many \nof his paintings convey images of modernity and alienation while using \ncolors, surface finishes, and techniques that hearken back to the long \ntradition of art history. But they do more, of course; the reference to \nthat long tradition of culture foregrounds the current manifestations \nof that culture, which George Tooker addresses as his subject.\n  Although some have seen elements of fantasy in his paintings, George \nTooker has been explicit; he seeks not an escape into a dream world \nbut, rather, the creation of a new approach to realism. ``I am after \npainting reality impressed on the mind so hard that it returns as a \ndream, but I am not after painting dreams as such, or fantasy,'' he \nonce said.\n  His haunting works often highlight the increased social isolation \nthat has accompanied the pressures of modernization on everyday life. \nHe deals with society and its very real consequences; although many of \nhis paintings retain a magical and stylized feel, at their heart are \nimages that have the capacity to reveal and reflect many of the deepest \nfeelings each viewer of Tooker's work encounters in his or her own life \nin the contemporary world.\n  I commend Mr. George Tooker for his important contributions to \nAmerican art and congratulate him on receiving the National Medal of \nArts. We in Vermont are proud of his accomplishment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/05/senate-section/article/S14783-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING MAINE MACHINE PRODUCTS COMPANY\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, with tremendous enthusiasm, I \nrecognize Maine Machine Products Company, a phenomenal small business \nfrom my home State of Maine that manufactures products for various hi-\ntech industries. Because of its hard work and dedication to leading its \nfield, Maine Machine Products was recognized with the Maine Development \nFoundation's Champion of Economic Development Award at the Foundation's \nannual meeting on October 5, 2007. Headquartered in South Paris, Maine \nMachine Products has a history replete with innovation and success, and \nis a company highly deserving of such an aptly titled award.\n  Founded in 1956 by Roland Sutton, Maine Machine Products is a custom \nprecision manufacturer of components and assemblies whose products are \nsent to global high-technology markets including those serving the \ndefense and aerospace, telecom and fiber optic, and semiconductor \nmarkets. Located in a temperature-controlled 75,000-square-foot \nbuilding in western Maine, Maine Machine Products employs roughly 150 \nhighly skilled workers who consistently produce products of the finest \nquality for these vital industries. Always seeking to be on the cutting \nedge of technology, Maine Machine Products earlier this year began \nworking with the Mazak Integrex e-Series, which is the most advanced \nmultitasking machine in custom precision manufacturing. The machine \nallows the company to complete all operations, such as turning, boring, \nand drilling, in a single setup, increasing productivity and \nefficiency. Additionally, the firm has upgraded its Clean Room, where \nit tests and finishes semiconductor equipment, by expanding it and \nmaking other improvements.\n  More than merely adding to its existing infrastructure, Maine Machine \nProducts has made significant contributions to both its employees and \nthe western Maine community. Two programs, in particular, demonstrate \nthe attention that the company pays to its workers and aspiring \nmanufacturing personnel. First, Maine Machine Products makes use of the \nmachine operators skills training grant, MOST, program, that assists \nfirms with the training of their computer numerical control, or CNC, \noperators. In addition, the program attempts to fill open CNC positions \nwith nontraditional workers by training individuals and matching them \nwith employers. In MOST's inaugural season, 52 incumbent Maine Machine \nProducts employees received training through the program, and the \ncompany hired 6 new employees who participated.\n  Through a second program, Maine Machine Products gives scholarships \nto students who are enrolled in the Machine Tool Program at Central \nMaine Community College based in Auburn. Since its inception in 1974, \nMaine Machine Products' scholarship program has sponsored 47 \nscholarships.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nrequire physician utilization of the Medicare electronic prescription \ndrug program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, seven thousand Americans die every year \nbecause of preventable adverse drug events. Tens of thousands of more \nare injured. Meanwhile, of the three billion prescriptions that are \nwritten each year, doctors report that nearly one billion of them \nrequired a followup for clarity, costing our health care system \nbillions of dollars a year. That is why I am pleased to join my \ncolleagues Senator Ensign, Senator Stabenow and Senator Martinez to \nintroduce critical legislation to help bring our health care system \ninto the 21st century through electronic prescribing, e-prescribing, of \nmedications in the Medicare program.\n  The benefits of e-prescribing are clear and compelling. When a doctor \n``writes'' an electronic prescription, a computer or handheld device \nwarns of potentially dangerous interactions or allergies or informs a \nphysician whether a particular drug is covered by a patient's \ninsurance. It also tells the physician whether a chemically identical \ngeneric alternative is available at a fraction of the price. The path \nto a more modern, accountable health care system starts with health \ninformation technology. The path to robust health information \ntechnology starts with e-prescribing.\n  This legislation would provide permanent funding for physician \npayment bonuses in Medicare to help offset the costs of acquiring e-\nprescribing systems and to incentivize the use of the\n\n[[Page S14789]]\n\ntechnology. The bill would also require all physicians in Medicare to \nuse e-prescribing starting in 2011--1 year later than the Institute of \nMedicine recommended in their recent study. We have talked long enough \nabout using technology to stem perpetually rising health care costs and \npoor quality, and our legislation takes an important step to do \nsomething about it.\n  I want to give particular credit to Mark Merritt and his team at \nPharmaceutical Care Management Association, PCMA, for their hard work \nand leadership. PCMA is responsible for a seminal study in this field, \nwhich showed for the first time that broader adoption of e-prescribing \nwill not only save lives, but will also save billions of dollars for \npatients, payers and taxpayers alike. Perhaps most importantly, PCMA \ncreated a strong and diverse coalition of health care stakeholders to \nadvocate for this legislation, including business, labor, consumer \nadvocates, physicians, health plans, pharmacists, and drug \nmanufacturers. The PCMA-led coalition has worked diligently on Capitol \nHill in support of this important issue. They have educated Congress on \ne-prescribing and are helping to make sure that we get the policy \nright.\n  The Medicare E-MEDS Act gets it right. The standards and \ninteroperability for e-prescribing are in place; the technology is \naffordable; and, most importantly, the dramatic benefits for patients \nand health care purchasers--especially the Federal Government--are \noverwhelmingly clear. This bill is a solid step towards addressing \nthese important issues in the delivery of our Nation's health care. It \nis time that Congress act to save lives and increase efficiency in \nAmerica's health care system.\n  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to the \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2408\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Electronic \n     Medication and Safety Protection (E-MEDS) Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Patient safety is an important issue and a priority \n     among patients, providers, insurers, businesses, and \n     government entities alike.\n       (2) Adverse drug events are defined by the Institute of \n     Medicine as ``any injury due to medication''.\n       (3) According to the Institute of Medicine, more then 1.5 \n     million preventable adverse drug events occur every year in \n     the United States.\n       (4) Studies indicate that at least 530,000 preventable \n     adverse drug events occur each year among the Medicare \n     population, and cost the Federal Government upwards of \n     $887,000,000, or $1,983 per person.\n       (5) Electronic prescription drug programs, or e-\n     prescribing, provide for the electronic transmittal of \n     prescription information from the prescribing health care \n     provider to the dispensing pharmacy and pharmacist.\n       (6) Electronic prescribing provides formulary and coverage \n     information before a prescription is written to better inform \n     the patient and prescriber of lower cost options, including \n     generics.\n       (7) E-prescribing can help to eliminate medical errors, \n     injuries, hospitalizations, and even death that can result \n     from illegible prescriptions and bad drug interactions, in \n     addition to reducing patient medication non-adherence.\n       (8) The Institute of Medicine recommends that all \n     physicians create a plan to implement and use e-prescribing \n     technology by 2010.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to require the establishment of a credit card safety \nstar rating system for the benefit of consumers, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, And Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, credit card debt is hitting American \nfamilies like a wrecking ball, with our families already being hammered \nby skyrocketing fuel prices and the subprime mortgage mess. We have \nseen credit card debt go up almost 25 percent in the last 3 years. I \nhave brought to the floor a typical credit card agreement\n\n[[Page S14790]]\n\nthat millions of our citizens enter into. It is 44 pages long. You \ncan't see it from the chair, but it goes on and on and on with small \nprint. It is very obvious to me that buried in all of this legalese, \nburied in all of this technical jargon, is a variety of sneaky terms \nthat end up hurting consumers because it is not possible to understand \nwhat is in much of the key provisions of these agreements. For example, \nwe understand folks in New Jersey, Oregon, or anywhere else pay a lot \nof attention to the interest rate provision. They pay a lot of \nattention to the annual fee provision. But they don't notice a lot of \nthe little disclosures that end up hidden in the legalese that can end \nup making the real cost of credit significantly higher.\n  Last week, I met with students across the State of Oregon. A lot of \nthem, with the financial aid cutbacks, are now walking on an economic \ntightrope. They balance their food bills against their fuel bills and \ntheir fuel bills against their housing costs. They are on an economic \ntightrope. They are getting buried in credit card debt. Very often they \nfind, for example, that if they have a credit card, and they are late \non another payment with someone else, their credit card interest rate \nends up going up as a result. There may be a small provision in their \nexisting credit card agreement that allows it, but nobody, for the most \npart, knows about it.\n\n  Students would say their interest rates would double almost overnight \nwith virtually no notice. They would not be given any clear \ncommunication about what is going on. They would just find their costs \nwould arbitrarily skyrocket, and they would again be unable to pay \ntheir bills.\n  Now, I recognize in a free society folks have a constitutional right \nto be foolish, to rack up charges that would not be wise, but they can \ndo so anyway in a free society. I do not think most people will do \nthat, certainly not the students I met with in Oregon last week, if it \nis possible to understand the terms of these credit cards in \nstraightforward, plain and simple English rather than see the key \nprovisions buried in all kinds of legalese that you would have to be a \nwizard to sort out.\n  So I am proposing today, with the support of our colleague, Senator \nObama from Illinois, that the Federal Reserve, which has great \nexpertise in this area, set up a safety rating system for credit \ncards--not one that evaluates credit card companies on provisions that \nare appropriately evaluated in the marketplace, but on safety matters--\nfor example, whether a credit card company gives the consumer adequate \nnotice before they change terms; whether, for example, they highlight \nthe key kinds of changes rather than bury them in the small print.\n  I think the Federal Reserve, with the technical expertise they have \nand the independent judgment they bring to these financial questions, \nis the ideal place to develop and operate a safety rating system. Such \na system has worked quite well for new cars. When you have a rating \nsystem for cars, people can understand how they would be protected in a \ncrash. The legislation I am offering will tell people whether credit \ncard companies are treating them fairly and disclosing the key \nprovisions so that a free market can work.\n  So under the rating system I propose today with Senator Obama, it \nwould be required for credit card companies to put on the card itself, \nput on the various promotional materials they are using, stars which, \nin effect, would be granted on the basis of the Federal Reserve's \nindependent judgment as to whether the key safety criteria are being \nmet.\n  I am very hopeful that at a time when our citizens are being pounded \nby powerful economic forces, particularly in the energy and housing \nfield, there could at least be bipartisan agreement that the Senate \ncould support transparency, disclosure, changes in the credit card \nbusiness, so our consumers--and millions are using these credit cards \nduring this holiday season--can understand the agreements they are \ngetting into.\n  The students I met with last week are taking steps now to better \npolice what is going on in the credit card field. On several campuses \nin Oregon, they have moved the credit card companies off campus. Yet \nthe credit card companies continue to flood the students with \npromotional material.\n  I was told, for example, about one program where students were \nbrought into a room where money was essentially floating in the air, \nwhere it was as if you would be going to a financial paradise if you \njust signed up for one of these credit card agreements.\n  I am not proposing heavy-handed regulation. I am not proposing one-\nsize-fits-all government. I am proposing that an agency with the \nexpertise to make sure there is disclosure, that the forms and \nagreements are printed in simple English--that that kind of information \nbe rewarded in the marketplace. If companies are not willing to do it, \nthe American people could find that out as well.\n  That is the kind of simple, straightforward approach--with \ndisclosure, transparency, in simple English--that makes sense for the \ndigital age. With the Federal Reserve completing that first safety \nrating, all Americans could get that kind of information quickly and \nconveniently. That is what is in the interest of the American people \nwith respect to this credit card debt issue at a critical time.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the legislation I introduce today \nwith Senator Obama.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Obama, Mr. Durbin, \n        Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Biden, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 2412. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reform \nthe system of public financing for Presidential elections, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I will reintroduce a bill to \nrepair and strengthen the presidential public financing system. \nBipartisan support is a key element of successful campaign finance \nreform efforts, and I am therefore delighted that the junior Senator \nfrom Maine, Sen. Collins, has agreed to be the principal cosponsor of \nthe bill.\n  The Presidential Funding Act of 2007 will ensure that this system \nwill continue to fulfill its promise in the 21st century. The bill will \ntake effect in January 2009, so it will first apply in the 2012 \npresidential election.\n  The presidential public financing system was put into place in the \nwake of the Watergate scandals as part of the Federal Election Campaign \nAct of 1974. It was held to be constitutional by the Supreme Court in \nBuckley v. Valeo. The system, of course, is voluntary, as the Supreme \nCourt required in Buckley. Every major party nominee for President \nsince 1976 has participated in the system for the general election and, \nprior to 2000, every major party nominee had participated in the system \nfor the primary election as well.\n  In the 2004 election, President Bush and two Democratic candidates, \nHoward Dean and the eventual nominee John Kerry, opted out of the \nsystem for the presidential primaries. President Bush and Senator Kerry \nelected to take the taxpayer-funded grant in the general election. \nPresident Bush also opted out of the system for the Republican \nprimaries in 2000 but accepted the general election grant. Several of \nthe leading candidates for President in the 2008 election are not \nparticipating in the primary system, and it remains to be seen whether \neither major party candidate will accept public funds in the general \nelection.\n  It is unfortunate that the matching funds system for the primaries \nhas become less practicable. The system protects the integrity of the \nelectoral process by allowing candidates to run viable campaigns \nwithout becoming overly dependent on private donors. The system has \nworked well in the past, and it is worth repairing so that it can work \nin the future. If we don't repair it, the pressures on candidates to \nopt out will increase until the system collapses from disuse.\n  This bill makes changes to both the primary and general election \npublic financing system to address the weaknesses and problems that \nhave been identified by participants in the system, experts on the \npresidential election financing process, and an electorate that is \nincreasingly dismayed by the influence of money in politics. First and \nmost important, it eliminates the state-by-state primary spending \nlimits in the current law and substantially increases the overall \nprimary spending limit from the current\n\n[[Page S14791]]\n\nlimit of approximately $45 million to $150 million, of which up to $100 \nmillion can be spent before April 1 of the election year. This should \nmake the system much more viable for serious candidates facing \nopponents who are capable of raising significant sums outside the \nsystem. The bill also makes available substantially more public money \nfor participating candidates by increasing the match of small \ncontributions from 1:1 to 4:1.\n  One very important provision of this bill ties the primary and \ngeneral election systems together and requires candidates to make a \nsingle decision on whether to participate. Candidates who opt out of \nthe primary system and decide to rely solely on private money cannot \nreturn to the system for the general election. Candidates must commit \nto participate in the system in the general election if they want to \nreceive Federal matching funds in the primaries. The bill also \nincreases the spending limits for participating candidates in the \nprimaries who face a nonparticipating opponent if that opponent raises \nmore than 20 percent more than the spending limit. This provides some \nprotection against being far outspent by a nonparticipating opponent. \nAdditional grants of public money are also available to participating \ncandidates who face a nonparticipating candidate spending substantially \nmore than the spending limit.\n  The bill also sets the general election spending limit at $100 \nmillion, indexed for inflation. If a general election candidate does \nnot participate in the system and spends more than 20 percent more than \nthe combined primary and general election spending limits, a \nparticipating opposing candidate will receive a grant equal to twice \nthe general election spending limit.\n  This bill also addresses what some have called the ``gap'' between \nthe primary and general election seasons. Presumptive presidential \nnominees have emerged earlier in the election year over the life of the \npublic financing system. This has led to some nominees being \nessentially out of money between the time that they nail down the \nnomination and the convention where they are formally nominated and \nbecome eligible for the general election grant. For a few cycles, soft \nmoney raised by the parties filled in that gap, but the Bipartisan \nCampaign Reform Act of 2002 fortunately has now closed that loophole. \nThis bill allows candidates who are still in the primary race as of \nApril 1 to spend an additional $50 million until funds for the general \nelection are made available. In addition, the bill allows the political \nparties to spend up to $25 million between April 1 and the date that a \ncandidate is nominated and an additional $25 million after the \nnomination. The total amount of $50 million is over three times the \namount allowed under current law. This should allow the ``gap'' to be \nmore than adequately filled.\n  Obviously, these changes make this a more generous system. So the \nbill also makes the requirement for qualifying more difficult. To be \neligible for matching funds, a candidate must raise $25,000 in \nmatchable contributions--up to $200 for each donor--in at least 20 \nStates. That is five times the threshold under current law.\n  The bill also makes a number of changes in the system to reflect the \nchanges in our presidential races over the past several decades. For \none thing, it makes matching funds available starting 6 months before \nthe date of the first primary or caucus, that's approximately 6 months \nearlier than is currently the case. For another, it sets a single date \nfor release of the public grants for the general election--the Friday \nbefore Labor Day. This addresses an inequity in the current system, \nunder which the general election grants are released after each \nnominating convention, which can be several weeks apart.\n  The bill also prohibits Federal elected officials and candidates from \nsoliciting soft money for use in funding the party conventions and \nrequires presidential candidates to disclose bundled contributions. The \nbundling provision builds on a provision contained in ethics and \nlobbying reform bill enacted earlier this year. It requires \npresidential candidates to disclose all bundlers of $50,000 or more.\n  The purpose of this bill is to improve the campaign finance system, \nnot to advance one party's interests. In fact, this is an excellent \ntime to make changes in the Presidential public funding system. The \n2008 presidential campaign, which is already underway, will undoubtedly \nbe the most expensive in history. A number of candidates from both \nparties have opted out of the primary matching funds system, and some \nexperts predict that one or both major party nominees will even refuse \npublic grants for the general election period. It is too late to make \nthe changes needed to repair the system for the 2008 election. But if \nwe act now, we can make sure that an updated and revised system is in \nplace for the 2012 election. If we act now, I am certain that the 2008 \ncampaign cycle will confirm our foresight. If we do nothing, 2008 will \ncontinue and accelerate the slide of the current system into \nirrelevancy.\n  Fixing the presidential public financing system will cost money, but \nour best calculations at the present time indicate that the changes to \nthe system in this bill can be paid for by raising the income tax \ncheck-off on an individual return from $3 to just $10. The total cost \nof the changes to the system, based on data from the 2004 elections, is \nprojected to be around $365 million over the 4-year election cycle. To \noffset that increased cost, this bill first amends the Energy Policy \nAct of 2005 to allow the Bureau of Land Management to implement new \nuser fees for processing oil and gas permits. It also amends the \nGeothermal Steam Act of 1970 to increase the yearly maintenance fee and \none-time location fee for holders of more than 10 mining claims on \nfederal land to $150 and $50 per claim, respectively, and imposes a 4 \npercent royalty on the gross income from mining on existing claims. \nFinally, it amends the Public Rangelands Improvement Act of 1978 to use \na state's fee formula to establish the grazing fees for federal land in \nthat state.\n  Though the numbers are large, this is actually a very small \ninvestment to make to protect our democracy and preserve the integrity \nof our presidential elections. The American people do not want to see a \nreturn to the pre-Watergate days of unlimited spending on presidential \nelections and candidates entirely beholden to private donors. We must \nact to ensure the fairness of our elections and the confidence of our \ncitizens in the process by repairing the cornerstone of the Watergate \nreforms.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na section-by-section analysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2412\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       Except as otherwise provided in this Act, the amendments \n     made by this Act shall apply with respect to elections \n     occurring after January 1, 2009.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n\n                         Section 1: Short Title\n\n    Section 2: Revisions to System of Presidential Primary Matching \n                                Payments\n\n       (a) Matching Funds: Current law provides for a 1-to-1 \n     match, where up to $250 of each individual's contributions \n     for the primaries is matched with $250 in public funds. Under \n     the new matching system, individual contributions of up to \n     $200 from each individual will be matched at a 4-to-1 ratio, \n     so $200 in individual contribution can be matched with $800 \n     from public funds.\n       Candidates who remain in the primary race can also receive \n     an additional 1-to-1 match of up to $200 of contributions \n     received after March 31 of a presidential election year. This \n     additional match applies both to an initial contribution made \n     after March 31 and to contributions from individuals who \n     already gave $200 or more prior to April 1.\n       The bill defines ``contribution'' as ``a gift of money made \n     by a written instrument which identifies the person making \n     the contribution by full name and mailing address.''\n       (b) Eligibility for matching funds: Current law requires \n     candidates to raise $5,000 in matchable contributions \n     (currently $250 or less) in 20 states. To be eligible for \n     matching funds under this bill, a candidate must raise \n     $25,000 of matchable contributions (up to $200 per individual \n     donor) in at least 20 states.\n       In addition, to receive matching funds in the primary, \n     candidates must pledge to apply for public money in the \n     general election if nominated and to not exceed the general \n     election spending limits.\n       (c) Timing of payments: Current law makes matching funds \n     available on January 1 of a presidential election year. The--\n     bill makes such funds available six months prior to the first \n     state caucus or primary.\n\n\n    Section 3: Requiring Participation in Primary Payment System as \n        Condition of Eligibility for General Elections Payments\n\n       Currently, candidates can participate in either the primary \n     or the general election public financing system, or both. \n     Under the bill, a candidate must participate in the primary \n     matching system in order to be eligible to receive public \n     funds in the general election.\n\n\n               Section 4: Revisions to Expenditure Limits\n\n       (a) Spending limits for candidates: In 2004, under current \n     law, candidates participating in the public funding system \n     had to abide by a primary election spending limit of about \n     $45 million and a general election spending limit of about \n     $75 million (all of which was public money). The bill sets \n     a total primary spending ceiling for participating \n     candidates in 2008 of $150 million, of which only $100 \n     million can be spent before April 1. State by state \n     spending limits are eliminated. The general election \n     limit, which the major party candidates will receive in \n     public funds, will be $100 million.\n       (b) Spending limit for parties: Current law provides a \n     single coordinated spending limit for national party \n     committees based on population. In 2004 that limit was about \n     $15 million. The bill provides two limits of $25 million. The \n     first applies after April 1 until a candidate is nominated. \n     The second limit kicks in after the nomination. Any part of \n     the limit not spent before the nomination can be spent after. \n     In addition, the party coordinated spending limit is \n     eliminated entirely until the general election public funds \n     are released if there is an active candidate from the \n     opposing party who has exceeded the primary spending limits \n     by more than 20%.\n       This will allow the party to support the presumptive \n     nominee during the so-called ``gap'' between the end of the \n     primaries and the conventions. The entire cost of a \n     coordinated party communication is subject to the limit if \n     any portion of that communication has to do with the \n     presidential election.\n       (c) Inflation adjustment: Party and candidate spending \n     limits will be indexed for inflation, with 2008 as the base \n     year.\n       (d) Fundraising expenses: Under the bill, all the costs of \n     fundraising by candidates are subject to their spending \n     limits.\n\n\n Section 5: Additional Payments and Increased Expenditures Limits for \n     Candidates Participating in Public Financing Who Face Certain \n                       Nonparticipating Opponents\n\n       (a) Primary candidates: When a participating candidate is \n     opposed in a primary by a nonparticipating candidate who \n     spends more than 120 percent of the primary spending limit \n     ($100 million prior to April 1 and $150 million after April \n     1), the participating candidate will receive a 5-to-1 match, \n     instead of a 4-to-l match for contributions of less than $200 \n     per donor. That additional match applies to all contributions \n     received by the participating candidate both before and after \n     the nonparticipating candidate crosses the 120 percent \n     threshold. In addition, the participating candidate's primary \n     spending limit is raised by $50 million when a \n     nonparticipating candidate spends more than the 120 percent \n     of either the $100 million (before April 1) or $150 million \n     (after April 1) limit. The limit is raised by another $50 \n     million if the nonparticipating candidate spends more than \n     120 percent of the increased limit. Thus, the maximum \n     spending limit in the primary would be $250 million if an \n     opposing candidate has spent more than $240 million.\n       (b) General election candidates: When a participating \n     candidate is opposed in a general election by a \n     nonparticipating candidate who spends more than 120 percent \n     of the combined primary and general election spending limits, \n     the participating candidate shall receive an additional \n     grant of public money equal to the amount provided for \n     that election--$100 million in 2008. Minor party \n     candidates are also eligible for an additional grant equal \n     to the amount they otherwise receive (which is based on \n     the performance of that party in the previous presidential \n     election).\n       (c) Reporting and Certification: In order to provide for \n     timely determination of a participating candidate's \n     eligibility for increased spending limits, matching funds, \n     and/or general election grants, non-participating candidates \n     must notify the FEC within 24 hours after receiving \n     contributions or making expenditures of greater than the \n     applicable 120 percent threshold. Within 24 hours of \n     receiving such a notice, the FEC will inform candidates \n     participating in the system of their increased expenditure \n     limits and will certify to the Secretary of the Treasury that \n     participating candidates are eligible to receive additional \n     payments.\n\n\n Section 6: Establishment of Uniform Date for Release of Payments from \n      Presidential Elections Campaign Funds to Eligible Candidates\n\n       Under current law, candidates participating in the system \n     for the general election receive their grants of public money \n     immediately after receiving the nomination of their party, \n     meaning that the two major parties receive their grants on \n     different dates. Under the bill, all candidates eligible to \n     receive public money in the general election would receive \n     that money on the Friday before Labor Day, unless a \n     candidate's formal nomination occurs later.\n\n\n     Section 7: Revisions to Designation of Income Tax Payments by \n                          Individual Taxpayers\n\n       The tax check-off is increased from $3 (individual) and $6 \n     (couple) to $10 and $20. The amount will be adjusted for \n     inflation, and rounded to the nearest dollar, beginning in \n     2009.\n       The IRS shall require by regulation that electronic tax \n     preparation software does not automatically accept or decline \n     the tax checkoff. The FEC is required to inform and educate \n     the public about the purpose of the Presidential Election \n     Campaign Fund (``PECF'') and how to make a contribution. \n     Funding for this program of up to $10 million in a four year \n     presidential election cycle, will come from the PECF.\n\n\n       Section 8: Amounts in Presidential Election Campaign Fund\n\n       Under current law, in January of an election year if the \n     Treasury Department determines that there are insufficient \n     funds in the PECF to make the required payments to \n     participating primary candidates, the party conventions, and \n     the general election candidates, it must reduce the payments \n     available to participating primary candidates and it cannot \n     make up the shortfall from any other source until those funds \n     come in. Under the bill, in making that determination the \n     Department can include an estimate of the amount that will be \n     received by the PECF during that election year, but the \n     estimate cannot exceed the past three years' average \n     contribution to the fund. This will allow primary candidates \n     to receive their full payments as long as a reasonable \n     estimate of the funds that will come into the PECF that year \n     will cover the general election candidate payments. The bill \n     allows the Secretary of the Treasury to borrow the funds \n     necessary to carry out the purposes of the fund during the \n     first campaign cycle in which the bill is in effect.\n\n\n             SECTION 9: REGULATION OF CONVENTION FINANCING\n\n       Federal candidates and officeholders are prohibited from \n     raising or spending soft money in connection with a \n     nominating convention of any political party, including funds \n     for a host committee, civic committee, or municipality.\n\n\n            SECTION 10: DISCLOSURE OF BUNDLED CONTRIBUTIONS\n\n       This section builds on the bundling disclosure provision of \n     the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 \n     (``HLOGA'') to require presidential campaigns to disclose\n\n[[Page S14797]]\n\n     the name, address, and employer of all individuals or groups \n     that bundle contributions totaling more than $50,000 in the \n     four year election cycle. Individuals who are registered \n     lobbyists would have to be separately identified. HLOGA's \n     definition of bundling would apply to bundling disclosure by \n     the presidential candidates, and no change is made to the \n     requirements of HLOGA with respect to congressional \n     campaigns.\n\n\n     SECTION 11: REPEAL OF PRIORITY IN USE OF FUNDS FOR POLITICAL \n                              CONVENTIONS\n\n       Current law gives the political parties priority on \n     receiving the funds they are entitled to from the PECF. This \n     means that parties get money for their conventions even if \n     adequate funds are not available for participating \n     candidates. This section would make funds available for the \n     conventions only if all participating candidates have \n     received the funds to which they are entitled.\n\n\n                           SECTION 12: OFFSET\n\n       This section provides an offset for the increased cost of \n     the presidential public funding system. The total increased \n     cost is estimated to be $365 million over four years. The \n     bill (1) authorizes the Bureau of Land Management to \n     implement new user fees for processing oil and gas permits; \n     (2) increases the yearly maintenance fee and one-time \n     location fee for holders of more than 10 mining claims on \n     federal land to $150 and $50 per claim, respectively, and \n     imposes a 4% royalty on the gross income from mining on \n     existing claims; and (3) uses state formulas to set federal \n     grazing fees.\n\n\n                       SECTION 13: EFFECTIVE DATE\n\n       Provides that the amendments will apply to presidential \n     elections occurring after January 1, 2009.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President. I rise to join my friend from Wisconsin, \nSenator Feingold, in introducing the Presidential Funding Act of 2007.\n  It was 100 years ago that the reformer President Theodore Roosevelt \nproposed ``a very radical measure'' in his State of the Union message \nto Congress. He envisioned a system of campaign financing that would \ninclude a congressional appropriation to support national campaigns so \nthat, as he said, ``The need for collecting large campaign funds would \nvanish.''\n  When the campaign financing reforms of the 1970s were enacted, it was \nhoped that we would draw closer to achieving Theodore Roosevelt's goal \nof funding the pursuit of our highest public office largely from public \nrather than private funds.\n  Our Presidential-campaign finance system still suffers from serious \ndefects, however, and current events are dramatically highlighting the \nneed for continued reform and improvement.\n  The current Presidential campaign is already shaping up as the most \nexpensive election in history by far. Candidate after candidate has \nchosen to forego public funds due to fundamental flaws in the system. \nFund-raising tallies have already shattered records. If a candidate \ndecides to seek public funding, he or she risks running out of funds to \ncounter candidates who can attract large amounts of private \ncontributions.\n  Current estimates are that the 2008 contest for the Presidency of the \nU.S. will cost more than $1 billion. Much of that cost will be incurred \nin delivering messages to the electorate through advertising and \npublications of all sorts.\n  One billion dollars is a huge sum. Yet we cannot expect modern \ncampaigns to be run on budgets that might have sufficed for William \nMcKinley, whose successful 1896 campaign relied heavily on speeches \nfrom his front porch in Canton, Ohio, to admirers who came by train to \nhear him. This idyllic but limited approach to campaigning is long \ngone.\n  Unless we wish to return to the cronyism, influence peddling, and \nrestricted suffrage of the 19th century, large expenditures on \nbroadcasting and other media are essential for any campaign that hopes \nto prevail. That financial fact obliges candidates to spend a great \ndeal of time appearing at exclusive, big-ticket fundraisers.\n  To allow candidates to spend less time raising money, Congress \nestablished a system of public funding for Presidential campaigns that \nstarted with the 1976 Presidential election. That system has not been \nsubstantially changed since 1984, and its limitations have only become \nmore evident with time.\n  The central problem is that the system does not provide enough public \nfunds to permit a credible contest against well-bankrolled candidates \nwho have opted out of the public-financing system.\n  In November 2003, Governor Dean announced that he would opt out of \npublic financing, saying ``floods of special-interest money have forced \nus to abandon a broken system.'' Senator Kerry also felt obliged to opt \nout so that he could lend his campaign $6 million rather than be \nrestricted to the use of $50,000 in personal funds.\n  Citing Senator Dole's campaign in 1996, Senator McCain's campaign in \n2000, and Senator Edwards's campaign in 2004, the League of Women \nVoters has spoken of the public system's ``devil's bargain'' for \ncandidates: ``To get matching funds, they have to accept a spending \nlimit that will leave them bankrupt if the contest continues into \nMarch. . . . With the underdogs boxed in by the limits, the \nfrontrunners, and others who can afford it, have additional incentive \nto opt out.''\n\n  The bill we introduce today would make a number of important changes.\n  The key provisions of the Presidential Funding Act of 2007 would \nincrease the public match for primary-season contributions, make funds \navailable earlier in the contest, tie the availability of public \nfunding during the general-election campaign to a candidate's using it \nduring the primary season, provide additional funds if a non-publicly \nfunded opponent spends heavily, and update spending limits to more \nrealistic levels.\n  All of these steps represent sensible and useful improvements in the \ncampaign-finance system.\n  I recognize that some of our colleagues and some members of the \npublic are wary of taxpayer-supported funding for Presidential \ncandidates. I can only respond that the alternative--a complete \nreliance on private contributions--is worse.\n  I would also reassure doubters that this bill is no giveaway or an \ninducement to fringe candidates of narrow appeal. Its provisions are \npredicated upon matches for individual contributions, not absolute \ngrants, and it requires achieving significant levels of individual \ncontributions in at least 20 States.\n  We all understand that the current system of public funding for \ncampaigns has defects. The growing inclination of candidates to opt out \nof the system underscores that fact. The Presidential Funding Act of \n2007 would cure some serious problems and help restore the appeal of \npublic funding.\n  If enacted, this bill would take effect in January 2009. By moving \ntoward virtually full realization of Theodore Roosevelt's ``very \nradical measure,'' we can take a big step toward making the financing, \nthe conduct, and the outcome of the 2012 presidential campaign a \ngenuine source of pride for American citizens of all political \naffiliations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 2413. A bill to provide death and disability benefits for aerial \nfirefighters who work on a contract basis for a public agency and \nsuffer death or disability in the line of duty, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the 2007 fire season was one of the worst in \nrecent history. Millions of acres burned across America. The fires \ndestroyed homes, and their damage is estimated in the hundreds of \nmillions of dollars. These fires would have been worse, if not for the \nskill and bravery of the aerial firefighters who risked their lives to \nfight them.\n  Aerial firefighters take on the dangerous tasks of maneuvering aerial \nvehicles in and out of fire zones. Each time they step in a plane, \ntheir life is at risk. Unfortunately, while we expect aerial \nfirefighters to risk their lives to help control fires, we refuse to \nprovide their families with the knowledge that they will be made \nfinancially whole if their husband or wife dies in the line of duty.\n  This is because aerial firefighters do not qualify for death benefits \nunder the Public Safety Officers' Benefit, PSOB, program, which \nprovides financial and educational benefits to individuals serving a \npublic safety agency in an official capacity, on a paid or volunteer \nbasis. Currently, those receiving benefits include, but are not limited \nto, law enforcement officers, firefighters, emergency medical \ntechnicians, ambulance crew members, and corrections officers.\n  Senator Feinstein and I say that these pilots do the same work and \ntake on the same risks as other public safety officers. They should get \nthe same\n\n[[Page S14798]]\n\nbenefits. That is the reason that we have introduced the Aerial \nFirefighter Relief Act of 2007. This important legislation will remedy \nthis problem and makes aerial firefighters eligible for death benefits.\n  The Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Assistance, BJA, the \nagency that administers the PSOB, has ruled that aerial pilots are \nineligible because they are contractors and not employed directly by \nthe federal and state agencies involved in wildland fire management and \nsuppression. The 1980 official finding that prohibits the pilots and \ntheir families from receiving benefits states that pilots are not ``a \n`public safety officer' as this term is defined in the PSOB ACT because \n[they are] not serving a public agency in an official capacity . . . as \na fireman.''\n  Unfortunately, pilots also often do not receive benefits from their \nemployers. Federal agencies outsource air tanker missions to the \nlowest-cost private operators who do not provide benefits to keep their \ncosts down. Some companies do offer a minimal amount of life insurance. \nHowever, it is expensive, both for the pilot and the contractor. In the \n``low cost'' competitive bid situation they are in, the contractors \ncannot afford to add more expenses to the payroll or they reduce their \nchances of winning a fire suppression contract--and go out of business. \nOther forms of life insurance are also difficult to obtain because of \nthe dangerous nature of aerial firefighting.\n  It is common sense legislation that deserves the support of my \ncolleagues, and I am pleased to have Senator Feinstein as an original \ncosponsor. In the coming months, I look forward to working with the \nappropriate committees to move this legislation forward so that our \nbrave aerial firefighters can take to the skies knowing that their \nfamilies will be taken care of if they pass away taking care of our \ncountry.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to cosponsor \nSenator Enzi's Aerial Firefighter Relief Act of 2007.\n  On August 27, 2001, a California pilot named Larry Groff took off \nfrom Ukiah in State Air Tanker 87, doing what he loved, flying and \nfighting fires.\n  Like thousands of contract firefighters hired by the Government, he \nfigured that if anything ever happened to him, his family would be \ntaken care of. But that day, while maneuvering above a north coast fire \nstarted by a couple of Hells Angels who had blown up their \nmethamphetamine lab, Larry Groff died in a midair collision.\n  Faced with the prospect of raising their 6 children alone, his widow, \nChristine Wells-Groff, filed a claim under the Public Safety Officers' \nBenefit Program. This PSOB Program provides a lump-sum payoff to \nsurvivors of any ``public safety officer,'' a term which can include \nnot only actual government employees but also any volunteer or any \nperson acting in a ``similar relationship of performing services as \npart of a public agency.''\n  At the time of his death, Larry Groff had been flying a State-\noperated air tanker. He was wearing a California Department of Forestry \nuniform. And after his death, the California agency for which he had \nworked issued an opinion stating that he was an officially recognized \nmember of that agency. But he was also a contract employee.\n  Because of that, Ms. Wells-Groff's PSOB claim was initially denied by \nthe Bureau of Justice Affairs, based on its opinion that contract \nemployees cannot qualify for PSOB benefits. Ms. Wells-Groff then \nappealed, and she later convinced a trial court that despite being a \ncontract employee, her husband had held a ``similar relationship of \nperforming services as part of a public agency,'' thereby qualifying \nhim as a ``public safety officer'' entitled to PSOB benefits.\n  Unfortunately, on July 3, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal \nCircuit reversed that decision. The appellate court agreed that Mr. \nGroff's facts might fall within the applicable regulation's key \ndefinition of a ``similar relationship'' but it said that the question \nof whether he had met this standard was not entirely clear and that it \nwould defer to the Government's narrow interpretation of that language, \nabsent further clarification from Congress.\n  Following this decision, Ms. Wells-Groff petitioned the Supreme Court \nto take her case. However, it is unclear if the Court will hear the \ncase, let alone decide in her favor. So today, I want to go on record \nto support the policy that these contract employees should be entitled \nto the same PSOB benefits as other injured firefighters and volunteers.\n  The bill that Senator Enzi is introducing and that I am pleased to \ncosponsor will make it clear that survivors of aerial firefighters like \nLarry Groff who make the ultimate sacrifice should qualify for PSOB \nbenefits. In addition, this legislation will clarify that the district \ncourt was right in the Wells-Groff case. Brave firefighters like Larry \nGroff, who regularly put their lives on the line in officially \nsanctioned aerial firefighting activities to protect us, do this \ncountry a great service.\n  This bill will clarify that when actually up in the air carrying out \nofficial firefighting missions, contract employees will be deemed to \nhold a ``similar relationship of performing services as part of a \npublic agency''--and meet the regulatory standard already in place--so \nthat they are covered by the PSOB laws, and their survivors can receive \nthe benefits they need and deserve.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 2415. A bill to require the President and the Office of the Global \nAIDS Coordinator to establish a comprehensive and integrated HIV \nprevention strategy to address the vulnerabilities of women and girls \nin countries for which the United States provides assistance to combat \nHIV/AIDS, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Protection \nAgainst Transmission of HIV for Women and Youth, PATHWAY, Act of 2007, \nlegislation that is a companion to the bill introduced by \nRepresentative Barbara Lee.\n  Women and girls account for about half of the 33 million infections \nworldwide. But in the places that are hardest hit by epidemic, AIDS has \na disproportionate impact upon women. In sub-Saharan Africa, women \naccount for more than 60 percent of those living with HIV/AIDS. Young \nwomen account for 3 out of every 4 new HIV infections among sub-Saharan \nyouth. Our prevention messages are not reaching youth--in studies \ncompleted in 17 countries in 2003, more than 75 percent of the young \nwomen surveyed could not identify ways to protect themselves against \nHIV infection.\n  Clearly, we need to do more to stem the rising tide of HIV infection \nin women, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. But what doing more \nrequires is an examination of the factors that contribute to women's \nvulnerability to HIV infection. There are links between gender-based \nviolence and increased risk for HIV infection, links between lack of \neducation and economic opportunity and increased risk for HIV \ninfection, links between human trafficking and sexual exploitation and \nincreased risk for HIV infection.\n  Unfortunately, our current policies do not allow us to take these \nfactors into account. The law governing funding of the President's \nEmergency Plan for AIDS Relief, PEPFAR, requires \\1/3\\ of all \nprevention funding to be spent on abstinence-until-marriage programs. \nIn addition, a 2005 guidance from the Office of the Global AIDS \nCoordinator found that countries were directed to spend half of their \nprevention funds on sexual transmission prevention, with a full \\2/3\\ \nof that funding to be spent on ``abstinence and be faithful'' programs, \nrather than comprehensive HIV prevention education efforts.\n  More than 40 percent of women in Africa and South Asia are married \nbefore the age of 18. Directing funding to abstinence-until-marriage \nprograms fails to address their needs. Exhorting them to ``be \nfaithful'' in relationships where they may not have control over their \npartners' behavior is short-sighted. Making it the official policy of \nthe U.S. Government to restrict funding for efforts that could help \nthese women learn about female-controlled prevention methods is \nunconscionable.\n  In 2003, President Bush pledged to prevent 7 million new HIV \ninfections through PEPFAR. But we cannot let that promise go unmet due \nto ideology.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will lift restrictions on \nfunding\n\n[[Page S14799]]\n\nfor our prevention efforts. It will also require the President to \ndevelop and implement a coordinated, comprehensive HIV strategy to \naddress gender disparities in HIV infection, with a focus on the stigma \nsurrounding HIV, the links between gender-based violence and HIV \ninfection, the ways in which increasing educational and economic \nopportunities for women can prevent HIV infection, and ways in which to \nimprove access to female-controlled prevention methods. This strategy \nis a step forward--one that can ensure that the disproportionate risks \nfaced by too many women are taken into account in our global AIDS \nefforts.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that women's \nvulnerability to HIV infection is addressed as we work to reauthorize \nPEPFAR.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CASEY (for himself, Mr. Grassley, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 2418. A bill to ensure the safety of imported food products for \nthe citizens of the United States, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the EAT SAFE Act \nof 2007. I am pleased to be joined by my colleague on the Agriculture \nCommittee, Senator Grassley, to introduce this important piece of food \nsafety legislation.\n  As we have all seen this past year, in the wake of massive recalls of \npet food manufactured using contaminated Chinese gluten and consumer \nwarnings about the safety of various imported food products, ensuring \nthe safety of food products and food ingredients being brought into \nthis country from other nations has taken on a greater urgency.\n  A report issued in September by the President's Interagency Working \nGroup on Import Safety acknowledged that ``aspects of our present \nimport system must be strengthened to promote security, safety, and \ntrade for the benefit of American consumers.'' The EAT SAFE Act that we \nare introducing today is designed to address one of those critical \naspects of the food and agricultural import system that, in the face of \nthe mounting imported food safety crisis, has received little public \nfocus. That issue is food and other agricultural products that are \nbeing smuggled into the U.S.\n  When many people think of food smuggling, they likely think of it as \nsomething that occurs when travelers attempt to bring small amounts of \nforeign food or agricultural products into the U.S. by concealing it in \ntheir vehicles, luggage, or other personal affects. While this type of \nsmuggling is unquestionably a problem that U.S. authorities must and do \naddress, the larger threat of smuggled food and agricultural products \ncomes from the companies, importers, and individuals who circumvent \nU.S. inspection requirements or restrictions on imports of certain \nproducts from a particular country.\n  The ways in which these companies, importers, and individuals \ncircumvent the system can happen in any number of ways. Many times \nsmuggled products are intentionally mislabeled and bear the \nidentification of a product that can legally enter the country. Other \ntimes, smuggled products gain import entry through falsifying the \nproducts' countries of origin. And, many times, products that have \npreviously been denied entry are later ``shopped around,'' that is, \npresented to another U.S. port of entry in the effort to gain \nimportation undetected.\n  Just some examples of prohibited products discovered in commerce in \nthe United States in recent years include duck parts from Vietnam and \npoultry products from China, both nations with confirmed human cases of \navian influenza; unpasteurized raw cheeses from Mexico containing a \nbacterium that causes tuberculosis; strawberries from Mexico \ncontaminated with hepatitis A; and mislabeled puffer fish from China \ncontaining a potentially deadly toxin. These smuggled food and \nagriculture products present safety risks to our food, plants, and \nanimals, and pose a threat to our Nation's health, economy, and \nsecurity.\n  The EAT SAFE Act addresses these serious risks by applying \ncommonsense measures to protect our food and agricultural supply. This \nlegislation authorizes funding for the U.S. Department of Agriculture \nand the Food and Drug Administration to bolster their efforts by hiring \nadditional personnel to detect and track smuggled products. It also \nauthorizes funding to provide food safety cross training for Homeland \nSecurity Agricultural Specialists and agricultural cross training for \nCustoms' Border Patrol Agents to ensure that those men and women \nworking on the front lines are knowledgeable about these serious food \nand agricultural threats.\n  In addition to focusing on increased personal and training, the EAT \nSAFE Act also seeks to increase importer accountability. The \nlegislation requires private laboratories conducting tests on FDA-\nregulated products on behalf of importers to apply for and be certified \nby FDA. It also imposes civil penalties for laboratories or importers \nwho knowingly or conspire to falsify imported product laboratory \nsampling and for importers who circumvent the USDA import reinspection \nsystem.\n  Finally, the EAT SAFE Act will also ensure increased public awareness \nof smuggled products, as well as recalled food products, by requiring \nthe USDA and FDA to provide this information to the public in a timely \nand easily searchable manner.\n  These commonsense measures are an important first step towards \nsafeguarding Americans' food and agricultural supply and ensuring our \nNation's health, economy, and security.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2418\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nrequire physician utilization of the Medicare electronic prescription \ndrug program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, seven thousand Americans die every year \nbecause of preventable adverse drug events. Tens of thousands of more \nare injured. Meanwhile, of the three billion prescriptions that are \nwritten each year, doctors report that nearly one billion of them \nrequired a followup for clarity, costing our health care system \nbillions of dollars a year. That is why I am pleased to join my \ncolleagues Senator Ensign, Senator Stabenow and Senator Martinez to \nintroduce critical legislation to help bring our health care system \ninto the 21st century through electronic prescribing, e-prescribing, of \nmedications in the Medicare program.\n  The benefits of e-prescribing are clear and compelling. When a doctor \n``writes'' an electronic prescription, a computer or handheld device \nwarns of potentially dangerous interactions or allergies or informs a \nphysician whether a particular drug is covered by a patient's \ninsurance. It also tells the physician whether a chemically identical \ngeneric alternative is available at a fraction of the price. The path \nto a more modern, accountable health care system starts with health \ninformation technology. The path to robust health information \ntechnology starts with e-prescribing.\n  This legislation would provide permanent funding for physician \npayment bonuses in Medicare to help offset the costs of acquiring e-\nprescribing systems and to incentivize the use of the\n\n[[Page S14789]]\n\ntechnology. The bill would also require all physicians in Medicare to \nuse e-prescribing starting in 2011--1 year later than the Institute of \nMedicine recommended in their recent study. We have talked long enough \nabout using technology to stem perpetually rising health care costs and \npoor quality, and our legislation takes an important step to do \nsomething about it.\n  I want to give particular credit to Mark Merritt and his team at \nPharmaceutical Care Management Association, PCMA, for their hard work \nand leadership. PCMA is responsible for a seminal study in this field, \nwhich showed for the first time that broader adoption of e-prescribing \nwill not only save lives, but will also save billions of dollars for \npatients, payers and taxpayers alike. Perhaps most importantly, PCMA \ncreated a strong and diverse coalition of health care stakeholders to \nadvocate for this legislation, including business, labor, consumer \nadvocates, physicians, health plans, pharmacists, and drug \nmanufacturers. The PCMA-led coalition has worked diligently on Capitol \nHill in support of this important issue. They have educated Congress on \ne-prescribing and are helping to make sure that we get the policy \nright.\n  The Medicare E-MEDS Act gets it right. The standards and \ninteroperability for e-prescribing are in place; the technology is \naffordable; and, most importantly, the dramatic benefits for patients \nand health care purchasers--especially the Federal Government--are \noverwhelmingly clear. This bill is a solid step towards addressing \nthese important issues in the delivery of our Nation's health care. It \nis time that Congress act to save lives and increase efficiency in \nAmerica's health care system.\n  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to the \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2408\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Electronic \n     Medication and Safety Protection (E-MEDS) Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Patient safety is an important issue and a priority \n     among patients, providers, insurers, businesses, and \n     government entities alike.\n       (2) Adverse drug events are defined by the Institute of \n     Medicine as ``any injury due to medication''.\n       (3) According to the Institute of Medicine, more then 1.5 \n     million preventable adverse drug events occur every year in \n     the United States.\n       (4) Studies indicate that at least 530,000 preventable \n     adverse drug events occur each year among the Medicare \n     population, and cost the Federal Government upwards of \n     $887,000,000, or $1,983 per person.\n       (5) Electronic prescription drug programs, or e-\n     prescribing, provide for the electronic transmittal of \n     prescription information from the prescribing health care \n     provider to the dispensing pharmacy and pharmacist.\n       (6) Electronic prescribing provides formulary and coverage \n     information before a prescription is written to better inform \n     the patient and prescriber of lower cost options, including \n     generics.\n       (7) E-prescribing can help to eliminate medical errors, \n     injuries, hospitalizations, and even death that can result \n     from illegible prescriptions and bad drug interactions, in \n     addition to reducing patient medication non-adherence.\n       (8) The Institute of Medicine recommends that all \n     physicians create a plan to implement and use e-prescribing \n     technology by 2010.\n\n     SEC. 3. INCENTIVES FOR USE OF E-PRESCRIBING UNDER MEDICARE.\n\n       (a) Bonus Payments.--Section 1833 of the Social Security \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 1395l) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new subsection:\n       ``(v) Incentive Payments for Physician Use of E-\n     Prescribing.--\n       ``(1) One-time bonus for start-up costs.--\n       ``(A) In general.--If the Secretary determines, based upon \n     coding in claims submitted under this part over a duration \n     specified by the Secretary, that a physician meets a \n     threshold volume or proportion (as specified by the \n     Secretary) of claims for physicians' services for individuals \n     enrolled under this part that--\n       ``(i) are classified (under section 1848) as evaluation and \n     management services;\n       ``(ii) include the making of a prescription that could \n     under law be made using the electronic prescription drug \n     program; and\n       ``(iii) use the electronic prescription drug program for \n     such prescription,\n\n     the Secretary shall make a payment to the physician, in \n     addition to any other payment under this part, of the amount \n     specified in subparagraph (B).

A bill to require the establishment of a credit card safety \nstar rating system for the benefit of consumers, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, And Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, credit card debt is hitting American \nfamilies like a wrecking ball, with our families already being hammered \nby skyrocketing fuel prices and the subprime mortgage mess. We have \nseen credit card debt go up almost 25 percent in the last 3 years. I \nhave brought to the floor a typical credit card agreement\n\n[[Page S14790]]\n\nthat millions of our citizens enter into. It is 44 pages long. You \ncan't see it from the chair, but it goes on and on and on with small \nprint. It is very obvious to me that buried in all of this legalese, \nburied in all of this technical jargon, is a variety of sneaky terms \nthat end up hurting consumers because it is not possible to understand \nwhat is in much of the key provisions of these agreements. For example, \nwe understand folks in New Jersey, Oregon, or anywhere else pay a lot \nof attention to the interest rate provision. They pay a lot of \nattention to the annual fee provision. But they don't notice a lot of \nthe little disclosures that end up hidden in the legalese that can end \nup making the real cost of credit significantly higher.\n  Last week, I met with students across the State of Oregon. A lot of \nthem, with the financial aid cutbacks, are now walking on an economic \ntightrope. They balance their food bills against their fuel bills and \ntheir fuel bills against their housing costs. They are on an economic \ntightrope. They are getting buried in credit card debt. Very often they \nfind, for example, that if they have a credit card, and they are late \non another payment with someone else, their credit card interest rate \nends up going up as a result. There may be a small provision in their \nexisting credit card agreement that allows it, but nobody, for the most \npart, knows about it.\n\n  Students would say their interest rates would double almost overnight \nwith virtually no notice. They would not be given any clear \ncommunication about what is going on. They would just find their costs \nwould arbitrarily skyrocket, and they would again be unable to pay \ntheir bills.\n  Now, I recognize in a free society folks have a constitutional right \nto be foolish, to rack up charges that would not be wise, but they can \ndo so anyway in a free society. I do not think most people will do \nthat, certainly not the students I met with in Oregon last week, if it \nis possible to understand the terms of these credit cards in \nstraightforward, plain and simple English rather than see the key \nprovisions buried in all kinds of legalese that you would have to be a \nwizard to sort out.\n  So I am proposing today, with the support of our colleague, Senator \nObama from Illinois, that the Federal Reserve, which has great \nexpertise in this area, set up a safety rating system for credit \ncards--not one that evaluates credit card companies on provisions that \nare appropriately evaluated in the marketplace, but on safety matters--\nfor example, whether a credit card company gives the consumer adequate \nnotice before they change terms; whether, for example, they highlight \nthe key kinds of changes rather than bury them in the small print.\n  I think the Federal Reserve, with the technical expertise they have \nand the independent judgment they bring to these financial questions, \nis the ideal place to develop and operate a safety rating system. Such \na system has worked quite well for new cars. When you have a rating \nsystem for cars, people can understand how they would be protected in a \ncrash. The legislation I am offering will tell people whether credit \ncard companies are treating them fairly and disclosing the key \nprovisions so that a free market can work.\n  So under the rating system I propose today with Senator Obama, it \nwould be required for credit card companies to put on the card itself, \nput on the various promotional materials they are using, stars which, \nin effect, would be granted on the basis of the Federal Reserve's \nindependent judgment as to whether the key safety criteria are being \nmet.\n  I am very hopeful that at a time when our citizens are being pounded \nby powerful economic forces, particularly in the energy and housing \nfield, there could at least be bipartisan agreement that the Senate \ncould support transparency, disclosure, changes in the credit card \nbusiness, so our consumers--and millions are using these credit cards \nduring this holiday season--can understand the agreements they are \ngetting into.\n  The students I met with last week are taking steps now to better \npolice what is going on in the credit card field. On several campuses \nin Oregon, they have moved the credit card companies off campus. Yet \nthe credit card companies continue to flood the students with \npromotional material.\n  I was told, for example, about one program where students were \nbrought into a room where money was essentially floating in the air, \nwhere it was as if you would be going to a financial paradise if you \njust signed up for one of these credit card agreements.\n  I am not proposing heavy-handed regulation. I am not proposing one-\nsize-fits-all government. I am proposing that an agency with the \nexpertise to make sure there is disclosure, that the forms and \nagreements are printed in simple English--that that kind of information \nbe rewarded in the marketplace. If companies are not willing to do it, \nthe American people could find that out as well.\n  That is the kind of simple, straightforward approach--with \ndisclosure, transparency, in simple English--that makes sense for the \ndigital age. With the Federal Reserve completing that first safety \nrating, all Americans could get that kind of information quickly and \nconveniently. That is what is in the interest of the American people \nwith respect to this credit card debt issue at a critical time.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the legislation I introduce today \nwith Senator Obama.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Obama, Mr. Durbin, \n        Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Biden, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 2412. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reform \nthe system of public financing for Presidential elections, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I will reintroduce a bill to \nrepair and strengthen the presidential public financing system. \nBipartisan support is a key element of successful campaign finance \nreform efforts, and I am therefore delighted that the junior Senator \nfrom Maine, Sen. Collins, has agreed to be the principal cosponsor of \nthe bill.\n  The Presidential Funding Act of 2007 will ensure that this system \nwill continue to fulfill its promise in the 21st century. The bill will \ntake effect in January 2009, so it will first apply in the 2012 \npresidential election.\n  The presidential public financing system was put into place in the \nwake of the Watergate scandals as part of the Federal Election Campaign \nAct of 1974. It was held to be constitutional by the Supreme Court in \nBuckley v. Valeo. The system, of course, is voluntary, as the Supreme \nCourt required in Buckley. Every major party nominee for President \nsince 1976 has participated in the system for the general election and, \nprior to 2000, every major party nominee had participated in the system \nfor the primary election as well.\n  In the 2004 election, President Bush and two Democratic candidates, \nHoward Dean and the eventual nominee John Kerry, opted out of the \nsystem for the presidential primaries. President Bush and Senator Kerry \nelected to take the taxpayer-funded grant in the general election. \nPresident Bush also opted out of the system for the Republican \nprimaries in 2000 but accepted the general election grant. Several of \nthe leading candidates for President in the 2008 election are not \nparticipating in the primary system, and it remains to be seen whether \neither major party candidate will accept public funds in the general \nelection.\n  It is unfortunate that the matching funds system for the primaries \nhas become less practicable. The system protects the integrity of the \nelectoral process by allowing candidates to run viable campaigns \nwithout becoming overly dependent on private donors. The system has \nworked well in the past, and it is worth repairing so that it can work \nin the future. If we don't repair it, the pressures on candidates to \nopt out will increase until the system collapses from disuse.\n  This bill makes changes to both the primary and general election \npublic financing system to address the weaknesses and problems that \nhave been identified by participants in the system, experts on the \npresidential election financing process, and an electorate that is \nincreasingly dismayed by the influence of money in politics. First and \nmost important, it eliminates the state-by-state primary spending \nlimits in the current law and substantially increases the overall \nprimary spending limit from the current\n\n[[Page S14791]]\n\nlimit of approximately $45 million to $150 million, of which up to $100 \nmillion can be spent before April 1 of the election year. This should \nmake the system much more viable for serious candidates facing \nopponents who are capable of raising significant sums outside the \nsystem. The bill also makes available substantially more public money \nfor participating candidates by increasing the match of small \ncontributions from 1:1 to 4:1.\n  One very important provision of this bill ties the primary and \ngeneral election systems together and requires candidates to make a \nsingle decision on whether to participate. Candidates who opt out of \nthe primary system and decide to rely solely on private money cannot \nreturn to the system for the general election. Candidates must commit \nto participate in the system in the general election if they want to \nreceive Federal matching funds in the primaries. The bill also \nincreases the spending limits for participating candidates in the \nprimaries who face a nonparticipating opponent if that opponent raises \nmore than 20 percent more than the spending limit. This provides some \nprotection against being far outspent by a nonparticipating opponent. \nAdditional grants of public money are also available to participating \ncandidates who face a nonparticipating candidate spending substantially \nmore than the spending limit.\n  The bill also sets the general election spending limit at $100 \nmillion, indexed for inflation. If a general election candidate does \nnot participate in the system and spends more than 20 percent more than \nthe combined primary and general election spending limits, a \nparticipating opposing candidate will receive a grant equal to twice \nthe general election spending limit.\n  This bill also addresses what some have called the ``gap'' between \nthe primary and general election seasons. Presumptive presidential \nnominees have emerged earlier in the election year over the life of the \npublic financing system. This has led to some nominees being \nessentially out of money between the time that they nail down the \nnomination and the convention where they are formally nominated and \nbecome eligible for the general election grant. For a few cycles, soft \nmoney raised by the parties filled in that gap, but the Bipartisan \nCampaign Reform Act of 2002 fortunately has now closed that loophole. \nThis bill allows candidates who are still in the primary race as of \nApril 1 to spend an additional $50 million until funds for the general \nelection are made available. In addition, the bill allows the political \nparties to spend up to $25 million between April 1 and the date that a \ncandidate is nominated and an additional $25 million after the \nnomination. The total amount of $50 million is over three times the \namount allowed under current law. This should allow the ``gap'' to be \nmore than adequately filled.\n  Obviously, these changes make this a more generous system. So the \nbill also makes the requirement for qualifying more difficult. To be \neligible for matching funds, a candidate must raise $25,000 in \nmatchable contributions--up to $200 for each donor--in at least 20 \nStates. That is five times the threshold under current law.\n  The bill also makes a number of changes in the system to reflect the \nchanges in our presidential races over the past several decades. For \none thing, it makes matching funds available starting 6 months before \nthe date of the first primary or caucus, that's approximately 6 months \nearlier than is currently the case. For another, it sets a single date \nfor release of the public grants for the general election--the Friday \nbefore Labor Day. This addresses an inequity in the current system, \nunder which the general election grants are released after each \nnominating convention, which can be several weeks apart.\n  The bill also prohibits Federal elected officials and candidates from \nsoliciting soft money for use in funding the party conventions and \nrequires presidential candidates to disclose bundled contributions. The \nbundling provision builds on a provision contained in ethics and \nlobbying reform bill enacted earlier this year. It requires \npresidential candidates to disclose all bundlers of $50,000 or more.\n  The purpose of this bill is to improve the campaign finance system, \nnot to advance one party's interests. In fact, this is an excellent \ntime to make changes in the Presidential public funding system. The \n2008 presidential campaign, which is already underway, will undoubtedly \nbe the most expensive in history. A number of candidates from both \nparties have opted out of the primary matching funds system, and some \nexperts predict that one or both major party nominees will even refuse \npublic grants for the general election period. It is too late to make \nthe changes needed to repair the system for the 2008 election. But if \nwe act now, we can make sure that an updated and revised system is in \nplace for the 2012 election. If we act now, I am certain that the 2008 \ncampaign cycle will confirm our foresight. If we do nothing, 2008 will \ncontinue and accelerate the slide of the current system into \nirrelevancy.\n  Fixing the presidential public financing system will cost money, but \nour best calculations at the present time indicate that the changes to \nthe system in this bill can be paid for by raising the income tax \ncheck-off on an individual return from $3 to just $10. The total cost \nof the changes to the system, based on data from the 2004 elections, is \nprojected to be around $365 million over the 4-year election cycle. To \noffset that increased cost, this bill first amends the Energy Policy \nAct of 2005 to allow the Bureau of Land Management to implement new \nuser fees for processing oil and gas permits. It also amends the \nGeothermal Steam Act of 1970 to increase the yearly maintenance fee and \none-time location fee for holders of more than 10 mining claims on \nfederal land to $150 and $50 per claim, respectively, and imposes a 4 \npercent royalty on the gross income from mining on existing claims. \nFinally, it amends the Public Rangelands Improvement Act of 1978 to use \na state's fee formula to establish the grazing fees for federal land in \nthat state.\n  Though the numbers are large, this is actually a very small \ninvestment to make to protect our democracy and preserve the integrity \nof our presidential elections. The American people do not want to see a \nreturn to the pre-Watergate days of unlimited spending on presidential \nelections and candidates entirely beholden to private donors. We must \nact to ensure the fairness of our elections and the confidence of our \ncitizens in the process by repairing the cornerstone of the Watergate \nreforms.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na section-by-section analysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2412\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       Except as otherwise provided in this Act, the amendments \n     made by this Act shall apply with respect to elections \n     occurring after January 1, 2009.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n\n                         Section 1: Short Title\n\n    Section 2: Revisions to System of Presidential Primary Matching \n                                Payments\n\n       (a) Matching Funds: Current law provides for a 1-to-1 \n     match, where up to $250 of each individual's contributions \n     for the primaries is matched with $250 in public funds. Under \n     the new matching system, individual contributions of up to \n     $200 from each individual will be matched at a 4-to-1 ratio, \n     so $200 in individual contribution can be matched with $800 \n     from public funds.\n       Candidates who remain in the primary race can also receive \n     an additional 1-to-1 match of up to $200 of contributions \n     received after March 31 of a presidential election year. This \n     additional match applies both to an initial contribution made \n     after March 31 and to contributions from individuals who \n     already gave $200 or more prior to April 1.\n       The bill defines ``contribution'' as ``a gift of money made \n     by a written instrument which identifies the person making \n     the contribution by full name and mailing address.''\n       (b) Eligibility for matching funds: Current law requires \n     candidates to raise $5,000 in matchable contributions \n     (currently $250 or less) in 20 states. To be eligible for \n     matching funds under this bill, a candidate must raise \n     $25,000 of matchable contributions (up to $200 per individual \n     donor) in at least 20 states.\n       In addition, to receive matching funds in the primary, \n     candidates must pledge to apply for public money in the \n     general election if nominated and to not exceed the general \n     election spending limits.\n       (c) Timing of payments: Current law makes matching funds \n     available on January 1 of a presidential election year. The--\n     bill makes such funds available six months prior to the first \n     state caucus or primary.\n\n\n    Section 3: Requiring Participation in Primary Payment System as \n        Condition of Eligibility for General Elections Payments\n\n       Currently, candidates can participate in either the primary \n     or the general election public financing system, or both. \n     Under the bill, a candidate must participate in the primary \n     matching system in order to be eligible to receive public \n     funds in the general election.\n\n\n               Section 4: Revisions to Expenditure Limits\n\n       (a) Spending limits for candidates: In 2004, under current \n     law, candidates participating in the public funding system \n     had to abide by a primary election spending limit of about \n     $45 million and a general election spending limit of about \n     $75 million (all of which was public money). The bill sets \n     a total primary spending ceiling for participating \n     candidates in 2008 of $150 million, of which only $100 \n     million can be spent before April 1. State by state \n     spending limits are eliminated. The general election \n     limit, which the major party candidates will receive in \n     public funds, will be $100 million.\n       (b) Spending limit for parties: Current law provides a \n     single coordinated spending limit for national party \n     committees based on population. In 2004 that limit was about \n     $15 million. The bill provides two limits of $25 million. The \n     first applies after April 1 until a candidate is nominated. \n     The second limit kicks in after the nomination. Any part of \n     the limit not spent before the nomination can be spent after. \n     In addition, the party coordinated spending limit is \n     eliminated entirely until the general election public funds \n     are released if there is an active candidate from the \n     opposing party who has exceeded the primary spending limits \n     by more than 20%.\n       This will allow the party to support the presumptive \n     nominee during the so-called ``gap'' between the end of the \n     primaries and the conventions. The entire cost of a \n     coordinated party communication is subject to the limit if \n     any portion of that communication has to do with the \n     presidential election.\n       (c) Inflation adjustment: Party and candidate spending \n     limits will be indexed for inflation, with 2008 as the base \n     year.\n       (d) Fundraising expenses: Under the bill, all the costs of \n     fundraising by candidates are subject to their spending \n     limits.\n\n\n Section 5: Additional Payments and Increased Expenditures Limits for \n     Candidates Participating in Public Financing Who Face Certain \n                       Nonparticipating Opponents\n\n       (a) Primary candidates: When a participating candidate is \n     opposed in a primary by a nonparticipating candidate who \n     spends more than 120 percent of the primary spending limit \n     ($100 million prior to April 1 and $150 million after April \n     1), the participating candidate will receive a 5-to-1 match, \n     instead of a 4-to-l match for contributions of less than $200 \n     per donor. That additional match applies to all contributions \n     received by the participating candidate both before and after \n     the nonparticipating candidate crosses the 120 percent \n     threshold. In addition, the participating candidate's primary \n     spending limit is raised by $50 million when a \n     nonparticipating candidate spends more than the 120 percent \n     of either the $100 million (before April 1) or $150 million \n     (after April 1) limit. The limit is raised by another $50 \n     million if the nonparticipating candidate spends more than \n     120 percent of the increased limit. Thus, the maximum \n     spending limit in the primary would be $250 million if an \n     opposing candidate has spent more than $240 million.\n       (b) General election candidates: When a participating \n     candidate is opposed in a general election by a \n     nonparticipating candidate who spends more than 120 percent \n     of the combined primary and general election spending limits, \n     the participating candidate shall receive an additional \n     grant of public money equal to the amount provided for \n     that election--$100 million in 2008. Minor party \n     candidates are also eligible for an additional grant equal \n     to the amount they otherwise receive (which is based on \n     the performance of that party in the previous presidential \n     election).\n       (c) Reporting and Certification: In order to provide for \n     timely determination of a participating candidate's \n     eligibility for increased spending limits, matching funds, \n     and/or general election grants, non-participating candidates \n     must notify the FEC within 24 hours after receiving \n     contributions or making expenditures of greater than the \n     applicable 120 percent threshold. Within 24 hours of \n     receiving such a notice, the FEC will inform candidates \n     participating in the system of their increased expenditure \n     limits and will certify to the Secretary of the Treasury that \n     participating candidates are eligible to receive additional \n     payments.\n\n\n Section 6: Establishment of Uniform Date for Release of Payments from \n      Presidential Elections Campaign Funds to Eligible Candidates\n\n       Under current law, candidates participating in the system \n     for the general election receive their grants of public money \n     immediately after receiving the nomination of their party, \n     meaning that the two major parties receive their grants on \n     different dates. Under the bill, all candidates eligible to \n     receive public money in the general election would receive \n     that money on the Friday before Labor Day, unless a \n     candidate's formal nomination occurs later.\n\n\n     Section 7: Revisions to Designation of Income Tax Payments by \n                          Individual Taxpayers\n\n       The tax check-off is increased from $3 (individual) and $6 \n     (couple) to $10 and $20. The amount will be adjusted for \n     inflation, and rounded to the nearest dollar, beginning in \n     2009.\n       The IRS shall require by regulation that electronic tax \n     preparation software does not automatically accept or decline \n     the tax checkoff. The FEC is required to inform and educate \n     the public about the purpose of the Presidential Election \n     Campaign Fund (``PECF'') and how to make a contribution. \n     Funding for this program of up to $10 million in a four year \n     presidential election cycle, will come from the PECF.\n\n\n       Section 8: Amounts in Presidential Election Campaign Fund\n\n       Under current law, in January of an election year if the \n     Treasury Department determines that there are insufficient \n     funds in the PECF to make the required payments to \n     participating primary candidates, the party conventions, and \n     the general election candidates, it must reduce the payments \n     available to participating primary candidates and it cannot \n     make up the shortfall from any other source until those funds \n     come in. Under the bill, in making that determination the \n     Department can include an estimate of the amount that will be \n     received by the PECF during that election year, but the \n     estimate cannot exceed the past three years' average \n     contribution to the fund. This will allow primary candidates \n     to receive their full payments as long as a reasonable \n     estimate of the funds that will come into the PECF that year \n     will cover the general election candidate payments. The bill \n     allows the Secretary of the Treasury to borrow the funds \n     necessary to carry out the purposes of the fund during the \n     first campaign cycle in which the bill is in effect.\n\n\n             SECTION 9: REGULATION OF CONVENTION FINANCING\n\n       Federal candidates and officeholders are prohibited from \n     raising or spending soft money in connection with a \n     nominating convention of any political party, including funds \n     for a host committee, civic committee, or municipality.\n\n\n            SECTION 10: DISCLOSURE OF BUNDLED CONTRIBUTIONS\n\n       This section builds on the bundling disclosure provision of \n     the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 \n     (``HLOGA'') to require presidential campaigns to disclose\n\n[[Page S14797]]\n\n     the name, address, and employer of all individuals or groups \n     that bundle contributions totaling more than $50,000 in the \n     four year election cycle. Individuals who are registered \n     lobbyists would have to be separately identified. HLOGA's \n     definition of bundling would apply to bundling disclosure by \n     the presidential candidates, and no change is made to the \n     requirements of HLOGA with respect to congressional \n     campaigns.\n\n\n     SECTION 11: REPEAL OF PRIORITY IN USE OF FUNDS FOR POLITICAL \n                              CONVENTIONS\n\n       Current law gives the political parties priority on \n     receiving the funds they are entitled to from the PECF. This \n     means that parties get money for their conventions even if \n     adequate funds are not available for participating \n     candidates. This section would make funds available for the \n     conventions only if all participating candidates have \n     received the funds to which they are entitled.\n\n\n                           SECTION 12: OFFSET\n\n       This section provides an offset for the increased cost of \n     the presidential public funding system. The total increased \n     cost is estimated to be $365 million over four years. The \n     bill (1) authorizes the Bureau of Land Management to \n     implement new user fees for processing oil and gas permits; \n     (2) increases the yearly maintenance fee and one-time \n     location fee for holders of more than 10 mining claims on \n     federal land to $150 and $50 per claim, respectively, and \n     imposes a 4% royalty on the gross income from mining on \n     existing claims; and (3) uses state formulas to set federal \n     grazing fees.\n\n\n                       SECTION 13: EFFECTIVE DATE\n\n       Provides that the amendments will apply to presidential \n     elections occurring after January 1, 2009.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President. I rise to join my friend from Wisconsin, \nSenator Feingold, in introducing the Presidential Funding Act of 2007.\n  It was 100 years ago that the reformer President Theodore Roosevelt \nproposed ``a very radical measure'' in his State of the Union message \nto Congress. He envisioned a system of campaign financing that would \ninclude a congressional appropriation to support national campaigns so \nthat, as he said, ``The need for collecting large campaign funds would \nvanish.''\n  When the campaign financing reforms of the 1970s were enacted, it was \nhoped that we would draw closer to achieving Theodore Roosevelt's goal \nof funding the pursuit of our highest public office largely from public \nrather than private funds.\n  Our Presidential-campaign finance system still suffers from serious \ndefects, however, and current events are dramatically highlighting the \nneed for continued reform and improvement.\n  The current Presidential campaign is already shaping up as the most \nexpensive election in history by far. Candidate after candidate has \nchosen to forego public funds due to fundamental flaws in the system. \nFund-raising tallies have already shattered records. If a candidate \ndecides to seek public funding, he or she risks running out of funds to \ncounter candidates who can attract large amounts of private \ncontributions.\n  Current estimates are that the 2008 contest for the Presidency of the \nU.S. will cost more than $1 billion. Much of that cost will be incurred \nin delivering messages to the electorate through advertising and \npublications of all sorts.\n  One billion dollars is a huge sum. Yet we cannot expect modern \ncampaigns to be run on budgets that might have sufficed for William \nMcKinley, whose successful 1896 campaign relied heavily on speeches \nfrom his front porch in Canton, Ohio, to admirers who came by train to \nhear him. This idyllic but limited approach to campaigning is long \ngone.\n  Unless we wish to return to the cronyism, influence peddling, and \nrestricted suffrage of the 19th century, large expenditures on \nbroadcasting and other media are essential for any campaign that hopes \nto prevail. That financial fact obliges candidates to spend a great \ndeal of time appearing at exclusive, big-ticket fundraisers.\n  To allow candidates to spend less time raising money, Congress \nestablished a system of public funding for Presidential campaigns that \nstarted with the 1976 Presidential election. That system has not been \nsubstantially changed since 1984, and its limitations have only become \nmore evident with time.\n  The central problem is that the system does not provide enough public \nfunds to permit a credible contest against well-bankrolled candidates \nwho have opted out of the public-financing system.\n  In November 2003, Governor Dean announced that he would opt out of \npublic financing, saying ``floods of special-interest money have forced \nus to abandon a broken system.'' Senator Kerry also felt obliged to opt \nout so that he could lend his campaign $6 million rather than be \nrestricted to the use of $50,000 in personal funds.\n  Citing Senator Dole's campaign in 1996, Senator McCain's campaign in \n2000, and Senator Edwards's campaign in 2004, the League of Women \nVoters has spoken of the public system's ``devil's bargain'' for \ncandidates: ``To get matching funds, they have to accept a spending \nlimit that will leave them bankrupt if the contest continues into \nMarch. . . . With the underdogs boxed in by the limits, the \nfrontrunners, and others who can afford it, have additional incentive \nto opt out.''\n\n  The bill we introduce today would make a number of important changes.\n  The key provisions of the Presidential Funding Act of 2007 would \nincrease the public match for primary-season contributions, make funds \navailable earlier in the contest, tie the availability of public \nfunding during the general-election campaign to a candidate's using it \nduring the primary season, provide additional funds if a non-publicly \nfunded opponent spends heavily, and update spending limits to more \nrealistic levels.\n  All of these steps represent sensible and useful improvements in the \ncampaign-finance system.\n  I recognize that some of our colleagues and some members of the \npublic are wary of taxpayer-supported funding for Presidential \ncandidates. I can only respond that the alternative--a complete \nreliance on private contributions--is worse.\n  I would also reassure doubters that this bill is no giveaway or an \ninducement to fringe candidates of narrow appeal. Its provisions are \npredicated upon matches for individual contributions, not absolute \ngrants, and it requires achieving significant levels of individual \ncontributions in at least 20 States.\n  We all understand that the current system of public funding for \ncampaigns has defects. The growing inclination of candidates to opt out \nof the system underscores that fact. The Presidential Funding Act of \n2007 would cure some serious problems and help restore the appeal of \npublic funding.\n  If enacted, this bill would take effect in January 2009. By moving \ntoward virtually full realization of Theodore Roosevelt's ``very \nradical measure,'' we can take a big step toward making the financing, \nthe conduct, and the outcome of the 2012 presidential campaign a \ngenuine source of pride for American citizens of all political \naffiliations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 2413. A bill to provide death and disability benefits for aerial \nfirefighters who work on a contract basis for a public agency and \nsuffer death or disability in the line of duty, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the 2007 fire season was one of the worst in \nrecent history. Millions of acres burned across America. The fires \ndestroyed homes, and their damage is estimated in the hundreds of \nmillions of dollars. These fires would have been worse, if not for the \nskill and bravery of the aerial firefighters who risked their lives to \nfight them.\n  Aerial firefighters take on the dangerous tasks of maneuvering aerial \nvehicles in and out of fire zones. Each time they step in a plane, \ntheir life is at risk. Unfortunately, while we expect aerial \nfirefighters to risk their lives to help control fires, we refuse to \nprovide their families with the knowledge that they will be made \nfinancially whole if their husband or wife dies in the line of duty.\n  This is because aerial firefighters do not qualify for death benefits \nunder the Public Safety Officers' Benefit, PSOB, program, which \nprovides financial and educational benefits to individuals serving a \npublic safety agency in an official capacity, on a paid or volunteer \nbasis. Currently, those receiving benefits include, but are not limited \nto, law enforcement officers, firefighters, emergency medical \ntechnicians, ambulance crew members, and corrections officers.\n  Senator Feinstein and I say that these pilots do the same work and \ntake on the same risks as other public safety officers. They should get \nthe same\n\n[[Page S14798]]\n\nbenefits. That is the reason that we have introduced the Aerial \nFirefighter Relief Act of 2007. This important legislation will remedy \nthis problem and makes aerial firefighters eligible for death benefits.\n  The Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Assistance, BJA, the \nagency that administers the PSOB, has ruled that aerial pilots are \nineligible because they are contractors and not employed directly by \nthe federal and state agencies involved in wildland fire management and \nsuppression. The 1980 official finding that prohibits the pilots and \ntheir families from receiving benefits states that pilots are not ``a \n`public safety officer' as this term is defined in the PSOB ACT because \n[they are] not serving a public agency in an official capacity . . . as \na fireman.''\n  Unfortunately, pilots also often do not receive benefits from their \nemployers. Federal agencies outsource air tanker missions to the \nlowest-cost private operators who do not provide benefits to keep their \ncosts down. Some companies do offer a minimal amount of life insurance. \nHowever, it is expensive, both for the pilot and the contractor. In the \n``low cost'' competitive bid situation they are in, the contractors \ncannot afford to add more expenses to the payroll or they reduce their \nchances of winning a fire suppression contract--and go out of business. \nOther forms of life insurance are also difficult to obtain because of \nthe dangerous nature of aerial firefighting.\n  It is common sense legislation that deserves the support of my \ncolleagues, and I am pleased to have Senator Feinstein as an original \ncosponsor. In the coming months, I look forward to working with the \nappropriate committees to move this legislation forward so that our \nbrave aerial firefighters can take to the skies knowing that their \nfamilies will be taken care of if they pass away taking care of our \ncountry.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to cosponsor \nSenator Enzi's Aerial Firefighter Relief Act of 2007.\n  On August 27, 2001, a California pilot named Larry Groff took off \nfrom Ukiah in State Air Tanker 87, doing what he loved, flying and \nfighting fires.\n  Like thousands of contract firefighters hired by the Government, he \nfigured that if anything ever happened to him, his family would be \ntaken care of. But that day, while maneuvering above a north coast fire \nstarted by a couple of Hells Angels who had blown up their \nmethamphetamine lab, Larry Groff died in a midair collision.\n  Faced with the prospect of raising their 6 children alone, his widow, \nChristine Wells-Groff, filed a claim under the Public Safety Officers' \nBenefit Program. This PSOB Program provides a lump-sum payoff to \nsurvivors of any ``public safety officer,'' a term which can include \nnot only actual government employees but also any volunteer or any \nperson acting in a ``similar relationship of performing services as \npart of a public agency.''\n  At the time of his death, Larry Groff had been flying a State-\noperated air tanker. He was wearing a California Department of Forestry \nuniform. And after his death, the California agency for which he had \nworked issued an opinion stating that he was an officially recognized \nmember of that agency. But he was also a contract employee.\n  Because of that, Ms. Wells-Groff's PSOB claim was initially denied by \nthe Bureau of Justice Affairs, based on its opinion that contract \nemployees cannot qualify for PSOB benefits. Ms. Wells-Groff then \nappealed, and she later convinced a trial court that despite being a \ncontract employee, her husband had held a ``similar relationship of \nperforming services as part of a public agency,'' thereby qualifying \nhim as a ``public safety officer'' entitled to PSOB benefits.\n  Unfortunately, on July 3, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal \nCircuit reversed that decision. The appellate court agreed that Mr. \nGroff's facts might fall within the applicable regulation's key \ndefinition of a ``similar relationship'' but it said that the question \nof whether he had met this standard was not entirely clear and that it \nwould defer to the Government's narrow interpretation of that language, \nabsent further clarification from Congress.\n  Following this decision, Ms. Wells-Groff petitioned the Supreme Court \nto take her case. However, it is unclear if the Court will hear the \ncase, let alone decide in her favor. So today, I want to go on record \nto support the policy that these contract employees should be entitled \nto the same PSOB benefits as other injured firefighters and volunteers.\n  The bill that Senator Enzi is introducing and that I am pleased to \ncosponsor will make it clear that survivors of aerial firefighters like \nLarry Groff who make the ultimate sacrifice should qualify for PSOB \nbenefits. In addition, this legislation will clarify that the district \ncourt was right in the Wells-Groff case. Brave firefighters like Larry \nGroff, who regularly put their lives on the line in officially \nsanctioned aerial firefighting activities to protect us, do this \ncountry a great service.\n  This bill will clarify that when actually up in the air carrying out \nofficial firefighting missions, contract employees will be deemed to \nhold a ``similar relationship of performing services as part of a \npublic agency''--and meet the regulatory standard already in place--so \nthat they are covered by the PSOB laws, and their survivors can receive \nthe benefits they need and deserve.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 2415. A bill to require the President and the Office of the Global \nAIDS Coordinator to establish a comprehensive and integrated HIV \nprevention strategy to address the vulnerabilities of women and girls \nin countries for which the United States provides assistance to combat \nHIV/AIDS, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Protection \nAgainst Transmission of HIV for Women and Youth, PATHWAY, Act of 2007, \nlegislation that is a companion to the bill introduced by \nRepresentative Barbara Lee.\n  Women and girls account for about half of the 33 million infections \nworldwide. But in the places that are hardest hit by epidemic, AIDS has \na disproportionate impact upon women. In sub-Saharan Africa, women \naccount for more than 60 percent of those living with HIV/AIDS. Young \nwomen account for 3 out of every 4 new HIV infections among sub-Saharan \nyouth. Our prevention messages are not reaching youth--in studies \ncompleted in 17 countries in 2003, more than 75 percent of the young \nwomen surveyed could not identify ways to protect themselves against \nHIV infection.\n  Clearly, we need to do more to stem the rising tide of HIV infection \nin women, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. But what doing more \nrequires is an examination of the factors that contribute to women's \nvulnerability to HIV infection. There are links between gender-based \nviolence and increased risk for HIV infection, links between lack of \neducation and economic opportunity and increased risk for HIV \ninfection, links between human trafficking and sexual exploitation and \nincreased risk for HIV infection.\n  Unfortunately, our current policies do not allow us to take these \nfactors into account. The law governing funding of the President's \nEmergency Plan for AIDS Relief, PEPFAR, requires \\1/3\\ of all \nprevention funding to be spent on abstinence-until-marriage programs. \nIn addition, a 2005 guidance from the Office of the Global AIDS \nCoordinator found that countries were directed to spend half of their \nprevention funds on sexual transmission prevention, with a full \\2/3\\ \nof that funding to be spent on ``abstinence and be faithful'' programs, \nrather than comprehensive HIV prevention education efforts.\n  More than 40 percent of women in Africa and South Asia are married \nbefore the age of 18. Directing funding to abstinence-until-marriage \nprograms fails to address their needs. Exhorting them to ``be \nfaithful'' in relationships where they may not have control over their \npartners' behavior is short-sighted. Making it the official policy of \nthe U.S. Government to restrict funding for efforts that could help \nthese women learn about female-controlled prevention methods is \nunconscionable.\n  In 2003, President Bush pledged to prevent 7 million new HIV \ninfections through PEPFAR. But we cannot let that promise go unmet due \nto ideology.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will lift restrictions on \nfunding\n\n[[Page S14799]]\n\nfor our prevention efforts. It will also require the President to \ndevelop and implement a coordinated, comprehensive HIV strategy to \naddress gender disparities in HIV infection, with a focus on the stigma \nsurrounding HIV, the links between gender-based violence and HIV \ninfection, the ways in which increasing educational and economic \nopportunities for women can prevent HIV infection, and ways in which to \nimprove access to female-controlled prevention methods. This strategy \nis a step forward--one that can ensure that the disproportionate risks \nfaced by too many women are taken into account in our global AIDS \nefforts.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that women's \nvulnerability to HIV infection is addressed as we work to reauthorize \nPEPFAR.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CASEY (for himself, Mr. Grassley, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 2418. A bill to ensure the safety of imported food products for \nthe citizens of the United States, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the EAT SAFE Act \nof 2007. I am pleased to be joined by my colleague on the Agriculture \nCommittee, Senator Grassley, to introduce this important piece of food \nsafety legislation.\n  As we have all seen this past year, in the wake of massive recalls of \npet food manufactured using contaminated Chinese gluten and consumer \nwarnings about the safety of various imported food products, ensuring \nthe safety of food products and food ingredients being brought into \nthis country from other nations has taken on a greater urgency.\n  A report issued in September by the President's Interagency Working \nGroup on Import Safety acknowledged that ``aspects of our present \nimport system must be strengthened to promote security, safety, and \ntrade for the benefit of American consumers.'' The EAT SAFE Act that we \nare introducing today is designed to address one of those critical \naspects of the food and agricultural import system that, in the face of \nthe mounting imported food safety crisis, has received little public \nfocus. That issue is food and other agricultural products that are \nbeing smuggled into the U.S.\n  When many people think of food smuggling, they likely think of it as \nsomething that occurs when travelers attempt to bring small amounts of \nforeign food or agricultural products into the U.S. by concealing it in \ntheir vehicles, luggage, or other personal affects. While this type of \nsmuggling is unquestionably a problem that U.S. authorities must and do \naddress, the larger threat of smuggled food and agricultural products \ncomes from the companies, importers, and individuals who circumvent \nU.S. inspection requirements or restrictions on imports of certain \nproducts from a particular country.\n  The ways in which these companies, importers, and individuals \ncircumvent the system can happen in any number of ways. Many times \nsmuggled products are intentionally mislabeled and bear the \nidentification of a product that can legally enter the country. Other \ntimes, smuggled products gain import entry through falsifying the \nproducts' countries of origin. And, many times, products that have \npreviously been denied entry are later ``shopped around,'' that is, \npresented to another U.S. port of entry in the effort to gain \nimportation undetected.\n  Just some examples of prohibited products discovered in commerce in \nthe United States in recent years include duck parts from Vietnam and \npoultry products from China, both nations with confirmed human cases of \navian influenza; unpasteurized raw cheeses from Mexico containing a \nbacterium that causes tuberculosis; strawberries from Mexico \ncontaminated with hepatitis A; and mislabeled puffer fish from China \ncontaining a potentially deadly toxin. These smuggled food and \nagriculture products present safety risks to our food, plants, and \nanimals, and pose a threat to our Nation's health, economy, and \nsecurity.\n  The EAT SAFE Act addresses these serious risks by applying \ncommonsense measures to protect our food and agricultural supply. This \nlegislation authorizes funding for the U.S. Department of Agriculture \nand the Food and Drug Administration to bolster their efforts by hiring \nadditional personnel to detect and track smuggled products. It also \nauthorizes funding to provide food safety cross training for Homeland \nSecurity Agricultural Specialists and agricultural cross training for \nCustoms' Border Patrol Agents to ensure that those men and women \nworking on the front lines are knowledgeable about these serious food \nand agricultural threats.\n  In addition to focusing on increased personal and training, the EAT \nSAFE Act also seeks to increase importer accountability. The \nlegislation requires private laboratories conducting tests on FDA-\nregulated products on behalf of importers to apply for and be certified \nby FDA. It also imposes civil penalties for laboratories or importers \nwho knowingly or conspire to falsify imported product laboratory \nsampling and for importers who circumvent the USDA import reinspection \nsystem.\n  Finally, the EAT SAFE Act will also ensure increased public awareness \nof smuggled products, as well as recalled food products, by requiring \nthe USDA and FDA to provide this information to the public in a timely \nand easily searchable manner.\n  These commonsense measures are an important first step towards \nsafeguarding Americans' food and agricultural supply and ensuring our \nNation's health, economy, and security.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2418\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I wish to notify the Senate of my intent to \nobject to proceeding to S. 311, a bill to\n\n[[Page S14803]]\n\namend the Horse Protection Act to prohibit the shipping, transporting, \nmoving, delivering, receiving, possessing, purchasing, selling, or \ndonation of horses and other equines to be slaughtered for human \nconsumption, and for other purposes.\n  The bill would prohibit the shipping, transporting, moving, \ndelivering, receiving, possessing, purchasing, selling, or donation of \nhorses and other equines to be slaughtered for human consumption. In \nshort, it would further limit the already limited options for disposal \nof unwanted horses.\n  An unwanted horse is one that has reached the useful end of its \neconomic or recreational life. There are numerous reasons for the \nexistence of unwanted horses, not the least of which are economic \nreasons such as loss of job, price of feed or stabling, relocation, \npoor health of the horse or its owner.\n  It must be recognized that no one has adequately addressed the fate \nof the estimated 90,000 unwanted horses that were formerly slaughtered \non an annual basis. Animal welfare groups and rescue organizations can \nonly do so much to shoulder the load of aiding the adoption or care of \nthese horses. They are currently stretched to capacity, and we expect \nan increase in need. As a result, we are witnessing a significant \nincrease in abandonment and neglect of horses in this country. \nParticularly in the West, growing numbers of unwanted horses are being \ndumped on public or private rangelands.\n  I believe that we should take the time to examine this growing issue \nof the unwanted horse before passing legislation that ties the hands of \nhorse owners, public and private land managers, and others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/05/senate-section/article/S14803-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n               Committee on Environment and Public Works\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Madam President, for the past 5 weeks now, my colleagues \nand I have spent literally hours on the Senate floor talking about the \n2007 farm bill. Unfortunately, talking about the farm bill for over 5 \nweeks is all we have done. We could have spent all the days and hours \nsince November 5 productively debating this farm bill. Instead, the \ndistinguished leader on the other side of the aisle made a decision the \nvery first day of the farm bill debate when the farm bill was brought \nto the floor and the debate ensued to not allow any amendments to reach \nthe floor. Not one single farm bill amendment has been discussed.\n  Farm bill authority spans 5 years. This legislation impacts every \nman, woman, and child in America. My colleagues in the minority, who \nare not members of the Agriculture Committee and who have not had an \nopportunity to help craft this legislation, deserve a chance to offer \ntheir suggested changes.\n  The farm bill before us totals 1,600 pages. It reauthorizes over $280 \nbillion in spending on commodity, conservation, nutrition, trade, \nenergy, and rural development programs. This bill is far too important \nto be held hostage by partisan tactics. However, the majority leader \nmade a decision, as I said, nearly 2 weeks ago, to prohibit amendments \nfrom being offered to this landmark legislation.\n  I am a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, and I am proud of \nthe farm bill we passed out of the committee. I give Chairman Harkin \nand the ranking member, Senator Chambliss, great credit. I believe they \ndeserve to be given great credit for the efforts they made in committee \ndeliberation. The members of the committee held an open and productive \ndebate. Several amendments were offered, debated, and voted on. At the \nend of the day, Senate Democrats and Republicans set aside their \ndifferences and reported out a bill to meet America's food and energy \nneeds over the next 5 years.\n  Is the committee-reported bill perfect? No, of course not. But that \nbeing said, my colleagues all deserve an opportunity to offer their \namendments to the farm bill. There are only 21 of us who serve on the \nSenate Agriculture Committee, 11 Democrats, 10 Republicans. Senator \nDomenici, Senator Nelson, and I authored an amendment that would add an \nincreased renewable fuels standard to the 2007 farm bill on the floor \nbecause it didn't get added in the committee and because there were \nquestions about whether an energy bill was ultimately going to pass the \nSenate. Therefore, we thought it would be good to improve and \nstrengthen the energy title of the farm bill by adding the RFS to the \nfarm bill. That is one of the amendments that, of course, could be \ndebated if, in fact, there were an open debate process.\n  As I travel across my State and met with farmers and agricultural \nleaders, the message to me is very clear. No single policy is more \nimportant to our agricultural community than this farm bill and the \naccompanying Energy bill. If we can get a farm bill passed with a \nrenewable fuel standard, I think our farmers would be very pleased with \nthe work Congress has done to promote American agriculture and move the \nrenewable fuels industry forward.\n  This renewable fuels standard will create jobs in rural America, give \nour producers an alternative market for our crops, spur billions of \ndollars in renewable fuels investment, and save over $600 million in \ntaxpayer dollars in the underlying bill.\n  However, we have not had an opportunity to debate any of these \namendments, including a renewable fuels standard amendment. I listened \nall day while accusations have flown back and forth. There has been all \nthis hand wringing going on finger pointing, and the blame game being \nplayed. I have to say, as someone who voted for cloture the first time \nwe had a cloture vote on the farm bill, I voted for cloture because I \nneed this bill to move forward--my farmers and my ranchers want a new \nfarm bill--but not because the process has been fair to Members on my \nside of the aisle.\n  Senators on the minority side, on the Republican side of the aisle--\nas I said, there are only 21 of us who serve on the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee. That means there are 79 other Senators who would like to \nweigh in on this important legislation. We have had the bill on the \nfloor literally for a 2-week period and we didn't debate or vote upon \none single amendment.\n  As I said before, you are talking about a 1,600-page bill that \nauthorizes $280 billion in spending over the next 5 years, and there \nhas not been one single amendment voted on. The majority leader decided \nwhen the bill came to the floor he was going to fill the amendment \ntree, which in effect said no amendment can be offered unless it is \napproved by the majority leader.\n  I don't happen to disagree with the notion that amendments that are \nbrought to the floor of the Senate ought to be somewhat germane to the \nunderlying legislation. But it is a reality, a practical reality every \nsingle day in this institution, in the Senate, that amendments are \nbrought to the floor that are not germane to the underlying bill. I \nwill hold up a case in point because I have heard my colleagues on the \nother side get up and say: The Republicans want to offer all these \nnongermane amendments and what are we supposed to do about that, these \nneed to be germane to the underlying farm bill? I would like to see \namendments that are germane to the underlying farm bill, but it is a \nreality in the Senate that on many occasions--in fact it is often the \ncase--amendments are offered to all kinds of legislation that are not \ngermane to that underlying legislation.\n\n  A case in point: We are now stalled on the Defense authorization \nbill, a bill that was debated and voted upon a long time ago. The House \npassed it, the Senate passed it, we went to conference, we resolved all \nthe differences. I serve as a Member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, and I know some of the issues that were being debated in the \nconference were somewhat contentious, but they all got resolved. Most \nof them were related to the underlying bill. Most of them were related \nto our national security programs, our readiness and that sort of \nthing. What is holding up the conference on the Defense authorization \nbill is hate crimes legislation because hate crimes was put on the bill \nin the Senate before it left, over the objections of many of us who \ndidn't feel it was relevant or germane to the underlying Defense \nauthorization bill. But nevertheless we didn't have the votes. It went \nto conference.\n  Now the debate over whether we are going to have a Defense \nauthorization bill doesn't hinge on anything having to do with national \nsecurity. It hinges on hate crimes legislation. How is that germane to \nthe Defense authorization bill? Yet my colleagues on the other side \nhave continually gotten up today and railed on the Republicans because \nRepublicans, of all things, want a vote on a death tax amendment to the \nfarm bill.\n\n[[Page S14805]]\n\n  In my State, most farmers and ranchers think the death tax is \nrelevant to their everyday lives because it is probably the single \nbiggest barrier to multigenerational transfers of cattle operations. \nThere is not anything that is a bigger barrier, a larger impediment to \nthose types of transfers in passing farm operations and ranching \noperations down to the next generation than is the death tax. In most \ncases, these are people who are asset rich but cash poor. Oftentimes, \nwhen someone dies and they wanted to pass it on, they have to liquidate \nall their assets in order to pay the death tax.\n  My point simply is this. I would like to see us move forward. We need \na farm bill. We need an energy bill. As I said before, I voted for \ncloture on the farm bill, but I have to say this process has been very \ntilted in favor of a procedure that the majority leader adopted on the \nfirst day that is very much without precedent--in terms of what happens \non the Senate floor, I am sure it has been done. I am sure it has been \ndone under Republican majorities. But the fact is, filling the \namendment tree and prohibiting amendments from being offered, in a \nplace such as the Senate which thrives on an open amendment process, I \nthink is undermining the very foundation, the rules and procedures on \nwhich the Senate is based.\n  I would like to see us be able to get to a vote on the farm bill, but \nwe can't do that until we have some agreement on amendments, and we \ncan't get to the amendments on the floor until such time as the \nmajority leader agrees we will be able to offer amendments. Until that \nhappens, our side is going to continue to object to proceeding to the \nfarm bill because, in fairness to them, as I said, this is a 1,600-page \nbill that spends $280 billion over 5 years and was debated by 21 of the \n100 Senators. In the Agriculture Committee, I think we produced a very \ngood bill. I would like to see it--as I said, if it went through \nunamended, that would be fine by me because I think we got as good a \nconsensus in the farm committee as we could. But there are 79 other \nMembers of the Senate on both sides of the aisle who want to strengthen \nand make this bill better, and right now the process has precluded that \nopportunity to a point where we are at a standstill on legislation that \nis of great importance to the farmers I represent and, I would argue, \nto all Americans.\n  The farm bill not only funds production agriculture--and frankly less \nand less of the overall funding in the farm bill is going to production \nagriculture. More of it now, 68 percent of it, is going to nutrition \nand food stamps and other aspects of the farm bill; 9 percent toward \nconservation. All of those are important. But my point simply is this \nis a bill important to all Americans, not just to those farmers and \nranchers.\n  During debate on the 2002 farm bill, there were 246 amendments filed. \nDemocrats and Republicans came together and voted on 49 amendments, \nincluding 29 rollcall votes. Before that, in the 1996 farm bill, there \nwere 339 amendments offered, which were debated. Republicans controlled \nthe Congress at that time. Republican leadership allowed 26 amendment \nvotes, including 11 rollcall votes.\n\n  During consideration of the 1990 farm bill, there were 113 votes on \nthe farm bill, 22 of which were rollcall votes. Finally, in 1985, there \nwere 88 votes on that farm bill, 33 of which were rollcall votes.\n  My point is, writing a farm bill is not an easy task. A lot goes into \nthis. It is a lengthy process, involving compromise between stakeholder \ngroups, national priorities, regional interests, and compromise is \nsimply unachievable under the political maneuvers that have been \nemployed by the Democratic leader on this farm bill.\n  As I said before, it has been 5 weeks since it was called up on the \nfloor. We had it on the floor for 2 weeks at one stretch before we went \nout for the Thanksgiving break, and let me emphasize we did not vote on \none single amendment to this legislation.\n  I hope that will change because I think there is precious little time \nleft in this session of the Congress and there are a lot of priorities. \nThere is not much, frankly, that has been done. The Defense \nauthorization bill, as I said, is being held up over an unrelated, \nnongermane amendment dealing with hate crimes. We don't have funding \ngoing out to the troops. We have only gotten one appropriations bill \nsigned into law. The VA-Military Construction appropriations bill is \ncued up, ready to go. The President said he would sign it. We have not \nmoved that through here. The list goes on and on.\n  I think it is regrettable because, as most Americans observe this \nprocess, they become increasingly cynical. The reason I think these \npublic opinion polls that are published and surveys that are done \nindicate that Congress has terribly low approval ratings is for this \nreason: They see the partisan bickering, gridlock, finger pointing and \nall they want is for Congress to work together to get things done. One \nrecent public opinion survey had the approval rating of the Congress at \n11 percent which, as our friend John McCain always says: When you get \ndown to 11 percent, you are pretty much talking about paid staff and \nblood relatives; and if you factor in the margin of error, you might \neven run a negative on that.\n  That is because the American public perceives what is happening and \nis incredibly frustrated by that. They want to see us work together \ntoward solutions. We cannot do that absent a process and procedure that \nallows amendments to be offered when bills come to the floor. \nLegislation put on the floor that is as comprehensive as this farm bill \nis which, as I said, is 1,600 pages, $280 billion in spending over a 5-\nyear period, to date not one single amendment has been voted on.\n  That is regrettable. It is a disservice to the farmers and ranchers \nof this country who are waiting for this farm bill but, as important, I \nthink it is a disservice to the American public, all of whom benefit \nfrom the farm bill and all of whom want to see the Senate work and \nfunction effectively to address the challenges and the problems we face \nas a country.\n  The process employed by the majority leader on the farm bill \ncompletely precludes us from having anything that resembles an open \ndebate. As I pointed out earlier, if you go back to the 1985, 1990, \n1996 or 2002 farm bills, there were ample opportunities for amendments. \nThere was vigorous and spirited debate and lots of rollcall votes. This \nis really historic in terms of the precedent it sets and the message it \nsends to American agriculture, which desperately needs a farm bill.\n  I hope in the next day or two, and next week--which in my view is \nabout what we have left to work with. I am frankly happy to stay here \nthis weekend. I would stay here Saturday, Sunday, and beyond if we \ncould get a farm bill on the floor, actually debate it, actually have \namendments offered and voted on. I am happy to stay. I would be willing \nto bet that many of my colleagues would be happy to stay.\n  But the clock is a-running, time is a-wasting. All the American \npeople see is finger pointing and hand wringing and bickering and \ngridlock. That is not in their best interests. Certainly, it is not \nfair to them, the people by whom we were elected. They sent us to do a \njob. We need to get about that job. That means allowing the Senate to \nfunction, to work, to allow Senators to offer amendments to these bills \nand to get to final action and completion and to get some legislation \npassed that will hopefully improve the lives of many Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/05/senate-section/article/S14805-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10:30 A.M.
