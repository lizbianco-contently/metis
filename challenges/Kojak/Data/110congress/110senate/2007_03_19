Mr. President, in today's Congressional Weekly, a respected \npublication we get back there, there is a column on the last page by \nCraig Crawford which I think is quite illuminating. It is entitled \n``The Firing Squad Backfires.''\n\n       The fingerprints of the President's top advisers are all \n     over the prosecutors' firing scandal, which means trouble for \n     Bush.\n\n  Here is the first sentence:\n\n       Of all the scandals that increasingly bedevil George W. \n     Bush's Presidency, none has more direct ties to the President \n     than the flap over firing Federal prosecutors.\n\n  I rise today to express my strong support of S. 214, Senator \nFeinstein's legislation to strengthen the independence of U.S. \nattorneys. There is growing evidence that the Bush administration fired \nFederal prosecutors for improper partisan reasons. This legislation is \nneeded to protect the integrity of the Federal criminal justice system \nand the autonomy of the chief Federal prosecutors across the country.\n  The U.S. attorney scandal is another example of the arrogance of \npower. As Lord Acton said, power tends to corrupt, and absolute power \ntends to corrupt absolutely. For too long, the Bush administration--\nshielded from oversight by a Republican-dominated Congress--enjoyed \nabsolute power, and they abused it.\n  After all, this was a President who won two elections by the barest \nof margins, first by the Supreme Court. Yet after 9/11, instead of \nuniting the country, he has chosen to push the envelope of his \nauthority. On everything from the runup to the war in Iraq, to the plan \nto destroy Social Security, to the use of warrantless wiretapping, this \nadministration has governed without compromise.\n  The political purge of U.S. attorneys is only the latest example of \nthis President's unhealthy disregard for checks and balances. Speedy \npassage of this bill is only the first step the Senate must take to \ndeal with the administration's dangerous power grab.\n  We need to get to the bottom of this scandal to find out why these \nU.S. attorneys were fired. We need to find out whether the Attorney \nGeneral and his deputies testified truthfully when they first explained \nthe firings to Congress and the American people.\n  Federal prosecutors are enormously powerful individuals. They are the \nembodiment of Federal criminal law. They make life-and-death decisions \nabout who to prosecute and who should receive leniency. Their \ndiscretion is largely unreviewable. They must be permitted to carry out \ntheir solemn duties without any political interference.\n  No one disputes the authority of the President to name U.S. attorneys \nat the beginning of his term, subject to the advice and consent of the \nSenate. But it is unprecedented that U.S. attorneys be terminated in \nthe middle of a Presidential term without proper cause. It is \nunacceptable for U.S. attorneys to be replaced because they were \nperceived by the White House to be insufficiently partisan or too \naggressive in prosecuting public corruption.\n  It appears that administration officials took advantage of a \nprovision that they insisted be included in the\n\n[[Page S3240]]\n\nPATRIOT Act reauthorization conference report last year. Now it is \nbecoming clear why they stuck that provision in there. This was a plan \nthey had for some time. That law reversed a longstanding procedure that \nallowed the chief Federal judge in the Federal district court to \nappoint a temporary replacement while the permanent nominee undergoes \nSenate confirmation. The Feinstein bill simply restores the pre-PATRIOT \nAct procedure.\n\n  Conflicting testimony and recently released e-mails strongly suggest \nthe American people are not getting from the Bush administration the \nfull story about this scandal.\n  In the State of Nevada, as an example, Daniel Bogden, a highly \nrespected career prosecutor, was forced to step down. His chosen \nvocation in life was to be a Federal prosecutor. He worked as an \nassistant U.S. attorney for a significant period of time before chosen \nto be the U.S. attorney by a Republican, John Ensign, and by the \nPresident, who sent his name to us. We were initially told that Bogden \nand others were fired for ``performance-related reasons.'' But that \nexplanation proved to be totally bogus. In fact, Dan Bogden's personnel \nreview was glowing. We still don't know why Dan Bogden was fired. What \nwe do know is under the new PATRIOT Act provision, Mr. Bogden could be \nreplaced by someone with no ties to Nevada, and with no input from the \nSenate. The damage done to Bogden personally is irreparable. He can't \nwork now as assistant U.S. attorney. That is part of the process. That \nis too bad. He is a fine man whose reputation has been besmirched.\n  Meanwhile, we learned of a scheme hatched in the White House to \nreplace all U.S. attorneys. At least one U.S. attorney has stated he \nwas forced to resign because he refused to bend to political pressure \nregarding ongoing investigations. Others were fired under circumstances \nthat raise the same question. In the State of Arkansas, the U.S. \nattorney was fired and replaced by one of Karl Rove's underlings.\n  The Attorney General and his deputies told Congress these firings \nwere not politically motivated. But according to newly released e-\nmails, White House political operatives such as Mr. Rove were involved \nin the decisionmaking. Kyl Sampson, who eventually became Chief of \nStaff to Attorney General Gonzales, wrote an e-mail that distinguished \nbetween those U.S. attorneys who were ``loyal Bushies'' and those who \nwere not. Dan Bogden and other U.S. attorneys who were fired last \nDecember were not ``loyal Bushies.''\n  What I am worried about--and it hasn't come out yet--is what about \nthose who were loyal Bushies? Were these people prosecuting people \nbecause of the political involvement of the White House? Perhaps so.\n  The real question is whether being a ``loyal Bushie'' meant letting \npartisan consideration poison law enforcement decisions. Do prosecutors \nwho are ``loyal Bushies'' go easy on Republican corruption? Do they \nbring cases against Democrats without legal justification? The actions \nof the Bush administration call into question every decision by Federal \nprosecutors in corruption cases across the country.\n  I applaud the efforts of Senator Feinstein, who wrote this \nlegislation and spoke about it early on. I also applaud the efforts of \nSenators Schumer and Leahy, as well as colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle who are committed to getting the truth in this matter. I \nstrongly urge the Senate to pass this piece of legislation. Simply put, \nwe need to begin to keep politics out of the Federal criminal justice \nsystem, which is the way it has always been.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/19/senate-section/article/S3240-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of S. \n214, the bill the leader just referred to. This is a bill that simply \nreinstates the Senate's role in the confirmation process of U.S. \nattorneys. It is a bill I introduced with Senator Leahy on January 9, \n2007, days after I first learned in early December that officials from \nmain Justice called a handful of U.S. attorneys from around the country \nand forced them to resign their positions without cause.\n\n[[Page S3241]]\n\n  At that time, I had very little information and was unaware of \nexactly what had occurred and why. As I looked into it, I learned that \nin March of 2006, the PATRIOT Act was reauthorized and a change was \nmade in the law. It was made in conference without Democratic Senators \npresent. To the best of my knowledge, it was made without the knowledge \nof any Senator, Republican or Democrat. It is my understanding this was \na request from the Justice Department that was presented by Will \nMoschella to the staff of the Judiciary Committee and, without the \nknowledge of Senators, was put into the bill. It then gave the \nPresident the authority essentially to appoint a U.S. attorney without \nconfirmation for the remainder of his term.\n  The bill, S. 214, that is before the Senate today simply returns the \nlaw the way it was before this action took place in March of 2006.\n  Today, just a little more than 2 months after I first learned about \nthis situation, additional information has come to light. But rather \nthan alleviating the concerns and answering questions, we are now faced \nwith new and more serious allegations. In fact, the big question \nlooming over this debate is whether the Attorney General and others in \nthe Bush administration have misled the Congress and the public. If \ntrue, this is very serious.\n  There are also allegations that the firings were done because the \nDepartment of Justice and the White House were both unhappy with some \nof the U.S. attorneys' handling of public corruption cases. If true \nthis, too, is very serious.\n  We now know that at least eight U.S. attorneys were forced from \noffice, and that despite shifting rationales for why, it has become \nclear that politics has, in fact, played some role.\n  Last week, we learned that the White House was involved in this \nprocess and that discussions took place with such prominent figures as \nPresidential adviser Karl Rove and former White House Counsel Harriet \nMiers. We also learned last week that these discussions began well over \n2 years ago, almost immediately following the 2004 election, and it \nappears from recently released e-mails that Attorney General Gonzales \nwas personally consulted, even while he was still serving as White \nHouse Counsel.\n  This information also shed new light on who was being targeted for \nfiring and why. It is this last point--why some were targeted--that has \nserved to raise more questions and more significant concerns. We have \nlearned that as many as six of the eight U.S. attorneys who were \ninvolved with public corruption cases. While we don't know what role \nthis played in their selection, it is an unavoidable fact that raises \nserious questions.\n  Today, as the Senate begins the debate on the Preserving United \nStates Attorney Independence Act, I would like to discuss some of what \nwe have learned in greater detail and some of the reasons this bill is \nso necessary.\n  I believe it is important to look at how interim U.S. attorneys have \nbeen appointed over the years. There appears to be an assumption by the \nBush administration that the Attorney General should have an exclusive \nauthority to appoint interim U.S. attorneys. But, in fact, history \npaints a much different picture.\n  When first looking into this issue, I found that the statutes had \ngiven the courts the authority to appoint an interim U.S. attorney and \nthat this dated back as far as the Civil War. Specifically, the \nauthority was first vested with the circuit courts in March of 1863. \nThen, in 1898, a House of Representatives report explained that while \nCongress believed it was important to have the courts appoint an \ninterim U.S. attorney, there was a problem relying on circuit courts \n``since the circuit justice is not always to be found in the circuit \nand time is wasted in ascertaining his whereabouts.'' Therefore, at \nthat time, the interim appointment authority was switched to the \ndistrict courts; that is, in 1898 it was switched to the district \ncourts. Thus, for almost 100 years, the district courts were in charge \nof appointing interim U.S. attorneys, and they did so with virtually no \nproblems.\n  This structure was left undisturbed until 1986 when the statute was \nchanged during the Reagan administration. In a bill that was introduced \nby Senator Strom Thurmond, the statute was changed to give the \nappointment authority to the Attorney General, but even then it was \nrestricted and the Attorney General had a 120-day time limit. After \nthat time, if a nominee was not confirmed, the district courts would \nappoint an interim U.S. attorney. The adoption of this language was \npart of a larger package that was billed as technical amendments to \ncriminal law, and thus there was no recorded debate in either the House \nor the Senate and both Chambers passed the bill by voice vote.\n  Then, 20 years later, in March 2006--again without much debate and \nagain as a part of a larger package--a statutory change was inserted \ninto the PATRIOT Act reauthorization. This time, the Executive's power \nwas expanded even further, giving the Attorney General the authority to \nappoint an interim replacement indefinitely and without Senate \nconfirmation.\n  Unfortunately, not 1 year after securing this new authority, abuses \nhave come to light. Almost immediately after I first spoke about what I \nhad learned in January, the Attorney General called me to tell me that \nI had my facts wrong. However, he also sent up his staff to confirm \nthat ``less than 10'' U.S. attorneys had been asked to resign on \nDecember 7, 2006.\n  Despite this, the Attorney General adamantly denied politics had any \nrole in the process. In fact, in an interview with an Associated Press \nreporter on January 16, 2007, the Attorney General was asked about the \ncharges of political motivation, and he responded:\n\n       Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\n  He further stated in response to your comment, Mr. President, that \nthe Department tried to avoid Senate confirmation to reward political \nallies:\n\n       We in no way politicized these decisions.\n\n  Two days later, the Attorney General reiterated this position when he \ncame before the Senate Judiciary Committee on January 18 of this year \nand said:\n\n       I would never, ever make a change in the United States \n     attorney position for political reasons.\n\n  That is a categorical and definitive monosyllabic statement. However, \nthe Department had to backtrack when it became evident that the former \nU.S. attorney from your State, Mr. President, Arkansas, Bud Cummins, \nwas simply replaced in order to make room for Tim Griffin, who had \nserved as Karl Rove's special assistant and had been in charge of \nopposition research against Democratic candidates for the Republican \nNational Committee.\n\n  Less than a month later, the Deputy Attorney General confirmed this \nfact when he testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on \nFebruary 7, 2007. At that time, he said:\n\n       The fact is there was a change made [in Arkansas] that was \n     not connected, as we said, to the performance of the \n     incumbent, but more related to the opportunity to provide a \n     fresh start with a new person in that position.\n\n  Deputy Attorney General McNulty, however, went on to say that all the \nothers who were fired were fired for ``performance-related reasons.'' \nBut this, too, was not the final explanation. The Department next tried \nto justify the firings by arguing that the U.S. attorneys were let go \nbecause there were ``policy disagreements.'' Then the Attorney General \nsaid that these U.S. attorneys had ``lost [his] confidence.'' So there \nare three different reasons so far. Now, most recently, the explanation \nhas been that the Department thought it ``could do better''--the fourth \nexplanation.\n  These explanations are as slippery as they are misleading. Rather, \nwhat documents and e-mails demonstrate is that none of these reasons \nwas the deciding factor that led some U.S. attorneys to be targeted for \nfiring. Instead, it appears these individuals lost their jobs because a \nnumber of Department of Justice officials and possibly--we don't know \nbut possibly--White House officials did not judge them to be \nsufficiently loyal or did not like the cases they were prosecuting or \nsimply wanted to put in new, politically connected, young lawyers. It \nappears this way because contained in the documents that were released \nlast week is an outline of the Department of Justice's plan for how to \ndetermine who should be let go and who should stay.\n  The first step of that plan was to create a new rating system to \nevaluate all\n\n[[Page S3242]]\n\n93 U.S. attorneys. This was to be separate from the independent \nperformance reports, called EARS reports. Those reports routinely \noccurred and objectively examined each U.S. Attorney's Office by \nevaluating their prosecution caseloads, their management, their \nwillingness to follow Department priorities, and their ability to work \ncooperatively with the FBI, with the DEA, and with other client \nagencies.\n  This rating system was developed back in February of 2005, and one of \nthe primary factors to be considered was loyalty to the administration.\n  One e-mail describing the ratings stated:\n\n       Recommended retaining strong U.S. attorneys who have \n     produced, managed well, and exhibited loyalty to the \n     President and Attorney General. Recommended removing weak \n     U.S. attorneys who have been ineffectual managers and \n     prosecutors, chafe against administration initiatives.\n\n  Under this system, two of the eight fired U.S. attorneys received \nstrong evaluations and recommended retaining while three received \nrecommended removing.\n  One of the U.S. attorneys who received a recommended removing rating \nwas Carol Lam from the Southern District of California. She received \nthis low rating despite her many accomplishments and despite her \npositive performance evaluations. I am familiar with Carol Lam's career \nbecause she served in San Diego. In that position, she has taken on \nsome of the biggest cases and really made a positive impact on the \ncommunity she has served. But that is not just my opinion. Leaders \nthroughout San Diego have sung her praises. Let me give a few examples.\n  Dan Dzwilewski, head of the FBI office in San Diego:\n\n       Carol has an excellent reputation and has done an excellent \n     job given her limited resources.\n\n  Then, when asked whether she had given proper attention to gun cases, \nhe said:\n\n       What do you expect her to do? Let corruption exist?\n\n  Adele Fasano, the San Diego Director of Field Operations, U.S. \nCustoms and Border Protection, said:\n\n       [We have] enjoyed a strong, collaborative relationship with \n     the U.S. Attorney's Office to combat smuggling activity \n     through the ports of entry.\n\n  City attorney for San Diego, Michael Aguirre, said:\n\n       [Carol Lam] has been by far the most outstanding U.S. \n     Attorney we've ever had . . . she's won a national reputation \n     as one of the top prosecutors in the country.\n\n  This is the city attorney.\n  Michael Unzueta, Special Agent in Charge, Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement:\n\n       Carol Lam is truly an example of a dedicated public servant \n     and a law enforcement professional. We will miss her \n     leadership.\n\n  John Cooper, Special Agent in Charge, Naval Criminal Investigative \nService:\n\n       The departure of Ms. Lam will be a great loss . . . Ms. Lam \n     is the consummate law enforcement executive who leads by \n     example.\n\n  And Alan Poleszak, Acting Special Agent in Charge, Drug Enforcement \nAgency:\n\n       The on-going prosecution of [the] Javier Arellano Felix \n     drug trafficking organization is both historic and noteworthy \n     . . . [Ms. Lam's] commitment to Federal law enforcement in \n     this judicial district, county, and city, will be missed.\n\n  We should take note of the fact that the Arellano Felix organization \nis one of the largest and most dangerous Mexican drug cartels known. \nThey operate out of Tijuana. They have killed hundreds of people. They \nhave murdered Mexican DAs, they have murdered Mexican judges, and they \nare a blight. This U.S. attorney took them on. I will tell my \ncolleagues more about that in a moment. The reason Carol Lam was well \nrespected is because she worked hard and she took on the tough fights. \nShe has had success after success. Let me give some examples.\n\n  In September of 2005, the president of the San Diego chapter of \nHell's Angels pled guilty to conspiracy to commit racketeering. Guy \nRussell Castiglione admitted he conspired to kill members of a rival \nmotorcycle gang, the Mongols, to sell methamphetamine. In December \n2005, Daymond Buchanan, member of Hell's Angels, was sentenced to 92 \nmonths in Federal prison for participating in a pattern of racketeering \nas well as inflicting serious bodily injury upon one victim. At that \ntime, Ms. Lam announced:\n\n       With the president, sergeant at arms, secretary, treasurer, \n     and six other members of the Hell's Angels convicted of \n     racketeering charges and facing long prison sentences, the \n     San Diego chapter of the Hell's Angels has been effectively \n     shut down for the foreseeable future.\n\n  If that isn't enough, in September of 2006, Jose Ernesto Beltran-\nQuinonez, a Mexican national, pled guilty to making false statements \nabout weapons of mass destruction. Mr. Quinonez was sentenced to 3 \nyears in Federal prison for making up a story about Chinese terrorists \nsneaking into the United States with a nuclear warhead. The hoax \nprompted a massive investigation, Federal warnings, discussions at one \nof President Bush's security briefings, and a nationwide hunt for the \ngroup of Chinese supposedly plotting the attack.\n  In December 2006 Mel Kay, of Golden State Fence Company, and Michael \nMcLaughlin pled guilty to felony charges of hiring illegal immigrants \nand agreed to pay fines of $200,000 and $100,000 respectively. The \ncompany, which built much of the fence near Otay Mesa, agreed \nseparately to pay $5 million on a misdemeanor count, one of the largest \nfines ever imposed on a company for an immigration violation.\n  Was Carol Lam praised for this work? No, she was sent packing without \nan explanation. Those were not her only cases.\n  She gained a national reputation for her work on public corruption \ncases. I think it is important to note that public corruption is the \nFBI's second highest priority after terrorism-related investigations. \nNow, I didn't know this, but the Judiciary Committee had an oversight \nhearing of the FBI on December 6, 2006, where the Director, Bob \nMueller, came before us and he mentioned what their priorities were, \nand he said: Terrorism first, and then public corruption second, and \ncrime was way down on the list.\n  As a matter of fact, I found it rather startling, and I questioned \nhim about that. He said, with some emphasis, those are our priorities, \nand we believe if we don't do public corruption, nobody else will. So \nthe FBI has as its second highest priority public corruption. The FBI \nis going to be out there putting together cases. Who prosecutes these \ncases? U.S. attorneys. The FBI's second highest priority, and Carol Lam \nrose to this challenge.\n  In March of 2004, her office convicted Steven Mark Lash, the former \nchief financial officer of FPA Medical Management, for his role in \ndefrauding shareholders and lenders of FPA. The collapse of the company \nleft more than 1,600 doctors being owed more than $60 million and \npatients reporting they were unable to obtain medical care because this \ncompany had ceased paying providers.\n  In January of 2005, Mark Anthony Kolowich, owner of World Express Rx, \npled guilty to conspiracy to sell counterfeit pharmaceuticals, \nconspiracy to commit mail fraud and smuggle pharmaceuticals, and \nconspiracy to launder money. Mr. Kolowich had run an Internet pharmacy \nWeb site where customers could order prescription drugs without a valid \nprescription. The judge called him the kingpin and architect of an \nillicit pharmaceutical ring that recruited many others to smuggle drugs \nacross the United States-Mexico border at San Ysidro.\n  Another case. In July 2005, Mrs. Lam brought a case against San Diego \ncouncilman Ralph Inzunza and Las Vegas lobbyist Lance Malone. They were \nconvicted on multiple counts of extortion, wire fraud conspiracy and \nwire fraud and were accused of trading money for efforts to repeal a \nlaw.\n  Then, in her most well-known case, in November of 2005, Ms. Lam \nsecured a guilty plea from former Representative Randy ``Duke'' \nCunningham for taking more than $2 million in bribes in a criminal \nconspiracy case involving at least three defense contractors after he \naccepted cash and gifts and then tried to influence the Defense \nDepartment on behalf of donors. He also pled guilty to a separate tax \nevasion violation for failing to disclose income in 2004.\n  Now, here is where it gets interesting. Finally, 2 days before she \nleft office, that would be around February 13, Carol Lam announced \nindictments of Kyle ``Dusty'' Foggo, a former top officer of the \nCentral Intelligence\n\n[[Page S3243]]\n\nAgency, and Brent Wilkes, a defense contractor accused of bribing Duke \nCunningham and the prime benefactor of secret CIA contracts. It is this \nlatest incident, involving the ongoing investigations stemming from the \nCunningham case, that has raised the most significant concerns about \nCarol Lam's removal.\n  When I first came to the floor in January, I mentioned rumors were \ncirculating around California that Carol Lam was pushed out because of \nher efforts in the Duke Cunningham case and subsequent investigations. \nI have tried to be very careful about talking about these allegations \nbecause they are so serious and because, at the time, they were based \non mere speculation.\n  Despite recent materials coming to light, I want to continue to be \nvery careful in talking about these allegations. At the same time, I \nmust say that today there are even more questions to be answered \nregarding what role public corruption cases played in the \nadministration's decisions about which U.S. attorneys to fire. We have \nnow learned that six of the eight fired U.S. attorneys were involved in \npublic corruption cases.\n\n  The Washington Post noted this, I think, very well, as I will point \nout here on this chart.\n  David Iglesias, New Mexico--oversaw probes of State Democrats and \nalleges two Republican lawmakers pressured him about the case. He was \nrespected by the Judiciary agencies and staff, complied with Department \npriorities.\n  Daniel Bogden, Nevada--overall evaluation was very positive. Notable \ncases, opened a probe related to Nevada Governor Jim Gibbons, former \nMember of Congress.\n  Paul Charlton, Arizona--opened preliminary probes of Representatives \nJim Kolbe and Rick Renzi before November election. Well respected, \nestablished goals that were appropriate to meet the priorities of the \nDepartment.\n  These are quotes from the official performance reports. I am not \nmaking them up, and I am not taking them from any individual. These are \n27 people who go into an office and evaluate the performance of a U.S. \nattorney. What did they say about notable cases?\n  Bud Cummins, Eastern Arkansas--Cummins was very competent, highly \nregarded.\n  That was his performance review. He conducted a probe related to \nMissouri Governor Roy Blunt, which he later closed without charges.\n  There is Carol Lam, Southern California, whom I have already \nmentioned.\n  John McKay, Western Washington--here is the job performance: \neffective, well regarded, capable leader, established strategic goals \nthat were appropriate. Here is the case: Declined to intervene in \ndisputed gubernatorial election, angry GOP.\n  Those are the six. In Carol Lam's case, these allegations have become \neven more troubling.\n  Following the conviction of Duke Cunningham, in April 2006, Federal \nprosecutors in Carol Lam's office began investigating whether Brent \nWilkes, a defense contractor, and Kyle ``Dusty'' Foggo, the third \nhighest ranking official at the CIA, and others were involved in \nbribery and corruption. Throughout the first week of May 2006, \ninformation began to surface in the press regarding this ongoing \ninvestigation. Then, on May 10, 2006, Carol Lam quietly sent an urgent \nnotice to officials at Main Justice to inform the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral and the Attorney General she was about to execute search \nwarrants on May 12--that is 2 days later--to search the home and CIA \noffice of Dusty Foggo. The very next day, after she sent this internal \nnotice, Department of Justice staff sent an e-mail to the White House \nthat said this:\n\n       Please call me to discuss the following: . . . The real \n     problem we have right now with Carol Lam that leads me to \n     conclude that we should have somebody ready to be nominated \n     on 11/18, the day her 4-year term expires.\n\n  The real problem we have right now with Carol Lam. And that is the \nday after she notified Main Justice that she was executing two search \nwarrants.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the complete e-mail be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     From: Sampson, Kyle.\n     Sent: Thursday, May 11, 2006 11:36 AM.\n     To: `William_K._Kelley@who.eop.gov'.\n     Subject: FW: Removal and Replacement of U.S. Attorneys Whose \n         4-year Terms Have Expired.\n     Sensitivity: Confidential.\n\n       Per-your inquiry yesterday after JSC, this is the e-mail I \n     sent to Dabney last month at Harriet's request. Please call \n     me at your convenience to discuss the following:\n       ------\n       Tim Griffin for E.D. Ark.; and\n       The real problem we have right now with Carol Lam that \n     leads me to conclude that we should have someone ready to be \n     nominated on 11/18, the day her 4-year term expires.\n                                  ____\n\n     From: Sampson, Kyle.\n     Sent: Friday, April 14, 2006 9:31 AM.\n     To: `Dabney_Friedrich@who.eop.gov'.\n     Subject: RE: Removal and Replacement of U.S. Attorneys Whose \n         4-year Terms Have Expired.\n     Sensitivity: Confidential.\n       Also, I would note that two others on my original list \n     already have left office. They are:\n       ------and------\n                                  ____\n\n     From: Sampson, Kyle.\n     Sent: Friday, April 14, 2006 9:30 AM.\n     To: `Dabney_Friedrich@who.eop.gov'.\n     Subject: Removal and Replacement of U.S. Attorneys Whose 4-\n         year Terms Have Expired.\n     Sensitivity: Confidential.\n       Dabney, DOJ recommends that the White House consider \n     removing and replacing the following U.S. Attorneys upon the \n     expiration of their 4-year terms:\n       Margaret M. Chiara, W.D. Mich., term expired 11/2/2005;\n       Harry E. ``Bud'' Cummins III, E.D. Ark., term expired 1/9/\n     2006; and\n       Carol C. Lam, S.D. Cal., term expires 11/18/2006.\n       We also should similarly seek to remove and replace:\n       ------\n       Call me if you have any questions. If you pushed me, I'd \n     have 3-5 additional names that the White House might want to \n     consider.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, there could be a straightforward \nexplanation for this e-mail that has nothing to do with public \ncorruption cases Carol Lam was pursuing. However, the timing looks \nreally suspicious and it raises serious questions, questions that need \nto be answered. Because if any U.S. attorney were removed because of a \npublic corruption investigation or prosecution, this could very well \ncomprise obstruction of justice.\n  I believe that irrespective of the intent behind the decision to fire \nCarol Lam and the other U.S. attorneys working on public corruption \ncases, such a removal sends a message to all other Federal prosecutors, \nwhether intended or not, that creates a chilling effect. Because of \nthis, there should have been very careful consideration given to what \nsteps should have been taken to ensure it was clear there was good \nreason to remove the prosecutor, that the office itself had a \ncomprehensive plan in place to ensure no cases or investigations would \nbe harmed or slowed in any way and that ongoing public corruption cases \nhad absolutely nothing to do with the removal of the U.S. attorney.\n  However, in the case of Carol Lam and in the case of five other U.S. \nattorneys, the administration failed to meet even these bare minimum \nstandards. I strongly believe that removal of a United States attorney \nwho is involved in an ongoing public corruption case should occur \nonly--only if there is a very good reason, and not simply ``we could do \nbetter.''\n  Because of the public corruption cases and allegations that \nindividuals were removed to put in politically connected young lawyers, \nanother issue that must be examined is the appearance of politics \nimpacting how U.S. attorneys are treated and what that means for the \nprosecution of justice.\n  As was reported in the McClatchy newspapers, former Federal \nprosecutors and defense lawyers have said:\n\n       Allegations of political interference could undermine the \n     reputation of U.S. attorneys as impartial enforcers of the \n     law.\n\n  And, yes, I really agree with that.\n  One former Federal prosecutor said:\n\n       One of the things the Department has stood for was being \n     apolitical. Sure, politics does get involved in the \n     appointment process, but this is just nuts.\n\n  He is right. Yes, appointees are selected and nominated by the party \nin power. But once an individual U.S. attorney takes that oath of \noffice, he or she must be independent, objective, and must be free to \npursue justice wherever the facts lead.\n  Bruce Fein, the former Associate Deputy Attorney General for the\n\n[[Page S3244]]\n\nReagan administration, said in an interview last week:\n\n       [W]e expect the rule of law to be administered \n     evenhandedly. That's what ties our country together and gives \n     legitimacy to decisions by the court and to the government \n     itself. When it's obvious that the prosecution function is \n     being manipulated for political purposes, that undermines the \n     entire rule of law.\n\n  In defending its actions, administration officials and others have \ntried to argue that both Presidents Reagan and Clinton fired all 93 \nU.S. attorneys when they came into office, and that is no different \nthan what occurred in December. Right?\n  Wrong. The implication of this argument has been that it is not \nunheard of to fire U.S. attorneys in this manner, and that, at some \nlevel, it is commonplace. Right?\n  Wrong, it is not commonplace. In fact, the Department of Justice and \nthe White House knew that this was not commonplace and that comparing \nits actions to Reagan and Clinton was an inaccurate analogy. A memo, \nwritten by Kyl Sampson on January 1, 2006, to the Counsel to the \nPresident, clearly stated:\n\n       During the Reagan and Clinton Administrations, President \n     Reagan and Clinton did not seek to remove and replace U.S. \n     Attorneys they had appointed, whose four-year terms had \n     expired, but instead permitted such U.S. Attorneys to serve \n     indefinitely under the holdover provision.\n\n  That is a memo from the Attorney General's Chief of Staff, Kyle \nSampson, again, on January 1, 2006.\n  So they knew. They knew that just to say President Reagan and \nPresident Clinton each formed a new team when they became President \ncouldn't be used as precedent because it was not an accurate precedent.\n  Despite this, the administration and its defenders have continued to \nargue that firing U.S. attorneys was ``entirely appropriate'' and that \nit was justified because executive branch appointees ``serve at the \npleasure of the President.'' In fact, this had never been done before. \nIn fact, as far as we have been able to find out so far, and they are \nstill researching it--but the Congressional Research Service has told \nus that in the past 25 years, only two U.S. attorneys who served less \nthan a full term have been fired.\n  Interestingly, this talking point about ``serving at the pleasure of \nthe President'' is repeated throughout the documents that have been \nreleased as to what the administration should say when asked about the \nfiring of U.S. attorneys. Specifically, it was listed in several \nversions of a memo that outlined the steps to be taken to execute the \nplan. This, again, is a memo from the Chief of Staff to the Attorney \nGeneral:\n\n       ``Step 3: Prepare to withstand political upheaval.'' We \n     should expect that there will be ``direct and indirect \n     appeals of the Administration's determination to seek these \n     resignations. . . . Recipients of such `appeals' must respond \n     identically . . . U.S. attorneys serve at the pleasure of the \n     President.''\n\n  So those to whom somebody appeals must reinforce this argument: U.S. \nattorneys serve at the pleasure of the President. That little statement \nis meant to cover, I am sorry to say, a multitude of sins.\n  Of course, in the most literal sense, it is true: executive branch \nemployees serve at the pleasure of the President. However, blind \nadherence and single-minded pursuit of this principle ignores that it \nis equally true that our Nation's prosecutors must be independent, they \nmust be objective, and they must pursue justice wherever the facts \nlead.\n  And it ignores that our country is based on the principle of checks \nand balances. Of course, in this instance this means that we must \nreturn Senate confirmation as a certainty to the law, and this is \nexactly what we do in S. 214--we simply return the law to what it was \nbefore that unknown addition was added to the PATRIOT Act \nreauthorization without the knowledge of Senators.\n  Since January when this issue was first raised, the Department of \nJustice has repeatedly stated publicly that it did not intend to avoid \nSenate confirmation. For example, before the Judiciary Committee on \nJanuary 18, 2007, the Attorney General testified that DOJ was ``fully \ncommitted to try and find presidentially appointed, Senate confirmed \nU.S. Attorneys for every position.''\n  However, in e-mails and memos written by his staff, a strategy was \noutlined that does not show a commitment to Senate confirmation. For \nexample, on September 13, 2006, 3 months before the firing call on \nDecember 7, the Attorney General's Chief of Staff sent an e-mail to \nMonica Goodling, liaison between the Department of Justice and the \nWhite House, suggesting that the Department use the new authority \nslipped into the PATRIOT Act reauthorization to facilitate firing U.S. \nattorneys and replacing them with new ones. The e-mail said:\n\n       I strongly recommend that as a matter of administration, we \n     utilize the new statutory provisions that authorize the AG to \n     make [U.S. attorney] appointments.\n\n  Then, the inference is, by avoiding Senate confirmation, the e-mail \ngoes on:\n\n       [W]e can give far less deference to home State Senators and \n     thereby get (1) our preferred person appointed and (2) do it \n     far faster and more efficiently at less political costs to \n     the White House.\n\n  This is only one example of discussions among White House and DOJ \nofficials about the benefits of avoiding the Senate, especially when \nthe home State Senators are Democrats.\n\n  In another example there is an e-mail chain from December 2006 \nbetween the Department of Justice and the White House which discusses \nhow to deal with the opposition of Arkansas' Democratic Senators to the \ninterim appointment of Tim Griffin. I quote:\n\n       ``I think we should gum this to death.'' . . . The longer \n     we can forestall [the Senators saying they will never support \n     Griffin] the better. We should run out the clock . . . ``all \n     of this should be done in `good faith,' of course.''\n\n  The e-mail went on to say:\n\n       Our guy is in there so the status quo is good for us . . . \n     pledge to desire a Senate-confirmed U.S. Attorney; and \n     otherwise hunker down.\n\n  That is an e-mail that deserves a lot of questions. In addition, in a \nNovember 15, 2006, memo regarding the plan to replace U.S. attorneys, \n``Step 2: Senator calls,'' outlines that for my State of California and \nfor Michigan and Washington, the strategy was to have Bill Kelly from \nthe White House call ``the home State `Bush political lead,' '' since \nthere was no Republican home State Senators.\n  So while the Justice Department has said: We consulted with home \nState Senators--that is true only if they were Republican. If they were \nDemocratic home State Senators they were not, in fact, called.\n  I believe all of this adds up to a very complex and very serious \nsituation that now has even more questions that need to be asked and \nanswered under oath. For example, we need to know who from the White \nHouse was involved in these decisions? Was the plan orchestrated by the \nWhite House? Who made these determinations about who to fire and who \nwas involved in the loyalty evaluation? What other U.S. attorneys were \ntargeted for dismissal?\n  We know there were several but their names have been redacted from \nthe documents we have received. We need to know who are they, why were \nthey on the list, and why did they come off the list?\n  What were the real reasons used to determine who would be fired, \nsince the evaluations don't line up with the EARS reports? What role, \nif any, did open public corruption cases play in determining who would \nbe fired? What was the Attorney General's role in the process? What did \nhe know and when did he know it? How can he say he didn't know what was \ngoing on with the firing of the U.S. attorneys, even though the White \nHouse did, and even though there are e-mails showing that he was \nconsulted?\n  Was the change to the law in March of 2006 done in order to \nfacilitate the wholesale replacement of all or a large number of U.S. \nattorneys without Senate confirmation? We know that somebody suggested \nall 93 U.S. attorneys should be replaced, at one point. My question is, \nwas this done to facilitate that?\n  These are just some of the questions I hope our committee will delve \ninto as the investigation continues.\n  Finally, in an e-mail that discussed avoiding the Senate confirmation \nprocess, the Attorney General's Chief of Staff wrote:\n\n       There is some risk that we'll lose the authority [to \n     appoint interim U.S. attorneys indefinitely], but if we don't \n     ever exercise it then what's the point of having it?\n\n\n[[Page S3245]]\n\n\n  Think about that: There is some risk that we will lose the authority \nto appoint U.S. attorneys indefinitely, but if we don't ever exercise \nit, then what is the point of having it?\n  I believe the time has come for the administration to lose that \nauthority. All these unanswered questions and allegations have \ndemonstrated at the very least one real thing: the law must be returned \nto what it was prior to the reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act, and the \nbipartisan bill before the Senate would do just that. Through \nnegotiations with Senator Specter we are now considering legislation \nthat would give the Attorney General authority to appoint an interim \nU.S. attorney but only for 120 days. If after that time the President \nhas not sent up a nominee to the Senate and had that nominee confirmed, \nthen the authority to appoint an interim U.S. attorney will fall to the \ndistrict court.\n  Given all we have learned in the past few months, I believe this is \nthe least we can do to restore the public's faith in an independent \nsystem of justice. This bill will also help prevent any future abuse or \nappearance of politicization of U.S. attorney positions.\n  The legislation also makes it clear that the 120-day limitation \napplies to all the interim U.S. attorneys who are currently in place, \nincluding those who are the result of the Department's actions in \nDecember. These changes are in line with the way the law used to be and \nwould simply be restoring the proper checks and balances that are \nneeded in our system of government.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose all amendments and pass a clean bill.\n  I have noted the distinguished ranking member of the committee is on \nthe Senate floor. Before I yield, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee amendments be considered as original text for the purpose of \nfurther amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I join with the Senator from California \nin urging the adoption of the present legislation.\n  I am a cosponsor of the legislation. I immediately agreed to join \nSenator Feinstein on this matter when she called to my attention the \nsituation in the Southern District of California in San Diego, which \nhad resulted from the provision which was added in the PATRIOT Act re-\nauthorization. That provision had been added in the PATRIOT Act \nconference report and had been available for inspection from December \n8, 2005, when the conference report was filed in the House, and March \n2, 2006, when the report was adopted in the Senate. Though that \nconference report was available for some 85 days, it was not noted \nuntil we saw its application. Then, when the Senator from California \ncalled it to my attention, I immediately said there is a problem here \nand we ought to correct it, and she introduced the bill. I immediately \ncosponsored it.\n  There is no doubt there are major problems which we have to confront \non the requested resignations of eight U.S. attorneys.\n  The President has traditionally had the authority to replace U.S. \nattorneys. That has generally been interpreted, to me, that the \nPresident may replace U.S. attorneys without giving any reason. But I \nthink implicit in the application of replacement of attorneys is you \ncannot replace them for a bad reason, you cannot replace because they \nare seeking to ferret out corrupt politicians, or if they are refusing \nto yield, or not bringing a case the administration thinks ought to be \nbrought. So those are the parameters. When President Clinton took \noffice in 1993, the President replaced some 93 U.S. attorneys, as a \nmatter of fact--of course, without giving any specific reason--and no \none drew any objection to that.\n  We have a situation with respect to the eight U.S. attorneys who have \nbeen asked to resign and caused the current issues as to whether they \nare being replaced for bad reasons.\n  The situation with the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of \nCalifornia, Ms. Carol Lam, raised some issues as to whether she was \nbeing asked to resign because she was pursuing corruption charges which \nresulted in the conviction of former Congressman Duke Cunningham and an \n8-year jail sentence.\n  It has been reported, for example, that U.S. Attorney Lam sent a \nnotice to the Department of Justice saying that there would be two \nsearch warrants and a criminal investigation of a defense contractor \nwho was linked to former Congressman Duke Cunningham.\n  It was further reported that on the very next day, D. Kyle Sampson, \nthe Chief of Staff to Attorney General Gonzales, sent an e-mail message \nto William Kelley in the White House Counsel's Office saying Ms. Lam \nshould be removed as quickly as possible. Now the communique from Mr. \nSampson further reportedly asked Mr. Kelley to call Mr. Sampson to \ndiscuss:\n\n       The real problem we have right now with [U.S. attorney] \n     Carol Lam, that leads me to conclude we should have someone \n     ready to be nominated on 11/18, the day her 4-year term \n     expires.\n\n  Well, the sequence of events raises a question as to whether Ms. Lam \nwas asked to resign because she was hot on the trail of criminal \nconduct relating to the Cunningham case. We do not know. But that is a \nquestion which ought to be inquired into.\n  It is my view, as I review all of these matters, that there are \ndisputed questions as to whether the eight U.S. attorneys who were \nasked to resign were doing their job or whether they were not.\n  There was a very lengthy article in the New York Times yesterday--\nstarts on the first page and continues in the interior of the paper for \na substantial part of another page--where there are issues raised as to \nwhether New Mexico's U.S. Attorney, David C. Iglesias was doing his job \nproperly. There were reports that he was not pursuing prosecutions as \nhe should. Those were relayed to officials in Washington. Those \nofficials, in turn, then relayed them to the Department of Justice. I \nthink it appropriate that if there are complaints, they be relayed to \nthe Department of Justice so an evaluation can be made as to whether \nthey are justified or are not justified. But the person who relays \nthose complaints is acting in the normal course of business and I \nsuggest is doing what ought to be done.\n\n  The Judiciary Committee is capable of ferreting out all of the \nconflicting factors, is capable of getting at the facts and making an \nevaluation. We have a number of members of the Judiciary Committee who \nare experienced attorneys, and enough have specific experience as \nformer prosecutors to be able to make an expert evaluation, so to \nspeak, as to whether the U.S. attorneys were doing their job properly. \nThat is what we ought to undertake at the present time.\n  That, of course, can proceed in due course without affecting the \nlegislation which is pending here today.\n  I think there is no doubt we ought to change the provision of the \nPATRIOT Act which gave the Attorney General the authority to appoint an \ninterim U.S. attorney until the President had submitted another nominee \nand they are confirmed by the Senate, to go back to the old system \nwhere the Attorney General could appoint for 120 days, on an interim \nbasis, and then after that period of time the replacement U.S. attorney \nwould be appointed by the district court.\n  What has occurred here raises broader questions as to whether there \nought to be some standards set by Congress on circumstances which would \nwarrant terminating a U.S. attorney either by firing or by asking the \nU.S. attorney to resign. I certainly think there would be general \nagreement that you should not be able to remove a U.S. attorney either \nby way of firing or asking to resign if that U.S. attorney is pursuing \ncorruption cases or if the U.S. attorney was appropriately not \ninitiating a prosecution. That is a discretionary judgment.\n  A prosecuting attorney vested with broad discretion can abuse that \ndiscretion, and there is case law to that effect. A prosecuting \nattorney's discretion is not unlimited. There is comment published in \nVolume 64 of the Yale Law Journal which goes into that issue in some \ndetail.\n  The question on my mind is whether we ought to use the occasion of \nthis\n\n[[Page S3246]]\n\nlegislation and the attendant controversy about the replacement or \nasking for the resignation of U.S. attorneys to legislate. Congress has \nthe authority to circumscribe, to some extent, the President's \nauthority to remove prosecuting attorneys. The independent counsel \nstatute, for example, provides that the Congress has provided that the \nindependent counsel may be removed by the Attorney General for cause. \nThat is a legitimate exercise of Congress's constitutional authority \nunder article I and does not impinge upon the President's \nconstitutional authority under article II.\n  With respect to independent commissions, such as the Federal Trade \nCommission, the Commissioners may be removed, but it has to have a \nhigher level of showing of impropriety--something in the nature of \nmalfeasance or its equivalent. In taking a look at what might be done, \nthere could be a provision that U.S. attorneys may be removed or asked \nto resign only for cause. But that would impinge upon the President's \ntraditional authority to remove for no reason at all. I have doubts as \nto whether we ought to go that far, but I believe there is a strong \ncase to be made for limiting the authority of the President to remove \nfor a reason which is a bad reason, such as the ones I have mentioned.\n  That kind of legislation would call for a listing of a variety of \nsituations which would justify removal: for example, the U.S. attorney \ncould not be removed for pursuing a corruption investigation; the U.S. \nattorney could not be removed for declining to prosecute in a situation \nwhere that was within the justifiable discretion of the U.S. attorney.\n  This issue has percolated now for some time, and the deeper we get \ninto this issue, the more we think about various aspects which so far \nhave not been examined. My staff and I are looking at the present time \nat such an amendment. I was informed today that a unanimous consent \nagreement was entered into on Thursday which will preclude further \namendments. On this state of the record, any such amendment would be \nout of order. But we intend to pursue it to see if we can structure an \namendment which would make sense. If we do, there is always the option \nof asking for unanimous consent that an additional amendment be \npermitted on this bill under a limited time agreement.\n  I know the majority leader is anxious to move through this \nlegislation and move ahead to other items on the docket. I mention that \npossibility because it is a work in process, and we may find it \nstructurally possible to provide such an amendment which would address \nsome of the underlying problems confronting us in the present \nsituation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a sequence of events \nrelating to the interim appointment of U.S. attorneys in the PATRIOT \nAct reauthorization be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Sequence of Events Relating to the Interim Appointment of U.S. \n              Attorneys in the PATRIOT Act Reauthorization\n\n       The interim US Attorney provision was first raised with \n     staff on November 9, 2005. The provision was discussed at a \n     staff level and was included in the draft PATRIOT Conference \n     report as a separate section and under the title of ``Interim \n     Appointment of US Attorneys'' and was in each of the draft \n     Conference reports circulated by the House Judiciary \n     Committee, which chaired the PATRIOT Conference.\n       The House filed the Conference Report, H. Rept. 109-333 on \n     December 8, 2005. The Conference Report was agreed to on \n     December 14, 2005 in the House (House Roll no. 627). The \n     Conference Report contained Sec. 502, which was clearly \n     visible in the table of contents of the Report and titled as \n     ``Interim Appointment of US Attorneys''; it was not hidden, \n     but was in plain view for all Members to consider.\n       Floor Statements on the Conference Report began in the \n     Senate on November 17, 2005 and ran through the Cloture \n     Motion's initial defeat on December 16, 2005 (Senate vote \n     358) until December 20, 2005. No mention was made of the \n     Interim U.S. Attorney provision in any floor statement during \n     the 24 days the Senate debated the Conference Report in the \n     First Session of the 109th.\n       The Conference Report was raised in floor speeches in the \n     Senate again starting on January 31, 2006. Debate ran until \n     March 2, 2006 when the Senate adopted the Conference Report \n     (Senate vote 29). No mention was made of the Interim U.S. \n     Attorney provision in any floor statement during the 21 days \n     the Senate debated the Conference Report in the Second \n     Session of the 109th.\n       In all, the Senate discussed the PATRIOT Conference Report \n     in some form on the Floor for a total of 45 days. No mention \n     was made of the Interim U.S. Attorney provision even though \n     it was not snuck into a managers' package or included as a \n     technical fix, but was instead clearly labeled and provided \n     its own separate section.\n       Between December 8, 2005, when the Conference Report was \n     filed in the House, and March 2, 2006 when the Report was \n     adopted in the Senate, the Conference Report was open to \n     review for 85 days. During that entire time, the provision \n     was available for all to see.\n       My staff searched the Congressional Record for the 85 day \n     period in which the Conference Report was under \n     consideration. There was no objection made to Section 502 or \n     the Interim U.S. Attorney provision in either the House or \n     the Senate during that period. The provision was in no way \n     ``slipped'' into the PATRIOT Act Reauthorization.\n       Indeed, subsequent to the adoption of the PATRIOT \n     Conference Report, the Congress adopted a legislative package \n     to make additional modifications to the PATRIOT Act. No one \n     requested any modification or elimination of the interim US \n     Attorney provision from the Conference Report in that \n     legislation.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I note the presence of my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Leahy, and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania.\n  First, I thank the Senators who began this debate. I have been told a \nnumber of family matters changed the ability of some to be here.\n  Over the last several months, the Judiciary Committee has used \nhearings, investigation, and oversight to uncover an abuse of power \nthat threatens the independence of U.S. Attorney's Offices around the \ncountry and the trust of all Americans in the independence of our \nFederal law enforcement officials. We have probed the mass firings of \nU.S. attorneys. We are trying to get to the truth in order to prevent \nthese kinds of abuses from happening again.\n  So today, the Senate finally begins debate on S. 214; that is, the \nPreserving United States Attorney Independence Act of 2007. The bill \nwas initially introduced by Senator Feinstein and me on January 9. On \nJanuary 18 during a hearing on oversight of the Department of Justice, \nwe asked the Attorney General about these firings. We then followed up \nwith two hearings devoted to the matter on February 6 and March 6. I \nplaced the bill on the agenda for the Judiciary Committee's first \nbusiness meeting on January 25 but action on the measure was delayed \nuntil our meeting on February 8. At the time we debated the bill, \nconsidered and rejected amendments, and the committee on a bipartisan \nbasis voted 13 to 6 to report favorably the Feinstein-Specter-Leahy \nsubstitute.\n  We have sought Senate consideration of this bill for more than a \nmonth now, but Republican objections have prevented that debate and \nvote. But through the majority leader's persistence, he was ultimately \nable to obtain consent to proceed to this measure today. I thank all \nSenators for finally allowing it to go forward.\n  My friend from California, Senator Feinstein, gave our bill a \nstraightforward title: ``The Preserving United States Attorney \nIndependence Act of 2007.'' We need to close the loophole exploited by \nthe Department of Justice and the White House that facilitated this \nabuse.\n  The bill we have before us was initially fought by the Department of \nJustice when it was in committee. It appears that even after these \nscandals, there are people there who want to continue to have this \nloophole that has been so badly misused. But likely because of the \npublic outcry against the administration's attempt to maintain that \nloophole and the ability to do what no one intended them to do, we\n\n[[Page S3247]]\n\nhad a meeting in my office on March 8 in which the Attorney General \nfinally said the administration would no longer oppose this bill. So I \ntrust that tomorrow when the Senate votes on this legislation, we will \npass it and take a step toward restoring the independence of Federal \nlaw enforcement in this country.\n  Even if we pass the bill, the Judiciary Committee will continue to \ninvestigate the firings. We will summon whoever is needed to learn the \ntruth. What we have already learned from the few documents we have seen \nfrom the Department of Justice appear to confirm the Attorney General, \nofficials at the Department of Justice, and officials at the White \nHouse had previously misled Congress and the American people about the \nmass firings and the reasons behind them.\n  The most fundamental problem is that this administration has \napparently insisted on corrupting Federal law enforcement by injecting \ncrassly partisan objectives into the selection and evaluation and \nfiring and replacement of top Federal law enforcement officers around \nour country--our U.S. attorneys.\n  When you corrupt it at that level, at the prosecutor level, you \naffect everybody--all the police, all the investigators, all the agents \nwho report to the U.S. Attorney's Office--because if they think the \ninvestigations they carry out have to reflect certain partisan \npolitics, then they cannot do their job. Ultimately, it hurts not just \nthe people in law enforcement, it hurts every man and woman in the \nUnited States of America.\n  We have heard the Attorney General and even the President use what \nWilliam Schneider has called the ``past exonerative'' tense in \nconceding ``mistakes were made.'' The ``past exonerative'' tense. I \nremember conjugating my verbs in grade school. We learned about verbs, \nadjectives, adverbs, everything else. I guess it took this \nadministration to bring up the ``past exonerative'' tense. Sister Mary \nGonzaga probably would have wondered what I was saying had I come up \nwith that when I was in school.\n  Now let's take a look at their use of this ``past exonerative'' \ntense. Attorney General Gonzales has yet to specify what mistakes he \nmade. So what mistakes were made? Was it a mistake to allow the White \nHouse, through the President's top political operative and his White \nHouse counsel, to force the firing of a number of high-performing, \nBush-appointed U.S. attorneys? Or when he says ``mistakes were made,'' \ndid he mean it was a mistake for the President and his top political \noperatives to tell the Attorney General and others in the Department \nabout concerns that U.S. attorneys are not pushing fast enough or hard \nenough to indict Democrats but were pushing too hard and too fast in \nindicting corrupt Republicans? Was that the past mistake the President \nand the Attorney General meant? Or when the Attorney General and the \nPresident say ``past mistakes were made,'' did they mean it was a \nmistake to generate, with White House political operatives, a hit list \nfor firing hard-working U.S. attorneys and to ensure that what they \ncall--and these were their words--``loyal Bushies'' are retained? Or \nwhen they say ``mistakes were made,'' did they mean it was a mistake to \nname more ``loyal Bushies'' to replace those U.S. attorneys who have \nshown the kind of independence they are supposed to show in exercising \ntheir law enforcement authority and who have acted without fear or \nfavor based on political party?\n\n  Because when a crime is committed, you do not ask whether the victim \nwas a Republican or a Democrat. You ask if a crime was committed. If a \ncrime was committed, you expect the prosecutor to prosecute. You do not \nexpect them to be fired if they step on the toes of either political \nparty.\n  This is an administration that seeks to justify its unilateralism by \nan expansive application of what it calls a ``unitary executive \ntheory''--everything comes from the President on down. But do you know \nwhat. With all that authority and all that control, when they get \ncaught with their hand in the cookie jar all of a sudden no one knows \nanything, no one can remember anything, no one did anything, and no one \ntold the President. ``Oh, my goodness gracious, we didn't know this \nhappened until we picked up the papers.'' Obviously, they did not know \nit happened when they were testifying up here under oath the first time \naround to tell us what happened.\n  Instead, ``mistakes were made.'' Is the only ``mistake'' they are now \nwilling to concede their failure to cover up the White House influence \nover the Justice Department? Is the only ``mistake'' they will admit \nthat they got caught in a series of misleading statements to Congress, \nthe media, and the American people? I still wonder if those in the \nadministration or the Attorney General understand the seriousness of \nthis problem.\n  Of course, mistakes were made. That is why we are here. It is our \noversight duty to discover who made those mistakes and how and why they \nmade them. I have said many times, the Members of the Senate and the \nMembers of the other body should never be rubberstamps. We are elected \nindependently. We respond to the American people. We are supposed to \nask questions when something happens.\n  What we have seen so far corrupts the Federal law enforcement \nfunction. It has cast a cloud over all U.S. attorneys. Now every U.S. \nattorney is under that cloud. People are asking: If they were not \nfired, if they were kept on, is that because they are ``loyal \nBushies''? Does that mean they will only go after crime if it hurts \nDemocrats but not if it hurts Republicans? What an awful signal to send \nto law enforcement. This is a crippling signal to send to law \nenforcement.\n  Those fired have had their reputations rehabilitated to some degree \nby coming forward as we have publicly examined the facts of their \nfirings. But those circumstances raise questions with respect to those \nretained and what they had to do to please the White House political \noperatives in order to keep their jobs. The mass firings have thus \nserved to undermine the confidence of the American people in the \nDepartment of Justice and their local U.S. attorneys.\n  A recent study of Federal investigations of elected officials and \ncandidates shows a political slant in the Bush Justice Department in \npublic corruption cases. The study found that between 2001 and 2006, 79 \npercent of the elected officials and candidates who have faced a \nFederal investigation were Democrats and only 18 percent Republicans. \nIt seems their track record is wanting, and they have been caught again \nwith their hand in the cookie jar.\n  Of course the President has the power to appoint U.S. attorneys. \nNobody questions that. What is raising concerns is the apparent abuse \nof that authority by removing U.S. attorneys for improper reasons. In \nthe same way any employer has the power to hire, we know people cannot \nbe fired because they are Catholic or because of their race or because \nthey are whistleblowers.\n  The power of employment is not without limit. It can be abused. When \nit is abused in connection with political influence over Federal law \nenforcement, the American people and those of us who are entrusted with \nthe power to represent them have a right to be concerned. We need the \nfacts. We do not need more spin. We do not need another cover story. We \ndo not need another ``We will come up to the Hill. We will brief you on \nthis. Let's have a quiet little briefing. We will tell you what is \ngoing on.'' And then we pick up the paper 2 days later and find out \nwhat they left out.\n  Oh, I want a briefing, all right. I want a briefing where they stand \nbefore us and raise their right hand and swear to tell the truth, the \nwhole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. Then we will \nask them questions; both Democrats and Republicans will. And the \nAmerican people will be able to determine who is telling the truth.\n  I made no secret during our confirmation proceedings of my concern \nwhether Mr. Gonzales could serve as an independent Attorney General on \nbehalf of the American people and leave behind his role as counselor to \nPresident Bush.\n  As the Nation's chief Federal law enforcement officer, he must carry \nout his responsibilities and exercise his awesome authority on behalf \nof the American people. He has to enforce the law. He has to honor the \nrule of law. He\n\n[[Page S3248]]\n\nmust act with the independence necessary to investigate and prosecute \nwrongdoing without fear or favor.\n  The political interests of the President cannot be his guiding light. \nWhen he said as recently as January 18 at our hearing that the \nPresident is his ``principal,'' when he says in an interview he wears \ntwo hats--as a member of the President's staff and as head of the \nJustice Department--then he has forgotten what the Attorney General is.\n  The President has a lawyer. The President has counsel. It is not the \nAttorney General. This is not the Attorney General of the President. \nThis is the Attorney General of the United States of America. His \nclients are the American people and his principles must be devoid of \npartisan politics. He is not there as the President's loyal counsel. He \nis there as the Attorney General of the United States of America, for \nevery single one of us. His mission is not to provide legalistic \nexcuses or defenses for unlawful actions of the administration, such as \nthe warrantless wiretapping of Americans or the use of torture and the \nissuing of signing statements to excuse following the law. He is not \nthe one who should be excusing this kind of outrageous conduct. He \nshould enforce the law. He should ensure that Federal law enforcement \nis above politics. What kind of signal do we send to our Federal law \nenforcement agencies if we suggest to them they cannot do their job \nwithout checking the political credentials of the people they are \ninvestigating?\n\n  The President can pick anybody he wants to serve on his White House \nstaff--and he does. But when it comes to the U.S. Department of Justice \nand to the U.S. attorneys in our home States, Senators have a say and a \nstake in ensuring fairness and independence to prevent the Federal law \nenforcement function from untoward political influence. That is why the \nlaw and the practice has always been these appointments require Senate \nconfirmation. The advice and consent check on the appointment power is \na critical function of the Senate. That is what this administration \ninsisted be eliminated. They wanted to do away with that check and \nbalance. They wanted to do away with the confirmation process. So they \nhad inserted in the reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act a provision to \nremove limits on the ability of the Attorney General to name an interim \nU.S. attorney. That is what our bill intends to restore.\n  We have seen again the effects of letting politics infiltrate the \nDepartment and undermine its independence and the independence of its \nlaw enforcement function. As we have learned more about these events \nover the last few months, I was reminded of a dark time some 30 years \nago when President Nixon forced the firing of the Watergate prosecutor \nArchibald Cox. Not since what came to be known as the ``Saturday Night \nMassacre'' have we witnessed anything of that magnitude. The calls to \nthe U.S. attorneys across the country last December, by which they were \nforced to resign, were extraordinary.\n  Unlike during the Watergate scandal, there is no Elliott Richardson \nor William Ruckelshaus seeking to defend the independence of the \nFederal prosecutors. Instead, we have a cabal of the Attorney General, \nthe Deputy Attorney General, the Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys in \nthe White House, all apparently collaborating in efforts to sack a \nnumber of outstanding U.S. attorneys. Then when it becomes public and \nwhen the first time in 6 years the House and Senate actually dare ask \nquestions about what is going on, the administration, amazed they have \nbeen questioned about their actions, starts a series of shifting \nexplanations and excuses. Lack of accountability or acknowledgment of \nthe seriousness of this matter makes it all the more troubling.\n  The Attorney General's initial response at our January 18 hearing \nwhen we asked about these matters was to brush aside any suggestion \nthat politics and the appearance of ongoing corruption investigations \nwere factors in the mass firings. But now we know that contrary to what \nhe told us then, these factors did play a role in this troubling \nproject.\n  Today and tomorrow we can take a step forward by fixing the statutory \nexcess that opened the door to these untoward actions. I commend \nSenator Feinstein for leading this effort. I commend Senator Specter \nfor joining her. We have all cosponsored the substitute to restore the \nstatutory checks that have existed for the last 20 years. It is time to \ntake that first step toward restoring independence by rolling back a \nchange in law that has contributed to this abuse.\n  There have been no good answers to our questions about why the \nadministration removed U.S. attorneys without having anybody lined up \nto replace them or why home State Democratic Senators were not \nconsulted in advance. There is no explanation for why there are now 22 \nout of the 93 districts with acting or interim U.S. attorneys instead \nof Senate-confirmed U.S. attorneys.\n  I look at this in light of my own experience. I am very proud of the \nfact I was a prosecutor. The only thing in my personal office that has \nmy name on it is a plaque from my prosecutor's office presented to me \nby the police when I left office, and it also has my shield, my badge \nas a prosecutor. I used to instill in the police and those prosecutors \nwho worked for me: You don't take sides. Nobody is a Democrat or a \nRepublican when crimes are committed. We don't take sides. If you keep \nemphasizing this and proving it by the way you carry out your office, \nthen police work better, investigators work better, courts work better, \nthe grand juries work better, because they know you are not playing \npolitics. The American public, whoever is within the area the \nprosecutor represents, feels safer because they know you are not \nplaying favorites. I lived my life that way as a prosecutor and I know \nmany Republicans and Democratic Senators in this Chamber who are former \nprosecutors did the same.\n  I am worried that even successfully restoring the law is not going to \nundo the damage done to the American people's confidence in Federal law \nenforcement. For that, we need to get to the truth and real \naccountability. But then I think all of us in both parties now, and no \nmatter who holds the White House 2 years from now, must renew a \ncommitment to insulate Federal law enforcement officers from the \ncorrupting influence of partisan politics and the corrosive influence \nof White House intrusion into law enforcement activities.\n  Mr. President, I will have more to say on this later. I see my friend \nfrom Arizona who has been waiting patiently, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of my remarks a letter I wrote to all of my colleagues in \nthe Senate, dated March 19, regarding interviewing U.S. attorneys be \nadded to my statement as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, there has been a lot of discussion over the \ncourse of the last couple of hours about the firing of seven U.S. \nattorneys and a lot of speculation about why that occurred. I suggest \nit is important to find out the facts and then we can quit speculating \nand we will know what those facts were.\n  I wish to change the subject a little bit to what we are going to do \nabout it. Actually, the Judiciary Committee passed a bill which is on \nthe floor and will be amended tomorrow, I hope, and then we will vote \non that bill tomorrow. It relates to what was conceived to be at least \npart of the problem here. The problem was that in the PATRIOT Act, a \nprovision of law relating to appointment of U.S. attorneys was amended \nto allow the Attorney General to put into office what is called an \ninterim U.S. attorney who would never have to come before the Senate \nfor confirmation. Early on, there was speculation that the reason these \nseven U.S. attorneys were asked to resign was so the administration \ncould put someone else in their place without going through the regular \nconfirmation process of a nominee by the President. Except for the U.S. \nattorney in Arkansas, however, there appears to be no evidence that was \nthe case.\n  In the case of Arizona, for example, it is clear it was not the case. \nThere was no one ready to be appointed as interim U.S. attorney. In \nfact, Senator McCain and I have recommended an individual to the \nPresident for his consideration to be nominated to fill the\n\n[[Page S3249]]\n\nvacancy that now exists. Nonetheless, there was concern this statute \nshouldn't remain on the books, that it shouldn't be that the Attorney \nGeneral can appoint an interim U.S. attorney who never has to come to \nthe Senate for confirmation.\n  I think there is a general consensus that that statute should be \nchanged and that the President should nominate people and the Senate \nshould have an opportunity to act on the nomination.\n  An interesting thing has occurred, however. The legislation which has \nbeen proposed doesn't achieve the objective. It doesn't even begin to \nachieve the objective. So I drafted an amendment which I will be \noffering tomorrow that actually achieves the objectives. It says: The \nPresident has to nominate to fill the vacancy and the Congress has to \nact on the nomination, and it provides a very strong incentive for the \nPresident to comply with the law because if he doesn't, then Congress's \nrequirement to act on any of his U.S. attorney nominations for the \nentire remainder of his term is vitiated. So if he wants strong and \nquick action by Congress on his nominees, he has to do his part and \nactually nominate somebody within the 120 days required by my \namendment.\n  Now, that achieves both objectives we are trying to achieve here: \nthat the President will actually nominate and the Congress will have a \nchance to act on the nomination. The underlying bill, unfortunately, \ndoes not achieve that objective. It reverts to the old law which \ndoesn't require the President to nominate, and if he doesn't, it has \nU.S. district court judges nominating U.S. attorneys, something they \ndon't want to do and they haven't been very good at, and, in any event, \nconfuses their article 3 responsibilities with the article 2 \nresponsibilities of U.S. attorneys. It is not a good idea, and it \ndoesn't solve the problem that people perceive existed.\n  My amendment also eliminates the current statute relating to interim \nnominees so the President could no longer appoint these interim \nnominees who would have to be confirmed by the Senate, or at least \nacted upon by the Senate. So I believe my amendment goes directly to \nthe concern that our Democratic colleagues have had regarding this \nissue. I would hope politics wouldn't play a part in the consideration \nof my amendment. This issue generally has been so politicized--\neverybody has chosen up teams. I would hope that conversation would not \nbe confused with the practical solution to the problem everybody has \nagreed exists, and that Members on both sides, in a very clear-eyed \nway, could consider which of the solutions represents the best option \nof solving the problem.\n  My colleague Senator Sessions has a proposed solution which, in the \nevent my amendment were not adopted, I would support as well, because \nit at least improves somewhat on the underlying bill. But the reality \nis we shouldn't have Federal district judges making these nominations, \nand if our goal is to have the President make the nomination and enable \nthe Senate to act on the nomination, the only amendment that does that \nis my amendment.\n  I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to remember we are not \nalways going to have a Republican President and a Democratic Senate. We \nare going to have a Democratic President some day and a Democratic \nSenate or a Republican Senate or a Republican President and a \nRepublican Senate. All the permutations will exist and politics should \nplay no role in it. We should want the President to nominate to fill \nthe vacancy and we should want the Congress to have a chance to act on \nthat nomination. That is what my amendment provides.\n  The committee-passed bill, the number is S. 214, restores the interim \nU.S. attorney appointment statute that existed between 1986 and 2006. \nAs I said, that system, which delegates to Federal judges the authority \nto appoint interim attorneys, has several flaws. First, as I said, S. \n214 does not ensure the President will nominate a U.S. attorney. \nWhoever serves in a district should be someone who is nominated by the \nPresident, not a district judge. It is the President, not the district \ncourt, who is charged by the Constitution with ensuring that the laws \nare faithfully executed. It is the President's job to enforce the law. \nTo do that effectively, he needs to have in place U.S. attorneys who \nare accountable to him. If he is not bringing important prosecutions or \nenforcing particular statutes, he and his superiors need to be held \naccountable. But if that U.S. attorney were appointed by a district \njudge, there is no one to complain to. Judges, after all, have lifetime \ntenure. It is only by ensuring that U.S. attorneys are appointed by the \nPresident that we can ensure there is ultimate accountability in the \nsystem.\n  This is, after all, the way in which the Constitution envisioned that \naccountability for enforcing the laws would be charged--by charging the \nPresident with the duty to enforce the law.\n  The second flaw in the underlying bill is that the Senate has no say \nin the selection of U.S. attorneys appointed by a district judge. One \nof the major complaints about the administration's handling of the \ninterim U.S. attorney appointment authority is that it did not consult \nwith home State Senators; that, in fact, some individuals sought to use \nthe authority to avoid consulting with Senators.\n  It is right that the Senate take action in an effort to protect its \nprerogatives, but letting judges pick U.S. attorneys does not protect \nthe Senate's rights. Senators have absolutely no say in the selection \nof a U.S. attorney who is picked by a judge. There is no confirmation \nof the judge's selection as there is when the President nominates \nsomeone. This system, which S. 214 puts back in place, is a solution \nthat doesn't solve the problem that we have set out to address.\n  There is a third problem with this underlying bill. The judges don't \nwant the authority. In the past, when district judges have had the \nauthority to appoint interim U.S. attorneys, some have simply refused \nto do so. Incidentally, the statutory language is ``may,'' not \n``shall.'' If they don't appoint judges, then the very concern that the \nDemocratic Senators have had that an interim U.S. attorney is appointed \nand serves is exactly what happens. So judges don't want the authority, \nand there have been at least three such occasions during the current \nBush administration when a district judge has refused to appoint an \ninterim U.S. attorney and, in fact, they have had good reason. It is at \nleast a potential conflict of interest for the district judge, who \npresides over criminal cases, to also select a U.S. attorney who \nprosecutes those cases. It is for this reason that some judges have \nrefused to intervene in this area and select U.S. attorneys.\n  Yet with the committee-reported bill, we once again foist this \nauthority on the judges. Why are we doing this--restoring power to the \ndistrict judges that those judges don't want and have refused to use in \nthe first place? Why are we forcing them to take actions that judges \nthemselves, for good reason, see as a potential conflict of interest?\n  There is a fourth reason why this is not a good idea. Unfortunately, \nsome district judges have not acquitted themselves very well when they \nhave exercised the power to appoint U.S. attorneys. A Federal district \njudge may have the measure of the legal abilities of the lawyers who \npractice in his district, but he has no way to gauge their managerial \nskills, which is an important quality in a successful U.S. attorney. A \ndistrict judge doesn't even have access to a candidate's personnel file \nand would not know of potentially disqualifying information or \nconflicts of interest in that file.\n  Allow me to describe two cases under the old system where the \nappointment of a U.S. attorney by a district judge led to a situation \nthat can only be described as a fiasco:\n  In the Southern District of West Virginia, in 1987, the U.S. attorney \nfor the District of West Virginia was confirmed to be a Federal judge. \nWhen the term of the interim U.S. attorney expired, the chief district \njudge appointed another individual as U.S. attorney. This individual \nwas not a Justice Department employee and had not undergone an FBI \nbackground investigation. The court's appointee came into office and \nstarted asking about ongoing public integrity investigations, including \ninvestigations involving the mayor of Charleston and the State's \nGovernor. Not only were this mayor\n\n[[Page S3250]]\n\nand Governor under investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office at the \ntime, both were later indicted and convicted of various Federal crimes.\n  The first assistant U.S. attorney, who knew that the district court's \nU.S. attorney had not undergone a background investigation, believed \nthat these inquiries about pending investigations of local politicians \nwere inappropriate and reported them to the Executive Office for United \nStates Attorneys in Washington, DC. The Justice Department eventually \nhad to remove the investigative files involving the Governor from that \nU.S. Attorney's Office for safekeeping. The Justice Department also had \nto direct the court's appointee to recuse herself from some criminal \nmatters until a background check could be completed. This situation \nwasn't resolved until another U.S. attorney was confirmed by the \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, at the very time that some Democrats are suggesting \nthat it just might be--there is no evidence, but it just might be that \none or more of these U.S. attorneys was removed because they were hot \non the trail of some Republican officeholder, they were involved in a \npolitical investigation or an investigation of a political person, and \nthat was the reason they were removed--again, there is no evidence, but \nthat is the suggestion--why would you want to substitute for that \nsituation a statute that goes back to the way it used to be, which \nallowed the same thing to occur as in the case in West Virginia that I \njust cited? Why not change the situation so that the President must \nnominate, and the Senate explicitly has a right to act on that nominee \nby either confirming or rejecting the nominee?\n\n  That is the check and balance we need, rather than going back to the \nway it used to be, where the judge can appoint and we end up with \nproblems like this involving investigations of political corruption.\n  Another case occurred in the District of South Dakota. In 2005, when \nthe term of an interim U.S. attorney was about to expire, the chief \ndistrict judge told the Justice Department he wanted to appoint an \nindividual who didn't have any Federal prosecutorial experience, had \nnot undergone a background check, and did not have the necessary \nsecurity clearances. The Justice Department strenuously objected. Once \nthe Justice Department believed the matter had been resolved, the \nAttorney General appointed another candidate. A Federal judge executed \nthe oath of office for this appointee and copies of the Attorney \nGeneral's order were sent to the district court.\n  Ten days later, the Justice Department received a fax indicating that \nthe chief district judge had changed his mind and ``appointed'' the \nearlier, unacceptable candidate as U.S. attorney.\n  This created a situation where two different people claimed to be the \nU.S. attorney for the District of South Dakota. Defense lawyers \nrepresenting criminal defendants in the district indicated that they \nwould challenge ongoing investigations and cases on the basis that they \ncould not know who was in charge. The chief judge then refused to \nnegotiate a resolution to the situation. Eventually, in order to \nprotect ongoing criminal cases, the President was forced to resolve the \nsituation by firing the district judge's U.S. attorney. The matter was \nnot completely resolved until another U.S. attorney was confirmed by \nthe Senate the next year.\n  Don't we want to avoid this situation in the future? We are going to \nbe asking for this kind of problem if we pass S. 214, the bill pending \nbefore us now. Far better it would be to adopt the amendment that I \nwill offer that precludes this from occurring.\n  Let me point out another very serious problem that I don't think the \nauthors of the legislation have even thought of or they clearly would \nhave tried to fix it. S. 214 does not prevent the Attorney General from \nmaking multiple consecutive appointments of the same interim U.S. \nattorney. In other words, the very thing they are afraid of--that the \nPresident got rid of these people so the Attorney General could put his \nown person in office--is precisely what would be permitted under the \nbill pending before the Senate because it reinstates the exact language \nthat existed before the statute was amended in 2006: the Attorney \nGeneral could make consecutive 120-day appointments of interim U.S. \nattorneys.\n  Has this ever been done? There is at least one case where the \nAttorney General appointed a U.S. attorney to four consecutive 120-day \ninterim terms. Well, that is a year and a half, by my reckoning. This \nincident occurred in the Eastern District of Oklahoma during the years \n2000 and 2001. As a result, that district had an interim U.S. attorney \nwho had been appointed by the Attorney General for over a year. \nSimilarly, in Florida, in 2005, an interim U.S. attorney was appointed \nby the Attorney General. After the 120-day term ran out, the Attorney \nGeneral appointed that individual to another interim term. After that \nterm ran out, the Attorney General appointed him to a third interim \nterm.\n  This practice is what the language of the 1986 law allowed. It is the \nsame language that is in the bill that is before us now. It is obvious \nthat much of the impetus for the present legislation is a desire to \nrein in the Attorney General's authority to appoint interim U.S. \nattorneys without Senate confirmation. Yet I submit that such power \nhasn't exactly been ``reined in,'' and the Senate's prerogatives are \nnot protected, by a system that allows the Attorney General to make \nconsecutive appointments of non-Senate-confirmed U.S. attorneys, which \nis precisely what the bill before us would allow. That system clearly \nfalls short of ensuring that U.S. attorneys are subject to U.S. Senate \nconfirmation, which is one of our two goals.\n  Finally, I note that S. 214's system of judge-made interim \nappointments is duplicative of the designation of acting U.S. attorneys \nunder the Vacancies Act. We are effectively creating two different and \nredundant systems for appointing ``temporary'' U.S. attorneys. That \nmakes no sense and creates obvious potential problems. For example, \nthis system would make it possible for an individual to be \nconsecutively designated as an acting U.S. attorney and serve in that \npost for 210 days and then be appointed as interim U.S. attorney and \nserve another 120 days. So he can be reappointed and reappointed again, \nif the Attorney General wanted to do so. This is nearly a whole year \nthat someone could serve as U.S. attorney without ever being confirmed \nor acted upon by the Senate, without the nomination ever being sent to \nus.\n  Mr. President, we can all agree there is a problem. The solution, \nwhich was very quickly devised, is not a solution at all, as I have \ndemonstrated. We can do better. There is nothing partisan about what I \nsuggest. It would work equally for Republican and Democratic Presidents \nand Republican and Democratic Senates. To that end, I will offer an \namendment on Tuesday that will achieve these goals of ensuring that \nU.S. attorneys are promptly nominated by the President and that the \nSenate has an opportunity to act on the nomination.\n  My amendment, again, requires that the President nominate a U.S. \nattorney candidate within 120 days of vacancy. It then requires that \nthe Senate consider the nomination within 120 days after it is \nsubmitted. In order to encourage the President to abide by these time \nlimits, the amendment provides that if the President fails to nominate \nan attorney candidate in any district within the time limit, then the \n120-day limit on Senate consideration is vitiated for all U.S. attorney \nnominations for the remainder of the President's term in office. In \neffect, in order to enjoy the substantial benefits of prompt Senate \nconsideration of his nominees, the President would be required to, \nhimself, nominate promptly.\n  My amendment makes one other important change. It completely repeals \nthe interim U.S. attorney statute, as I said, which is what people have \ngotten all concerned about in the first instance but seem to have \nforgotten. The interim authority is unnecessary in light of the \nVacancies Act and has caused a host of problems. By repealing this \nauthority, my amendment would effectively bar the President or a judge \nfrom appointing any long-term U.S. attorney without Senate \nconfirmation. Any temporary gap in the office of U.S. attorney would be \naddressed by the Vacancies Act, which applies to all Senate-confirmed \nexecutive appointments and allows another employee or officer--\npresumptively the first assistant--to carry out the function and duties \nof the office subject to various time limits and other requirements.\n\n[[Page S3251]]\n\n  Mr. President, especially those who are upset about recent events \nshould support a complete repeal of the interim authority. It is only a \ncomplete repeal that will ensure that U.S. attorneys are appointed by \nthe President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. It is \nonly a complete repeal that will prevent consecutive appointments of \nU.S. attorneys by the Attorney General. It is only a complete repeal \nthat will prevent the stacking of the interim and acting terms as U.S. \nattorney. Only a complete repeal ensures that Senators will always have \na say in who serves for the long term as the U.S. attorney in their \nState.\n  The interim appointment authority has lately become a contentious and \nvery politicized issue. It need not be. It is particularly in times \nsuch as these that the Senate must do what was designated by the \nFramers to do: cool the passions and look to the long term. I hope my \ncolleagues will do this when I present my amendment tomorrow. I hope we \nwill lay partisanship aside and that my amendment will be supported.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                   U.S. Senate\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 19, 2007.\n     Re Interim U.S. Attorneys.\n\n       Dear Colleague: There is a consensus that the changes made \n     to the interim U.S. attorney statute, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 546, by \n     the Patriot Improvement and Reauthorization Act, Pub. L. 109-\n     177, were a mistake. It is my hope that we will not compound \n     that mistake with another--namely, involving Federal district \n     judges in the appointment of U.S. attorneys.\n       During Monday's debate and Tuesday's vote, I urge you to \n     consider that in the future both Democrats and Republicans \n     will control the Senate, and both a Democrat and a Republican \n     will serve as President. The solution that we adopt should be \n     one that we are ready to live with under all combinations of \n     these circumstances. It should be a solution that ensures \n     that the President timely nominates U.S. attorneys, and that \n     those U.S. attorneys are subject to confirmation by the \n     Senate.\n       S. 214, the committee-reported U.S. attorneys bill, does \n     not meet these goals. My proposed amendment does. S. 214 \n     restores the interim U.S. attorney appointment statute that \n     existed between 1986 and 2006. That statute, which delegates \n     to Federal judges the authority to appoint interim U.S. \n     attorneys, has several flaws. First, it does not ensure that \n     the President will nominate a U.S. attorney. Second, the \n     Senate has no say in the selection of a U.S. attorney who is \n     appointed by a district judge.\n       Moreover, judges do not want this authority. Some have \n     simply refused to appoint interim U.S. attorneys, finding it \n     a potential conflict of interest for the district judge who \n     presides over criminal cases to also select the U.S. attorney \n     who would prosecute those cases. And finally, some district \n     judges have not acquitted themselves well when they have \n     exercised the power to appoint U.S. attorneys. A Federal \n     district judge may have the measure of the legal abilities of \n     the lawyers who practice in his district, but he is in no \n     position to gauge an individual's management skill--an \n     important quality in a successful U.S. attorney. A district \n     judge does not even have access to a candidate's personnel \n     file and would not know of disqualifying information in that \n     file or of potential conflicts of interest.\n       An additional problem, which may be of concern to those who \n     are eager to respond to recent events, is that the permissive \n     language of the pre-2006 statute--the same language that S. \n     214 restores--was understood to allow the Attorney General to \n     make consecutive 120-day appointments of interim U.S. \n     attorneys. In at least one case, the Attorney General \n     appointed a U.S. attorney to four consecutive 120-day \n     ``interim'' terms. Such a system falls short of ensuring that \n     U.S. attorneys are subject to Senate confirmation. And \n     finally, S. 214's approach is duplicative of the designation \n     of Acting U.S. attorneys under the Vacancies Act, 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3345 et seq., and potentially allows an individual to be \n     consecutively designated as an Acting U.S. attorney, and then \n     as an interim U.S. attorney--again avoiding Senate \n     confirmation for a substantial period of time.\n       I believe that we can do better. To that end, I will offer \n     an amendment on Tuesday that will achieve our goals of \n     ensuring that U.S. attorneys are promptly nominated by the \n     President and that the Senate has an opportunity to act on \n     those nominations. My amendment: (1) Would require the \n     President to nominate a U.S. attorney candidate within 120 \n     days of a vacancy. It then would require the Senate to \n     consider the nomination within 120 days after it is \n     submitted. In order to encourage the President to abide by \n     these time limits, the amendment also would provide that if \n     the President fails to nominate a U.S. attorney candidate in \n     any district within the time limit, the l20-day limit on \n     Senate consideration is vitiated for all U.S. attorney \n     nominations for the remainder of that President's term in \n     office. In effect, in order to enjoy the substantial benefits \n     of prompt Senate consideration of his nominees, the President \n     would be required to nominate promptly.\n       Finally, my amendment: (2) Would completely repeal the \n     interim U.S. attorney statute, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 546. The \n     interim authority is unnecessary in light of the Vacancies \n     Act and has caused a host of problems. By repealing this \n     authority, my amendment would effectively bar the President \n     (or a judge) from appointing any long-term U.S. attorney \n     without Senate confirmation. Any temporary gap in the office \n     of U.S. attorney would be addressed by the Vacancies Act, \n     which applies to all Senate-confirmed executive appointments \n     and allows another employee or officer (presumptively the \n     First Assistant) to carry out the functions and duties of the \n     office subject to various time limits and other requirements.\n       The interim appointment authority has lately become a \n     contentious and very politicized issue. It need not be. It is \n     particularly in times like these that the Senate must do what \n     it was designed by the Framers to do: To cool the passions \n     and look to the long term. I hope that you will do so--and \n     that you will support my amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                          Jon Kyl.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 459\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I call up my amendment which, I understand, \nis at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 459.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To ensure that United States attorneys are promptly nominated \nby the President, and are appointed by and with the advice and consent \n                             of the Senate)\n\n       On page 2, strike line 10 and all that follows and insert \n     the following:\n\n     SEC. 2. PROMPT NOMINATION AND CONFIRMATION OF UNITED STATES \n                   ATTORNEYS.\n\n       Section 541 of title 28, United States Code is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subsections (b) and (c) as subsections \n     (c) and (d), respectively; and\n       (2) by inserting after subsection (a) the following:\n       ``(b)(1) Not later than 120 days after the date on which a \n     vacancy occurs in the office of United States attorney for a \n     judicial district, the President shall submit an appointment \n     for that office to the Senate.\n       ``(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), not later than \n     120 days after the date of the submission of an appointment \n     under paragraph (1), the Senate shall vote on that \n     appointment.\n       ``(3) If the President fails to comply with paragraph (1) \n     with regard to the submission of any appointment for the \n     office of United States attorney, paragraph (2) of this \n     subsection shall have no force or effect with regard to any \n     appointment to the office of United States attorney during \n     the remainder of the term of office of that President.''.\n\n     SEC. 3. REPEAL OF INTERIM APPOINTMENT AUTHORITY.\n\n       Section 546 of title 28, United States Code, is repealed.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kyl for his work and \nthoughtfulness on this subject. A situation that has always caused \nenemies is when judges--the judicial branch--appoint officials of the \nexecutive branch. In particular, a judge is supposed to be a neutral \narbiter for the contest going on before him. If he appoints the coach \nor the quarterback of one of the teams it seems as though he may not be \nfacilitating a fair trial. It creates a perception that I believe is \nnot healthy. Some judges have actually refused to appoint a U.S. \nattorney. They didn't think they should be taking sides in lawsuits \nthat would come before them or stating to the world that they were, in \neffect, choosing and validating the integrity and their support for one \nof the advocates who appears before them.\n  That is pretty basic to our system. But we have had a different \nprocedure for appointing interim attorneys for many years. It has been \ndiscussed over time as being unwise, but nothing ever happened until \nthe PATRIOT Act reauthorization. Then, when we finally changed the \nprocedure for interim appointments, I think we didn't do it well. We \nfixed the problem but left a big loophole that does need to be worked \non. On balance, the Kyl amendment is preferable to going back to the \nold system, and I support it.\n  I also note there has been a lot of talk about politics and the \nDepartment of Justice. I served as a U.S. attorney for 12 years. I \nserved as an assistant U.S. attorney for 2\\1/2\\ years. I came to know \nand love and respect that office. It is a very great and important \noffice. To be able to go into a court of the United States of America \nand to stand before that jury and that judge and all the parties who \nare there and the court says: Is the United States ready? And you say: \nThe United States is ready, Your Honor--to speak for the United States \nof America, to represent the United States of America in court is a \nhigh honor and a tremendous responsibility.\n  My impression, my entire experience was that when faced with \ndifficult choices, if I called the people in Washington and sought \ntheir advice or help or insight into how to handle a difficult matter, \nthey were very respectful of my decisionmaking process.\n\n[[Page S3252]]\n\nThey would provide support and advice, and they usually deferred to the \ndecision of the prosecutor.\n  They have strict regulations that require cases to be reviewed at \nvarious levels in the Department before an indictment can be returned \nbecause the U.S. attorney is not a free agent. They are not entitled to \nindict anyone they choose without any review within the Department of \nJustice, any oversight at all. A lot of us thought sometimes there was \ntoo much of that, but it was mainly a bureaucratic headache you had to \ngo through with some cases.\n  The U.S. attorney is appointed by the President. Presidents who take \noffice routinely replace U.S. attorneys who were there and appoint \npeople they believe are able and who will execute their approaches, \ntheir policies of law enforcement and litigation. That is what a \nPresidential election entails.\n  When we elect a President, we understand they are going to appoint \nU.S. attorneys who will be responsible for their effort, and if they \nrefuse to prosecute immigration cases, for whatever reason they might \ndecide, and the United States public knows about this, what recourse do \nthey have? They can vote against the President if he appoints somebody \nwho won't enforce the law, gun prosecutions, or any other kind of \nprosecutions. That is an accountability of sorts. But to have a judge \nwho has a lifetime appointment make these appointments and who has no \naccountability to the public is not healthy. I believe it undermines \naccountability.\n  I guess I had the occasion to be fired. They have been talking about \na lot of people being fired. When President Bush took over from \nPresident Reagan--I had been appointed a U.S. attorney by President \nReagan--even though I had been a Republican and was supported by a \nRepublican President, he wanted everybody to resign so he could replace \nall the U.S. attorneys. This was a perfectly logical decision for him \nto have made.\n  As a matter of fact, I remember it being discussed, although not \nacted on, at the midterm of President Reagan's Administration whether \nU.S. attorneys should be asked to resign after 4 years and bring in new \nblood. They chose not to do that.\n  When President Bush took office, many U.S. attorneys did not stay on. \nOver a period of weeks and months, they submitted their resignations, \nand he appointed new U.S. attorneys, many excellent U.S. attorneys. I \nasked that I be allowed to stay on, and after some time, they said: You \ncan stay on. So I stayed for 12 years. There were a handful of U.S. \nattorneys who stayed during that period--I mean literally half a dozen \nor fewer who stayed 12 years.\n  I say that to say these appointments are appointments of the \nPresident. The U.S. attorneys have to be responsible, if Presidential \nelections mean anything at all, in executing the policies the President \nsets forth with regard to criminal cases or civil cases, for that \nmatter. That is what he does.\n  We have this sense in which an appointment of a U.S. attorney is both \npolitical and nonpolitical. Let me tell my colleagues how it works. \nThis is very important. Most U.S. attorneys are recommended to the \nPresident or known to the President to have certain abilities. People \nmake recommendations. If it is a Republican President, they tend to \nappoint Republican U.S. attorneys. If it is a Democratic President, \nthey tend to appoint Democratic U.S. attorneys. Local Congressmen and \nSenators--particularly Senators, since we are in the confirmation \nprocess--make these recommendations to the President. He listens to \nthem and gives great weight to the recommendations.\n  So most of the people who are appointed have some sort of political \nheritage or background, but when you take that oath, when a person \nbecomes a U.S. attorney and they are asked to evaluate the merits of an \nexisting case before them as to whether a person should be charged, as \nto what kind of plea bargain should be entered into in the course of a \nprosecution, they should follow the law, they should follow their \npersonal integrity and do the right thing regardless of any politics, \nregardless of whether that defendant or the person involved in a civil \nlawsuit is a Republican, a Democrat, rich or poor, whatever. They have \ntaken an oath to enforce the laws fairly against everyone. I took it \nseriously. It was an important oath to me. I don't think I have ever \ndone anything of which I am more proud than serving as a U.S. attorney. \nI believe I fulfilled that oath as God gave me the ability to do so, \nand I made some tough calls. I handled cases against people I knew--\nfriends. I felt it was my duty, and I did my duty as best I could. I am \nconvinced that most U.S. attorneys do the same.\n\n  The appointment process has a political component, as everyone in \nthis body knows, because I submit to my colleagues and to anyone who is \nlistening, there has not been a U.S. attorney appointed who doesn't \nhave some sort of Senate recommendation to it. In fact, they have to \nget our approval to move the nomination through the Senate. That is a \npolitical process. So some of these e-mails which are being talked \nabout I think are not so unusual at that level, where they are talking \nabout appointments. Are we appointing people who are loyal to President \nClinton or are we appointing people who are loyal to the administration \nof President Bush, who wants his administration to succeed and wants \nhis priorities to succeed? That is how appointments are made. But once \nyou take that position, nobody in the Department of Justice, for \ncorrupt or ill intent, should ever try to influence a legitimate, \nproper decision of a grand jury or a U.S. attorney with any improper \nmotive because of politics. That is a tradition which most of the \npublic may not know but is deeply understood throughout the Department \nof Justice.\n  Years ago, assistant U.S. attorneys would resign when Presidents were \nnot reelected. The whole office would resign. As a matter of fact, when \nI came on in 1980, several offices still had that tradition, and in \nseveral offices, when the new U.S. attorney walked in, there was nobody \nthere. They thought that was the right thing to do--to turn it over and \nlet the new President and new U.S. attorney hire whom he or she wanted \nto run the office.\n  That has ended, I think correctly. Now in every U.S. Attorney's \nOffice, there is a deep cadre of experienced career prosecutors. The \nU.S. Attorney's Office is much larger today. They have grown in size, \nand they have a deep cadre of professional assistants, many of whom are \nappointed by different political parties of different Presidents, \ndifferent Attorneys General, and selected by different U.S. attorneys.\n  Everybody, if they are doing their job correctly--and I am convinced \nthat most do, overwhelmingly they do--they make decisions on cases \nbased on the merits. If someone in the office tries to upset that or if \nsome U.S. attorney tries to squash or cover up a case that should be \nprosecuted or a U.S. attorney tries to prosecute someone and there is \nnot a legitimate basis for it, there are Federal agents involved in \nthese prosecutions, assistant U.S. attorneys, people talk about these \nthings, and it comes to the surface. Really, it is very difficult for \nanybody to not do what is right. I am not saying it can't be done, but \nI am just emphasizing that U.S. attorneys have a responsibility to do \nwhat is right. Their assistants are raised in that concept, they are \ntrained in that concept, and if some political shenanigans are \nattempted, those assistants will usually push back and can appeal to \nthe Department of Justice in Washington or state their claims. That is \njust the way it is.\n  What about this deal of President Bush firing 8 of U.S. attorneys? \nLet me say it this way: The President was in midterm. He had been \nreelected. Apparently, there was a discussion as to whether U.S. \nattorneys should be kept or replaced. Somebody said: Why don't we \nreplace them all? He said: No, that is not a good idea. We ought to \nevaluate them and see which ones we want to keep and which ones we want \nto replace. There is nothing wrong with that. In fact, in my view, \nPresidents and Attorneys General have a greater responsibility than \nthey have exercised to ensure that U.S. attorneys are carrying out \naggressively the policies they set forth. It is mainly a question of \npolicy.\n  They made that decision. They battled it down and came out with eight \nU.S. attorneys whom they wanted to replace out of 93 U.S. attorneys. \nThat is not a holocaust of U.S. attorneys.\n  When I was U.S. attorney and President Clinton was elected President, \nhe sent out a notice that everybody would resign almost immediately. In \nthe past,\n\n[[Page S3253]]\n\nPresident Carter, President Reagan, and President Bush gave people 6 \nmonths or more notice to get their affairs in order and trundle on off \nin a nice fashion, give you an opportunity to find another job. But \nPresident Clinton sent out a notice immediately: You are out of there. \nIt caused an uproar, and then they backed off and said: OK, take your \ntime; we respect you more than that. We will let you take some time \nbefore you are out of here, but you are out of here. I have seen that \ntwice. I saw it when President Bush took over from President Reagan and \nwhen President Clinton took over from President Bush.\n  I wish to talk about this question of how you fill a vacancy in the \nU.S. Department of Justice, a U.S. attorney position. I always thought \nit odd that the court makes that appointment under certain \ncircumstances. Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty, in a Judiciary \nCommittee hearing on February 6, said:\n\n       Allowing the district court to appoint U.S. attorneys would \n     deprive the Attorney General of the authority to appoint his \n     chief law enforcement officials in the field when a vacancy \n     occurs, assigning it instead to another branch of \n     Government. The President is elected to do this. He is the \n     chief law enforcement officer. He sets the prosecutorial \n     policy, not the courts.\n\n  McNulty further testified:\n\n       Some district courts recognize the conflicts inherent in \n     the appointment of an interim United States attorney who \n     would then have matters before that court--not to mention the \n     oddity of one branch of government appointing the officers of \n     another branch of government--and they have simply refused to \n     exercise the appointment authority.\n\n  Some judges felt so strongly that this is an unhealthy way of doing \nbusiness, that they should appoint the prosecutor who is going to be \nappearing before them trying to convict somebody, yet they are supposed \nto be a neutral arbiter of the facts and the law, that they wouldn't \nmake the appointment.\n  McNulty pointed out:\n\n       Other district courts ignored the inherent conflict and \n     sought to appoint as interim United States attorneys wholly \n     unacceptable candidates who lacked the required clearances or \n     appropriate qualifications.\n\n  You have to have a secret clearance to be a U.S. attorney. This is \nvery serious business, who gets appointed U.S. attorney in these \nmatters. Let's say there was a U.S. attorney who had a meeting with the \njudge--and I have had these judges who like to tell you what the policy \nshould be. They like to tell you, you are prosecuting too many drug \ncases; you are prosecuting too many gun cases. We are the judges; we \nthink you, prosecutor, you work for us, basically you are prosecuting \ntoo many immigration cases. You need to do other kinds of things more \nfitting for the Federal Court, Mr. Prosecutor.\n  Well, who is the prosecutor working for? Is he working for that judge \nor is he working, in effect, to set forth the policy of the person duly \nelected President of the United States and thereby empowered to appoint \nhim and thereby to set those policies? So you have to tell the judge, \nyou know, I like you, Judge, and I appreciate all that. I know you, but \nthat is not our policy. We believe we should prosecute gun cases. We \nthink there is too much violence in America, and drugs and gangs are \nout there killing people and doing all these things, and our policy is \nto prosecute drug cases.\n  What about immigration cases? Nobody else will prosecute an \nimmigration case. One U.S. attorney had a lax record because she did \nnot prosecute those cases to the level of other similar districts and \nwas criticized for it by a lot of people. Let's say there was a \nvacancy, and under S. 214 the Senate majority now refused to confirm a \nBush appointment to that district and the judge appoints somebody who \nagrees with him who wouldn't prosecute immigration cases or gun cases \nor drug cases, and they could be in there permanently.\n  This idea that the Executive Branch, or President, can abuse the \nsystem is as true and possible as the idea that a judge can abuse the \nsystem. If the President does it, at least we in this Congress have a \nvote, and the American people have a right to vote on a President. So \nthere is accountability at least in this system that is not in the \nJudicial branch of government.\n  Paul McNulty, the Deputy Attorney General, said this:\n\n       The Department of Justice is aware of no other agency where \n     Federal judges, members of a separate branch of government, \n     appoint the interim staff of an agency.\n\n  I would ask my colleagues here to name one where the Federal judges \nfill a vacancy somewhere in the Government. In addition to the \nconstitutional separation of powers that is of concern with this \napproach, McNulty says:\n\n       At a minimum, it gives rise to an appearance of potential \n     conflict that undermines the performance or perceived \n     performance of both the executive and judicial branches.\n\n  Tough cases come up before courts and they are litigated before \njudges with great intensity. There is a lawyer for the defendant and \nthere is a lawyer for the Government, the prosecutor, and imagine now \nthat the judge has appointed the prosecutor. It creates some unease, I \nsubmit, and it is not a little bitty matter.\n  I am talking about a matter that will linger for 100 years. I am not \ntalking about the immediate media flack we are having now, that we are \ndigging into and seeing whether everybody can figure out exactly what \nhappened, and get a complete story of how the eight U.S. attorneys were \nasked to move on. We will get into that. That will all happen. I don't \nknow exactly what happened there, but I am saying that, as a matter of \npolicy, the appointments of executive branch officers should be \nmaintained, so far as possible, by the executive branch.\n  I will say one more thing. I do support the Kyl amendment. I think \nthat is a principled approach. I think the PATRIOT Act language we \npassed was not carefully thought through and did leave a loophole that \ncould allow the President to avoid confirmation process, and I think \nthat is not healthy. I believe the Kyl amendment, consistent with the \nseparation of powers, will confront and deal with that problem. I will \nsay this, regardless of how my colleagues might vote on that, I do \nbelieve we ought to consider an amendment I have offered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 460\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I call up my amendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside, and the clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 460.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: to require appropriate qualifications for interim United \n                           States attorneys)\n\n       On page 2, line 23, strike the quotation marks and the \n     second period and insert the following:\n       ``(e)(1) A district court appointing a United States \n     attorney under subsection (d) shall not appoint a candidate--\n       ``(A) unless that candidate is an employee of the \n     Department of Justice or is a Federal law enforcement officer \n     (as that term is defined in section 115 of title 18); or\n       ``(B) if the court learns that candidate is under \n     investigation or has been sanctioned by the Department of \n     Justice or another Federal agency.\n       ``(2) Not less than 7 days before making an appointment \n     under subsection (d), a district court shall confidentially \n     inform the Attorney General of identity of the candidate for \n     that appointment.''.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, if the Kyl amendment is not approved, my \namendment would require interim U.S. attorney appointments made by a \ndistrict court have appropriate and proper background checks. That is, \nwhoever the judge appoints would have background checks and security \nclearances in order to maintain efficient operation of the office \nduring this transition period.\n  The Feinstein bill that reverts to the previous process does not \nallow for that to happen, and we do know that in the past judges have \nnominated candidates who have serious difficulties. In 1987, an interim \nU.S. attorney for the Southern District of West Virginia, who was not a \nDepartment of Justice employee, did not have a background \ninvestigation, and was appointed by a district judge, started demanding \nto find out everything that was going on in the files related to a \nprosecution of prominent public officials. The First Assistant U.S. \nattorney there, a career\n\n[[Page S3254]]\n\nperson, was taken aback by this. The judge appointed interim U.S. \nAttorney didn't have security clearance to see the files, yet he had \nbeen appointed by the judge. So they had to remove the files from the \noffice. Not everybody can go in and see an investigatory file or see \ngrand jury transcripts. Those are, by law, available only to law \nenforcement officers who meet certain security clearances.\n  There was another example where the chief district judge in South \nDakota told the Department of Justice he wanted to appoint an \nindividual who did not have any Federal prosecutorial experience, had \nnot undergone a background check, and did not have the necessary \nsecurity clearances. The Department of Justice strongly objected. It \ngoes against the policy of the Department of Justice and the efficiency \nand effectiveness of the nominee. The Department of Justice appointed a \ndifferent candidate, under an existing law, and the Federal judge \nexecuted the oath of office for this appointee and copies of the \nAttorney General's order were sent out to the district court. Ten days \nlater, the Department of Justice received a fax indicating that the \nchief district judge had decided to appoint the earlier unacceptable \ncandidate as U.S. attorney. They had two of them appointed. So I think \nwe can fix that problem. That turned out to be an unpleasant mess, if \nyou want to know the truth, and we can do better about that.\n  I see Senator Kennedy is here, so I won't go on at length about this, \nexcept to say if we go back to the previous system that had been in \neffect for many years, it has been effective but we will face the same \nserious problems I just mentioned. Also, as a matter of principle, it \nis inconsistent with the responsibilities we give to the President of \nthe United States to appoint these officers and to give it to a \nseparate branch of Government that is not given the constitutional \nauthority to make those appointments. But I think we can fix it. We can \ndo better. We can fix this.\n  I think the Kyl amendment represents the appropriate principled \napproach to it. However, if the Kyl amendment does not succeed, I would \nsuggest my amendment, which makes for a limited modification to Senator \nFeinstein's amendment by ensuring that only qualified people be named, \npeople who meet the requirements, people who have a security clearance \nas part of the executive branch of the Government, who may be picked by \na judge, whoever they choose, but they at least would be qualified \nthrough security clearances and professional background to be a U.S. \nattorney. Maybe that would be a compromise that would help eliminate \nsome of the practical difficulties, even if it does not eliminate the \nphilosophical difficulties of having appointments made by a different \nbranch of Government.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support S. 214 as an urgently \nneeded step in our effort to restore our constitutional system of \nchecks and balances and to protect the rule of law.\n  In recent weeks, Congress has finally begun to investigate the \ndamaging politicization of the administration of justice by the White \nHouse and the Department of Justice. The problem did not begin with the \nrecently disclosed firings of eight U.S. attorneys. It was well \nunderway in 2002 when Attorney General Ashcroft abolished the process \nfor hiring new career attorneys for the Department of Justice.\n  That process had been established by the Eisenhower administration \nhalf a century ago to eliminate partisanship and cronyism in the \nDepartment's hiring. Under Attorney General Ashcroft, however, the \nprocess was placed entirely in the hands of political appointees who \nset out to remake the ranks of career attorneys by hiring new attorneys \nbased on partisan and ideological qualifications. Predictably, the \nresult has been partisan and ideological law enforcement.\n  The civil rights division virtually stopped enforcing the Voting \nRights Act on behalf of African Americans. It even sued African-\nAmerican officials in Mississippi for discriminating against White \nvoters. Contrary to the recommendations of career attorneys, the new \nregime also approved the Texas redistricting law that was later struck \ndown by the Supreme Court. It also approved a Georgia photo \nidentification law for voting that was subsequently struck down by a \nFederal Court as a poll tax. Approval of the Georgia photo \nidentification law was driven by the same partisan motivation that \nproduced the current U.S. attorney scandal.\n  Georgia's Republican-dominated State legislature said it was enacting \nthe law to respond to allegations of voter fraud. But evidence of fraud \nto justify the law did not exist. The ID law was passed anyway, with \nfull awareness that it would disproportionately prevent minorities from \nvoting.\n  When the law was submitted to the Civil Rights Division for approval \nunder the Voting Rights Act, the career staff of attorneys and analysts \nrecommended an objection by the Department, which would have prevented \nthe law from going into effect, but the recommendation was rejected by \nthe political appointees.\n  The Federal Court struck down the law as the equivalent of a poll \ntax, because the State offered to sell ID's for $20 to prospective \nvoters who did not have them. Tellingly, the State did not establish \noffices selling ID's in many of the State's most heavily minority \ndistricts.\n  After the law was blocked, the State reenacted it without the $20 \nfee, in a blatant effort to gain partisan advantage by manipulating the \nlaw. Once again, the political appointees in the Civil Rights Division \napproved it. Fortunately, a court struck down the new law, finding that \nit placed an undue burden on the voting rights of minority and elderly \nvoters.\n  The story does not end there. Shortly after political officials \nrejected the career attorneys' recommendation to block the law, they \ntransferred Robert Berman--the leader of the career team that reviewed \nthe Georgia law and a 28-year veteran of the Civil Rights Division--out \nof his job as a Deputy Chief of the Voting Section and into a dead-end \ntraining job.\n  When the Attorney General testified before the Judiciary Committee \nlast July, I asked whether this transfer was retaliation for the career \nattorney's role in recommending that the Department object to the \nGeorgia photo ID law. I still haven't received an answer. When Wan Kim, \nthe head of the Civil Rights Division, testified before the Committee \nin November, I asked him if Mr. Berman was transferred in retaliation \nfor the Georgia matter. I still haven't received an answer.\n  As the problems in the Civil Rights Division make clear, the real \ndanger with this administration's politicization of Justice \nDepartment's hiring is the corruption of the rule of law. U.S. \nAttorneys and other Department of Justice officials are selected by the \nPresident, but they are the people's lawyers. Their first duty is to \nenforce the rule of law--not to push a partisan agenda. This \nadministration has forgotten that basic truth, and the rule of law has \nsuffered.\n  The conclusion is inescapable that the Department of Justice ended \nMr. Berman's long and distinguished career as a voting section attorney \nbecause he applied the law faithfully and well, and refused to serve \nthe partisan interests of his political superiors. His plight is one of \nmany examples of loyal career public servants who have been pushed \naside for their failure to toe the partisan line in the Department of \nJustice.\n  Incredibly, Bradley Schlozman, the inexperienced political appointee \nwho oversaw approval of the Georgia ID law and the retaliation against \nthe career staff, was rewarded with an appointment as interim U.S. \nattorney for the Western District of Missouri. He has served in that \ncapacity for a year without Senate confirmation. Mr. Schlozman's \nappointment is symptomatic of the problem that the bill before us will \nsolve--the appointment as U.S. attorneys of unqualified partisan \noperatives who would be unlikely to win Senate confirmation, but who \ncan serve for extended periods of time anyway.\n  The continuing revelations about the 8 fired U.S. attorneys show how \nthoroughly partisanship has infected the administration of justice in \nthe Bush administration. As explanation after explanation has \nunraveled, it has become increasingly clear that the purge of U.S. \nattorneys had its genesis in the White House and its roots in a desire \nto remove U.S. attorneys who were not sufficiently committed to the \npolitical agenda of the administration.\n\n[[Page S3255]]\n\n  The initial explanation that 7 of the 8 were fired for poor \nperformance was a smokescreen manufactured out of thin air. Their \nperformance assessments were largely outstanding. Evidence is mounting \nthat the administration was concerned that Carol Lam was too successful \nin her investigation and prosecution of Republicans in the Duke \nCunningham scandal. John McKay was on the list because of his refusal \nto open an unwarranted investigation into voter fraud after a close \n2004 election victory by a Democrat. David Iglesias was the subject of \nRepublican complaints about his unwillingness to pursue voter fraud \ninvestigations of Democrats, and he was pressured by Republicans in \nCongress to indict Democrats before last November's election to help \nthe Republican candidate in a tight congressional race.\n  Recently released e-mails show that part of this scheme was to use \nthe little-noticed change in the law inserted in the reauthorization of \nthe Patriot Act last year which permitted the Attorney General to \nappoint interim U.S. attorneys to serve indefinitely without Senate \nconfirmation. The bill before us eliminates that provision and \nreinstates the 120-day limit on service by interim U.S. attorneys \nappointed by the Attorney General. This change will force the \nadministration to send nominees to the Senate to fill vacant slots, or \nhave them filled by a court instead.\n  This change in the law is an important first step we can take to \nremedy the problem, as we continue to investigate the political purge \nof U.S. attorneys. That investigation must continue. A full \ninvestigation is essential if we hope to restore confidence in Federal \nlaw enforcement. U.S. attorneys protect the Nation from violent crime, \nterrorism, violations of civil rights, organized crime and public \ncorruption. They must be above partisan or ethical reproach, if the \nrule of law is to have any meaning in our modern society.\n  There are few greater threats to our democracy than such efforts to \nturn our system of Federal law enforcement into a partisan political \ntool. As Justice Robert Jackson said:\n\n       The prosecutor has more control over life, liberty and \n     reputation than any other person in America.\n\nThat awesome power must not be used in the service of partisan goals. \nU.S. attorneys are political appointees, but once they are appointed, \nthey can no longer be part of the political process. Politics can shape \npolicies and priorities but the decision whether or not to investigate \nor prosecute cannot be influenced by the slightest hint of \npartisanship. No U.S. attorneys should be subjected to partisan \npolitical pressure to make a particular decision in a prosecution, and \nno U.S. attorney should be retaliated against for making decisions that \nare politically unpopular in the eyes of his superiors.\n  The bill before us will help guard against such partisanship, by \nrestoring the requirement for the administration to submit nominees for \nU.S. attorneys promptly to the Senate for confirmation, and I urge my \ncolleagues to pass this bill without amendment.\n\n\n                                  iraq\n\n  Mr. President, as our Nation begins its fifth year of the war in Iraq \nit is abundantly clear to the American people that our current policy \nhas failed, and that we need a new policy that will better serve both \nour national security and our service men and women.\n  President Bush continues to look for good news with a microscope. \nDespite his repeated claims that success is just around the corner, \nIraq is falling deeper and deeper into the chaos of civil war. Our \ntroops are in the untenable position of policing a nation at war with \nitself.\n  More than 3,200 American soldiers have made the ultimate sacrifice, \nand more than 24,000 have been wounded during the 4 years of his failed \npolicy.\n  Tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians have been killed, and nearly 4 \nmillion have been displaced inside Iraq and across the region.\n  The insurgency is growing in strength, and its lethal explosives are \ngrowing in sophistication.\n  Attacks on American soldiers continue to increase.\n  Militias are increasing their power, and their ability to brutalize \nthe Iraqi people is increasing as well.\n  No amount of American military might can end Iraq's civil war. Only a \npolitical settlement by Iraqi leaders and the Iraqi people can end the \nbloodshed and suffering.\n  Rather than fanning the flames of chaos by sending more U.S. troops \ninto Iraq's civil war, it is time for the President to begin to \nredeploy our troops out of harm's way.\n  The war in Iraq has been a disastrous and deeply dangerous debacle in \nAmerican foreign policy. It has made America more hated in the world \nthan at any other time in our history. It has emboldened terrorists \nacross the globe. It has stretched our military to the breaking point. \nAs a result, our national security is increasingly at risk.\n  The President's policy of escalating the war will not make success \nany more likely. It will only result in more death and more tragedy for \nAmerican soldiers, and it will undermine our national security even \nfurther.\n  The American people have been patient. But America has now been in \nIraq longer than it took us to win World War II. Instead of progress, \nwe continue to see unacceptably high levels of violence, death, and \ndestruction.\n  The American military and the American people deserve far better. The \nPresident seeks more funding for the war without strings and without \ndelay.\n  Because the President stubbornly insists on escalating the same \nfailed strategy, Congress must stand up to the President and stand up \nfor our troops by requiring him to redeploy our combat forces out of \nIraq as soon as possible. We have an opportunity to do so on the \nsupplemental appropriations bill that will soon be before us, and it is \nan opportunity we cannot afford to miss.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am going to speak on two timely issues. \nI would like to first speak on the issue of S. 214, the bill pending \nbefore the Senate.\n  I would like to ask my colleagues in the Senate who followed this \ndebate over the firing of eight U.S. attorneys to reflect a little bit \nabout history. It was over a century ago that the U.S. Department of \nJustice undertook plans to fire certain Federal prosecutors in the U.S. \nAttorney's Office in Alabama for political reasons. It was August 9, \n1904, when Republican President Theodore Roosevelt wrote a letter to \nhis Attorney General, William H. Moody. In this letter, President \nTheodore Roosevelt opposed the political firing of Federal prosecutors. \nThis is what he said:\n\n       Of all of the officers of the Government, those of the \n     Department of Justice should be kept most free from any \n     suspicion of improper action on partisan or factional grounds \n     . . . so that there will be gradually a growth, even though a \n     slow growth, in the knowledge that the Federal courts and the \n     representatives of the Federal Department of Justice insist \n     on meting out even-handed justice to all.\n\n  Those words were spoken over 100 years ago. They ring true today. Our \ndemocracy is based on the rule of law. It is based on meting out \nevenhanded justice, as President Theodore Roosevelt said.\n  The forced firing of eight U.S. attorneys, nearly all of whom had \nbeen judged qualified and favorably reviewed, calls into question the \ncredibility and integrity of Federal prosecutors. It calls into \nquestion our Nation's commitment to even-handed justice.\n  I have heard my colleagues on the floor today and in committee say: \nThis is much ado about nothing because whenever a new President comes \nalong, they replace all of the U.S. attorneys; that is clearly \npolitical. They are replacing those serving as U.S. attorneys with \npeople of their own choosing after they have replaced the Attorney \nGeneral. There is truth to that.\n  The fact is, with the new Attorney General, a new team is in place. \nWe have 93 U.S. attorneys. As President George W. Bush took office a \nlittle over 6 years ago, he replaced all of those U.S. attorneys \nappointed by President Clinton with his own. No one called for an \ninvestigation. No one screamed\n\n[[Page S3256]]\n\n``scandal.'' It is a tradition. It is one we accept. A new President \nhas that chance. But we know those U.S. attorneys serve at the \nPresident's discretion and can be removed at any time for any reason.\n  We have an unusual circumstance we face right now. Never before in \nhistory has a President and an Attorney General fired a group of U.S. \nattorneys en masse, in a group, other than the expected turnover, as I \nmentioned, with the change of administration.\n  We asked the Congressional Research Service if they could undertake \nan analysis of U.S. attorney firings that occurred other than the \nchangeover of a Presidency. This is what they found: Only 2 U.S. \nattorneys out of 486 confirmed by the Senate over the past 25 years \nhave been fired in the middle of a Presidential term for reasons \nunrelated to misconduct--2 out of 486. So for some to argue that this \nis routine, to fire those attorneys, the facts say otherwise. Only 2 \nout of 486 have been fired in the midst of their term.\n  Why is that the case? Why have U.S. attorneys been insulated from \nPresidential politics? Because Federal prosecutors are supposed to be \nindependent. They are nominated by the President and confirmed by the \nSenate, but, unlike other Federal public servants, they have a measure \nof independence.\n  Former Supreme Court Justice and Attorney General Robert Jackson once \nsaid: The prosecutor has more control over life, liberty, and \nreputation than any other person in America.\n  Discussing Justice Jackson's words, a scholar of the Justice \nDepartment named Lincoln Caplan has written:\n\n       The power of law enforcement to tarnish reputations, end \n     people's liberty and ruin lives, in other words, is so great \n     that it has to be exercised judiciously and, above all, \n     nonpolitically. That's one basic element of the rule of law.\n\n  That is what is at stake here. Eight U.S. attorneys who did not play \nball with the political agenda of this White House were dropped from \nthe team. Members of Congress have a responsibility to ask: What was \nthat political agenda? Why were they dismissed? Does this scandal rest \nat the feet of the Attorney General, Mr. Gonzales; Harriet Miers, the \nformer counsel to the President; Karl Rove, the President's political \nadviser; or does it reach the President's office itself?\n  Over the next several weeks, we are going to look into this. Passage \nof S. 214, the bill we will vote on at the end of this debate, will not \nend the inquiry. We have a lot more work to do. We need to learn \nwhether Attorney General Gonzales and his deputies told Congress the \ntruth when they testified just a few weeks ago. We need to have Karl \nRove, Harriet Miers, and other top administration officials testify \nunder oath about their role in these firings. I hope they will come \nvoluntarily. If they do not, the Senate Judiciary Committee should \nsubpoena each and every one of them. I am a member of that committee. \nWe plan to vote on these subpoenas this Thursday.\n  The White House is reluctant to have senior officials testify. That \nis understandable. But when the shoe was on the other foot--a \nDemocratic President and a Republican Congress--administration \nofficials testified all the time. Under President Clinton, 47 White \nHouse officials testified before congressional committees during their \nservice. We need to hear the truth--all of it and nothing but the \ntruth--about the firing of the eight U.S. attorneys.\n  There is a second question we have to ask which is equally important: \nHow many other U.S. attorneys were approached by the White House and \nasked to play ball and did play ball? Of the Nation's 93 U.S. \nattorneys, how many of them kept their jobs as a result of political \ncooperation?\n\n  We gained some insight into this question from a new study by two \nprofessors, John Cragan of Illinois State University and Donald Shields \nat the University of Missouri. They compiled a database of Federal \nindictments and investigations undertaken by U.S. attorneys against \nelected officials and political candidates since President Bush took \noffice in 2001. Here is what their study found: U.S. attorneys across \nthe Nation have investigated 298 Democrats and just 67 Republicans--\nnearly 5 times as many Democratic officials as Republicans. These \nstatistics are troubling, and we have to look into them. The firings of \nthe U.S. attorneys and documents that have been turned over to Congress \nreally call into question the legitimacy of all prosecutions brought by \nthe U.S. attorney in cases involving partisan interests.\n  This is regrettable. There is no place for politics when it comes to \nprosecution, especially when it comes to public corruption and voting \nrights cases. If there is belief that people in the White House in \neither party are pushing for prosecutions to seek a political \nadvantage, we have seriously undermined the integrity and credibility \nof our system of justice.\n  As President Teddy Roosevelt warned: Even the appearance of political \ninterference in the process of justice is damaging to public faith in \nGovernment. Last night, as I left a Chicago restaurant, a young man and \nhis wife were sitting at a table. He asked me to come over. He \nintroduced himself and said he was an assistant U.S. attorney in \nChicago. That is a hard job to get. It is not a political job at all. \nIn fact, you have to be really talented to be qualified to serve in the \nU.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois.\n  He said to me: Senator, I would like to ask you to do your best to \nget to the bottom of this. We think we are doing a professional job. \nThis suggestion that some U.S. attorneys were fired for political \nreasons really casts a shadow over all of us who are trying to \nrepresent the people of the United States effectively through our \nDepartment of Justice.\n  We owe it to him. We owe it to the U.S. attorneys across this country \nwho have been independent in their judgment and all of the assistants \nwho work with them to get to the bottom of this and ask the important \nquestions. I hope the Senate Judiciary Committee will be able to move \nthis week, perhaps next week, to get to the bottom of this and call \nthese witnesses before us.\n  Mr. President, today marks a somber milestone. It was 4 years ago \ntoday that President Bush ordered our military to launch a preemptive \ninvasion of Iraq. I can recall the vote on the Senate floor--I have \nspoken of it many times--which led to that decision by the President. \nWe cast thousands of votes as Members of the Senate, the House, and \nmost of them are hard to remember. One can never forget a vote cast \nabout war. You know people will die as a result of that decision. We \nfocus on eliminating the enemy--as we do in our war in Afghanistan--but \nwe know good American soldiers will give their lives as well, and \ninnocent people will die.\n\n  I can remember well that decision. It was a tough one, a very \ndifficult one. But now we face 4 years of this war having been \ncompleted. As of today, we start the fifth year of this war, a war that \nhas lasted longer than World War II.\n  Yesterday, on the ABC News program ``This Week,'' Stephen Hadley, the \nPresident's National Security Adviser, was asked: If the President had \nknown 5 years ago how much this war would cost--in dollars and in \nlives--would he have still ordered this invasion of Iraq?\n  Mr. Hadley replied:\n\n       I think he would. The point is, this war has made the U.S. \n     safer.\n\n  Those were the words of Stephen Hadley. Unfortunately, they are \nwrong.\n  A National Intelligence Estimate released last spring warns that the \nwar in Iraq has helped create a whole new generation of terrorists \naround this world.\n  The latest report from the Defense Department confirms our troops are \nnow trapped in a civil war. For the longest time, we danced around \nusing the words ``civil war.'' But even that term does not adequately \nexpress the complexity of the deadly situation we find ourselves in \ntoday.\n  Before our military was diverted to fight this war of choice in Iraq, \nthey had driven the Taliban from power in Afghanistan and splintered \nthe leadership of al-Qaida. We were in the hunt for Osama bin Laden. We \nknew who was responsible for 9/11, and we were determined to get him \nand those who worked for him. We were on track to demolish the \nterrorists who brought such grief to our Nation on 9/11.\n  What is the story today? According to Mr. Hadley in his comments \nyesterday on television, the war has made us ``safer.'' The fact is, \ntoday al-Qaida is regrouping and the Taliban is still fiercely fighting \nfor control of Afghanistan.\n  Our military--especially the Army--is stretched to the breaking \npoint.\n\n[[Page S3257]]\n\nThere is not one Active or Reserve Army combat unit outside of Iraq and \nAfghanistan today that is rated ``combat ready''--not one. If we were \ncalled on to respond to another military emergency in the world with \nour great military, they would be hard pressed to respond because they \nhave been depleted in terms of personnel and resources and training and \nequipment by this war in Iraq.\n  National Guard units in Illinois and across the Nation have about \none-third of the equipment they need to respond to a domestic crisis or \nto train for an overseas mission. A recent audit by the Department of \nDefense inspector general found the Pentagon has failed to properly \nequip the soldiers it already has in Iraq and Afghanistan. Many \nsoldiers have found themselves short on guns and ammunition, body \narmor, communications equipment, armored vehicles, and electronic \njammers to disable IEDs.\n  Two hours ago, I was at Walter Reed Hospital. I make visits there and \ntry to meet with soldiers and talk to them about how they are doing. I \ngo to the rehab unit where amputees are trying to learn to walk. Some \nhave lost one leg, some two. Some have lost an arm. They are struggling \nto get their lives back together. These are real heroes for America, \nand they are profiles in courage, as they struggle every single day to \ntry to put their lives back together again.\n  I sat down with a group of these soldiers, all of whom had lost a \nleg, in this rehab room. I went around, and I said: What happened to \nyou? Each one of them said the same thing: Well, it was an IED that hit \nmy humvee. It was an IED that hit my humvee. It was an IED that hit my \nhumvee.\n  I thought to myself: When this war started, in my first visit to \nWalter Reed, I met a member of the Ohio National Guard who lost his \nleft leg. He could not wait to get back to his unit. I doubted if he \never would. I asked him what happened? He said: Well, this homemade \nbomb, this IED, hit my humvee. That was 4 years ago, and we still have \nsoldiers coming into our hospitals with similar injuries without the \nprotection they need.\n  The President's response to this terrible situation is to order \n30,000 more troops into battle.\n  We will pay for this war for the rest of our lives. But the people \nwho have paid the highest price, by far, are the men and women of the \nmilitary and their families. Many soldiers and marines, sailors and \nairmen in Iraq are on their second, even their third or fourth tour of \nduty. We are pushing them to the absolute limit. They have endured \ngreat danger. Their families have endured great hardships.\n  As of this morning, it is sad but must be reported that 3,210 \nAmerican soldiers, including 123 from my home State of Illinois, have \ngiven everything. They have given their lives in Iraq.\n  This is a hallowed rollcall. These are the names of every Illinois \nservicemember killed in Iraq since the start of this war. As we begin \nthe fifth year of this war, I ask unanimous consent to honor these \ngreat men and women by having printed immediately after my remarks in \nthe Congressional Record this list of those Illinois brave soldiers and \nmarines, airmen and sailors who have given their lives in Iraq.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DURBIN. In addition to these fallen heroes, thousands of our \ntroops have come home with serious injuries, disabilities--blindness, \namputations, and the signature injury of this war, traumatic brain \ninjury. We have been outraged in recent weeks to read about the shabby \nway some of these wounded veterans have been treated.\n  I went out today and I asked to finally see this infamous Building \n18, which is about a block away from Walter Reed Hospital. It is a \nrundown, old motel that our military took over. Under Secretary \nRumsfeld, they had this passion to privatize--taking the men and women \nwho were responsible for maintaining this building and removing them \nand bringing in a private contractor. That is when the worst happened. \nThe men and women who were involved in the private contract clearly did \nnot do the job.\n  As a result, the Washington Post ran this well-publicized series \nabout mold and mice droppings and evidence of bugs and the general \nrundown condition of Building 18--an outpatient facility for our \nsoldiers at Walter Reed Hospital.\n  Every day, we learn--as I have learned back in Illinois--of wounded \nsoldiers who have been denied proper medical care, housed in \nsubstandard and even deplorable living conditions, and forced to fight \na massive bureaucracy and endure long waits for decisions about \ndisability compensation. Meanwhile, their families suffer and many of \nthe wounded soldiers go without medical care.\n\n  Sadly, these problems are not unique to Walter Reed, nor are they new \nto many of the top Pentagon officials.\n  Mark Benjamin is a reporter who has written some of the \ngroundbreaking stories on the veterans health care crisis. He wrote an \narticle in 2003, 4 years ago, about wounded National Guard soldiers \nbeing housed in sweltering cinder-block buildings at Fort Stewart in \nGeorgia.\n  The Pentagon pledged then, in 2003, that no wounded soldier would be \nsubjected to that shabby treatment again. That was 4 years ago. Yet 2 \nyears later, in 2005, Jeff Romig, a physician's assistant from \nDanville, IL, and a captain in the Army National Guard, found himself \nliving in similar conditions at a military base in Indiana after he \nruptured his Achilles tendon during training.\n  Captain Romig had a cast on up to his hip following surgery, but he \nhad to walk a half a mile on crutches every day to eat lunch. When it \nrained, mud washed into the cinder-block barracks and coated the cement \nfloors where he was asked to live. His foot became infected. He has had \nfive surgeries on it. He still has a hole in the back of his foot and \nhis foot drops. He needs a brace to walk properly.\n  When he was released from active duty, the Army told Captain Romig \nthe VA would pay for the brace. But then the Veterans' Administration \nrefused. They told Captain Romig he was not entitled to VA health care \nuntil he received a disability rating, which takes 2 years. In the \nmeantime, he would have to pay the bills himself or go without the \nbrace and any other VA health care.\n  Now, who is Captain Romig? He happens to be a soldier who has served \n23 years in the military--12 in the regular Army and 11 in the National \nGuard. He was one of the lucky ones, though. Through his employer he \nhad private health coverage. They paid for the brace and his medical \ncare when the VA and our Government failed him.\n  He worries about other wounded veterans. In an e-mail he sent me \nrecently, he said:\n\n       Who is going to help pay the bills for a soldier's family \n     if he or she is disabled? The mortgage companies won't wait \n     two years to receive their payment and the VA made it \n     perfectly clear to me that if I didn't pay my bill, they \n     would send me to [a collection agency]; they don't want to \n     wait two years for payment, either. So why should a soldier \n     be expected to wait two years for care and financial \n     assistance?\n\n  There is another story I would like to share. It is about SGT Garrett \nAnderson of Champaign, IL. He and his wife Sam share a similar worry. \nHe is 30 years old. She is 29. They have a 6-month-old daughter. On \nWednesday, they will celebrate their second wedding anniversary.\n  Three months after they were married, he went to Iraq with the \nIllinois National Guard. Four months after that, an IED exploded next \nto his armored humvee in Baghdad.\n  The blast tore off Sergeant Anderson's right arm below the elbow, \nshattered his jaw, severed part of his tongue, took away much of his \nhearing, and punctured his body with shrapnel.\n  He spent 7 months at Walter Reed, and he praises the care that was \ngiven him there recently in Ward 57. He said the amputee ward could not \nhave treated him better. I have heard the same thing. There are many \noutstanding individuals at Walter Reed who should not be lumped into \nthe critical articles about Building 18. These are men and women, \nmedical professionals, who are literally working miracles every day on \nthese soldiers. So criticizing the situation at Walter Reed should not \nbring them in as well. Many of them are extraordinary and receive the \nhighest praise from men and women who are treated there.\n\n[[Page S3258]]\n\n  But after the treatment at Walter Reed for Sergeant Anderson, the \nmonths of outpatient care that followed were filled with ``massive \npaperwork and red tape.'' After 3 years in the Army and 4 in the \nNational Guard, Garrett Anderson finally retired from the military last \nJune.\n  Last week, 9 months later, he received his disability rating from the \nVA. You will recall the injuries I told you he sustained. His \ndisability rating, after waiting, 90 percent. His wife Sam said the VA \nruled that some of her husbands's shrapnel wounds were not service \nrelated because Walter Reed had not taken the time to document each and \nevery one of them.\n  The Andersons are appealing the rating. They are hoping for a 100-\npercent disability rating, which would make Sergeant Anderson eligible \nfor better health coverage and other benefits. Do you know how long \nthat appeal will take? Two years--2 more years for Sergeant Anderson to \nwait to determine whether the VA is going to rate him as 100 percent \ndisabled.\n  In the meantime, he is looking for a civilian doctor with experience \ntreating amputees, and doing without the speech therapy and PTSD \ncounseling he needs.\n  He is also going to college. His wife is trying to finish law school. \nThey are both speaking out to try to change the system. Here is what \nhis wife Sam says:\n\n       Each obstacle renews our desire to fix the system so that \n     future soldiers can serve proudly and take comfort knowing \n     that their country will take care of them just as they took \n     care of their country.\n\n  I applaud Defense Secretary Gates for the decisive steps he has taken \nto fix the problems at Walter Reed and to determine how widespread they \nare. But firing a few people--even a few generals--is not enough. The \nstories about wounded soldiers being mistreated raise serious questions \nabout our planning for this war, about the capacity of the Pentagon and \nthe VA to deal with the long-term health needs of our soldiers--post-\ntraumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, amputations. Ten \nyears ago, the VA could never have anticipated all these challenges. \nToday they face them.\n  Every year since the war in Iraq began, the President has failed to \nrequest adequate funding for the VA. The President's proposed budget \nfor next year would enable the VA to serve 54,000 Iraq and Afghanistan \nveterans--54,000. It sounds like a large number. It is. But it is \n50,000 patients short of the VA's expected demand.\n  The President's budget provides for half of what is needed. \nUnbelievably, it would cut funding for defense health facilities such \nas Walter Reed by 13 percent. I think about that $12 billion in cash--\n$12 billion in U.S. taxpayer dollars--that was flown into Iraq and \ncannot be accounted for, sent to Mr. Bremer and his Coalition \nProvisional Authority. How far would that money go to help the VA?\n  Here is another great statistic. In late January, the Army Times \nreported that in the last few years, the number of soldiers approved \nfor permanent disability retirement decreased by more than two-thirds--\nfrom 642 in 2001, to 209 in 2005. Think about that: a two-thirds drop \nin permanent disability ratings in the midst of a war? It does not make \nsense.\n  With the horrific wounds our troops are suffering--and thanks to the \noutstanding care they receive in the field--surviving, how can \npermanent disability rates be declining? Declining disability rates are \npart of the pattern of failing to plan properly for this war.\n\n  I know Dr. David Chu, who is an economist and mathematician by \ntraining, and he holds one of the top positions at the Pentagon. He is \nthe Under Secretary for Defense for Personnel and Readiness. He is one \nof the two top Pentagon officials responsible for making sure that \nreturning vets receive prompt outpatient care and fair compensation.\n  In January 2005, Dr. Chu told the Wall Street Journal that America \nwas spending too much on benefits for soldiers and veterans. He said:\n\n       The amounts have gotten to the point where they are \n     hurtful. They are taking away from the Nation's ability to \n     defend itself.\n\n  The truth is, health care and disability benefits for wounded \nsoldiers are not threats to our national security; they are an \nessential part of the cost of war and part of our national security. \nSomehow the Pentagon has to come to realize this.\n  I want to tell my colleagues one more story and then turn the floor \nover to my colleague from Arkansas. This is about an Illinois soldier, \nArmy 1LT Terry Peterson of Warrenville, IL. I first met Lieutenant \nPeterson in January 2006 when he was recuperating at Walter Reed. I \ninvited him to come to the President's State of the Union Address last \nyear as my guest. He was 23 years old. He is a graduate of the Citadel. \nFrom the time he was a little boy, he wanted to be a soldier.\n  On December 8, 2005, 3 weeks after he arrived in Iraq, an IED ripped \napart a humvee in which he was riding in Baghdad. The blast killed one \nsoldier in the humvee and nearly killed Lieutenant Peterson. It \nshattered his right foot, ripped three knuckles off his right hand, and \nsevered an artery in his left arm. He has had 20 surgeries so far. If \nhe is lucky, he will only need two more surgeries. He has five screws \nin his foot, and he deals with pain all the time. He can't stand for \nmore than 30 minutes, and it will take a miracle for him to ever be \nable to run again.\n  Lieutenant Peterson received outpatient care at Walter Reed for 9 \nmonths. Someone from home was always with him--usually his mother, his \ngirlfriend, or his sister--trying to cut through the redtape, trying to \nmake sure he received the very best care. His mom spent $8,000 flying \nback and forth between Illinois and Washington to be with her son. \nLieutenant Peterson spent $10,000 out of pocket to rent hotel rooms \nnear Walter Reed for 6 months because there was no room for him in the \ninfamous Building 18. He has yet to be reimbursed for that expenditure. \nThe Army says he still needs to turn in more paperwork.\n  Terry Peterson suffers from PTSD. He didn't see a psychiatrist until \nmonths after his injury, and then only because his father insisted. \nWhen he went back for a follow-up appointment a month later, they told \nhim his records had been lost.\n  Today Lieutenant Peterson is back at Fort Stewart in Georgia waiting \nto finish his surgeries and get his disability rating to leave the \nArmy. He says:\n\n       It took me a long time to stop making excuses for the \n     system.\n\n  Some days he says he feels like he was abandoned by the Army. But he \nis determined to try to fix this system so other soldiers won't go \nthrough the same thing.\n  Before the State of the Union Address, some 15 months ago, Terry and \nI met with some reporters. Terry said: I don't know if I ought to say \nthis, but I am a conservative and a Republican. He said:\n\n       What I'm really looking forward to is just hearing that the \n     President is behind us.\n\n  He said he didn't want the sacrifices that he and other soldiers had \nmade to be for nothing.\n  As we enter the fifth year of this war, America needs to demonstrate \nto all our troops and families that we are behind them, and that takes \nmore than words. It requires that we stand with our soldiers on the \nbattlefield and when they come home wounded, for as long as they need \nour help.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n    Operation Iraqi Freedom Casualties Listed in Chronological Order\n\n     Marine Corporal Brian Kennedy, 25, of Glenview, IL.\n     Marine Captain Ryan Anthony Beaupre, 30, of St. Anne, IL.\n     Marine Private Jonathan L.

Madam President, I come to the floor to voice my strong \nsupport of S. 214, Preserving U.S. Attorneys Independence Act.\n  We all know the story by now. In the dead of night, the Justice \nDepartment slipped into the PATRIOT Act, which was under consideration \nin the House--it was in the conference, apparently, when this happened. \nThey slipped in a provision to allow itself carte blanche authority to \nstrategically handpick judges and bypass Senate confirmation, which I \nbelieve was done to carry out a political scheme to fire and replace \nU.S. attorneys. I don't say this lightly. We have seen the e-mails now. \nMost of my colleagues in the Senate and, in fact, most people around \nthe country have seen all or some or bits and pieces of these e-mails. \nThey are damning.\n  The Department of Justice has taken deliberate steps to mislead \nSenators and abuse its misbegotten authority. Put quite simply, we \ncan't trust this administration to use its authority in a fair and \nconstructive manner. They have proven that to us. It is time we restore \njustice at the Justice Department. We can begin that process with two \nsteps: First, we can move this legislation to which I referred a moment \nago very swiftly and restore the confirmation process that our Founding \nFathers envisioned. Allowing interim U.S. attorneys to serve for a \nlimited 120 days is a reasonable solution and will put an end to the \nslippery tactics of this administration and, might I say, future \nadministrations.\n  By the way, I think one of the reasons we all should support this \nlegislation is not because this administration--I think they have \nabused the law they have--but there is always that tendency for the \nPresident to try to bully something through the Senate. The easiest way \nof all is to get around the Senate completely and circumvent the \nSenate's authority which, by the language of the PATRIOT Act, as I \nmentioned, was slipped in. I think most Senators inadvertently allowed \nthat to happen.\n\n[[Page S3260]]\n\n  The second of these two steps I refer to is--I said this on the \nSenate floor the other day, and I still believe it--the Attorney \nGeneral should resign. In an e-mail dated August 18, 2006, to the \nAttorney General's Chief of Staff, it says that we have a ``Senator \nproblem'' in Arkansas. Well, guess who the Senator problem is. You are \nlooking at him.\n  I was by that time making calls, checking around. I had heard these \nrumors that the Justice Department was going to fire Bud Cummins and \nwas going to replace him with Tim Griffin, and we will get to that \nspecific case in a moment. But the bottom line is that--I know I was \nthe problem, but the bottom line is that today the Attorney General, \nAttorney General Gonzales, has a bigger problem than the junior Senator \nfrom Arkansas. He has a credibility problem. He has a trust problem. He \nhas a growing national scandal problem. I think it is best for the \nJustice Department, for the administration, probably for all the U.S. \nattorneys and all the things that Justice does all around the country \nand, quite frankly, it is probably best for him as a person to go ahead \nand step down and move on.\n  The Attorney General is different from any other Cabinet-level \nofficer. He is mentioned in the Constitution. This is a role that our \nFounding Fathers envisioned, I believe, to be about the pursuit of \njustice. The Attorney General should always be held to a higher \nstandard. We should look to him--and we understand that the Attorney \nGeneral is by nature a political appointment. That is the way the \nFounding Fathers set it up. But we also look to him to have integrity \nfor that department and to not play politics with the office. He is a \npolitical appointee but not to play politics with that office.\n  One of the things that concerns me the most is some of the things I \nhave been reading in these e-mails that have come out in the last \nseveral days between the White House and the Justice Department. Again, \nmany of us have read these e-mails or read parts of them. They talk \nabout the ``Bushies.'' They actually use that term in an e-mail. They \ntalk about loyalty to the Bush administration and how that criteria is \nparamount in deciding whether to keep or to let go these U.S. \nattorneys.\n  Well, I would say this: that is exactly the wrong standard. There is \nno question in my mind that is the wrong standard. Again, being a U.S. \nattorney should not be about being loyal to the administration or being \npolitical; it should be the exact opposite. It should be about being \nnonpolitical and about being loyal to the Constitution and the law of \nthe land; to be loyal to the duty you were sworn to uphold. I think \nthis administration has it backwards.\n  I think U.S. attorneys on the local level have demonstrated over the \nlast couple of centuries that they have been very good at trying to \nstay above politics and stay out of the political fray. Let me tell my \ncolleagues, I have seen U.S. attorneys all over the country during my \nlifetime who have taken on very dicey, very difficult cases, and more \noften than not they do an outstanding job and are very professional in \ntheir pursuit of justice.\n  Things have changed with this administration. From the very top, they \nwant the U.S. attorneys out in the districts, out in the 93 districts \naround the country to play politics. This is not a hypothetical \nsituation. One would think hypothetically we would want to change this \nlaw we are talking about today to make sure those U.S. attorneys would \nqualify, to make sure they wouldn't play politics with their office, \nand one would think hypothetically it could be that at some point in \nthe future, maybe some of these U.S. attorneys might decide to go after \nand prosecute and investigate people who are in the other party but not \nprosecute and investigate and go after people in their own party. That \nwould be absurd. Apparently, according to these e-mails, that is \nexactly what was happening in at least some cases.\n  Let me speak for a moment--I know there are other Senators waiting to \nspeak and, certainly, I want to give them plenty of time. But let me \ntalk about the situation in Arkansas just for a few moments because it \nwas the first one that I became aware of. In fact, it was the first one \nthat any Senator became aware of.\n  I mentioned to the Judiciary Committee and very briefly to Pat Leahy \nin the summer and in the early fall about some of the things I was \nhearing in Arkansas and that I had concerns because, by all accounts, \nfrom everything I understood, Bud Cummins, the then-U.S. attorney in \nthe Eastern District of Arkansas, in Little Rock, had done a good job. \nEverybody I talked to in the legal community--the judges, people who \nare familiar with what that office does--thought Bud Cummins had been \nvery professional and thought he had done his job. They thought he had \ndone exactly what he was supposed to do.\n\n  I began hearing rumors over the summer that they were going to \nreplace Bud Cummins with Tim Griffin. At that moment in time, I didn't \nknow Tim Griffin. I am not sure I had ever met him. I don't think I had \never met him. I barely even knew who he was. I probably heard some \npeople from Congressman Bozeman's office mention him, but I really had \nalmost no knowledge or no recollection of who he was at all. That is \nall beside the point. I had never met him. I had been the attorney \ngeneral in my State. I had been a practicing lawyer in Little Rock for \na decade or more before I was attorney general, and I had never run \nacross this guy in the legal community. It turns out nobody else had \neither because he really hadn't been in Arkansas but maybe about 1 year \nfor his whole professional life; 1 out of maybe 15 years or something \nlike that.\n  So the bottom line is he didn't have any stature in the legal \ncommunity. People didn't know who he was. They didn't know anything \nabout him. So that was my concern. I didn't know who he was. I knew he \nhad a very political background. The first question I would have had \nis, can he check that at the door? And that is something I would want \nto talk to him about and I think the Senate Judiciary Committee would \nwant to talk to him about. But the bottom line is from the very \nbeginning, what I wanted--the President can nominate whomever he wants \nto nominate. That is his business. I think it would be smart to check \nwith Senators before he makes a nomination, but it is his business. He \ncan nominate whomever he wants.\n  From the very beginning, what I was asking for is that they nominate \nTim Griffin and send him through the normal confirmation process. I \nthink the people of the Eastern District of Arkansas are owed that. I \nthink we owe it to them to do our best and to have the very best U.S. \nattorney there. He may be very qualified, but again, because he was an \nunknown and because he had no real presence in the Arkansas legal \ncommunity, I thought certainly he was the type of guy who should go \nthrough the confirmation process.\n  So that is really what I have been saying from the very beginning, \nand this bill, S. 214, does that. It restores the traditional balance. \nI think that is a healthy balance. I think that is a good balance. I \nthink it is something we need to go back to immediately.\n  Now, I mentioned Bud Cummins and Tim Griffin. Listen. In my mind this \nissue is much larger than those two people, and it is much larger than \nDemocrats and Republicans. This issue is really fundamental to the \nConstitution; that is, should the Senate have the ability to confirm, \ngive the advice and consent, on U.S. attorneys. I say the answer to \nthat is, yes. I think that is something we as Senators should fight \nfor. I think we need to do this to the best of our ability. We need to \nbe fair. We need to move them through the process.\n  By and large, when one looks at the history of U.S. attorneys being \nconfirmed, we haven't had big knock-down, drag-outs over U.S. \nattorneys. But given the fact that U.S. attorneys go through Senate \nconfirmation, it keeps the administration honest on whom they nominate. \nI think that is a very important point.\n  Here again, with S. 214, we are trying to restore that balance that \nhad worked so well before.\n  One last thing. In the e-mails you see, in my view, a real abuse of \npower. Over and over you see e-mails between the Justice Department and \nthe White House, and among themselves, where they say they need to do \nthis, and they need to have this appointment power, and if they don't \nuse it, why in the world should they have it. There again, I think that \napproach to Government\n\n[[Page S3261]]\n\nis dangerous. It is shortsighted, and it seems to me someone who would \nmake that type of statement is more interested in the power of the \noffice rather than doing what is right. If there is one agency in the \nFederal Government about doing what is right, it ought to be the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  With all that said, I urge my colleagues to please support S. 214. It \nis good legislation. It restores the natural balance of what has worked \nso well for a long time around here. Once we can restore that natural \nbalance, I think the people all over this country will feel better \nabout their local U.S. attorney.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas, Mrs. Lincoln, is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I come to the floor this evening as a \ncosponsor of Senator Feinstein's legislation, S. 214, regarding the \ninterim appointment of U.S. attorneys. I am here this evening to \nvigorously restate my support for this bill and urge my colleagues to \nsupport its passage. I signed on to this legislation in January \nfollowing the interim appointment of Tim Griffin as U.S. Attorney for \nthe Eastern District of Arkansas, who replaced former U.S. Attorney Bud \nCummins.\n  I take this opportunity to compliment Senator Pryor, who has done a \ntremendous job in working with Senator Feinstein and others on this \nlegislation. His background as attorney general in our State, along \nwith his real ability within the Senate to work through these issues to \nbring a calm and respectful response to the concerns that exist here \nhas been a tremendous asset to this body in being able to bring the \nbill forward. I thank him and compliment him so much for his service. I \nam very proud to serve alongside him here in the Senate.\n  When the Congress reauthorized the PATRIOT Act last year, we granted \nthe administration the authority to appoint U.S. attorney vacancies on \nan interim basis. Remember, this was for emergency circumstances. The \nadministration asked for this authority based upon the idea that if a \nnational security issue arose requiring a new U.S. attorney, the \nAttorney General could step up and provide a replacement in a time of \ncrisis without the delay of the confirmation process. For those of us \nwho come from places such as Arkansas, close to Oklahoma, the Oklahoma \nCity bombing comes to mind where a Federal building may be destroyed, \nand all of a sudden you need to make sure the proper authorities in \npublic service are in place to be able to continue to serve the public \nthere. So we have certainly references of where emergencies might \noccur. But in these instances we have seen reviewed, I don't think \nanybody else could substantiate a real emergency circumstance.\n  One of the first questions I asked the Justice Department, when they \nasked to do an interim appointment so quickly, was: Was there an \nemergency in this situation? I had not heard about one.\n  In a January Senate Judiciary hearing, Attorney General Gonzales \nstated this emergency provision would not be used for political \npurposes or to circumvent the nomination process. Yet how else could it \nbe explained?\n  Furthermore, the Attorney General pledged he would work with home \nState Senators to provide replacement U.S. attorneys. I listened to the \nAttorney General's comments, but we now know the actions of his Justice \nDepartment in recent months do not match the rhetoric he delivered.\n  Specific information revealed last week shows the Justice Department \ndeliberately and deftly planned to circumvent the rules for appointing \nU.S. attorneys by politicizing the emergency provision we authorized.\n  In one e-mail exchange between White House staff and officials at the \nDepartment of Justice, the administration specifically plotted to ``gum \nthis to death'' and otherwise to ``run out the clock'' in an effort to \navoid the confirmation process to replace former U.S. Attorney Bud \nCummins in Arkansas.\n  These actions are a disservice to the Justice Department, to this \nadministration, and to all Americans. They demonstrate a willful lack \nof transparency and respect for the system of checks and balances our \nforefathers instituted. They foresaw the need to make sure the three \ncoequal branches of Government would remain separate, that there would \nbe a balance and a check to make sure these different branches of our \nGovernment were operating as they should.\n  I recognize the U.S. attorneys serve at the pleasure of the President \nand they are political appointees. Lord, we have heard that ad nauseam \nin this debate, that these U.S. attorneys serve at the pleasure of the \nPresident. But that does not mean they can politicize the law. It does \nnot mean they serve the President and they serve in these positions for \npolitical purposes. They serve in these positions as stewards of the \nlaw of this land. They serve in these positions as public servants to \ndefend the rule of law in this country. However, they have a duty and a \nresponsibility, as well, to implement the laws of our Nation without \npolitical favor or bias.\n  That is why the confirmation process is so very important, to ensure \nthat nominees are qualified and are committed to the rule of law. We \nknow they are going to be nominees of the President and that perhaps \nthey certainly are acquaintances or those whom the President or \nadministration would know, but they still have to be qualified and they \nstill have to be able to implement the rule of law. It is an important \ncheck and balance that has served our Nation well, and any attempt to \nundermine it represents a breakdown in our system.\n\n  The e-mails released last week show either a blatant attempt to \ndeceive the Senate or, at the very least, serious mismanagement under \nthe Attorney General. This controversy has caused a serious breach \nbetween the Justice Department, Congress and, most importantly, the \nAmerican people--a breach I am not sure can be repaired if Mr. Gonzales \nremains Attorney General.\n  That is why I am here this evening to preserve the Senate's role in \nthe confirmation process and to restore our system to the way our \nforefathers envisioned it.\n  I compliment Senators Feinstein, Leahy, and Specter for their \nleadership on this issue. This bill represents a compromise on this \nissue, and the bipartisan leadership they have shown should serve as an \nexample to this entire body.\n  I also thank the numerous U.S. attorneys and their staffs all across \nthis great Nation for the critical work they do to protect our \ncommunities by enforcing the laws of our Nation. Far too often, they do \nnot receive the credit they deserve.\n  It is unfortunate the Senate is having to set aside time to debate \nthis legislation because we have so many pressing priorities that must \nbe addressed as this year progresses. Yet we have had to step aside and \nlook at what has gone wrong and how we can prevent it from happening \nagain.\n  How has this breach of trust affected our overall system? Most \nimportantly, we have to look at what it has done to the sentiments of \nthe American people--those who want desperately to trust us, to trust \nthose of us in the legislative branch, to trust those in the executive \nbranch, and to trust those in the judicial branch to do our jobs, to be \nthere for them as part of the American democracy and what it is we \nstand for in this country, so they can trust that the laws we create \nwill be implemented without political bias, and that we would work \ntogether as branches of Government.\n  When we look at, unfortunately, what has happened, the mismanagement \nthat has occurred time and time again, from this administration \nparticularly--whether it was the civilian mismanagement we saw early on \nin Iraq, or the mismanagement of FEMA in Katrina, and the response the \nGovernment has to the people of the gulf region, we look at these areas \nwhere the mismanagement that occurred has eroded the faith of the \nAmerican people in this incredible democracy we are all so proud of.\n  Our democracy relies on independent and unbiased law enforcement. It \nis our duty to ensure that these problems are corrected. I encourage my \ncolleagues to support Senator Feinstein's bill, S. 214.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, first, I thank the Senator from\n\n[[Page S3262]]\n\nIowa for his courtesy in allowing me to proceed.\n  I rise to commend Chairman Leahy of our Judiciary Committee, and \nSenators Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein, my senior Senators on that \ncommittee, for their very deep concern about the politicization of the \nDepartment of Justice by the Bush administration.\n  As you know, I am new to this body, but having served as Rhode \nIsland's U.S. attorney for 4 years, I want to share some thoughts based \non that experience.\n  First, I want to point out that even if everything the administration \nhas said about their firing of these U.S. attorneys were true--and we \ncertainly have cause to doubt that--there is still a very real concern \nhere that merits the attention of this body over the independence of \nthe U.S. attorneys.\n  My experience convinces me--and it convinces me firmly--that Main \nJustice and the U.S. attorneys in the field check and balance each \nother in a way that is very healthy for the administration of justice \nin this country. Even if the mass firings--the purge of U.S. \nattorneys--had been done to punish policy differences with the \nDepartment of Justice, the firings would still defeat that healthy \ncheck and balance.\n  Bear in mind that nothing has been shown that suggests the exercise \nof graduated discipline one would expect in any kind of a well-managed \nsetting. For instance, Carol Lam was ostensibly fired for not \nprosecuting enough low-level immigration cases. But when she was here \ntestifying before us, she testified she was not told that when she was \nfired; nor, evidently, was she ever told beforehand this issue was a \nserious problem for her or that it might cost her job.\n  Even enemy ships usually get a warning shot. So the message of these \nfirings to the U.S. attorneys from the Bush administration is this: You \nserve at our whim. You displease us at your peril. A sudden firing \nawaits you if you cross us.\n  That is a very bad message to send in the context of this traditional \nbalance. Intimidation by purge is a tactic far better suited for a \nSoviet ministry of justice than for the U.S. Department of Justice--\nthat is, if everything they have said is true, which brings us now to \nthe question of the Department of Justice telling the truth.\n  Let me start by saying, as I have said to the Attorney General \ndirectly, unless you are first a department of truth, you will never be \na Department of Justice. Without truth, there can be no justice. We \nknow already--because they have admitted it--the Department of Justice \ncame before the Senate days ago and told us things that were not true. \nWe also know they have said things that are inconsistent. They have not \nyet told us which statement is true and which statement is not true, \nbut they have said things that cannot both be true. At least one must \ninevitably be false. We also know they have said things that boggle the \nimagination. Perhaps they are true, but it seems mighty unlikely.\n\n  The big question within this shameful cloud of admitted falsehood, \ninevitable falsehood, and probable falsehood is this: What truth hides \nbehind the bodyguard of lies? Is it this: U.S. attorneys who prosecuted \npublic corruption cases against Republicans or those who did not bring \npublic corruption cases against Democrats were terminated with extreme \npolitical prejudice? Is that what made them fail the Department of \nJustice test that they be ``loyal Bushies''? Is that what made Carol \nLam a ``real problem'' for the Department of Justice on the day \nRepublican corruption indictments were announced?\n  Like dead flesh that must be excised before a wound can heal, like \nrotten wood that must be scraped away before rebuilding can begin, the \ncloud of falsehood that now wraps around the Department of Justice must \nbe dispelled. It must first, again, become a department of truth or \nelse it can never again be our American Department of Justice. We \ncannot tolerate a Department of Justice or an Attorney General who will \nnot give the complete truth and face the consequences.\n  I think at least three questions must be pursued by the Judiciary \nCommittee or, if and when necessary, the entire Senate.\n  One, let's review authoritatively the historic relationship between \nU.S. attorneys and the Department of Justice, if necessary with expert \nassistance from historians and input from U.S. attorneys who served in \npast administrations.\n  The President of the United States has said this selective mass \nfiring of U.S. attorneys is--this is his quote--``customary practice.'' \nAs a former U.S. attorney myself, I believe that statement by the \nPresident of the United States to be false. His own Department of \nJustice officials seem to have conceded in their e-mail traffic that it \nis false. But let's take a thorough look because--I should not have to \nstate the obvious--our President should not be saying things that are \nnot true and also because that historic balance between independent \nU.S. attorneys serving in the field, in their districts, before their \njudges, and knowing their communities, against the group here in \nWashington that runs Main Justice, that historic balance has value \nwhich should not be destroyed.\n  Two, let's get the full, exact, unvarnished truth of what happened, \nand let's fix accountability for things that were said that were false. \nFalsehood has no place within the halls of the Department of Justice. \nWhatever needs to be done to dispel the clouds of falsehood, we must \ndo.\n  Three, if, indeed, the worst is to be feared and this Department has \ninfected its pursuit of political corruption with partisan bias, let's \nfind that out. Let's start by looking at the cold, hard, numerical \nstatistics on public corruption matters under this administration, \nagain with expert help, if necessary, and certainly with full regard \nfor the confidentiality of such investigations, and let's see what the \nfactual record is and what it suggests. We can then proceed as \nnecessary.\n  God forbid this should be so, but the air is thick with reasonable \nsuspicion which must be laid to rest, and if the worst should prove \ntrue, God forbid the Senate fail in its duty to preserve, protect, and \ndefend the integrity of our Government where its integrity should least \nbe questioned--in the U.S. Department of Justice.\n  I look forward to working with my learned colleagues on the Judiciary \nCommittee to do whatever is necessary to restore the honor and \ncredibility of a once-proud department and the tradition of its able \nand independent U.S. attorney corps. In the meantime, I hope we will \nall support Senator Feinstein's commendable legislation, S. 214, to \nclose the PATRIOT Act loophole that may have invigorated the Bush \nadministration in its unprecedented assault on the U.S. attorney corps.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The distinguished Senator from \nIowa.\n\n\n           The Smithsonian Institution: Cancel the Champagne\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, every year hundreds of thousands of \nAmericans come to our Nation's Capital for what will be for many a \nonce-in-a-lifetime vacation. A highlight of that visit for most \nfamilies is seeing the Smithsonian museums.\n  The Smithsonian, as everybody knows, is home to many of our Nation's \ntreasures, from Lincoln's top hat to the Hope Diamond. I have a picture \nof the Hope Diamond here. The Smithsonian receives over 70 percent of \nits support from the Federal taxpayers, over $700 million a year of \ntaxpayers' money just in the last year. In addition, the Smithsonian \nreceives over $200 million in donations each year. These donations are \ntax deductible, so the taxpayers also subsidize these charitable gifts \nas well. Thus, Federal taxpayers either pay for or subsidize almost the \nentire Smithsonian budget. Given that money is fungible, when \ntaxpayers' dollars are paying for one thing at the Smithsonian, that \nfrees up other money for the Smithsonian to spend elsewhere.\n  Despite the strong support the Smithsonian receives, the Government \nAccountability Office recently found in a record that there was \nsignificant damage to Smithsonian buildings and some exhibits because \nof water leakage. In fact, one of the Smithsonian buildings on the \nMall, the Arts and Industry Building, has been closed to the public \nbecause of damage to the roof.\n  The Smithsonian seems, on one hand, to have recognized the need to \ntell their employees they need to pinch\n\n[[Page S3263]]\n\npennies. The Washington Post, in a story in this morning's paper, cites \na Smithsonian memo sent to employees urging them to save energy by \nturning off decorative and accent lighting.\n  Unfortunately, while the rank-and-file at the Smithsonian and the \nstrength of this great institution were told to count the pennies and \nturn off the lights, the Secretary of the Smithsonian, Mr. Lawrence \nSmall, was throwing hundreds of thousands of dollars out the window. \nMoney was thrown at his house, his office, and first-class travel for \nMr. Small and his wife.\n  One of the great treasures in the Smithsonian is Dorothy's ruby \nslippers from ``The Wizard of Oz,'' as shown in this picture. What \nDorothy learned in that classic movie is that ``there is no place like \nhome.''\n  Just like for Dorothy, for Mr. Small, there is no place like home. \nThe Secretary of the Smithsonian has taken that sentiment to heart, \nspending hundreds of thousands of dollars on paintings, repairs, house \ncleaning, lawn service, even his cable, and presenting the bill to the \nSmithsonian for payment.\n  The Smithsonian Board of Regents wants to justify the million-dollar-\nplus in expenses paid for at Mr. Small's house, which he owns, because \nthe Board of Regents claims he does official Smithsonian entertainment \nat his home.\n  What are some of the expenditures at Mr. Small's house? Perhaps most \nincredible is that the Smithsonian has paid for roof repairs for the \nSmall's house at a time when the Smithsonian can't find the money to \nfix the roof at the Smithsonian museum. But along with the roof, let me \nlist some other items we are paying for: a chandelier cleaning for \n$2,535; a pool heater for $4,225.77; three new French doors for \n$14,525.\n  Having the taxpayers and the Smithsonian donors pay for what I \ndescribe as a champagne lifestyle? Priceless.\n  Let me turn now to Mr. Small's office at the Smithsonian castle \nbecause he has turned that castle into a palace. Again, the Smithsonian \ntells its hard-working employees that they need to save every cent \npossible by turning down the lights but wasted every dollar possible on \nMr. Small's office suite.\n  We have just one example here. These chairs reported in the \nWashington Post this morning are ``probably some of the best quality \nchairs you can buy.'' Those are the words of the Washington Post. These \nchairs are $2,000 each. There is a conference table for $13,000, \nthousands of dollars on carpeting and upholstery, and even finding the \nmoney to spend $1,502 on a wall sconce. I don't know if they turn that \noff, as he has told the employees to turn off lights.\n  In addition, Mr. Small has decorated his office suite with enough \npaintings and artifacts from the Smithsonian collection that it would \nbe the envy of many museums. Making one's personal office a museum \nannex goes against the best practices of museum directors. The \nSmithsonian's collection is for the people's enjoyment, not for private \nenjoyment.\n  It is a sad statement of the Secretary and the board's priorities \nwhen one of the newest rooms at the Smithsonian is the Secretary's \noffice--this at a time when the Smithsonian is struggling to keep the \nbuildings open.\n  In addition to spending on his house and office, what hasn't been \nreported yet are the enormous amounts of funds spent on top-of-the-line \ntravel by both Mr. and Mrs. Small. The accountant hired by the \ninspector general found example after example of Mr. Small and his wife \ntraveling with expenses that far exceeded what Federal employees are \nallowed to spend. I will highlight just two trips for my colleagues, \nbut I want you to know there are many more about which I could speak.\n  Mr. Small and his wife decided to take a trip to Las Vegas in 2002. \nThe reason ostensibly was to attend the opening of a portrait and a \npress conference. That, of course, meant a $3,464.50 first-class \nairline ticket for each. They then stayed at one of the best hotels in \nLas Vegas, the Venetian, at nearly $500 a night, and enjoyed a $170.79 \ndinner for two at the Belaggio.\n  They say what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, but I am going to make \nan exception. I posted on the Finance Committee Web site these travel \nvouchers.\n  While the Vegas getaway is bad enough, I think the trip to California \nin 2001 shows a real window into the problems at the Smithsonian. Mr. \nSmall spent over $2,800 in chauffeured limousine service in 4 days, \nincluding a whopping $1,319 in 1 day. I want everybody to know I have a \ncar I would be glad to sell to the Smithsonian for what they paid for \nthat car service.\n  What is even worse, if that is possible, is the excuse given for this \nout-of-control spending.\n  In a memo justifying the car service in California, the claim is made \nthat there would be ``a safety risk for [Small] to carry as much cash \nas would have been needed to pay for a taxi. . . .'' Even children who \nclaim dogs ate the homework are embarrassed by that excuse. These are \nvery serious problems, and I would say the more we look, the worse it \ngets in regard to the leadership at the Smithsonian.\n\n  I am pleased that the Smithsonian Board of Regents is announcing \ntoday the creation of two boards: one a group of outsiders to review \nthe work of the board, and a second group, comprised I understand \nmostly of Board of Regents members to look at board governance at the \nSmithsonian.\n  I am pleased that the Board of Regents is taking these needed steps. \nI may not agree with the members of the board and how they have handled \nthings, but let me say that I have looked at the governance setup, \nestablished over 100 years ago for the Board of Regents, and I feel \nthat architecture is one of the biggest dinosaurs in the Smithsonian. \nWe have to look at that architecture of that governance. The board \nstructures and duties have clearly not kept up with the times in terms \nof the best governance practices in the nonprofit sector.\n  In addition, the board's actions of blessing, after the fact, of Mr. \nSmall's expenditures and actions is extremely troubling. In my State of \nIowa, we call this the legislature passing a ``legalization act,'' and \nit raises very real concerns in my mind of whether the board is running \nthe Smithsonian and its secretary or whether the Secretary is running \nthe board.\n  The actions of the Smithsonian Board of Regents calls to mind my work \nwith some problems with the American Red Cross. This is another \norganization on which I have conducted oversight. I am pleased that the \nSenate recently passed legislation that I sponsored that reforms the \ngovernance of the American Red Cross. The Red Cross is a great American \ninstitution that also needed to modernize its governance, and I worked \nclosely and successfully with the Red Cross leadership and was pleased \nthat they recognized the need for fundamental change. I hope the \nSmithsonian Institution will look at the Red Cross's experience for \nguidance.\n  While the board has much to account for, that does not excuse where \nthe responsibility lies--with the Secretary of the Smithsonian, Mr. \nSmall. While the board should have been more vigilant in its work and \noverseeing its public trust, make no mistake, it is Mr. Small who \nordered the champagne and handed the bill to the Smithsonian.\n  So let's put to rest this argument that I have heard from some that \nMr. Small should not be held accountable for his actions because the \nboard allowed it to happen. I think that excuse is way beyond the pale. \nWe have a right to expect the Secretary of the Smithsonian to have the \ncommon sense to know if he wants Dom Perignon, he needs to pay for it \nout of his own pocket.\n  The other argument I hear is that Mr. Small should be excused of his \ntaxpayer-supported lifestyle because he has raised money. First, let's \nremember that 70 percent of the dollars come from the Federal \nGovernment. Secondly, I think it is insulting that Mr. Small's \nsupporters are trying to give him credit for every dollar raised at the \nSmithsonian. There are dozens of people being paid top dollar at the \nSmithsonian, including the museum directors, to help raise money as \nwell. They are all helping to pull that very big weight.\n  Finally, Mr. Small's supporters act as if no one raised a dime before \nhe showed up. The Smithsonian is our Nation's great museum. Many \npatriotic Americans want to show their support and give to this \ninstitution regardless\n\n[[Page S3264]]\n\nof who is in charge, if they have the confidence that the money is \ngoing to be spent wisely. For example, the Smithsonian received $123 \nmillion in donations in 1999, and that was more than double the amount \nthe year before in 1998. This included, by the way, $60 million from \nSteven Udvar-Hazy to build the new Air and Space Museum near the Dulles \nAirport, as well as $10 million from Ralph Lauren to preserve the Star-\nSpangled Banner. All of this fundraising was done before Mr. Small's \narrival.\n  Thanks to the growing economy and new tax laws that I have helped \nchampion that encourage greater charitable giving, it should be \nexpected that charitable giving will be up at the Smithsonian. In fact, \ncharitable giving is up across the country.\n  The supporters of Mr. Small who want to point to fundraising to wash \naway the thousands of dollars spent painting Mr. Small's own house \nreminds me of the rooster who crows and thinks he caused the Sun to \nrise.\n  The Smithsonian is the people's museum, and it contains America's \ntreasures. The American people have a right to have someone as a \nSecretary of the Smithsonian who enjoys their confidence. I believe the \nSecretary of the Smithsonian has lost the confidence of the American \npeople with his actions, actions that have been contrary to the public \ntrust that he has been given. It is proper and needed for the Board of \nRegents to take a hard look at itself and the actions from the board. \nMore immediately, however, I would suggest the Board of Regents needs \nto consider whether the Secretary of the Smithsonian should continue in \nhis position, a position that he should continue in only if he has the \ntrust and confidence of the American people and their representatives.\n  I think the board itself has learned a lot recently, and if the Board \nof Regents looks closely at the facts and listens to what the people \nare saying, it will have to consider very hard whether the time has \ncome to turn off the lights in the Office of the Secretary of the \nSmithsonian.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, first, I have had the opportunity to \nlisten to my colleague from the great State of Iowa, and I want to tell \nSenator Grassley that I couldn't agree with him more in the speech he \njust gave concerning the leadership of the Smithsonian museum. I find \nit is not dissimilar to some of the problems we found from time to time \nwith college presidents of public universities, that somehow we get off \nthe beaten path in terms of taxpayer funding. I certainly commend him \nfor the work he is doing in that area.\n  I rise this afternoon, however, to talk a little bit about something \nthat is so close to the heart of our democracy, and that is the rule of \nlaw. As a very young lawyer out of law school, I was very blessed to \nhave the opportunity to begin my legal career as an assistant \nprosecuting attorney in the courtrooms of Jackson County, in Kansas \nCity, MO. I learned so much in those first few years that I toiled as \nan assistant prosecutor. I had a felony docket, and I was learning from \ngreat prosecutors. It is inspiring when I think back on the quality of \nlegal work that was going on in those courtrooms on behalf of the \npublic by the prosecuting attorneys who worked there for very little \nmoney.\n  I was mentored on the rules of evidence and on courtroom strategy, \nbut, most importantly, I was mentored on the rules as they relate to \nthe ethics of a prosecutor. Where is that line and how do you draw it? \nHow does a prosecutor make the decision as to whether this is justice \nin terms of a sentence or this is not justice, and it must be put in \nthe hands of a jury when you are trying to decide plea bargains. \nCharging decisions: how do you decide when someone is charged with a \nfelony or whether you let it go with a misdemeanor, or perhaps not \ncharge at all?\n  Those lessons were so fundamental to the work that was done. It was \nfrom that experience that I began to revere--revere the rule of law in \nthe United States of America. It is fundamental to our democracy. It is \nthe engine that runs our democracy. It is the envy of the rest of the \nworld.\n  As I have traveled from time to time in other countries, I have seen \nthis firsthand. I will never forget a time when I was in a foreign \ncountry and we got pulled over by a police officer. We asked the native \nwho was helping us around the country that day: What is this? He said \nwe have to pay him. I remember thinking to myself how fortunate we are \nin America that there isn't an ingrained system of bribery on the \nstreets of our cities because we have this rule of law.\n  What is the heart of the rule of law? At its very essence, if you \nstrip away everything else, what is core and central to the rule of \nlaw? It is the independent prosecutor. It doesn't matter if you become \na prosecutor by election or selection. Once you take that oath, once \nyou raise your hand and swear to the job that you are about to take, \nyou must become blindfolded to any political considerations. You must \nsee all lawbreakers as equal whether the lawbreaker is a Congressman, a \npolice officer, or a high school dropout who is unemployed.\n  What is so offensive about the e-mail traffic that has been \ndiscovered at the Department of Justice surrounding the firing of eight \nprosecutors in the Federal criminal justice system has been their \nreference to loyalty--``loyal Bushies''--loyalty to the President and, \nby implication, to his party.\n  Prosecutors I have known, and I am lucky that I have known hundreds, \nhave loyalty to only one thing, and that is to the law. Good American \nprosecutors are slaves to the facts of the case and loyal only to the \nlaw of this great country. They have great power, prosecutors in our \ncountry. The decisions they make, as they apply those facts to our law, \ncan achieve justice. Those same decisions can also ruin lives.\n  What is happening right now in the United States as it relates to \nthese eight U.S. attorneys, frankly, isn't that important in the grand \nscheme of things to those eight U.S. attorneys, or those eight \nprosecutors. Am I sorry that they have been caught up in what appears \nto be a political scandal as it relates to their firing? Am I sorry \nthat they have been maligned, and it was said that they were \nunderperforming when, in reality, this was about being a ``loyal \nBushie''?\n  By the way, I am quoting the e-mail when I say ``loyal Bushie.'' That \nis the only reason I would use that term on the floor of the Senate, \nquoting that document.\n  What really is happening is very important to all the other \nprosecutors across the United States of America, particularly those \nprosecutors in the Federal system because, frankly, what the Justice \nDepartment is implying is if you still have your job as U.S. attorney, \nyou are loyal to the President of the United States and that is why you \nkept your job; not that you were loyal to the law. The Attorney \nGeneral's action implies they kept their jobs because they were loyal \nto the President.\n  It is not OK to judge a prosecutor through a prism of political \nloyalty. The facts show that these decisions included discussions of \nthe prosecutor's loyalty to the President, and because of that fact, \nand that fact alone, the Attorney General owes them and the rest of \nAmerica much more than an apology. He owes them his resignation.\n\n\n                 Tribute To Former Senator Tom Eagleton\n\n  Also, as a young prosecutor, I was very fortunate to have a man who \nwas a mentor to me and continued to be a mentor until, very sadly, the \nend of his life just a few days ago. He was a great politician, and \nthere is no place he would prefer to be called that than on the floor \nof the Senate.\n  There is a hole in the heart of Missouri with the death of Senator \nTom Eagleton. He was a giant among leaders and leaves a legacy that \nshould guide public servants and Senators for generations to come.\n  Beginning in 1956, at the age of 27, he also became a prosecutor. He \nwas elected the prosecutor of St. Louis city, a circuit attorney. In a \nbrief 12-year span, he became elected prosecutor of St. Louis, went on \nto be elected to the attorney general's position and then on to \nLieutenant Governor and on to U.S. Senate--a whirling dervish of \nenergy, intellect, and ambition.\n  In 1968, when Missourians sent our ``boy wonder'' to Washington, we \nknew he would achieve greatness, and he certainly didn't disappoint us. \nWithin his first term, he had already begun to turn the tide on the \nenvironmental damage that had ensued within the\n\n[[Page S3265]]\n\nhalf century after the industrial revolution by helping craft the Clean \nAir Act of 1970 and the Clean Water Act of 1972. He was a strong \nadvocate for children with disabilities and created the National \nInstitute on Aging.\n  While much of what Senator Eagleton did in the Senate made a true \nimpact on America and the world, no action may have been as great as \nhis handwritten amendment that stopped the bombing in Cambodia. This \ncourageous act changed the course of history by subsequently ending the \nVietnam war. His complete grasp of the complexities of foreign policy \ncontinued until his death.\n  As he talked to me in February of 2005 and tried to convince me to \nrun for the Senate, he said to me: Claire, this war in Iraq is a \ndisaster and, believe me, it is going to get much worse before it gets \nbetter.\n  Even in the later years of his life, he was a virtual fountain of \ninformation about foreign policy across the world. Despite the fact \nthat Senator Eagleton was a scholar at Amherst College in Massachusetts \nand Oxford and a cum laude graduate from Harvard Law School and \nprominent attorney and politician, he could relate to anybody. ``Just \ncall me Tom,'' he would always say, with a warm grin and a firm \nhandshake. That was his style--plainspoken, genuine, and usually the \nfunniest man in the room.\n  His ability to be the voice of everyday Americans was the reason he \nwas elected to three terms in the U.S. Senate and the same reason it \nwas so hard for him to leave public service in 1986. But, \ncharacteristically, he left office with very modest words. He said:\n\n       There is no sadness in leaving public life while you still \n     have something worthwhile to do and the time and motivation \n     to do it.\n\n  And that he certainly did. In the famous style and personality that \nwas Tom Eagleton, he went from public office but not from public life. \nA university lecturer, political commentator, writer, philanthropic \nfundraiser, community advocate, sports enthusiast, Tom continued to \npursue dreams of a different kind.\n  While Tom shied away from claiming due credit, his good friend and \ncolleague from the other side of the aisle, Senator John Danforth, \nsummed up his amazing political career by saying:\n\n       What has set Tom Eagleton apart from the rest of us is not \n     his intellect and his energy, as impressive as they are. It \n     is his moral passion, his capacity for outrage, his \n     insistence that justice be done, that wrongs be made right.\n\n  More than what Americans gained from his victories, achievements, \ndegrees, and accolades is the lessons we find in his words that we can \ntake into the future:\n\n       Be civil and modest. Act with courage and integrity. Pursue \n     your dreams and do right by your neighbors. And most of all, \n     don't take yourself too seriously.\n\n  His memorial service was a wonderful tribute to Tom Eagleton. We all \nlaughed and we cried. Some giants from the Senate were in attendance, \nand some Democratic ward workers from a nearby political ward who had \nbeen working the phones and putting up yard signs for 30, 40 years--all \nsat together and listened to great stories about a great man.\n  We all appreciated the fact that Senator Tom Eagleton wanted the last \nword. So, a year before his death, he wrote a letter--I would like to \nmake it part of the Record today--that everyone who attended the \nmemorial service was lucky enough to receive. It talks about his life, \nit talks about his service in the Senate, it talks about the things \nthat were important to him, and about his family--which was most \nimportant to him. But you got the sense of the man even from his \nfarewell address, and I will close today by using the last line he used \nin the letter he wrote that he wanted distributed at his memorial \nservice:\n\n       So go forth in love and peace--be kind to dogs--and vote \n     Democratic.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From STLtoday.com, Mar. 11, 2007]\n\n                  Thomas F. Eagleton Farewell Address\n\n       Senator Tom Eagleton wrote the following words of farewell \n     in May, 2006, with instructions that they be shared with his \n     family and friends at Saturday's memorial service.\n       Barbara, Terence, Christy, Michael, grandchildren Barbara, \n     James and Greg, and friends all:\n       This is my last audience and, thus, I think I am entitled \n     to the last word.\n       Using Lou Gehrig's famous quote, ``I consider myself the \n     luckiest man on the face of the earth.''\n       I have had a wonderful, understanding wife. She has endured \n     all of my foibles and I love her for it. I have been an \n     absentee father. Politics is an all-absorbing, all-consuming \n     profession. It takes a total, exclusive grip on one's life. \n     So I apologize to Terence and Christy and express how much I \n     love them.\n       I most fondly remember my mother. I was her favorite. I am \n     reluctant to use Nixon phraseology, but my mother was a \n     saint. She was a gentle woman and had the strength to put up \n     with such determined personalities as my father, my brother \n     and me.\n       From early days, I wanted to be a senator. My father would \n     have made a great one. He was a magnificent trial lawyer. He \n     was, in my mind, as great a speaker as FDR. He did not do so \n     well in politics because he insisted on making every campaign \n     decision by himself. I think, in a subliminal sense, I oozed \n     into politics because I knew I could not be as great a lawyer \n     as him and maybe I could prove to be a good politician.\n       My father was one of my three idols along with FDR and \n     Eugene Hecker, my English teacher at Country Day School. Mr. \n     Hecker thought every American should be able to read, write \n     and speak the English language--including his students.\n       My dad did not think in insular or parochial terms. He \n     thought a youngster should be exposed to all sorts of views. \n     Once he took me to the old Coronado Hotel to hear Norman \n     Thomas, the frequent Socialist candidate for president. \n     Another time he took me to see a Gerald L.K. Smith protest at \n     Kiel Auditorium. Smith was a racist ``preacher'' in the style \n     of Bob Jones of Bob Jones University.\n       Until 1944, dad was a Teddy Roosevelt Republican. He took \n     me to the 1940 Republican convention in Philadelphia where \n     Wendell Willkie was nominated. Dad thought Willkie was the \n     ``second coming'' of Teddy Roosevelt.\n       In 1938, dad drove me by a German Bund (pro Nazi) meeting \n     at Grand and Lafayette and explained the dangers of Hitler \n     and anti-Semitism.\n       He did not take me, but he arranged to have someone else \n     take me to Winston Churchill's ``Iron Curtain'' speech at \n     Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri. I wrote up the \n     speech for the Country Day News, but left out the ``Iron \n     Curtain'' part as being lesser importance than other \n     portions of his speech.\n       Let me make it clear that my father did not push me into \n     politics. His advice to me was to first get established as a \n     lawyer and then consider politics. When I ran for Circuit \n     Attorney at age 26 he said, ``You are making a mistake. Wait \n     a few years.''\n       In the Senate, I tried my best to express and vote my \n     conscience. I confess to several ``hold your nose'' votes, \n     like support for the dreadful price support program for \n     cotton which, at one time, was the crop of choice in the \n     Bootheel of Missouri. I think Senator Phil Hart, Senator Mike \n     Mansfield, my wonderful friend Gaylord Nelson and Jack \n     Danforth were amongst senators who voted their true \n     conscience on every vote.\n       You may wonder why I mention Jack Danforth. There is a \n     possibility that God is a Republican, and at this point I \n     feel it best to cover all my bases.\n       I am most proud that the ``Eagleton Amendment'' was the \n     legislative act that finally ended U.S. participation in the \n     dreadful Vietnam War. I am proud of the original version of \n     the War Powers Act which, had it been enacted as the bill \n     left the Senate, would have re-established the shared powers \n     of the President and the Congress when our nation went to \n     war. This is what our Founding Father envisioned.\n       I am proud that, when Senator Muskie ran for President in \n     1972, he directed me to take over our Environmental \n     Subcommittee and we passed the first major Clean Air and \n     Clean Water Acts. By Muskie's anointment, I was the first \n     Vice Chairman for a standing committee in the Senate.\n       After leaving the Senate, I never missed being there--\n     except for the debate on the nomination of Bork and the \n     horrible, disastrous Iraq War. That war will go down in \n     American history as one of our greatest blunders. It will be \n     remembered, in part, as a curse to our Constitution when \n     Attorney General John Ashcroft attempted to put a democratic \n     face on torture. Vice President Richard Cheney and Secretary \n     of Defense Donald Rumsfeld also will go down in history for \n     their total lack of planning for post-war Iraq.\n       I think, frankly, people stay too long in Congress. The \n     world changes so rapidly that I think there should be a \n     consistent and continuing infusion of new blood and fresh \n     brain power into the legislative process. Eighteen years for \n     me was enough.\n       I set forth my own critique of my Senate service. I could \n     and should have done more. I had the energy. I had the \n     desire. In analyzing myself, I blame it on my quickly moving \n     attention span. Ted Kennedy has spent 30 plus years on \n     National Health Insurance. I could not do that. I was too \n     impatient. I wanted quick action and if I didn't get it in a \n     few years, I would move on. That is a major fault for any \n     legislator.\n\n[[Page S3266]]\n\n       Finally, a word about the Catholic Church. This may seem to \n     be a strange topic to be raised by me, but we are here in \n     church and this is my final word. I do not pretend to be the \n     world's greatest Catholic. Nevertheless, I think the Catholic \n     Church is a vital part of American life, conscience and \n     thought. Just as our Constitution is a remarkable, living \n     code of governance and made relevant to the time in which we \n     live, so too the doctrine of the Catholic Church is a living \n     code of moral behavior and belief which must be relevant to \n     the time in which we live. Its timeliness relies upon its \n     capacity to adapt.\n       I am a Pope John XXIII and an Archbishop John L. May \n     Catholic, believing in what they said and what I believe they \n     would have said had they lived longer.\n       The outreach of the Catholic Church from Pope Pius IX to \n     Pope Pius XII was not the outreach of Pope John XXIII. It is \n     John XXIII who made the Catholic Church relevant to the 20th \n     Century and future popes must make it relevant to the 21st \n     Century. It was Archbishop May who made the Catholic Church \n     relevant to the 20th Century in St. Louis. In the era of a \n     Christian right, we seem to have merged God's power into \n     political power.\n       I am an optimist about death and believe there is a there \n     there. Somehow, in some manner, I will be meeting my parents, \n     my brother and my friends. Somehow, Bob Koster will be \n     waiting for me to tell me where I can buy everything 10% off.\n       So go forth in love and peace--be kind to dogs--and vote \n     Democratic.\n       Tom E.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as we mark our fourth anniversary of our \ninvolvement in Iraq, I wish to highlight an important chapter in our \nmilitary history. With foresight that proved to be a significant factor \nin America's victory in World War II, the U.S. Army established a \nJapanese language school a few months before the attack on Pearl \nHarbor, and recruited students, second-generation Americans of Japanese \nancestry, or Nisei, who would become interpreters and translators in \nthe Military Intelligence Service. Their ability to infiltrate the \npsyche of our enemy through their knowledge of Japanese culture and \nlanguage is credited with bringing the war in the Pacific to a quicker \nconclusion and later, helping turn bitter foes into strong allies.\n  In 1994, I was among a number of Members of Congress, including my \ncolleague and fellow World War II veteran, the senior Senator from \nHawaii, Dan Inouye, who asked the Secretary of the Army to publish an \nofficial history of the Military Intelligence Service. Today, I am \nhonored to announce the publication of Nisei Linguists, Japanese \nAmericans in the Military Intelligence Service During World War II, by \nDr. James McNaughton, Command Historian, U.S. European Command. Nisei \nLinguists chronicles the history of the Japanese in America, the events \nleading to the War, the creation of the MIS, and the Nisei involvement \nin the War.\n  For the soldiers of the Military Intelligence Service, and their \nbrethren in the 100th Infantry Battalion and the 442nd Regimental \nCombat Team, their service was much more than an obligation to the land \nof their birth; it was an opportunity to prove themselves as loyal \nAmerican citizens. As many friends, neighbors, and relatives were \ntransported to concentration camps in various locations around the \nUnited States, Nisei soldiers enlisted and served with great \ndistinction.\n  According to Chief of Military History Dr. Jeffrey Clarke, Nisei \nLinguists also reminds us that:\n\n     the entire experience provides valuable lessons to U.S. Army \n     officers both present and future. In fact, the Global War on \n     Terrorism underlines the need for similar capabilities and \n     programs as the Army girds itself for the sustained struggle \n     ahead.\n\n  As chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I am privileged to \nco-host an event marking the publication of Nisei Linguists on Tuesday, \nMarch 20th. Among those in attendance will be Dr. McNaughton, Dr. \nClarke, and a number of World War II Nisei veterans, including those \nwho served in the MIS.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/19/senate-section/article/S3266-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

That service can end in \ntragedy, even on our own soil.\n  Such an incident occurred last Thursday, March 15, 2007, near Cotton \nCity, NM. I am sad to report that on that day, two Border Patrol agents \nassigned to the Lordsburg, NM, border patrol station were killed in the \nline of duty in a vehicular accident. I extend my heartfelt condolences \nto the families of Agent Ramon Nevarez, Jr., and Agent David Tourscher \nfor their loss.\n  Agent Nevarez is survived by his wife, Bonnie, his mother Juana, his \nsister Viridiana, and his brother Ryan. Agent Tourscher is survived by \nhis father Gary and his mother Jeanne.\n  Border security is one of our first lines of defense in the United \nStates. An important part of that security is the men and women who are \nwilling to serve on the front lines of our borders as Border Patrol \nagents. Agent Nevarez and Agent Tourscher were two such brave men, and \nI know the Senate joins me in thanking their families for the service \nof those two men.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/19/senate-section/article/S3266-4", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3266-S3267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   BURLINGTON COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this spring, the new community \nhealth center in Burlington, IA, officially opened for business. Having \nsecured funding for the center and attended the groundbreaking ceremony \nlast June, I know how important this health care facility is to \nBurlington and the surrounding communities. At long last, Des Moines \nCounty has a permanent, unified medical and dental clinic something \nthat has been sorely needed for many years.\n  This is a truly unique community health center. It is housed on the \ngrounds of Southeastern Community College. And there is an agreement \nbetween the CHC board and the community college to allow nursing and \nhealth aide students to do some of their training in the center. This \ngives the center an edge in recruiting staff, and it gives students \nhands-on training opportunities right there on campus. Clearly, this is \na win-win-win arrangement for the center, for the community college, \nand for the entire Burlington community.\n  I salute Ron Kemp and others who had the vision to create this new \ncommunity health center, and the persistence to transform their vision \ninto bricks and mortar. The facility is welcoming, modern, and well \nequipped. And the staff members are truly an inspiration. They have a \nspecial passion for their work, and take pride in the fact that they \nare providing first-rate health care to underserved communities.\n  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., used to say that ``Life's most \npersistent and urgent question is: What are you doing for others?'' The \nstaff members at the community health centers of southeast Iowa have \nanswered that question in powerful ways. They have committed themselves \nto providing high-quality health care to all comers, regardless of \nability to pay. All are welcomed equally. All are served with \nprofessionalism and excellence.\n  As chair of the Health and Human Services Appropriations \nSubcommittee, I am 100 percent committed to securing appropriate \nfunding\n\n[[Page S3267]]\n\nfor community health centers all across America. One thing I know for \ncertain: Every dollar Congress appropriates for centers like the one in \nBurlington is a dollar spent wisely and frugally. It never ceases to \namaze me how their staff members are able to do so much--and to serve \nso many people--with such limited resources.\n  I dare say that nobody in the health care profession faces greater \nchallenges than those who choose to work in community health centers \nchallenges including chronic illness, cultural and linguistic \ndifferences, geographical barriers, homelessness, and on and on. \nNothing stops these superb professionals.\n  And one more thing: Community health centers have a well-deserved \nreputation for caring and kindness. In some ways, their physicians and \nnurses are a throwback to another era. They offer a direct and personal \nstyle of health care. They follow up. They care about prevention and \nwellness.\n  So I am deeply grateful to executive director Ron Kemp, to Dr. \nBeverly Simone, the president of Southeastern Community College, to the \ncenter's dedicated board members, to Ted Boesen, executive director of \nthe Iowa/Nebraska Primary Care Association, and to all the other people \nwho made this new facility possible. They work their hearts out to \nprovide the very best health care to some of our most needy citizens. I \ndeeply appreciate their passion, their compassion, and their dedication \nto public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/19/senate-section/article/S3267-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RETIREMENT OF BOB ROTHENBERG\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today we recognize a distinguished \nexecutive at the Social Security Administration, Bob Rothenberg. Bob is \nan Associate Commissioner and Director of the Social Security Budget \nOffice. He is a dedicated public servant who has served his country at \nthe Social Security Administration for nearly 37 years.\n  A native of New York, Bob began his career in the local Social \nSecurity Office in Brooklyn. In 1973 he moved to the Budget Office at \nSocial Security Headquarters in Baltimore. Bob's intellect and resolve \nwere quickly recognized and he rose to the position of Budget \nDirector--a position he has held for nearly 20 years. During Bob's long \nand distinguished career with the agency he has received many awards, \nof special note, the Presidential Rank and Meritorious Executive \nAwards.\n  For many years I have had the privilege of relying on Bob's \noutstanding work on the Social Security Administration's budget. He has \nalways been resourceful, insightful, and forthcoming.\n  Bob will retire from the Social Security Administration on March 31, \n2007. He will be sorely missed by his fellow colleagues and his \ncongressional contacts on the Hill. He will leave behind the numerous \nindividuals he has mentored and encouraged over the years and who, \nbecause of his guidance, are now prepared to carry on his work.\n  It is important that we in Congress recognize the many men and women \nwho devote their working lives to improve the lives of others. Career \ncivil servants often do their work in quiet anonymity behind the scenes \nproviding vital service to the American people. They are rarely \nrecognized for their important contribution. Bob Rothenberg is one of \nthose people. His record of leadership at the Social Security \nAdministration and his commitment to providing the American people with \neffective and compassionate service is a record of which he can be \njustly proud.\n  I wish Bob all the best in his retirement from Federal service and \nthank him for his many years of dedicated service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/19/senate-section/article/S3267-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING JESSE L. BROWN\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the life and \nservice of Ensign Jesse LeRoy Brown, U.S. Navy. Ensign Brown was born \nin Hattiesburg, MS, on October 13, 1926. He enlisted in the Naval \nReserve in 1946 and was appointed a midshipman, U.S. Navy, the \nfollowing year. After attending Navy preflight indoctrination and \nflight training, he was designated a naval aviator in October 1948, the \nfirst African American to achieve this status. Midshipman Brown was \nthen assigned to Fighter Squadron 32. He received his commission as an \nEnsign in April 1949.\n  During the Korean war, he operated from USS Leyte, flying F4U-4 \nCorsair fighter aircraft in support of United Nations forces. On \nDecember 4, 1950, while on a close air support mission near the Chosin \nReservoir, Ensign Brown's plane was hit by enemy fire and crashed. \nDespite heroic efforts by other aviators, he could not be rescued and \ndied in his aircraft. Ensign Jesse L. Brown was awarded the \nDistinguished Flying Cross for his Korean war combat service.\n  In honor of his service, the Secretary of the Navy named the 38th \nship in the Knox-class of frigates the USS Jesse L. Brown.\n  I know my colleagues will join me in honoring Jesse's memory and \ncelebrating, along with his friends, family, and fellow naval aviators, \nthe addition of a plaque in his memory to the Naval Aviation Monument \nPark in Virginia Beach to be presented May 5, 2007. Ensign Brown was \nboth a pioneer and a model of service to country, who gave his life \nthat we might enjoy our freedom.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Timothy \nWilliams for his 35 years of service at the Department of Veterans \nAffairs. This month, he is retiring as director of the VA Puget Sound \nHealthcare System. I want to thank him for his many years of hard work \nand leadership.\n  Our country makes a solemn promise to our servicemembers and their \nfamilies, and every day dedicated VA employees help keep that promise. \nDirector Williams faced many challenges in providing care in the Puget \nSound, from increasing caseloads to difficult budgets. Through it all, \nhe approached those challenges with unparalleled respect, \nunderstanding, and compassion for our veterans.\n  Throughout the country, the VA is recognized as providing some of the \nbest health care in the Nation. The VA has led the way in pioneering \nelectronic medical records and critical health research, much of which \nhas been done in Seattle and Tacoma under the direction of Director \nWilliams. On behalf of the constituents I represent, I want to thank \nDirector Williams and all of the dedicated VA employees who have worked \nso hard to reach those milestones.\n  Director Williams has been a tireless champion for veterans. Working \nclosely with Veterans Service Organizations, individual veterans, and \nthe congressional delegation, he was always willing to work with \npeople, to listen to their needs, and to sit down and discuss what is \npossible.\n  From hosting the VA's Wheelchair Games in 1995, to establishing one \nof the Nation's best spinal cord injury centers, to renovating the \ncancer clinic and bringing a Fisher House to the Seattle campus of the \nVA Puget Sound, Director Williams leaves behind a great legacy of \nchampioning the needs of veterans.\n  Circumstances were never easy for the VA's Puget Sound health care \nsystem. Tight budgets forced Tim and his entire staff to do more and \nmore with less and less. As demand for care increased, Director \nWilliams expanded the ability for the VA to treat more veterans. In \nfact, he oversaw the doubling of the patient care area to meet the \ndemands.\n  Tim and his staff worked to expand the VA's efforts to treat veterans \nfrom Iraq and Afghanistan through the Deployment Health Clinic. The \nclinic focuses on the care of veterans who are experiencing health \nconcerns related to a specific deployment. At the clinic, veterans \nreceive a comprehensive evaluation, benefits counseling, and assistance \nwith compensation and pension claims. Deployment Health Clinic staff \nwill continue to provide veterans with their primary medical care as \nwell as their mental health follow-up.\n  Today, the VA is facing tremendous challenges. A whole new generation \nof veterans is entering the system, and many will need care and support \nfor a lifetime. As the VA takes on these new challenges, I know \nDirector Williams will be missed. I hope his legacy lives on throughout \nthe VA's Puget Sound health care system and throughout the VA.\n\n[[Page S3268]]\n\n  I have said many times that VA staff members are truly our unsung \nheroes. Director Williams is one of those heroes. Whether attending \nveterans' gatherings in Port Angeles about efforts to expand VA care on \nthe Peninsula, or working with the difficult issues facing the Walla \nWalla VA Medical Center, Tim approached his job with integrity, honesty \nand a dedication to America's veterans.\n  Director Williams, I wish you all the best in the future, and thank \nyou for your distinguished service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/19/senate-section/article/S3268-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/19/senate-section/article/S3268-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/19/senate-section/article/S3268-3", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MEASURES REFERRED\n\n  The following bill was read the first and the second times by \nunanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n       H.R. 1003.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to advance \nmedical research and treatments into pediatric cancers, ensure patients \nand families have access to the current treatments and information \nregarding pediatric cancers, establish a population-based national \nchildhood cancer database, and promote public awareness of pediatric \ncancers; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, Senator \nColeman, in introducing the Conquer Childhood Cancer Act.\n  This bipartisan legislation seeks to achieve several important goals \nin our battle against childhood cancer. Specifically, it will expand \nsupport for pediatric cancer research, foster the career development of \nmore pediatric oncologists, establish a population-based national \nchildhood database, and provide essential information and support to \nhelp families dealing with this devastating disease. Childhood cancer \nimpacts thousands of children and their families each year. While we \nhave made great strides in treating cancer, we have made relatively \nlittle progress in advancing our understanding of the most common forms \nof pediatric cancer. This legislation will provide the focus and \nresources to hopefully one day find a cure.\n  Each year, more than 12,500 children are diagnosed with cancer, and \nmore than 2,300 of them lose their courageous battle with the disease. \nPediatric cancer not only takes a toll on the child, it affects the \nentire family--the parents, siblings, friends, and extended family all \nsuffer when a child has cancer. I have had the honor of meeting one \nsuch family from Warwick, RI who has taken the pain and devastation of \nlosing their nine year old son to neuroblastoma, a very aggressive \nchildhood cancer, and turned their tragedy into a message of hope. The \nHaight family is committed, in memory of their son Ben, to providing \neducation, advocacy, and support to other families going through a \nsimilar struggle with pediatric cancer. I never had a chance to meet \nBen Haight but his mother Nancy has told me of his passion for life and \nhis tremendous sense of strength and courage. Ben fought every day \nduring his four and a half year battle with this disease and his tragic \nstory highlights the importance of this legislation.\n\n[[Page S3275]]\n\n  It is my hope that the bill we are introducing today will help to \nstep up our efforts with regard to childhood cancer so that one day \nBen's story, and thousands of other children like him, will be one of \nsurvival. In Rhode Island alone, about eight children each year succumb \nto various forms of childhood cancer. Each of these children had hopes, \ndreams, and desires that will never be fulfilled and one cannot \nquantify the impact each of these children could have had on their \ncommunities and on society as a whole. We need to be doing more to give \nthese children a chance to grow up and reach their full potential. It \nis expected that by 2010 one out of 350 adults will be a survivor of \nchildhood cancer.\n  The Conquer Childhood Cancer Act will build the foundation necessary \nto enhance federal efforts in the fight against childhood cancer and \nwill also complement the incredible work of the network of \norganizations around the country dedicated to the prevention and cure \nof pediatric cancer.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues toward swift passage of \nthis important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed \nin the record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 911\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Conquer Childhood Cancer Act \n     of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Cancer kills more children than any other disease.\n       (2) Each year cancer kills more children between 1 and 20 \n     years of age than asthma, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, and \n     AIDS, combined.\n       (3) Every year, over 12,500 young people are diagnosed with \n     cancer.\n       (4) Each year about 2,300 children and teenagers die from \n     cancer.\n       (5) One in every 330 Americans develops cancer before age \n     20.\n       (6) Some forms of childhood cancer have proven to be so \n     resistant that even in spite of the great research strides \n     made, most of those children die. Up to 75 percent of the \n     children with cancer can now be cured.\n       (7) The causes of most childhood cancers are not yet known.\n       (8) Childhood cancers are mostly those of the white blood \n     cells (leukemias), brain, bone, the lymphatic system, and \n     tumors of the muscles, kidneys, and nervous system. Each of \n     these behaves differently, but all are characterized by an \n     uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal cells.\n       (9) Eighty percent of the children who are diagnosed with \n     cancer have disease which has already spread to distant sites \n     in the body.\n       (10) Ninety percent of children with a form of pediatric \n     cancer are treated at one of the more than 200 Children's \n     Oncology Group member institutions throughout the United \n     States.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       It is the purpose of this Act to authorize appropriations \n     to--\n       (1) encourage and expand the support for biomedical \n     research programs of the existing National Cancer Institute-\n     designated multicenter national infrastructure for pediatric \n     cancer research;\n       (2) establish a population-based national childhood cancer \n     database (the Children's Cancer Research Network) to evaluate \n     incidence trends of childhood cancers and to enable the \n     investigations of genetic epidemiology in order to identify \n     causes to aid in development of prevention strategies;\n       (3) provide informational services to patients and families \n     affected by childhood cancer;\n       (4) support the development, construction, and operation of \n     a comprehensive online public information system on childhood \n     cancers and services available to families; and\n       (5) establish a fellowship program in pediatric cancer \n     research to foster clinical and translational research career \n     development in pediatric oncologists in the early stages of \n     their career.\n\n     SEC. 4. PEDIATRIC CANCER RESEARCH AND AWARENESS.\n\n       Subpart 1 of part C of title IV of the Public Health \n     Service Act (42 U.S.C. 285 et seq.) is amended by adding at \n     the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 417E. PEDIATRIC CANCER RESEARCH AND AWARENESS.\n\n       ``(a) Pediatric Cancer Research.--\n       ``(1) Special programs of research excellence in pediatric \n     cancers.--The Director of NIH, acting through the National \n     Cancer Institute, shall establish special programs of \n     research excellence in the area of pediatric cancers. Such \n     programs shall demonstrate a balanced approach to research \n     cause, prognosis, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of \n     pediatric cancers that foster translation of basic research \n     findings into innovative interventions applied to patients.\n       ``(2) Fellowship of excellence in pediatric cancer \n     research.--The Secretary shall develop a grant mechanism for \n     the establishment, in cooperation with the National Cancer \n     Institute-supported pediatric cancer clinical trial groups, \n     of Research Fellowships in Pediatric Cancer to support \n     adequate numbers of pediatric focused clinical and \n     translational investigators thereby facilitating continuous \n     momentum of research excellence.\n       ``(b) National Childhood Cancer Registry.--The Director of \n     NIH shall award a grant for the operation of a population-\n     based national childhood cancer database, the Childhood \n     Cancer Research Network (CCRN), of the Children's Oncology \n     Group, in cooperation with the National Cancer Institute.\n       ``(c) Public Awareness of Pediatric Cancers and Available \n     Treatments and Research.--The Secretary shall award grants to \n     recognized childhood cancer professional and advocacy \n     organizations for the expansion and widespread implementation \n     of activities to raise public awareness of currently \n     available information, treatment, and research with the \n     intent to ensure access to best available therapies for \n     pediatric cancers.\n       ``(d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are \n     authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section, \n     $30,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2008 through 2012. Funds \n     appropriated under this section shall remain available until \n     expended.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 912. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nthe incentives for the construction and renovation of public schools; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing America's \nBetter Classroom Act, an essential initiative to respond to the \noverwhelming needs for school construction and renovations. I welcome \nthe support of my colleagues, Senator Harkin, and Senator Kerry, who \nhave been strong leaders on school construction and education policy. \nThis bill is a wise investment in education and economic development; \nit creates jobs while we build and renovate our schools.\n  The Department of Education reports that the average public school \nbuilding is 42 years old. In 1995, GAO estimated that we needed $112 \nbillion for school construction and renovations of the three-quarters \nof our schools that need funding to bring the buildings into good \noverall condition. A more recent survey in 2001 in the Journal of \nEducation Finance indicates that the need is increasing, and the unmet \nneed for school infrastructure over the next decade is over $200 \nbillion. My State of West Virginia will need as much as $2 billion for \nschool construction and renovations.\n  Combine these statistics with the fact that there is a proven \nrelation between the condition of school buildings and the performance \nof students, and it is not difficult to see that the state of our \nschools is entirely unacceptable. It is our responsibility to do all we \ncan to remedy this situation.\n  America's Better Classroom Act provides the financial tools to do \nthis. It will continue the Qualified Zone Academy Bonding (QZAB) \nProgram, which, in recent years, has provided $4.2 million for support \nof school construction and renovations in disadvantaged communities. \nThis provision would provide $2.8 billion to continue and expand the \nsuccessful QZAB Program. Effective programs deserve continued support.\n  But the truth is that many school districts need help with school \nconstruction and renovations, but cannot qualify for the QZAB program. \nThis is why the America's Better Classroom Act creates a $22 billion \nQualified School Bonding Program. Funding will be allocated to the \nStates based on the Title 1 formula so it is targeted, but the States \nwill have flexibility in allocating support among school districts.\n  When I visit schools in West Virginia, I am often stunned by the \naging buildings and compelling needs. In our fast-growing Eastern \nPanhandle, new schools must be built or renovated to accommodate rapid \npopulation growth. In other parts of the State, older school buildings \nneed renovations to be safe learning environments for our students. As \ntechnology plays an increasingly important role in education, \nclassrooms need to be updated.\n  States and communities need the America's Better Classroom Act so \nthat we can make needed investments. School construction can play a \npositive role in helping to stimulate our economy and create needed \njobs and is also an important investment in our children's education.\n\n[[Page S3276]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Crapo, and Mrs. \n        Murray):\n  S. 916. A bill to modify the boundary of the Minidoka Internment \nNational Monument, to establish the Minidoka National Historic Site, to \nauthorize the Secretary of the Interior to convey certain land and \nimprovements of the Gooding Division of the Minidoka Project, Idaho, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today with the support of my \ncolleague Senator Cantwell to introduce the Minidoka National Historic \nSite Act of 2007. This act will modify the boundary of the Minidoka \nInternment National Monument to establish the Minidoka National \nHistoric Site.\n  Adjacent to the Minidoka Internment National Monument is Herrmann \nfarm. Herrmann farm plays a historically significant role to the people \nof Idaho and the United States. During World War II, the Herrmann farm \narea was part of the Minidoka Relocation Center, one of the 10 city-\nlike camps where Americans of Japanese descent were interned.\n  Herrmann farm is also an excellent example of how relocation center \nland was transformed after the war into small family farms suitable for \nirrigation and farming. Many of these farms were allotted to World War \nII veterans. These veteran settlers put forth the same stubborn \nAmerican spirit and ingenuity with which they helped to win the war, to \npromote the farm area into a fruitful and prosperous agricultural \nsection.\n  Herrmann farm became one of a few Farm-In-A-Day sites within the \nUnited States, where members of a community joined together in the \ncreation of a farm site within one day.\n  The Minidoka Internment National Monument area is also a notable \neducational tool for residents of Idaho and the United States. Herrmann \nfarm is an excellent location to inform the public about the post-camp \nhomesteading era and agriculture in south-central Idaho as buildings, \nfeatures, and artifacts from both the relocation center and the Farm-\nIn-A-Day are present at the Minidoka site.\n  In addition to the historical and educational importance of Herrmann \nfarm, the Minidoka Internment National Site honors the hardships and \nsacrifices of those Japanese Americans imprisoned during World War II. \nMany of the Japanese American's who lived at this site are reaching \nconsiderable age and want to see this area preserved for future \ngenerations.\n  The site will incorporate the Nidoto Nai Yoni, ``Let it not happen \nagain'', memorial that commemorates those courageous Japanese Americans \nof Bainbridge Island, WA, who were the first to be forcibly removed \nfrom their homes and relocated to internment camps during World War II.\n  I ask the Senate to move swiftly on this bill, so the remaining few \nJapanese Americans who are still alive today can revisit this site that \nholds such meaningful memories. It is with pleasure and the support of \nthe Senator from Washington, that I introduce this act which preserves \nareas of historical and educational importance for the people of Idaho, \nWashington and the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/19/senate-section/article/S3276-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3276-S3282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS--DURING ADJOURNMENT MARCH 16, 2007\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 21--SETTING FORTH THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET \nFOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 AND INCLUDING THE \n  APPROPRIATE BUDGETARY LEVELS FOR FISCAL YEARS 2007 AND 2009 THROUGH \n                                  2012\n\n  Mr. CONRAD from the Committee on the Budget, submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution, which was placed on the calendar:\n\n                            S.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con.

Res. 14\n\n       Whereas the American Hellenic Educational Progressive \n     Association (AHEPA) was founded on July 26, 1922, in Atlanta, \n     Georgia, by 8 visionary Greek immigrants to help unify, \n     organize, and protect against the bigotry, discrimination, \n     and defamation faced by people of all ethnic, racial, and \n     religious backgrounds perpetrated predominantly by the Ku \n     Klux Klan;\n       Whereas the mission of AHEPA is to promote the ideals of \n     ancient Greece, which include philanthropy, education, civic \n     responsibility, and family and individual excellence through \n     community service and volunteerism;\n       Whereas, since its inception, AHEPA has instilled in its \n     members an understanding of their Hellenic heritage and an \n     awareness of the contributions made by Greece to the \n     development of democratic principles and governance in the \n     United States and throughout the world;\n       Whereas AHEPA has done much throughout its history to \n     foster patriotism in the United States;\n       Whereas members of AHEPA have served in the Armed Forces to \n     protect the freedom of the United States and to preserve the \n     democratic ideals that are part of the Hellenic legacy;\n       Whereas, in World War II, members of AHEPA were parachuted \n     behind enemy lines in Nazi-occupied Greece to help liberate \n     the country;\n       Whereas AHEPA raised more than $253,000,000 for United \n     States war bonds during World War II, for which AHEPA was \n     named an official Issuing Agent for United States War Bonds \n     by the Department of Treasury, an honor that no other civic \n     organization was able to achieve at the time;\n       Whereas the members of AHEPA donated $612,000 for the \n     restoration of the Statue of\n\n[[Page S3284]]\n\n     Liberty and Ellis Island, New York, for which AHEPA received \n     special recognition by the Department of the Interior;\n       Whereas the AHEPA National Housing Program was awarded \n     $500,000,000 by the Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development for its Section 202 Program, which has yielded \n     4,370 units in 80 properties across 21 States and 49 cities \n     and has provided dignified, affordable housing to senior \n     citizens;\n       Whereas AHEPA was recognized by the Department of State as \n     an organization that has engaged in ``Track Two Diplomacy'' \n     to foster reconciliation and rapprochement in the Eastern \n     Mediterranean, which is in the best interest of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas members of AHEPA raised $110,000 for the George C. \n     Marshall Statue to be erected on the grounds of the United \n     States Embassy in Athens, Greece, in celebration of the \n     historic relationship between the United States and Greece, \n     and in tribute to an outstanding statesman and Philhellene, \n     General Marshall;\n       Whereas AHEPA financially supports scholarships, \n     educational chairs, medical research, and countless other \n     charitable and philanthropic causes by contributing more than \n     $2,000,000 annually from its national, district, and local \n     levels collectively;\n       Whereas, in the spirit of their Hellenic heritage and in \n     commemoration of the Centennial Olympic Games held in \n     Atlanta, Georgia, members of AHEPA raised $775,000 for the \n     Tribute to Olympism Sculpture, the fan-like structure of \n     which helped to save lives during the bombing at Centennial \n     Olympic Park;\n       Whereas members of AHEPA have been Presidents and Vice \n     Presidents of the United States, United States Senators and \n     Representatives, and United States Ambassadors, and have \n     served honorably as elected officials at the local and State \n     levels throughout the United States; and\n       Whereas President George H.W. Bush cited AHEPA as one of \n     the ``thousand points of light'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the significant contributions of United \n     States citizens of Hellenic heritage to the United States;\n       (2) commemorates the 85th anniversary of the founding of \n     the American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association \n     (AHEPA), applauds its mission, and commends the many \n     charitable contributions of its members to communities around \n     the world; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the 85th anniversary of the founding of AHEPA and celebrate \n     its many accomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/19/senate-section/article/S3284-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, MARCH 20, 2007\n\n  Mr. REID.

Let me say to all our colleagues on this side of the aisle, \nthis will be a challenging week. Budget week always is, with numerous \nvotes. Obviously, it would be to the advantage of the body to have a \nnumber of those votes before the so-called vote-arama, which occurs as \nthe time expires late in the week.\n  So I encourage Republican Senators who have amendments to come on \nover, beginning tomorrow, lay them down, and let's try to proceed early \nin the week in order to minimize the inconvenience to everyone at the \nend of the week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would only add--and I appreciate very much \nthe Senator's remarks--we have to finish the budget resolution this \nweek. Next week we have to get to the supplemental. We have been told \nby the Secretary of Defense that all the work on the supplemental must \nbe completed by the end of April. Even though there is a week or so \nthat other arrangements can be made, we have found Secretary Gates to \nbe extremely upfront, and so we have to get to the supplemental next \nweek so we can complete it by the first of May.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if I may alert the majority leader, \napparently Senator Specter is not coming to the floor tonight, so there \nis no impediment to the Senate going ahead and adjourning.\n  Mr. REID.
