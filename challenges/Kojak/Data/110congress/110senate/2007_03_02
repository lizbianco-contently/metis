We will have more than one vote at \n5:30. What I would like to do is on Tuesday have McCaskill and DeMint \nin the morning.

If we get word \nthat Senators want to offer amendments, we can come in earlier rather \nthan later so that Members may offer amendments and speak about them \nand so we can move to conclusion of this legislation.\n  Members have been previously informed that we would be voting on \nMarch 5.

Mr. President, the person about whom I am going to speak \nhas never been on C-SPAN. Members of the public would not recognize him \nin any capacity. But he is a central part of the Senate family, helping \nmake sure offices have whatever they need to function.\n  His name is John ``Pedie'' Morton. I have known him for all the time \nI have been in the Senate. He has been here almost 40 years, working to \nmake the Senate a better place. His name is unfamiliar to the general \npublic. He works behind the scenes in Capitol Facilities. He is a \nfamiliar face to those of us who walk the halls of the Capitol. We know \nhim from his great smile, which is disarming. He always expresses warm \ngreetings. Even though he cares a great deal about the Senate, I have \nto acknowledge that he likes the Redskins more than the Senate. That is \nhis love, the Washington Redskins. After more than three decades of \nwork, he will be missed.\n  Students learn in civics class about the hundred of us, but they \ndon't learn how many workers it takes to keep this body running. There \nare hundreds of men and women just like Pedie who help us do our jobs. \nWhile the American people recognize us, the hundred Senators, today I \nwant to recognize Pedie and the multitude of colleagues with whom he \nshares responsibilities in making this place work so well.\n  There are people every day, seated in front of the Presiding Officer, \ndoing things we don't know how to do but they do to make this body \nfunction so that there is a Congressional Record every day and it is \nabsolutely correct, the court reporters taking down every word we say. \nThe police officers make sure the evil people who want to do harm to \nthis beautiful building and the people in it are safe. Today, I \nrecognize Pedie on behalf of all these people who do so much to make \nthe Senate the wonderful institution it is and our country a better \nplace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/02/senate-section/article/S2544-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2544]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague allowing me a \nfew minutes this morning to present this amendment. Whenever the \nmanagers of the bill believe we can vote on this amendment, I would \nmost certainly follow their lead. It is a very important amendment, not \njust for the State of Louisiana but for Mississippi as well and for the \ngulf coast.\n  There seems to be some misunderstanding about the scope of the damage \nof Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the first and third worst storms in the \nhistory of the Nation. As we can see, Hurricane Andrew, the most \nexpensive storm prior to these, had a per capita impact on the State of \nFlorida of $139. The World Trade Center attacks, as vicious and \nterrible and heart-wrenching as they were, had a more substantial \nimpact to the State of New York. But Katrina and Rita have had an \nextraordinarily horrific impact on the States of Louisiana and \nMississippi.\n  This amendment asks the Congress to waive the 10-percent match which \nwas done in this case and in this case. It most certainly should be \ndone in this case. That is the essence of this amendment.\n\n  It would not only mean fairness and parity and equity for the \nsurvivors of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, in line with what we have \ndone, but it would also substantially expedite the rebuilding work that \nis underway and is tied up in redtape--in mindless redtape--because of \nthis requirement. So I am asking for the Congress to act swiftly on \nthis bill to get that done.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 321\n\n  In addition, we also are asking for the critical infrastructure of \nthe levees to be included in the list of critical infrastructure being \ndebated on this bill. We have to review the infrastructure of the \nNation and set priorities about where we are going to spend our money. \nThat is what the second amendment does.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 296\n\n  Then, finally, the third amendment will put back into the law the \nCommunity Disaster Loan Act the way it was before Hurricanes Katrina \nand Rita struck. For every other disaster in the past, and amazingly \nfor every one in the future, communities at least have received the \noption of having their loans forgiven. But under the last Congress, the \nlaw was changed not for the future, which I could have accepted, but \nfor only the survivors in Mississippi and Louisiana. The law was \nchanged to not even allow for a possible forgiveness. So, again, it was \ngrossly unfair, unprecedented.\n  That, basically, is what these three amendments do.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for allowing me to speak about \nthe amendments briefly this morning.\n  I yield whatever time I have remaining.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 272 To Amendment No. 275\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 272.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. ALLARD] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 272 to amendment No. 275.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To prevent the fraudulent use of social security account \nnumbers by allowing the sharing of social security data among agencies \n  of the United States for identity theft prevention and immigration \n             enforcement purposes, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, this amendment deals with identity theft. \nAs we heard from the 9/11 Commission, being able to secure our identity \nprocess is extremely important for the national security of this \ncountry. The 9/11 Commission suggested that we needed to do more to \nprotect against identity theft and that was part of the problem with \nthe terrorists who were coming into this country.\n  So my amendment is very pertinent to the subject of this particular \npiece of legislation. One of the key items in that report is that we \nbreak down the stovepipe between the agencies so we can have some \nenforcement. This amendment tries to break down the stovepipe between \nSocial Security and Homeland Security. Homeland Security, in checking \nfor identity theft, is not able to get that information from Social \nSecurity; Social Security is not able to provide it because of a \ncurrent law. This amendment addresses that problem.\n  So it is my hope we can get this adopted. I have called it up, and I \nhave made previous statements on this particular amendment. It is \nimportant. If we have somebody who is using the same name and Social \nSecurity number, we do not have any way of finding out about it unless \nit shows up on the Social Security side. So we need to be sure we can \nbreak down that stovepipe so we can have better security for this \ncountry. That is what my amendment is all about.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 280\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, we will be voting in a few minutes on \namendment No. 280, which will create the Rural Policing Institute. This \nis the pinnacle of law enforcement training for our Federal agents \nthroughout our country. It is very important that we allow the 800,000 \nmen and women who are in rural law enforcement agencies to take \nadvantage of this great training opportunity. They are the eyes and \nears on the ground who ultimately will help us avoid future terrorist \nattacks such as the one we saw in Oklahoma City which killed 156 \npeople.\n  Mr. President, I am very proud of the fact this is a bipartisan \namendment. I am going to yield up to 2 or 3 minutes of my time to \nSenator Chambliss because FLETC is located in his State, and he has \nbeen a great champion of FLETC.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized for up to 3 minutes.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend and colleague \nfrom Colorado for once again bringing this amendment forward. Those of \nus who come from rural areas understand what our men and women do every \nday in rural America from the standpoint of enforcing the laws of this \ncountry. This amendment goes a longways toward supporting their \nefforts.\n  My colleague from Georgia, Senator Isakson, and I are original \ncosponsors and strong supporters of this measure which I believe does \nfulfill a great need in rural America.\n  The amendment creates a Rural Policing Institute that would be \nadministered by the Office of the Federal Law Enforcement Training \nCenter, also known as FLETC, located in Glynco, GA.\n  Despite the fact that a majority of America's law enforcement \nagencies serve rural communities and small towns such as those across \nGeorgia and Colorado, there is no entity dedicated specifically to \ntraining rural law enforcement officers. Currently, FLETC can only meet \na small fraction of the demand for rural training.\n  Rural law enforcement agencies have to work with fewer resources, \nfewer personnel, and are often forced to go without the training they \nneed and rightly deserve. They cannot afford to do without men and \nwomen who may be called away for an extended period of time to undergo \ntraining, and that is why we need to bring the training directly to \nthem--training otherwise they would not have access to.\n  There is no question--and I hear this whenever I travel around my \nState--that our local law enforcement in rural areas is called upon \nmore and more to prepare for different kinds of threats in this new \nsecurity environment. In many areas, increased crime and increased \nmethamphetamine drug trafficking has placed severe pressure on rural \nlaw enforcement capabilities.\n  So if we are going to call upon them to do more, to leave their \nfamilies each day, putting their lives in harm's way, then we have to \nprovide them with the resources they need to carry out their duties. As \na strong supporter of the criminal justice system, I believe this \nincludes giving them access to the vital training they need.\n  We must do all we can to support our hard-working professionals in \nrural areas. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense, \nbipartisan amendment.\n  Finally, I commend all of our law enforcement personnel, not just in \nour rural areas but in our urban areas as well--all across Georgia, \nColorado, and every single State in America--who risk their lives every \nday for the sake of protecting their citizens.\n  Again, Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Colorado for this \nvery commonsense, bipartisan measure that will improve the safety of \nevery single citizen who lives in rural, as well as urban America.\n  Mr. President, I yield back.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The junior Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, the importance of this amendment is \nunderscored in the stories and the lives that are led by the 800,000 \nmen and women who leave their homes every day to make sure they are \nprotecting America. These are men and women who, in many areas, live in \nrural communities. In my State alone, we have 14,000 peace officers.\n  As the attorney general of Colorado, I had the great honor and \nprivilege of being the chairman of the Peace Officers Standards and \nTraining Board. One of the things we recognized during that timeframe \nin my State of Colorado was that the training of these\n\n[[Page S2547]]\n\nrural law enforcement officers was very essential for us to be able to \nmake sure, first of all, they were able to protect themselves from \ngetting in harm's way, and, second of all, they were able to protect \nthe public?\n  Mr. President, can I ask how much time I have on this side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have up to 2 \nmore minutes to speak on the subject of amendment No. 280.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I am proud of the fact that Senator Pryor \nand Senator Isakson and Senator Chambliss have joined us in moving \nforward with this amendment. It is a commonsense amendment. When you \nconsider the horrific attack we saw in Oklahoma, it is exactly the kind \nof attack that might have been prevented if we had our rural law \nenforcement agencies with the kind of training that would make them \npart of our antiterrorism efforts.\n  So I want us very much to move forward with this amendment, to adopt \nit in the Senate. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nthat the time apply equally.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is no time on the other side.\n  Ms. COLLINS. OK.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Allard pertaining to the introduction of S. 746 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The pending business is the \nGrassley amendment, No. 309.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 295\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I wish to make two statements \nsupporting the amendments of the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, \nsubmitted earlier today.\n  One of the amendments, amendment No. 295, is actually identical to a \nbill Senators Landrieu, Stevens, and I introduced earlier this year \ncalled the Local Government Disaster Relief Act of 2007. That bill, S. \n664, would waive the 10 percent State match requirement for the \nrestoration of public infrastructure under FEMA's Public Assistance \nProgram.\n  This amendment is identical to a bill that Senators Landrieu, \nStevens, and I introduced earlier this year called the Local Government \nDisaster Relief Act of 2007.\n  That bill, S. 664, would waive the 10 percent state match requirement \nfor the restoration of public infrastructure under FEMA's Public \nAssistance Program.\n  FEMA provides Federal assistance for restoring public \ninfrastructure--highways, bridges, schools, utilities--that have been \ndamaged in a disaster. The law requires a match of no more than 25 \npercent from the States, but for rare and particularly catastrophic \ndisasters, the President is authorized to waive the matching \nrequirement.\n  This matching requirement was waived for both Hurricane Andrew and \nthe September 11 terrorist attacks. These were obviously two horrendous \nnational emergencies. But the damage wrought by Hurricane Katrina was \nequally as catastrophic, and the geographic scope of the Katrina \ndevastation was far worse. Over 90,000 square miles were devastated by \nKatrina and Rita combined.\n  Per capita cost is the traditional measurement used when determining \nwhether to waive the match. In New York, the per capita cost for \nSeptember 11 was $390.00. In Florida, after Hurricane Andrew, the cost \nper capita was $139.00. Louisiana's cost per capita was approximately \n$6,700. This number helps illustrates the massive challenge facing the \nState, and underscores the continuing need for Federal support as the \nregions struggles to regain its footing.\n  Nevertheless, FEMA is requiring Gulf Coast States to pay a 10-percent \nmatch. This is an enormous burden for States still picking up the \npieces and struggling to rebuild. And CBO has scored this legislation \nat no cost to the Federal Government.\n  In Louisiana, as much as $1 billion in matching funds will have to be \nrepaid if this requirement stands.\n  I know from several visits to the gulf coast, that the State and \nlocal governments--and more importantly, the people--appreciate the \ngenerosity the American people have shown them in the wake of this \ndisaster. But we must continue to demonstrate that generosity as people \nin the gulf States work to recapture their lives.\n\n[[Page S2552]]\n\n  We have asked the President to waive the 10-percent match. He has not \nresponded.\n  This amendment is the fair and right thing to do. It is a common \nsense, bipartisan amendment to fix a problem that never should have \noccurred in the first place. I urge every Senator to support this \namendment to fulfill our commitment to help the gulf coast back on its \nfeet.\n  Senator Landrieu talked about this matter earlier in the day, and I \nbelieve she will return to the floor to describe it in more detail.\n  Our Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee held a \nhearing in New Orleans during January of this year. Progress has been \nmade in recovering from Hurricane Katrina, but there is an enormous \namount yet to be done in the Gulf Coast. Particularly in New Orleans, \none of America's great cities, large sections now resemble a ghost \ntown.\n  There is a lot of bureaucratic red tape. The problem here is not that \nCongress has not responded. In fact, we have appropriated, I believe, \nwell over $110 billion in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina to the \nGulf Coast. The problem is that so much of that money is tied up--and \nin the case of this match, a lot of the programs are tied up because \nsome of the governments down there just don't have the resources to \nprovide the match. The match has been waived in other natural \ndisasters.\n  I believe this amendment which has been offered is exactly the right \nthing to do to expedite the recovery of the Gulf Coast.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 296\n\n  The second amendment Senator Landrieu offered is amendment No. 296, \nwhich I also want to support. It would allow the forgiveness of certain \nloans provided in the second Katrina supplemental appropriations bill \npassed last Congress to Gulf Coast States devastated by Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita.\n  Congress passed the supplemental appropriations bill in part to \nprovide $750 million to help Gulf Coast localities recover from the \nstorm, and the bill waived the respective $5 million and 25 percent \ncaps because of the enormous and immediate need all of us saw. This law \nwould continue that.\n  I supported waiving these caps to allow for the full flow of aid. At \nthe time, I did not, however, support another provision that prohibited \nforgiveness of the CDL loan as a condition for allowing funds to be \nreleased. The fact is that building is underway, but the recovery will \ntake years, perhaps even decades.\n  The Stafford Act provides for the forgiveness of these loans because \nit recognizes, in certain instances, that localities are simply unable \nto recover lost revenues. This, in turn, stops their efforts to rebuild \nand ultimately leads to longer dependence on Federal assistance. This \namendment would allow the Gulf Coast localities--many of them so \ndevastated, with their revenue bases dramatically shrunk--to continue \ntheir rebuilding free from the burden of repaying loans they simply, in \nfact, cannot repay.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, unless my friend \nfrom South Dakota wishes to speak.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. I thank the Senator from Connecticut for yielding.\n  Mr. President, I do have an amendment I would like to call up and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.

PROLIFERATION SECURITY INITIATIVE.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress, \n     consistent with the 9/11 Commission's recommendations, that \n     the President should strive to expand and strengthen the \n     Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) announced by the \n     President on May 31, 2003, with a particular emphasis on the \n     following principles:\n       (1) The responsibility for ensuring the national security \n     of the United States rests exclusively with the Government of \n     the United States and should not be delegated in whole or in \n     part to any international organization, agency, or tribunal \n     or to the government of any other country.\n       (2) The freedom of the Government of the United States to \n     act as it deems appropriate to ensure the security of the \n     American people should not be limited by, or made dependent \n     upon, the action or inaction of any international \n     organization, agency, or tribunal or by the government of any \n     other country.\n       (3) The Constitution of the United States is the supreme \n     law of the land and cannot be subordinated to, or superseded \n     by, the decisions, rulings, or other acts of any \n     international organization, agency, or tribunal or by the \n     government of any other country.\n       (4) In carrying out its responsibility for ensuring the \n     national security of the United States, the Government of the \n     United States has sought and should continue to seek the \n     cooperation and support of international organizations, \n     agencies, and tribunals, including the United Nations and its \n     affiliated organizations and agencies, as well as the \n     governments of other countries, but no decision or act taken \n     by the Government of the United States regarding its \n     responsibility to provide for the common defense, promote the \n     general welfare, and secure the liberty of the American \n     people should be deemed to require authorization, permission, \n     or approval by any international organization, agency, or \n     tribunal or by the government of any other country.\n       (5) The United Nations Security Council should not be asked \n     to authorize the PSI under international law, and in order \n     for the United Nations to be helpful in combating terrorism \n     and proliferation, it should first--\n       (A) establish a comprehensive definition of terrorism that \n     condemns all acts by individuals, resistance movements or \n     other irregular military groups, or nations intended to cause \n     death or serious injury to civilians or non-combatants with \n     the purpose of intimidating a population or compelling a \n     government to do or abstain from doing any act;\n       (B) fulfill the September 2005 commitment of the Summit of \n     World Leaders to establish a comprehensive convention against \n     terrorism;\n       (C) have the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Committee \n     establish a list of individuals, organizations, and states \n     that commit terrorist acts or support terrorist groups and \n     activities;\n       (D) prohibit states under sanction for human rights abuses \n     or terrorism by the United Nations Security Council from \n     running for seats on or chairing any United Nations body, \n     such as the Human Rights Council or the United Nations \n     Disarmament Commission;\n       (E) prohibit member states in violation of Chapter 7 of the \n     United Nations Charter and seen as a threat to international \n     security and peace from sitting as non-permanent members of \n     the United Nations Security Council; and\n       (F) prohibit giving United Nations credentials to \n     nongovernmental organizations that promote or condone \n     terrorism or terrorist groups.\n       (6) Formalizing the PSI into a multilateral regime would \n     severely hamper PSI's flexibility and ability to adapt to \n     changing conditions.\n       (b) Strengthening the Proliferation Security Initiative.--\n     The President is not authorized to--\n       (1) seek to subject the Proliferation Security Initiative \n     to any authority, oversight, or resolution of the United \n     Nations Security Council, international law, an international \n     organization, agency, or tribunal, or the government of any \n     country not participating in the Proliferation Security \n     Initiative; or\n       (2) formalize the Proliferation Security Initiative into a \n     multilateral regime.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, this amendment will expand and improve the \nProliferation Security Initiative in the national security interest of \nthe United States. The Proliferation Security Initiative, or PSI, is \nnow 4 years old. It is a program whereby the United States is working \nwith 80 allied countries to jointly interdict shipments of weapons of \nmass destruction-related materials in a timely manner when critical \nintelligence is received about imminent transfers of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  The PSI is based on voluntary cooperation by participating countries \nand relies on the ability to react quickly to time-sensitive \nintelligence on the\n\n[[Page S2553]]\n\nmovement of weapons of mass destruction material. According to the \nDepartment of State, the Proliferation Security Initiative was critical \nin uncovering Libya's weapons of mass destruction program in the AQ \nKhan proliferation network in 2003. PSI halted more than two dozen \nweapons of mass destruction-related transfers from 2005 to 2006. PSI \nhas improved the capabilities of our partnering countries to take \ncoordinated action to interdict proliferation-related shipments.\n  The House-passed version of this legislation of the 9/11 Commission \nrecommendations bill, or H.R. 1, significantly changes the \nProliferation Security Initiative in two key ways: First, the House \nwould surrender the Proliferation Security Initiative to the U.N., a \nmultilateral bureaucracy. Second, the House wants to give countries \nsuch as Russia and China veto power on U.S. national security by \nsubjecting the Proliferation Security Initiative to U.N. Security \nCouncil approval. This is the wrong direction to take for a key U.S. \ntool in fighting the war on terror.\n  For the Proliferation Security Initiative to be successful and \nintervene in time to stop shipments of weapons of mass destruction, \nthere must be a rapid-response capability and flexibility to respond to \nintelligence information. H.R. 1, the House-passed version of this \nlegislation, would place the Proliferation Security Initiative in a \nregulatory and inflexible straitjacket overseen by an international \nbureaucracy.\n  When we receive intelligence that al-Qaida is shipping material for a \nnuclear bomb through the waters of one of our allies, that intelligence \ndemands immediate action, not deliberation and redtape. By removing the \nProliferation Security Initiative from the safety and discretion of \nunique and bilateral relationships, the House-passed bill will likely \nreduce the willingness of other countries to cooperate, especially \ncountries where cooperation could produce domestic political problems.\n  The Proliferation Security Initiative is an effective means to help \nour allies use their own legal authorities to implement their \ncommitments under existing multilateral nonproliferation regimes that \ninclude the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the Missile Technology Control \nRegime, and the Australia Group. In addition, the State Department \nbelieves that PSI cooperation is an effective way to implement \ncountries' commitments to U.N. Security Council resolutions, such as \nResolution 1718 on North Korea and Resolution 1737 on Iran. Turning the \nPSI into yet another multilateral regime would not only be unnecessary \nbut would also be a hindrance to effective nonproliferation.\n  H.R. 1, the House-passed bill, by creating a multilateral regime for \nPSI, would limit our ability to share intelligence on proliferation-\nrelated shipments because it would subject sensitive U.S. intelligence \nsources and methods to broad international disclosure. This disclosure \nof sensitive and, at times, classified intelligence would expose our \nsources, covert agents, and methods to our enemies, including the very \nweapons of mass destruction traffickers we seek to shut down.\n  H.R. 1 would require annual GAO reports on Proliferation Security \nInitiative activities even though there are already several other \nreports currently required on nonproliferation matters that are sent to \nCongress, including reports that discuss PSI-related activities, such \nas the ``Periodic Report to Congress on the National Emergency \nRegarding Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction.'' Adding \nanother hoop for PSI to jump through would be counterproductive, and \nannual reports on PSI may even expose PSI's methodologies to \nproliferators.\n  The House-passed bill is also flawed because it would require the \nPresident to seek authorization from the U.N. Security Council for PSI. \nH.R. 1 implies that international law written by the U.N. Security \nCouncil is required to authorize U.S. measures to protect itself and \nthe world from the proliferation of nuclear, biological, or chemical \nweapons. Security Council members should not be given a veto over what \na bilateral national security program can and cannot do. As it is, \nChina has refused to endorse the Proliferation Security Initiative, \nprobably because Chinese traffickers are likely targets for PSI. We \nhave already seen China wielding its veto power to undermine and delay \nU.S. national security priorities. Because of their objections, it took \nmonths of extra deliberations for the Security Council to finally \nconfront the leading state sponsor of terror, probably the world's \ngreatest proliferation challenge--Iran. Granting the U.N. Security \nCouncil an intrusive role in our national security activities would \ncompromise highly sensitive intelligence.\n  PSI activities already are legal. All activities are undertaken in \nfull compliance with international law. PSI already cooperates well in \nits existing form with the United Nations and other international \norganizations. In 2005, the U.N. Secretary General applauded the \nefforts of the Proliferation Security Initiative to fill a gap in our \ndefenses. PSI has also won European Union and G8 endorsement. Why would \nour Democratic friends in the House want to change a program so highly \nregarded by our European friends?\n  Since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the U.N. has a failing grade when \nit comes to effectively fighting the war on terror. The U.N. has failed \nto establish a comprehensive definition for terrorism. The U.N. has \nfailed to fulfill its September 2005 commitment of the Summit of World \nLeaders to establish a comprehensive convention against terrorism. The \nU.N. Counter-Terrorism Committee has failed to identify terrorist \ngroups and states.\n  Finally, the U.N. has failed to prohibit state sponsors of terror \nfrom running for seats on or chairing any U.N. body, such as the Human \nRights Council or the United Nations Disarmament Commission. In fact, \nin April of 2006, the leading weapons proliferator and state sponsor of \nterror, Iran, served as vice chair of the United Nations Disarmament \nCommission.\n  The U.N. has failed to prohibit giving U.N. credentials to \nnongovernmental organizations that condone or promote terrorism or \nterrorist groups.\n  H.R. 1, the House-passed version of the 9/11 Commission \nrecommendations, the legislation we are considering currently in the \nSenate, returns us to the failed policy of the previous decade where \nthe preference was for unenforced multilateral regimes instead of \neffective U.S. programs. H.R. 1 would be a step backward toward \npolicies that left the United States vulnerable to terrorist attacks on \n9/11. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to maintain the \nintegrity of the Proliferation Security Initiative and to help keep our \nNation secure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend from South Dakota for his statement.\n  I believe the Senator from Maryland has been here a while. If he is \nnot ready to proceed, we will go to the Senator from Oklahoma, and then \nthe Senator from Maryland will be next.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment. I think \nit is important for the people of America to understand, first, what is \nat stake here and, No. 2, the tremendous failure of the U.N. in terms \nof proliferation. The best example of that right now is the enrichment \nof uranium for purposes of weapons of mass destruction by Iran. The \nreason Iran continues to do that is because two world powers, China and \nRussia, through the U.N., failed to support adequate enforcement of \nsanctions for behavior that would otherwise not allow nuclear \nproliferation.\n  Senator Thune very thoroughly outlined the failures of the U.N., but \nlet me outline them a little further. This country sends over $5.3 \nbillion a year to the U.N. Our entire contribution to peacekeeping is \nwasted, according to the U.N. Inspector General's own reports. We don't \nget to find those reports because the U.N. won't be transparent on \neither how it spends its money or who gets the money it does spend or \nwhether they are held accountable for it. Senator Thune outlined the \neffectiveness of this initiative by the State Department with 80 other \ncountries. That is 80 countries that help us every day to interrupt, \ndisrupt, and stop either the passage, transfer, or proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction. I do not understand the motivation, why \nsomeone would want to take this to a bureaucracy that has proved, time \nand again, it fails to accomplish the very purposes for which it was \nset up--whether it be the rape of\n\n[[Page S2554]]\n\nU.N. peacekeepers in the areas in which they are serving; whether it be \nthe U.N. Oil for Food scandal, where only one person out of several has \neven been indicted in the corruption racket that was ongoing with that. \nThe fact is the U.N. has failed in multiple areas at multiple times to \naccomplish the very things it set out to do.\n  Senator Thune mentioned that the No. 2 position on the \nnonproliferation committee at the U.N. is chaired by none other than \nIran. What we do know is, had adequate sanctions been applied to Iran, \nthe continued enrichment of uranium would not be there. The House has \ngutted one of the most effective tools we have, in terms of \ninterdicting weapons of mass destruction from across this world.\n  Why is it important? Let me give an analogy. Today, when somebody \ncomes into the emergency room and they are bleeding internally, we \ndon't stop and have a committee meeting among doctors on what to do. \nWhat we do is look at the signs and symptoms we find--i.e., the \nintelligence, the actual knowledge of what is going on--and then we \ntreat the condition on an emergent basis. This whole initiative will be \ngutted by bringing it to the bureaucratic process of the U.N. The thing \nthat happens now is good intelligence, in terms of cooperation with \npeople--the other 80 countries that are working cooperatively--\ninstitutes action. The failure to act on internal bleeding ends up with \ndeath. The same thing is going to happen if we let a bureaucracy, \ndominated with a veto power by China and Russia, determine whether we \ncan intercept weapons of mass destruction.\n  I understand we need a world body. I understand the U.N. is that \nworld body. But the U.N. has so many problems today in terms of being \neffective at what it is trying to accomplish. It is absolutely \nnontransparent with how it does that--nontransparent with how the money \nis spent and is utilized today, so that every step of the way two \ncountries are blocking our attempts to block the development of weapons \nof mass destruction in Iran.\n  We can let the patient die, bleed to death internally, while we have \na committee hearing and get the approval and then get it vetoed by \nChina or Russia because it plays out more powerfully to their benefit, \nor we can continue to do what we have been doing successfully 24 times \nin the last year. Twenty-four times in the last year, in coordination \nwith these eight countries, based on great intelligence, we have \ninterrupted or disrupted the transmission of weapons of mass \ndestruction. Why would we want to get rid of that? Why did this PSI get \nstarted in the first place? Because of problems in the U.N. If the U.N. \nwere to work as it should, there would be no need for a PSI. It will \nnot and it does not because it is not necessarily to everybody's \nadvantage in the U.N. that these weapons be controlled.\n  I believe the House has been very shortsighted. My hope is if this is \nincluded when it comes out of conference, this bill is vetoed. It \nshould be vetoed. It ties the hand of a President trying to do what is \nbest for this country and instead makes the rest of the world have veto \npower over our ability to defend ourselves. We should never give up \nthat right.\n\n  I am very thankful Senator Thune has put this amendment on the floor \nand my hope is we will have a vote on it next week. What this bill does \nis to violate our Constitution. We give up sovereignty to protect \nourselves by giving that sovereignty to the United Nations. That is \nsomething we ought not do. It would be different if the United Nations \nwere transparent. It would be different if a third of peacekeeping \nfunds were not wasted every year out of the billions that are spent in \nthe U.N. $15 to $20 billion budget. But that is not the case. That is \nnot the real world.\n  Until we have cogent, realistic, proper reforms, including \ntransparency, at the U.N, including equality at the U.N., including \naccountability at the U.N., we should not move any initiative affecting \nour own protection and that of those other 80 countries that are \nworking with us in this regard, to give them veto power over our own \nsecurity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n       Amendments Nos. 326, 327, 328 En Bloc to Amendment No. 275\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for me to \noffer three amendments; that once they are reported by number, the \nreading be dispensed with and the amendments be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Mr. Cardin] proposes amendments \n     Nos. 326, 327, 328, en bloc, to amendment No. 275.\n\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 326\n\n      (Purpose: To provide for a study of modification of area of \n    jurisdiction of Office of National Capital Region Coordination)\n\n       At the end of title XV, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, if I might, I will take a moment to \ndescribe each of these three amendments I offered to S. 4, the 9/11 \nCommission's recommendations bill. My staff is working with the \ncommittee staff and I am hoping these three amendments can be cleared. \nI think they strengthen the underlying bill. They deal with issues that \nare particularly of concern to the capital region, the States of \nMaryland, Virginia, and the Nation's Capital.\n  My first amendment requires the Department of Homeland Security to \nstudy whether modifying and updating\n\n[[Page S2555]]\n\nthe national capital region boundaries would improve coordination among \nthe State and local governments within the region, enhance regional \ngovernments and the Federal Government's ability to prevent and respond \nto a terrorist attack within the region, and affect the distribution of \nfunding under the Homeland Security Grant Program.\n  Congress created the national capital region boundaries as part of \nthe National Capital Planning Act of 1952. We now use this definition \nin dealing with our homeland security. Obviously, there have been \nsignificant demographic changes since 1952.\n  We all know if there is a problem in the Nation's Capital, it goes \nwell beyond the immediate counties that surround the Capitol, in \nVirginia and Maryland, yet the national capital region is restricted to \njust a few counties. The purpose of this amendment is to have a study \nto see whether it would make sense for us to expand that region for the \npurposes of being better prepared to respond to emergencies. If the \nDepartment of Homeland Security determines it is appropriate to have \nnew boundaries, we would have a chance to look at that. Those \nrecommendations would be submitted to Congress.\n  My second amendment is a commonsense technical amendment that \ncorrects an oversight in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorist \nPrevention Act of 2004. That act contains provisions for cooperation \nalong the national capital region's jurisdictions in the event of a \nregional or national emergency. As the jurisdictions began working on a \nmutual aid agreement authorized by the statute, a concern arose that \nwater and wastewater utilities were not included in the original \nlanguage. Therefore, if there were a problem in Montgomery County \ndealing with a sanitation issue, someone from Fairfax County would not \nbe allowed to come in to help. That obviously makes no sense \nwhatsoever. We should be able to allow the local governments to proceed \nwith that type of arrangement. The mutual aid provisions in the 2004 \nlaw allow this type of exchange of jurisdictions between firefighters, \npolice, and various other emergency responders.\n  The 2004 bill also explicitly allowed for employees at WMATA and the \nAirports Authority to work between jurisdictions under the provisions \nof a mutual aid agreement. My amendment would allow water and \nwastewater authorities to similarly share staff resources during an \nemergency and under the provisions of the mutual aid agreement.\n  The need for this amendment was brought to my attention by the \nMetropolitan National Council of Governments. All the water and \nwastewater authorities in the Greater Washington area support this \namendment.\n  My third amendment deals with a problem that is preventing the \nMaryland Department of Transportation and Amtrak from negotiating a new \ncontract for MARC trains access to the Northeast corridor and operation \nby Amtrak. The problem stems from the repeal in the Amtrak Reform and \nAccountability Act of 1997 of a provision which requires the laws of \nthe District of Columbia to govern all Amtrak contracts.\n  The original provision was done to create uniformity. Amtrak followed \nlongstanding industry practice of agreeing to resolve disputes by \narbitration.\n  There is an inconsistency between that provision and the laws of \nMaryland, if they were to apply to dispute settlement procedures. We \nneed to clarify that provision in order to move forward with these \nagreements. The repeal of the DC provision created a conflict with the \ndispute resolution clause in Maryland procurement law that requires the \nBoard of Contract Appeals hear all disputes applied to all procurement \ncontracts. Amtrak will not enter into an agreement with Maryland until \nthe State agrees to abide by the same DC law that is still accepted in \nall other States. Amtrak and Maryland both requested that Congress \nclarify that Amtrak contracts and the laws of the District of Columbia \ngovern these contracts and leases uniformly. It is critical that \nCongress act swiftly to address this problem. Maryland's current \ncontract with Amtrak expires in 16 months and therefore we need to move \nquickly on this issue.\n  I have conferred with the staffs of the committees. To my \nunderstanding, we may still need some technical clarifications to the \ntechnical amendment, and if that is necessary I will seek the \nappropriate consent in order to adjust the amendment to meet the needs \nand concerns that are being raised by the committee.\n  I am hopeful the bill managers on both sides will find these \namendments acceptable. I look forward to working with them. S. 4 is a \ngood bill. My amendments, if agreed to, will make it better for \nMaryland, Washington, DC and Virginia. I hope we will be able to move \naccordingly.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Madam President, my remarks are in regard to amendment \nNo. 309, which is my amendment, but it was offered, as a lot of other \namendments on this side of the aisle were, by Senator McConnell, and so \nI am going to speak now on amendment No. 309.\n  This amendment seeks to shut down terrorists and criminal \norganizations by attacking their most valuable resource, and that is \ntheir money. Terrorists and criminal organizations take many different \nforms, but there is one factor that they all have in common, and that \nis the need to obtain, transit, and store money to do their dirty work.\n  In the past few years, we have made some significant advancements in \nidentifying how these groups obtain and attempt to legitimize their \nillicit funds. Yet as we close one door, these criminals seek to open \nanother to move their money around and to continue their dirty work. In \nfact, they continue to take advantage of loopholes and inconsistencies \nin our current law. We must continue to be vigilant in closing these \nloopholes, and we must not underestimate their capabilities or resolve.\n  As we consider amendment No. 309, I think we have to consider that \nthis will not necessarily be the last word. These terrorists are so \nsophisticated in their operation that they may find some way to get \naround what we are doing now. As long as we are constantly vigilant, as \nlong as we are constantly throwing roadblocks in the way of \nlegitimizing their money and transiting their money, we will curtail \ntheir dirty work to some extent. Any\n\n[[Page S2556]]\n\nefforts that we make to improve America's security must then, without \nquestion, address how terrorists and criminals are funding and \nfinancing their operations.\n  One of the main recommendations that have come from the 9/11 \nCommission Report was that, and I quote:\n\n       Vigorous efforts to track terrorist financing must remain \n     front and center in the U.S. counterterrorism effort.\n\n  These groups know well that we are looking hard to determine sources \nof funding that they use. They also know that we must continually \ndevelop new tactics to avoid detection, prosecution, and ultimately to \nprotect those sources of funding. This has become, as we say in the \nMidwest, a kind of cat and mouse game. Like the larger war on terror, \nwe cannot afford to lose this cat and mouse enterprise.\n  My amendment will close existing loopholes. My amendment will remove \nthe inconsistencies that allow terrorists and criminals to hide illegal \nfunds within legal institutions and then move those funds for profit or \nto fund their activities or, you might say, for both.\n  Our law enforcement agencies and our prosecutors must have the \nresources they need to bring these criminals to justice and to shut \ndown their operations and, hopefully, shut them down permanently. For \nexample, my amendment simplifies the continual growing list of over 200 \npredicate crimes dedicated for Federal prosecutors to bring a money \nlaundering charge.\n  My amendment will allow U.S. attorneys to use any Federal or State \nfelony as a predicate offense to bring a money laundering charge.\n  My amendment will also greatly simplify how prosecutors may seek \nindictments for money laundering violations. It also closes many \nloopholes that have allowed the terrorists and criminals to move money \ninto this country.\n  Clever tricks, such as traveling with blank checks with bearer form \nor in bearer form and the commingling of illegal and legitimate money \nin bank accounts will no longer be available to these criminal \norganizations.\n  Under my amendment cash smugglers will no longer be able to hide \nbehind a claim of ignorance about the source of the money they carry.\n  The amendment will also provide necessary changes to our antiquated \ncounterfeiting statutes. The stability of our currency is paramount to \nnot only our economy but also the economies of so many other countries \nthat seem to follow the dollar. The dollar is the most recognizable \ncurrency in the world and an inescapable target for counterfeiters.\n  For instance, U.S. currency counterfeiting operations have been \nidentified in places such as Colombia, North Korea, and the Middle \nEast, undoubtedly giving counterfeiting ties to drug cartels and to \nsponsors of terrorism. This crime has evolved and continues to evolve \nwith the explosion of computer printing technology.\n  This amendment will bring our counterfeiting statutes in line with \nthese dramatic technological changes and give law enforcement agencies, \nespecially the Secret Service, the resources to fight counterfeiting \nand other financial crimes on an international scale.\n  Any effort we make to increase the security of this Nation must then \nstrive to remove sources of funding available to the terrorists and to \nthe criminals. Without financial resources, these groups will no longer \nbe able to make profits or fund operations.\n\n  Our Nation, for a long period of time, has been trying to shut off \nsources of funding. As I indicated earlier, we are up against a \nsophisticated enemy that always finds some way around our laws to \nlegitimize what they do. Once again, I want to emphasize that it is a \nconstant struggle to keep our laws so that the criminal element cannot \nfind these loopholes and do something legally that finances their \nillegal activities.\n  These criminals should not be allowed to hide behind loopholes in our \nlaws, and we should give law enforcement and prosecutors the ability to \ndeal the ever-changing tactics of terrorists and criminals. In essence, \nour goal should be nothing less than putting these criminal \norganizations out of business, and putting them out of business for \ngood.\n  This amendment is critical to our homeland defense. It implements \nchanges that the 9/11 Commission recommended in its report, which was a \nbipartisan commission and, consequently, a bipartisan report. We are \ndealing with something that should have support on both sides of the \naisle.\n  This amendment also has the support and backing of both the \nDepartment of Justice and the Secret Service. It has the support of the \nSecret Service because one of their many responsibilities--and maybe \none of their original responsibilities--is to protect the integrity of \nAmerican currency.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment and improve \nAmerica's security by combating terrorist financing and criminal money \nlaundering.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 300\n\n  Madam President, another amendment that was filed by our Republican \nleader, Senator McConnell, is No. 300, which I will also now discuss. \nThat amendment to the underlying bill will revise current laws related \nto visa revocation for visa holders who are on U.S. soil.\n  Under current law, visas approved or denied by consular officers are \nnonreviewable and are deemed final. However, if a visa is approved but \nlater revoked, and that individual is on U.S. soil, the decision by the \nconsular officer then becomes automatically reviewable in our U.S. \ncourts. My amendment would treat visa revocations similar to visa \ndenials because the right of that person to be in the United States is \nno longer valid.\n  It is very important that we do this for these reasons: Consider visa \nrevocations related to terrorism. From September 11, 2001, until the \nsummer of 2003, the State Department revoked about 1,200 visas based \nupon terrorism links. I asked Secretary Chertoff, the Secretary of \nHomeland Security, about the problems with our current law on visa \nrevocation. I will quote what he said to me on Wednesday when he was \nbefore the Judiciary Committee:\n\n       The fact is that we can prevent someone who is coming in as \n     a guest. We can say, you can't come in from overseas, but \n     once they come in, if they abuse the terms and conditions of \n     their coming in, we have to go through a cumbersome process. \n     That strikes me as not particularly sensible. People who are \n     admitted as guests, like guests in my house, if the guest \n     misbehaves, I just tell them to leave. They don't get to go \n     to court over it.\n\n  That is the end of his quote, but he makes it very clear that he \nbelieves somebody who should not have been here in the first place \nshouldn't have the right of protection of our courts before they are \nremoved.\n  Following on the Secretary's analogy, I think we can equate the role \nof homeowner to that of consular officer. Currently and historically \nall decisions by consular officers with regard to the granting of visas \nare final and not subject to review. Revocations, then, should not be \ntreated any differently than that original denial, when somebody did \nnot have the right to come here in the first place.\n\n  Let me explain how we got here. Back in 2003, a Government \nAccountability Office report revealed that suspected terrorists could \nstay in the country after their visas had been revoked on grounds of \nterrorism because of a legal loophole in the wording of the revocation \npapers. This loophole came to light after the Government Accountability \nOffice found that more than 100 persons were granted visas that were \nlater revoked because there was evidence the person had terrorism links \nand associations.\n  The FBI and intelligence community suspected ties of terrorism in \nover 280 visa applications. The FBI did not share the information with \nour consular offices in time, so the consular officers actually granted \nthe visa so somebody with terrorism connections could come here when \nthey should not have been allowed into the country. When they got the \nderogatory information from the FBI, it was too late; they had access \nto our courts.\n  The consular officer had to revoke the visas. What the Government \nAccountability Office found was that even though the visas were \nrevoked, immigration officials couldn't do anything about it. They were \nhandicapped from locating the visa holders and deporting them. In the \nend, it turned out OK, but it is an example of the mistakes that can be \nmade. It is also an example of the loophole terrorists are smart enough \nto exploit.\n  Why, then, are revoked visas such a problem? The short answer is that \nthe\n\n[[Page S2557]]\n\nperson with the revoked visa can stay in the United States--a \nterrorist, then, can stay in the United States--and can appeal the \nconsular officer's decision of whether they had a right to be here in \nthe first place. Thanks to a small provision inserted during the \nconsideration of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Act of 2004, the \nvisa holder has more rights than he or she should have, considering the \nterrorist connection. If they were originally denied a visa by the \nconsular officer, there would be no right to dispute it.\n  I will give an example. If a consular officer grants a visa to a \nperson and that person makes his or her way to the United States and \nafter arriving in the United States the consular officer finds out that \nthe foreign individual has ties to terrorism--maybe the consular \nofficer found out that the visa holder attended a terrorist training \ncamp or maybe the intelligence community just informed the consular \nofficer that the visa holder was linked to the Taliban or maybe our \nGovernment just learned that the visa holder gave millions of dollars \nto a terrorist organization before they applied for a visa--whatever \nthe case might be, the person should not have a visa, and the consular \nofficer has to revoke it. This revocation should be a final \ndetermination--no ifs, ands, or buts about it. It should not be \nreviewable and especially should not be reviewable in the U.S. courts.\n  What are the ramifications, then, of where we are today with the law \nand why change the law? Deporting an alien on U.S. soil with a revoked \nvisa is nearly impossible today if the alien is given the opportunity \nto appeal that revocation. This exception has made the visa revocation \nineffective as an antiterrorism tool. Allowing review of revoked visas, \nespecially on terrorism grounds, jeopardizes the classified \nintelligence that led to revocation. It can force agencies such as the \nFBI and the CIA to be hesitant to share information if it might get out \nwithin the environment of a court. Current law could be reversing our \nprogress in information sharing.\n  So why is this relevant, then, to the bill on the floor? The 9/11 \nCommission--again, I want to emphasize it is a bipartisan commission--\nfound flaws in our visa policies. Specifically, the staff report said \nthat the 19 hijackers used--these are the 19 people who died on those \nairplanes that killed 3,000 Americans--these 19 hijackers used 364 \naliases. Two of the hijackers may have obtained passports from family \nmembers working in the Saudi passport ministry. The 19 hijackers \napplied for 23 visas and obtained 22. The hijackers lied on their visa \napplications in detectable ways. The hijackers violated the terms of \ntheir visas, and they came and went at their very own convenience.\n  The leaders of the Senate claim that the underlying bill will finish \nthe implementation of the 9/11 Commission recommendations. The floor \nmanager on the other side of the aisle was quoted as saying:\n\n       Every day that we don't act is another day in which we are \n     not as secure here at home as we should be.\n\n  The 9/11 Commission pointed out the obvious by stating:\n\n       Terrorists cannot plan and carry out attacks in the United \n     States if they are unable to enter our country.\n\n  The 9/11 Commission explicitly recommends, on page 385, that:\n\n       The United States should combine terrorist travel \n     intelligence, operations, and law enforcement in a strategy \n     to intercept terrorists, find terrorist travel \n     facilitators, and constrain terrorist mobility.\n\n  So we are back to my amendment. The amendment, amendment No. 300, \nhelps to achieve this goal. Intelligence officials need to share \ninformation with immigration and consular officers to prevent \nterrorists from entering the United States and impede the mobility of \nterrorists throughout our country, wherever they want to do their dirty \nwork.\n  The Speaker of the House pointed out that:\n\n       Implementing the 9/11 Commission recommendations is \n     supported by 62 percent of Americans.\n\n  I think a higher percentage of Americans would agree that reforms to \nour immigration and visa policies should not be ignored, especially \ngiven the 9/11 Commission's recommended actions on these issues that \nthen would make it easier to get these people with revoked visas out of \nthe country and would not put them in an environment where, if they \nwere going to be pursued through the courts to get them out of the \ncountry, that intelligence information or FBI sources would have to be \ndisclosed in the courts.\n  Unfortunately, our leaders have forgotten a major recommendation of \nthe 9/11 Commission. In other words, this bill is not as complete as \nthe authors of this legislation want us to think it is, and this \namendment will make it more complete. This amendment would constrain \nterrorists' travel, and it should be accepted on this bill. Allowing \naliens to remain on U.S. soil with revoked visa or petition is a \nnational security concern and is something about which the 9/11 \nCommission would suggest correction is needed. We must encourage, as \nthe 9/11 Commission recommended, a procedure in which our intelligence \ncommunity can work with consular officers, who then cooperate with our \nNation's law enforcement to keep terrorists from coming to the United \nStates. We should not allow potential terrorists and others who act \ncounter to our laws to remain on U.S. soil and to run to the courts and \nto seek relief from deportation.\n  Terrorists took advantage of our system before 9/11--and I have laid \nthis out, how you can get more visas than you even need, how you have \nhundreds of aliases, the tools they use--and proved how sophisticated \nthey are and proved how they could carry out their dastardly acts on \nSeptember 11. Enough is enough. They took advantage of our system \nbefore 9/11. We need to do everything we can to make sure they don't \ntake further advantage of our system.\n  I hope my colleagues will support amendment No. 300.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Vitter as a cosponsor of this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/02/senate-section/article/S2557-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2557-S2558]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    46TH ANNIVERSARY OF PEACE CORPS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, 46 years ago, President John F. Kennedy \nproposed to the Congress one of the most successful and influential \nprograms in the history of our Nation. It was on March 1, 1961, that \nPresident Kennedy asked the Congress to establish the Peace Corps.\n  In making that request, President Kennedy pointed out that the \nprogram would be of great benefit to struggling nations that were in \n``urgent need for skilled manpower.'' The program has helped meet that \nneed as more than 187,000 volunteers have served in the Peace Corps \nsince its inception, in 139 countries.\n  President Kennedy also explained that the program would benefit \ndeveloped nations as well. ``The future of freedom around the world,'' \nPresident Kennedy explained, ``depend[s], in a very real sense, on the \nability to build growing and independent nations where men can live in \ndignity, liberated from the bonds of hunger, ignorance, and poverty.'' \nIn pursuit of the Peace Corps mission of helping people help themselves \nthroughout the world, Peace Corps volunteers have served as school \nteachers, economic development advisers, agricultural and environmental \nspecialists, and in various capacities as skilled laborers. These \ndedicated Americans have helped developing nations with health and \nsanitation projects and have assisted them in increasing their \nagricultural production. They have helped these nations to combat \ndiseases, including malaria and HIV/AIDS, that have, for too long, \nplagued underdeveloped nations. Because of the outstanding work of its \nvolunteers, the Peace Corps has become an enduring symbol of the \nAmerican commitment to freedom through the encouragement of the social, \nas well as the economic progress of all nations.\n  And, in proposing the creation of the Peace Corps, President Kennedy \nforthrightly acknowledged that American self-interest was involved in \nthe creation of the program. ``Our own young men and women,'' he \nexplained, ``will be enriched by the [Peace Corps] experience . . . an \nexperience which will aid them in their future careers.'' And it did. \nMembers of the Senate, Senators Paul Tongas and Chris Dodd, came to\n\n[[Page S2558]]\n\nthis Chamber as Peace Corps veterans. My good friend and colleague from \nWest Virginia, Senator Jay Rockefeller had worked for the Peace Corps \nin Washington, DC, where he served as the operations director for its \nlargest overseas program in the Philippines. Members of my staff, like \nZach Pusch, and even the mothers of members of my staff, like Mrs. \nDorothy Corbin, have served in the Peace Corps. I have heard all of \nthem, on a number of occasions, discuss how their lives and careers \nwere enhanced by their service in the Peace Corps. Their experience in \nthe Peace Corps inspired them to persevere in making this world a \nbetter and safer place in which to live, work, and raise families, long \nafter they had left the program.\n  It is through the Peace Corps that the dreams and the policies of the \ngreat and beloved President John F. Kennedy live on.\n  On this 46th Anniversary of the Peace Corps, and in celebration of \nNational Peace Corps Week, I want to congratulate everyone and anyone \never involved in this unique organization for your service to our \ncountry. And, I want to commend you for your efforts in promoting \nfreedom around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/02/senate-section/article/S2558-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2558]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, this Sunday, March 4, will mark the 86th \nanniversary of the enactment of a measure which established the Tomb of \nthe Unknowns, honoring those members of the U.S. Armed Forces who fell \nin battle but who were not able to be identified, those ``known but to \nGod.''\n  By its very nature, war takes life. Parents lose children, children \nlose parents, and with each passing this country loses a son or \ndaughter that makes this Nation what it is, great. No funeral or \nceremony can stop the pain that cuts deep into the families of \nservicemembers who have been killed in action. But for the families of \nservicemembers missing in action, the cutting pain of loss remains an \nopen wound.\n  At the end of the First World War, this country asked itself \nquestions related to those American soldiers who were unknown or \nmissing in action. Where would those families come to pray, to grieve? \nWhere would the rest of us go to ponder how it is we should honor them?\n  Eighty-six years ago, Members of Congress, standing in the Capitol \nwhere we stand today, sought to respond to those questions. Eighty-six \nyears later, the Tomb of the Unknowns stands honored and guarded. Since \n1937, Tomb Guards of the 3rd U.S. Infantry have safeguarded those \nburied in the tomb, every minute of every day, never failing. They \nepitomize our Nation's commitment to honor all of America's unknown and \nmissing soldiers.\n  On this occasion, choosing to reflect on the Tomb of the Unknowns and \nwhat it means would be of value to us all. We should think of the the \nfamilies of the missing, the spirits of the unknown soldiers, and of \nthe Tomb Guards, who honor them. For myself, I extend heartfelt \nfeelings my prayers for the families, my deepest gratitude to those \nunknown soldiers, honored by us all, though ``known but to God,''and my \nrespect to those entrusted to guard the tomb.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/02/senate-section/article/S2558-3", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2558]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ASSAULT WEAPONS PROTECTION\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in 1994, I voted for the assault weapons \nban which was enacted into law, and in March 2004, I joined a \nbipartisan majority of the Senate in voting to extend the ban for \nanother 10 years. Unfortunately, despite the overwhelming support of \nthe law enforcement community, the ongoing threat of terrorism, and \nbipartisan support in the Senate, neither President Bush nor the \nRepublican congressional leadership acted to help protect Americans \nfrom assault weapons. On September 13, 2004, the assault weapons ban \nwas allowed to expire. Today, law enforcement agencies across the \ncountry have been forced to upgrade their firepower in order to counter \nwhat they describe as an increasing presence of high-powered weapons on \nthe streets.\n  According to an article last week in USA Today, Scott Knight, \nchairman of the Firearms Committee of the International Association of \nChiefs of Police, revealed that an informal survey of approximately 20 \npolice departments showed that since 2004, all of the agencies have \nbeen forced to either add weapons to their officers' units or replace \nexisting weaponry with military-style arms. ``This (weapons upgrade) is \nbeing done with an eye to the absolute knowledge that more higher-\ncaliber weapons are on the street since the expiration of the ban,'' \nKnight explained.\n  The 1994 assault weapons ban prohibited the sale of 19 of the highest \npowered and most lethal firearms produced. It also prohibited the sale \nof semiautomatic weapons that incorporated a detachable magazine and \ntwo or more specific military features. These features included folding \ntelescoping stocks, threaded muzzles or flash suppressors, protruding \npistol grips, bayonet mounts, barrel shrouds, or grenade launchers.\n  Ron Stucker, criminal investigations chief of the Orange County \nSheriff's Department in Florida, stated that over the past 2 years his \ndepartment has been arming many of its deputies with assault weapons. \nThese deputies are now ``frequently'' encountering dangerous assault \nweapons even during routine traffic stops.\n  In Houston, homicides rose 25 percent in 2006 over the previous year. \nPolice Chief Harold Hurtt acknowledged the AK-47 assault rifle has \nbecome the ``weapon of choice'' for major drug dealers, warring gangs \nand immigrant smugglers. ``The reality on the street is that many of \nthese weapons are readily available,'' according to Hurtt, whose \ndepartment has also been consistently upgrading its weaponry with \nassault style arms.\n  It is clear that allowing the 1994 assault weapons ban to lapse has \ncontributed to the dangerous and deadly consequences so many of us \nfeared. Over the past 2 years criminals have been permitted easier \naccess to weapons that simply have no place on our streets. I urge my \ncolleagues to enact a commonsense ban on assault weapons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/02/senate-section/article/S2558-4", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2558-S2559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HATE CRIMES PREVENTION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I report that \na victim of a hate crime in the city of Detroit died 10 days after the \nbrutal incident.\n  Andrew Anthos was an extraordinary citizen with a passion for \ncommunity service. During the last 20 years, Mr. Anthos repeatedly \ntraveled by bus from Detroit to Lansing with a singular purpose, to \nurge the Michigan capital's dome be illuminated in red, white and blue, \nto honor his country.\n  Mr. Anthos wrote me last year to inform me of his efforts. As he put \nit, he wanted Michigan to be ``the first State to inaugurate this \npatriotic tribute to its loyal citizens.'' He had support from many in \nthe State, and had hoped for dedication lighting during Michigan Week, \nwhich will occur in May of this year, when Michigan would celebrate its \n170th anniversary as our 26th State.\n  On the evening of February 13, 2007, Mr. Anthos was riding a bus home \nfrom the Detroit Public Library. A passenger on the bus yelled at him \nand asked if he was gay. The man then followed him off the bus, where \nMr. Anthos was helping a wheelchair bound friend off of the bus. The \nassailant then struck Anthos in the back with a metal pipe, leaving him \ncritically injured, lying in the snow.\n  The man left, without any effort to rob Mr. Anthos. This clearly was \na hate crime, where Anthos was targeted because of his sexual \norientation. Mr.\n\n[[Page S2559]]\n\nAnthos tragically was left paralyzed from the neck down, before he \nslipped into a 10-day coma. He passed away on February 23, 2007. His \nkiller has yet to be found.\n  Unfortunately, Andrew Anthos has not been the only victim of a hate \ncrime. The Federal Bureau of Investigation's latest statistics tell us \nthat over 8,800 individuals were the victim of a hate crime in 2005. \n4,900 of these crimes were racially motivated, while 1,200 were based \non sexual orientation. Many of these crimes resulted in death or \nserious bodily harm.\n  No one should be targeted because of the color of their skin, their \nreligion, their gender or their sexual orientation. We have an \nobligation to make America a fully inclusive nation, a country that \ndoes not tolerate bias, discrimination or bigotry.\n  Next week, as an original cosponsor, I will join Senators Kennedy and \nSmith in introducing the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention \nAct. This bill will, for the first time, expand the definition of a \nhate crime to include gender, gender identity, disability, and sexual \norientation. It will also allow the Federal Government to assist local \nlaw enforcement in investigation of hate crimes.\n  We should condemn and act against the hate crimes that have plagued \nour Nation and have had such a devastating impact on Andrew Anthos, and \nthousands of others and their families. I hope the Senate will take \nswift action to enact the Kennedy-Smith bill.\n  In addition, I hope that State governments will strengthen their own \nhate crime statutes to combat this growing trend. Andrew Anthos gave so \nmuch to our community, and it is essential that we give back to his \nmemory by doing everything we can to reduce the incidence of these \ncrimes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/02/senate-section/article/S2559-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JANET MILLER\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I am pleased to recognize and \ncelebrate the long record of public service by an Idaho woman who has \nimproved the financial conditions for many of my State's residents, \nhelped our children through countless fundraising efforts and offered \nof herself in a distinguished record of service as an Idaho \nRepresentative.\n  Janet Miller is well-known to many people in the Treasure Valley of \nSouthwest Idaho, including the City of Boise. Janet is also well-known \nto many in this body; she assisted two of my predecessors in the U.S. \nSenate--Senator Jim McClure and Senator Dirk Kempthorne.\n  Janet and her late husband Don moved to Idaho from Utah back in 1966. \nThey did not bring much with them except for their desire to help \npeople. Janet was a founding member of the local charity group called \nWorking Partners. She spent more than 20 years in fundraising efforts \nthat brought benefit to Idaho children and other charitable efforts.\n  Janet worked on behalf of the former Booth Memorial High School--now \nthe Pritchett School--where I have had the pleasure to see the \ndifference her efforts make in people's lives. She raised money for the \nlocal Salvation Army. She worked every Christmas to see that young \nchildren who may not have had a merry Christmas had a gift under the \ntree.\n  She has been very involved in politics, having met several Presidents \nincluding her hero, Ronald Reagan. She walked the halls of Congress \noften and has been involved in numerous political efforts.\n  Janet decided to give even more of herself when, after years of \nworking behind the scenes, she stepped forward and ran for public \noffice, and she won. She was the voice of Boise's Bench Neighborhood in \nthe Idaho Legislature. She spoke often and was direct about the issues \nin the hearts and minds of her constituents. She sought consensus but \nwas not afraid to speak out on what mattered most to the people she \nrepresented.\n  Janet sought to improve the lives of unwed mothers and needy \nchildren, our environment and various social concerns. She could have \nsat back and let rheumatoid arthritis keep her down. But that is not \nthe kind of person Janet is. Janet is like many of us in Idaho--\nindependent, giving, not afraid to stand up for what is right and speak \nour mind when we need to.\n  Now, Janet is facing her final quest--to enjoy her time to the \nfullest with her cherished family, children and grandchildren as she \nfights terminal cancer.\n  Janet Miller gave of herself, tirelessly, over a lifetime of public \nservice. And now, Janet, we want to give back just a little bit. I ask \nJanet's accomplishments be noted here in the Record of the Congress of \nthe United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/02/senate-section/article/S2559-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       H.R. 800.

A bill to establish a competitive grant program to build \ncapacity in veterinary medical education and expand the workforce of \nveterinarians engaged in public health practice and biomedical \nresearch; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I come to the floor to discuss an \nimportant piece of legislation that I am introducing to address a major \npublic health need.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senators Hagel, Brownback, and Baucus.\n  Today, I am introducing the Veterinary Public Health Workforce \nExpansion Act, to address the growing shortage of veterinarians in the \npublic health sector.\n  Over the past decade, the world has faced a significant increase of \nnewly emerging infectious disease outbreaks, including West Nile virus; \nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SARS; monkeypox; and avian \ninfluenza.\n  In addition to their ability to cause severe illness, and even death, \nthese diseases share another important characteristic: they are all \ntransmitted from animals to man.\n  Veterinary medicine is an integral and indispensable component of our \nNation's public health system.\n  Veterinarians protect human health by preventing and controlling \ninfectious diseases, ensuring the safety and security of the Nation's \nfood supply, promoting healthy environments, and providing health care \nfor animals.\n  Veterinarians are essential for early detection and response to \nunusual disease events that could be linked to newly emerging \ninfectious diseases, or other biothreat agents of concern.\n  In fact, it was a veterinarian who first diagnosed West Nile virus in \nthe United States and a veterinarian who first notified health \nauthonties of the introduction of monkeypox to the United States.\n  A veterinarian's prompt diagnosis and reporting of screwworm \ninfestation prevent this disease from becoming reestablished in the \nUnited States, thus saving hundreds of millions of dollars in expensive \neradication programs.\n  There is a need to build national capacity in research and training \nin the prevention, surveillance, diagnosis, and control of newly \nemerging and reemerging infectious diseases.\n  Veterinarians are uniquely qualified to address these high-priority \npublic health issues because of their extensive professional training \nin basic biomedical sciences, population medicine, and broad, multi-\nspecies, comparative medical approach to disease prevention and \ncontrol.\n  There is a shortage of veterinarians working in public health \npractice. As used in the preceding sentence, the term ``public health \npractice'' includes bioterrorism and emergency preparedness, \nenvironmental health, food safety and food security, regulatory \nmedicine, diagnostic laboratory medicine, and biomedical research.\n  The Bureau of Labor Statistics expects there to be 28,000 job \nopenings in the veterinary medical profession by 2012 due to growth and \nnet replacements, a turnover of nearly 38 percent.\n  The Nation's veterinary medical colleges do not have the capacity to \nsatisfy the current and future demand for veterinarians and veterinary \nexpertise that is vital to maintain public health preparedness.\n  Veterinary colleges also provide a broad, multi-species, comparative \nmedical approach to disease prevention and control, which is \nfundamental to understanding the transmission and life cycle of \ninfectious disease agents, especially those that are shared with \nanimals.\n  Veterinarians have special expertise in preventing and controlling \nthese types of diseases, but there is a critical shortage of \nveterinarians working in public health practice, and the Nation's \nveterinary medical colleges do not have enough capacity to meet the \ndemand.\n  In order to meet the critical shortages of veterinarians today I am \nintroducing the Veterinary Public Health Workforce Expansion Act, which \nwill allow veterinary medical colleges to expand their training \nprograms for veterinary public health professionals.\n  The Veterinary Public Health Workforce Expansion Act will create a \nnew competitive grant program for capital improvements to allow \nveterinary medical colleges to expand their training programs for \npublic health professionals.\n  There are critical shortages of veterinarians across the United \nStates, and the Nation's veterinary medical colleges do not have enough \ncapacity to meet the demand.\n  The Veterinary Public Health Workforce Expansion Act will build \ninfrastructure, research laboratories, and classroom space to provide \ntraining for veterinary students in public health, food safety, \ninfectious diseases, global health, and environmental quality.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ISAKSON (for himself, Mr. Allard, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. \n        Crapo, and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 747. A bill to terminate the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, back in Georgia, we have a saying. When \npeople are treating the symptoms and never treating the cause, we say \nthey are avoiding the 800-pound gorilla in the living room. I wish to \ntalk for a minute about a 6-pound gorilla that is in the United States \nCapitol. It is called the U.S. Tax Code.\n  Printed in the 8-point font type, the U.S. Tax Code weighs 6 pounds, \nbut the\n\n[[Page S2561]]\n\nburden is equal to that or more of an 800-pound gorilla on the backs of \nAmerican business and American families. To that end, I am joined by \nSenators Vitter, Chambliss, Allard, Graham, and others in the \nintroduction of Tax Code simplification legislation to finally address \nthe 800-pound gorilla in the living room and the 6-pound gorilla on the \nback of every American.\n  This bill simply calls on the Congress to establish a tax review \ncommission which will be required to report back to the Congress on \nJuly 4, 2010. Its job will be to analyze all options for revenue for \nthe United States. Consumption taxes or sales taxes, flat taxes, income \ntaxes, productivity taxes, whatever it might be, wipe the slate clean \nand say: If we could do it all over again, what would be the best way \nto finance this great country of ours.\n  Second, once they have made those determinations, they make the \nrecommendations back to the Congress. Then it is the Congress's \nresponsibility to either adopt the commission's recommendations, much \nas we do with BRAC, or to reject them and affirmatively ratify the Tax \nCode of 1986, amended thousands of times, now weighing 6 pounds on the \nback of every single American.\n  All of us have different ideas over what is the right way to do \nthings. All of us know the United States of America needs revenue to \noperate. All of us know that. But since 1986 and the major rewrite of \nthe Tax Code, every year all we have done is decorate it like a \nChristmas tree, amend it here, lower it there, raise it somewhere \nelse--until it has become an absolute burden.\n  We all know--I know the Presiding Officer deals with it in his State, \nas I do--the tremendous upheaval over the alternative minimum tax which \npassed in the 1960s to address the 169 taxpayers who made over a \nmillion dollars who did not pay any taxes. Today, the AMT affects \neverybody, including a family of four making $50,000 a year, if they \nown their own home, deduct interest, and itemize their deductions. That \nis just wrong.\n  So rather than take individual Senators--I respect every one of us in \nthe Chamber, including, obviously, myself--take our ideas and try to \nvolley them back and forth, why not get a distinguished commission of \nlearned people to sit down for a protracted period of time, analyze \nwhat is right for this country, and make recommendations to us?\n  We solved the political disability in terms of reforming the military \nwhen we passed BRAC. Why not take the greatest disability on the \nAmerican people--and that is the Tax Code--and approach it the same \nway: have thoughtful people who are knowledgeable and understand the \nTax Code as it is make the recommendations on what might make it \nbetter? It may be a sales tax or a consumption tax. It may be a flat \nincome tax. It may be a series of fees or other revenue streams. It may \nbe a combination.\n  But what we need most importantly is simplicity, fairness, equity, \nand I would submit one other thing--participation by all Americans. \nEverybody has a stake in this country, and everybody should contribute \nsomething. I think if we open up the Tax Code to scrutiny, we give this \ngroup 3 solid years to look and make their determination, we get the \nrecommendation back by July 4, and then we debate it in this Congress, \nthen, by the end of 2010, we have two choices: We ratify what we have \ntoday, which is the 600-pound gorilla on the back of every American \ncitizen, or we look to a vision for the future and adopt a fair and a \nsimpler and a more equitable tax system for every citizen of the United \nStates of America.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us on this legislation, help bring about \nand make it a reality, and, for the first time since 1986, address the \ncause and not the symptom of the cumbersome nature of the American Tax \nCode.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 750. A bill to authorize to be appropriated $1,800,000 for fiscal \nyear 2008 to acquire real property and carry out a military \nconstruction project at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Bingaman to \nintroduce legislation authorizing new construction at Kirtland Air \nForce Base, NM.\n  Kirtland Air Force Base serves many roles for the Department of \nDefense and the U.S. Air Force. The Nuclear Weapons Center, Air Force \nResearch Laboratories, the New Mexico Air National Guard, and a \nDepartment of Energy National Nuclear Security Administration national \nlaboratory are some of the many Federal entities doing work at \nKirtland. As such, Kirtland's construction needs are many.\n  Therefore, I am proud to offer this bill to authorize replacement of \na fuel unloading facility at Kirtland Air Force Base. The President's \nfiscal year 2008 budget requests $1.8 million for this work, and in \nkeeping with that request my legislation authorizes $1.8 million for \nthe work.\n  Our Armed Forces deserve our full support. I am proud to offer my \nsupport for the personnel at Kirtland Air Force Base by introducing \nthis bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 750\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. AUTHORITY TO CARRY OUT MILITARY CONSTRUCTION \n                   PROJECT AT KIRTLAND AIR FORCE BASE, NEW MEXICO.\n\n       (a) Authority.--Using amounts appropriated pursuant to the \n     authorization of appropriations under subsection (b), the \n     Secretary of the Air Force may acquire real property and \n     carry out a military construction project at Kirtland Air \n     Force Base, New Mexico, as specified under such subsection.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated for fiscal year 2008 for military \n     construction and land acquisition for the Department of the \n     Air Force for the replacement of a fuel unloading facility at \n     Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico, $1,800,000.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 751. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nmodify certain administrative eligibility rules relating to children \nborn in the United States to Medicaid-eligible mothers; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the \nGuaranteed Access to Medicaid for Newborns Act. This bill corrects a \nproblem that has arisen during the implementation of the Deficit \nReduction Act, DRA, of 2005. Through this act, we will guarantee that \nchildren born in America who are eligible for Medicaid can seamlessly \nget Medicaid coverage.\n  For the last two decades, Medicaid recipients have been required to \nbe a U.S. citizen or qualified alien who has been in the country for at \nleast 5 years. In a July 2005 report, the HHS Office of Inspector \nGeneral found that 47 States allowed individuals to ``self attest'' \ntheir citizenship status to qualify for Medicaid benefits. In short, \nthe State simply asked a Medicaid applicant if they were a citizen. The \napplicant need only respond, ``Yes, I am an American.'' No documents \nnecessary. And of those 47 States, 27 did no followup verification such \nas checking with the Social Security Administration. In response to \nthis report, the DRA included a House-led provision that I supported to \nrequire States to more carefully document the citizenship of Medicaid \nrecipients and applicants.\n  Implementation of this provision, as is often the case with \nlegislation, has not been without its challenges. The interim final \nrule that was issued by CMS effective July 6, 2006, did make many \nimprovements so that the new statute could be implemented consistent \nwith legislative intent. I think, on the whole, CMS did a good job. \nHowever, there was one specific provision in the interim final rule \nthat I do not think is consistent with congressional intent: the \nprovision that makes it more difficult for children born to \nundocumented mothers to gain Medicaid eligibility.\n  In section 1903(v) of the Social Security Act, the Medicaid statute \nmakes available payment to States for treatment of an alien who is not \notherwise eligible for Medicaid in the case of an emergency medical \ncondition. A woman who is undocumented or not\n\n[[Page S2562]]\n\notherwise eligible for Medicaid is covered under Medicaid for labor and \ndelivery. Nothing in the DRA changed that nor was anything in the DRA \nintended to change that.\n  Under section 1902(e)(4) of the Social Security Act, a child born to \na woman receiving Medicaid at the time of the child's birth is deemed \nonto Medicaid for a year. States had been interpreting that to mean the \nchild of a woman who was undocumented could be deemed onto Medicaid for \na year since the mother, under 1903(v), was eligible for Medicaid at \nthe time of the child's birth. The interim final rule now specifically \nprevents a State from deeming the child of an undocumented mother onto \nthe State Medicaid program without properly documenting the child's \ncitizenship first.\n  In this case, I believe CMS has gone too far. A child born in the \nUnited States of America is a citizen. Before the DRA, children born to \nmothers on Medicaid were deemed onto Medicaid, and I think that is \nabsolutely in the best interest of that newborn child. The DRA did not \nchange two fundamental facts: First, the mother, regardless \nof documentation status, was eligible for Medicaid at the time of the \nchild's birth and, second, the child is a citizen. In my mind, there is \nno reason then to have any new documentation requirement for the child.\n\n  The legislation I am introducing today reinstitutes the pre-DRA \npolicy with one notable exception. Under the old rule, a State could \nissue a temporary Medicaid identification number to the mother which \nserved as the identification number for the child for up to a year. I \ndon't think that it's necessary or appropriate for a State to provide a \nchild Medicaid benefits by issuing the mother a Medicaid card. This \nespecially problematic in cases where the mother may not be in the \ncountry legally nor eligible for Medicaid after delivery. My \nlegislation changes the old policy by requiring the State to issue an \nidentification number to the child of the undocumented mother. This \ndoes not in any way change the States' responsibility to provide the \nmother benefits when she comes to the emergency room in labor.\n  The legislation makes one further change to the statute to benefit \nnewborns. Under the interim final rule, all children born to mothers on \nMedicaid are required to document their citizenship within 1 year of \nbirth. I do not think that is necessary. Medicaid paid for the birth of \nan American citizen. It is simple common sense that the child is a \ncitizen and requiring any further documentation is redundant and \ncounter-intuitive.\n  I want to be clear that I support the requirement that a State more \nfully document the citizenship of applicants for Medicaid. Given what \nthe Congressional Budget Office has told us would be the cost of making \nundocumented aliens eligible for public programs, the Deficit Reduction \nAct addressed a real concern by requiring documentation. I want the new \nstatutory provision to go forward to ensure that the people getting the \nbenefits are actually eligible for the benefits. However, CMS and the \nStates should recognize what is to me, common sense: A child born in \nthe United States whose birth was paid for by Medicaid is a citizen \nunder current law. No further documentation necessary.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Reed, Mr. Hagel, \n        Mr. Baucus, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Cochran):\n  S. 753. A bill to enhance scientific research and competitiveness \nthrough the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today, I introduce the EPSCoR \nResearch and Competitive Act of 2007, and I am proud to have the \nbipartisan support of my colleagues, Senators Snowe, Reed, Hagel, \nBaucus, Roberts, and Cochran.\n  The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research, EPSCoR, \nis part of the National Science Foundation and is intended to assist \nsmaller States competing for research grants that historically have not \nreceived as much funding from the NSF as larger States. Twenty-six \nStates, representing 20 percent of our Nation's population and 25 \npercent of our doctoral and research institutions are currently \neligible for the EPSCoR program yet receive only 10 percent of the \ntotal NSF research funding. EPSCoR funding provides valuable research \nopportunities in States with unique scientific features. States such as \nWest Virginia, Alaska, Hawaii, Montana and New Mexico all stand to gain \nfrom EPSCoR funding, and our country will gain from the scientists and \ninnovations made in our States.\n  EPSCoR has the additional bonus of having a proven track record. Over \n50 percent of researchers supported by EPSCoR funds have successfully \ncompeted for non-EPSCoR funding. EPSCoR is also helping drive the \neconomy in active States by providing cutting edge job opportunities. \nSeventy-five percent of new technology companies started by university \nresearch are based in the States where the original research was done.\n  In order for our Nation to remain competitive in the global \nmarketplace, EPSCoR will play an important role in promoting science \nnationwide. This legislation provides some specifics to meet that goal. \nFirst off, this bill proposes that the Research Infrastructure \nImprovements Grant increase to $75 million beginning in fiscal year \n2009 and remain at that level through 2012. Secondly, it seeks 20 \npercent of the EPSCoR budget for the cofunding program, an innovative \ninitiative to help encourage each of the NSF directorates to \ncollaborate and fund meritorious projects from the EPSCoR States. \nThirdly, it encourages the NSF Director to develop creative ways to \nensure that the EPSCoR States are part of the new major initiatives of \nthe foundation, including cyberinfrastructure and major research \ninstrumentation.\n  The citizens of West Virginia have benefited tremendously as a result \nof this program. Competitive Federal research has increased 68 percent \nin West Virginia since 2001. In 2005 alone, research created more than \n$147 million in economic activity and supported 4,432 jobs. Much like \nother States involved, EPSCoR has been a tremendous boon to our \nflagship higher institutions with West Virginia University and Marshall \nUniversity having worked together through this program to come up with \ninnovate solutions like never before. To help ensure that EPSCoR States \nremain competitive, this legislation suggests that EPSCoR grow \nproportionately with the foundation. To achieve our competitiveness \ngoals and to increase the numbers of engineers and scientists, every \nState needs to play a role. It is encouraging to note that the \nadministration's budget request for this year seeks a $7 million \nincrease in EPSCoR.\n  Ensuring the economic well-being of all our States is an essential \npart of keeping our entire Nation competitive and EPSCoR is an \nimportant step in that direction. EPSCoR States are the home for 25 \npercent of the doctoral and research universities, and our States train \nnearly 20 percent of our science and engineering graduate students. \nThis legislation will help encourage and promote competitiveness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/02/senate-section/article/S2562-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2562-S2563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 321.
