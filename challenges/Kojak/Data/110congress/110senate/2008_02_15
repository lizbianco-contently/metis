Mr. President, I speak today in recognition of \nNational Drug Prevention and Education Week. One of the most serious \nissues facing our youth in rural America and throughout the United \nStates is drug use and abuse. Drug abuse and addiction is a problem \nthat never seems to go away and prevention and education are two of the \nmost important steps that we can take to ensure the welfare of our next \ngeneration while preserving our current generation. As a nation, we \ncannot sit idly by and watch the trend of substance abuse grow.\n  We, as a community, must continue fighting the challenges imposed by \ndrugs on our communities. We have to face the fact that cocaine, \nmarijuana, and heroin remain a constant threat. We cannot ignore the \nrapidly increasing use of meth or the abuse of prescription drugs in \nour rural communities across South Dakota and throughout the Nation. I \nwill continue to seek funding for organizations and programs like South \nDakota's Glory House Methamphetamine Addiction Treatment Center and \nMartin Addiction Recovery Center to help those addicted to drugs and \nalcohol. We cannot afford to let these and other programs disappear \nfrom lack of funding. As we all know, the devastating effects of drug \naddition do not just affect those who are addicted, but everyone around \nthem. The services they provide to addicts and families of addicts are \nirreplaceable in communities in South Dakota. We have a responsibility \nto our citizens, our State, and our Nation to continue the fight \nagainst drug use, abuse and addiction.\n  Education and prevention are the first steps in this fight against \nsubstance abuse. For that reason, the Senate passed S. Res. 434, a \nresolution designating this week as National Drug Prevention and \nEducation Week. We urge local communities, schools, friends, youths and \nparents to carry out drug education and drug prevention activities not \nonly throughout this designated week, but throughout the year so we can \ncontinue to beat back the horrible tide of drug use and abuse to \npreserve the health of our Nation for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/15/senate-section/article/S1087-4", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                BLACK ENGINEER OF THE YEAR AWARD WINNERS\n\n Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I speak today to honor the public \nservice of four great Ohioans--Dr. Woodrow Whitlow, Jr., Jo Ann \nCharleston, Dr. Rickey Shyne, and Dr. Yolanda Hicks. I am proud to \nhonor these four NASA Glenn engineers for their achievements in the \nfields of science, engineering, and technology.\n  On the Shores of Lake Erie, just outside the city of Cleveland, OH, \nworld class scientists and engineers at the NASA Glenn Research Center \nare conducting world class research. Dr. Wilson, Ms. Charleston, Dr. \nShyne, and Dr. Hicks, each of whom has contributed meaningfully to NASA \nGlenn's important work, are rightfully being honored at this year's \nBlack Engineer of the Year Awards ceremony.\n  It is the pragmatic, yet creative, approach taken by researchers like \nDr. Whitlow, Ms. Charleston, Dr. Shyne, and Dr. Hicks that will allow \nthis country to remain at the forefront of aerospace and space \nexploration technology. It is the work of the many dedicated scientists \nand engineers like them that drives our economy and ensures our \ncountry's future prosperity.\n  I am proud to honor these great Ohioans, the work of the NASA Glenn \nResearch Center, and the many other award recipients at the Black \nEngineer of the Year Awards ceremony. In this new global economy, \nAmerican innovation in the fields of math, science, and engineering is \ncritical. The hard work and dedication of these four serve as an \ninspiration for the next generation of American innovators.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/15/senate-section/article/S1087-5", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1087-S1088]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG.
