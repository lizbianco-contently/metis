Mr. President, before turning this over to the Republican \nleader, we have worked long and hard on the farm bill. It is a \nbipartisan bill. It has been a struggle to get where we are. I so \nappreciate the work done by Senators who are responsible for bringing \nthis to the floor, Senators Harkin and Chambliss, Baucus, Grassley, and \na lot of other players who are involved. It is a very important piece \nof legislation. We expect to turn to the farm conference report as soon \nas we receive it from the House. We even will try to do it before it \ncomes here, if we can get a consent agreement. We hope we can limit \ndebate on this matter and get it out of here.\n  Remember, this week we have to hopefully dispose of the collective \nbargaining legislation. We have to take\n\n[[Page S4124]]\n\ncare of the farm bill. We have to appoint conferees on the budget. We \nalso have to dispose of, because we have a statutory problem, the media \ncross-ownership issue. There are 10 hours of debate on that. I hope we \ncan limit that significantly. Those are the items we need to complete \nthis week--this week--and it is already Wednesday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/14/senate-section/article/S4124-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, more than a hundred years ago, the \nHungarian journalist Theodore Herzl set into motion a political \nmovement that would change the world.\n  Herzl's vision for a Jewish homeland would not be realized in his own \nlifetime, but the nation that would become the modern State of Israel \nwould have exceeded even his dreams of a prosperous home for the \ndescendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.\n  In the nearly 2,000 years that had passed since the exile, the Jewish \npeople had remained faithful to their traditions, praying and hoping \nfor their eventual return. That right was acknowledged in the Balfour \nDeclaration of 1917 and reaffirmed by the mandate of the League of \nNations in 1922. The horrors of the Nazi Holocaust made Israel's \nestablishment all the more urgent, and had created among the American \npeople a deep sympathy for the aspirations of the Jewish people. At the \nstroke of midnight, on this day in 1948, the modern State of Israel was \nborn, and just eleven minutes later, here in the U.S., President Truman \nrecognized the new state, solidifying for all time the bond between our \ntwo countries.\n  A deep friendship between America and Israel is natural, given the \nmany political and moral values we share. But our strong diplomatic \nties were far from inevitable. Historians tell us that recognition was \nstrenuously opposed by Secretary of State George Marshall, a foreign \npolicy realist who valued strategic interests over humanitarian \nconcerns. In this case, Marshall was overridden by his Commander in \nChief, who, following the Holocaust, saw the moral and humanitarian \nimperative of the Jewish people having their own state. Despite \nPresident Truman's deep respect for Marshall, it was a decision that \nTruman would never regret.\n  The U.S. Congress, it should be noted, had spoken out on the issue \nlong before recognition was sought. As far back as 1922, Congress \nexpressed its sympathy for a sovereign homeland for the Jewish people. \nIt would take two more decades for that state to come about, but when \nit did Congress and the American people were ready once again to \nexpress overwhelming support.\n  In the decades since the birth of the modern State of Israel, much \nhas changed. This desert land has in many ways become ``a land that \nfloweth with milk and honey.'' In this, it reflects the ingenuity and \nthe resourcefulness of the Israeli people.\n  Over time, the U.S.-Israeli relationship has only grown stronger. A \nbond that was originally based largely on moral grounds and shared \nvalues has been fortified by shared strategic interests.\n  While some Arab states recognize Israel, most do not. And Israel \nfaces numerous threats, including an existential threat from Iran.\n  Yet on this day of celebration, it is my fervent hope that Israel \nwill soon celebrate its birth as a state that is recognized by all its \nArab neighbors, safe from the threat of terror. Until then, I know my \ncolleagues and I will do everything in our power to ensure that the \nU.S.-Israeli relationship is robust, and that the Jewish state has all \nit needs to defend itself.\n  On this anniversary, we send our best wishes and every expression of \nheartfelt goodwill and congratulations to the Jewish people.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/14/senate-section/article/S4124-3", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, in a little more than 2 hours, I will join \nmembers of the United States and Colombian labor organizations at a \nnews conference speaking out against human rights abuses in Colombia, \nspeaking out against the pending free-trade agreement that would ignore \nthose abuses and, in some sense, excuse them. Much of the talk about \nthis agreement centers around the violence and impunity in Colombia, \nespecially as it relates to trade unionists. And for good reason. \nInternational organizations, human rights and religious groups look at \nColombia's record with alarm and urgency. Human rights defenders, trade \nunionists, community leaders, and religious leaders are today, in too \nmany cases, receiving death threats from rearmed paramilitary groups \nsuch as the Black Eagles and are reeling from a new wave of violence.\n  Before, during, and after a countrywide rally on March 6, 2008, \nagainst paramilitary and all forms of violence, at least two march \norganizers were killed. Union leaders Carlo Burbano and Carmen Cecilia \nCarvajal were killed for simply trying to voice their views. Three \nother social leaders were killed in events that also were associated \nwith the march. March organizers all over the country received death \nthreats. One organizer's house was attacked with gunfire on February \n29. Those human rights issues are serious. Yet the administration takes \nthem in stride, barely acknowledging the Colombian culture of violence \nand then impunity, in too many cases, for those who committed those \nviolent acts.\n  In a short while, I will stand with nearly a dozen brave women and \nmen who have come to Washington to give witness to the horrific danger \nthey and their loved ones face every day. These brave men and women \nface threats to their jobs, their families, their homes, and their \nlives. They are under threat because they have taken a stand. They have \nfought for labor and human rights in Colombia.\n  One message I want them to take back to Colombia is that we are not \ntaking lightly what is happening to them. The administration may be \ntaking it lightly, but an awful lot of people in the House and Senate \nand an awful lot of Americans don't take this lightly. We will push the \nBush administration to take a stand against the violence occurring in \nColombia instead of glossing over it.\n  The President must not forsake our Nation's values, our profound \nrespect for the rule of law, and our Nation's hard-won progress on \nbehalf of labor and human rights and basic rights. Again, the President \nmust not forsake our Nation's values and our profound respect for the \nrule of law or our hard-won progress to establish labor, human, and \nbasic rights. The President must not forsake our values or dismiss the \nsacrifices of so many.\n  The Colombian Government has taken steps to strengthen legal \ninstitutions and processes--I acknowledge that--but the bottom line is \nthe violence is not subsiding. Murders of labor leaders continued at a \npace of one per week already this year.\n  Some newspapers have said the violence is down--and although it was \ndown last year, now it is back up--and we should move on with this \nColombia trade agreement because the violence is down. But when there \nis one labor activist killed every single week, it is hard to say that \nis an acceptable level. That is what people in the administration are \nsaying. That is what some newspapers are saying, that that is an \nacceptable level of violence. No, we should not approve a trade \nagreement when that kind of violence is aimed at too many labor \nactivists.\n  For the sake of both our nations, the United States should not sign a \ntrade\n\n[[Page S4125]]\n\ndeal with Colombia that shortchanges workers, that rewards polluters, \nthat gives businesses the same power as sovereign governments. Later, I \nwill talk more about a part of this trade agreement and how it does \nreward polluters and gives businesses the same power as sovereign \ngovernments. In many cases, corporations will be able to override the \ndemocratically attained rule of law, rules, and regulations. More on \nthat later.\n  Back to the issue at hand with Colombia, we absolutely should not \nsign a trade deal that forgives treachery toward labor leaders, that \nsays it is OK that these labor leaders are murdered. We in this body \nwill fight alongside our Colombian labor friends for fair trade, and we \nwill fight for their efforts to end the violence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/14/senate-section/article/S4125-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4125-S4126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               FARM BILL\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise today not only as a U.S. Senator \nfrom Montana but also as a farmer who is actively engaged in \nagriculture, family farm agriculture. It truly is a family farm that we \noperate in north central Montana. Not only do my wife Sharla and I \nfarm, but when we need help, my brother, my son-in-law, my son, and my \ndaughter all step to the plate and help us.\n  We just finished spring planting in north central Montana, and with \nit comes hopes for a great year. We all know the commodity prices right \nnow are very good, but the rest of the story is this: Diesel prices are \ndouble what they were last year. Chemical prices have gone through the \nroof. Fertilizer is becoming unaffordable because the cost is so high.\n  That is where the farm bill steps in--this farm bill which just came \nout of conference committee which we will vote on, hopefully, later \ntoday. In this farm bill, we raise the target price. We have a disaster \nprogram that Senator Baucus fought so hard to get into this bill so \nthat farmers, when they do have a disaster, do not have to come back to \nWashington, DC, with hat in hand. They will have a safety net. We have \ncountry-of-origin labeling in this farm bill with some teeth in it that \nI hope the next administration takes by the horns and adopts so people \nknow where their food comes from. It allows for the interstate shipment \nof meat so small meatpackers can ship their products across State \nlines, which has not been available before, to add value to meat \nproducts throughout this country. It has a nonfood biofuel section of \nwhich a part of that is a camelina pilot program, which I am very proud \nof, which offers farmers another crop for their rotation and helps this \ncountry become more energy independent. It also has a very aggressive \nnutrition program to help people who need help buying food, which is \nvery important.\n  This bill is about rural development, about making rural America all \nit can be, creating jobs, and helping meet this country's energy needs, \ncreating a level of energy independence.\n  This bill is also about food security for this country. We have been \nvery fortunate in the United States. We have not suffered the lack of \nfood that other countries have. I believe it is because of farm bills \nof the past, and it is because family farmers have done such a great \njob meeting this country's food demands.\n  We need to have a farm bill that helps support those family farmers, \nand that is exactly what this farm bill does. Is it perfect? No. But is \nit pretty darn good? Yes. This farm bill does things for people in \nproduction agriculture that it needs to do to make sure they remain in \nbusiness, to make sure this country's food security needs are met.\n  So when I read editorials in newspapers on the east coast, west \ncoast, in the Washington Post, Boston Herald, Dallas Morning News, Los \nAngeles Times--and the list goes on and on--that talk about this farm \nbill being loaded with waste and giveaways and lard, I ask the folks \nwho write these editorials to come out to Montana and talk to somebody \nwho has their hands in the dirt. Go out to the Midwest and see the \nkinds of challenges these folks have and ask yourself: Is this farm \nbill really full of the kind of waste you are talking about? Because it \nis not. It is a farm bill that meets the needs of America's family \nfarmers. As I have said many times before, if we lose this country's \nfamily farmers, this country will change forever, and not for the \nbetter.\n  So I applaud the folks who worked on the conference committee from \nboth parties, from all corners of this country, to develop a farm bill \nthat meets the needs of this country. I hope the Members of this Senate \njoin me later on today in voting for this farm bill and sending it to \nthe President's desk. I hope the President signs it because it is the \nright thing to do.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll of the \nSenate.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it has now been 10 days since the \ndevastating tropical cyclone hit the country of Burma. The cyclone, \nwhich brought sustained winds of 130 miles an hour, with gusts as high \nas 160 miles an hour, really caused widespread destruction across this \nAsian nation.\n  As you can see from the before and after satellite photographs that \nare on this chart, the devastation was particularly severe in the \ncountry's low-lying delta area. A 12-foot wall of water swept away \nentire villages, leaving thousands dead and homeless. Bodies floated in \nfloodwaters, and survivors tried to reach dry ground on boats, using \nblankets as sails. Fights broke out around the few shops that were able \nto provide any kind of food to the hungry people.\n  The United Nations has estimated that between 1.2 million and 1.9 \nmillion people have been severely affected and that cyclone-related \ndeaths could reach over 100,000. Already, more than 200,000 people are \nreported missing.\n  Immediately after the cyclone, countries around the world, including \nthe United States, offered emergency supplies and assistance. We \noffered help in transporting badly needed food, water, and medicine. In \nfact, U.S. Navy ships that by coincidence were in the region for \ntraining exercises have remained in the vicinity to offer help. Yet \nalmost 2 weeks after the cyclone, this natural disaster has been made \nworse by the reluctance of the Burmese military government to even \naccept international aid on the scale that is necessary. Instead, they \nhave ignored the plight of their own people, as the entire world \nwatches. Not only have they refused most outside assistance, they \nbroadcast shameless propaganda showing the military handing out aid to \nthe people. Yet reports from the ground indicate the government has \ndone little or nothing to really help. In fact, there are reports that \nthe government's military has confiscated some of the limited aid that \nhas been allowed to enter into the country.\n\n  Not only has the military ignored the suffering of its own people, \nbut it tried to push through a sham referendum at the same time. Can \nyou imagine a national election in the midst of this devastation? \nCritical time and resources were used to intimidate people to the \npolls--time and resources that should have been spent for helpless and \nsuffering victims.\n  U.N. Secretary Ban Ki-moon summed up the situation when he said:\n\n       This is not about politics; it is about saving people's \n     lives. There is absolutely no more time to lose.\n\n  He continued:\n\n       Unless more aid gets into the country very quickly, we face \n     an outbreak of infectious diseases that could dwarf today's \n     crisis.\n\n  In a country that already has one of the worst health care systems of \nthe world, it is even harder for people who need medical attention to \nfind it. The environment is a rich breeding ground for infection and \ncontagious disease. We are hearing disturbing reports of badly injured \npeople trying to dress their own wounds. The government has repeatedly \nforced humanitarian organizations such as Doctors Without Borders to \nleave the hardest hit areas. Bodies are decomposing. The contamination \nis spreading. The immediate\n\n[[Page S4126]]\n\nrisk of waterborne disease is acute. The risk of other diseases, such \nas malaria and dengue fever, is growing as mosquitoes rapidly reproduce \nin the flooded areas.\n  Existing malnutrition among children, which affects up to half the \npopulation in Burma, is even worse because of the flooding and cyclone.\n  Mr. President, perhaps the world should not be so surprised with this \nmilitary's outrageous reaction to this disaster. This is, after all, a \ngovernment with a long, well-documented history of brutality to its own \npeople.\n  In eastern Burma, the military has destroyed 3,000 villages over the \npast 10 years. It has widely used forced labor and has recruited up to \n70,000 child soldiers--far more than any other country in the world. \nToday, Burma has an estimated 1.5 million internal and external \nrefugees.\n  It is a country with a well-documented history of political \nrepression and torture. Two years after the Burmese people protested \nconditions in 1988, the government held an election. Aung San Suu Kyi, \na leader in human rights around the world, was placed under house \narrest before the election and has suffered mightily since. Despite her \nparty's victory she was subjugated and imprisoned in her own home for \nmost of the last 18 years. Suu Kyi has been awarded the Congressional \nGold Medal--recognition by this Congress of her singular efforts in \nBurma to bring a new day and a new government. Last September, \nthousands of monks peacefully protested for change in Burma. Many of \nthem were hunted down, imprisoned, and killed. This military junta has \nignored global calls for dialog and an end to the violence.\n  Earlier this week, ADM Timothy Keating, who leads the U.S. Pacific \nCommand, and USAID Administrator Henrietta Fore landed with an American \nrelief flight in Rangoon. They met directly with the Burmese military \nofficials to offer help. I hope this visit does help.\n  Last week, I spoke of the world taking definitive action to halt the \ngenocide in Darfur. Today, we face a mounting humanitarian crisis in \nBurma.\n  Some, including French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner, have said \nthe United Nations should invoke the responsibility to protect--a \nprovision that allows the world community to help those left \nunprotected by their governments. Others argue that China, which also \nhas suffered a horrible natural disaster this week, should use its \nfriendship with Burma to help open the country to outside \nassistance. At a minimum, Burma should view China's response to its \nearthquake, in which it immediately and proactively stated its \nwillingness to accept emergency aid, as an important way to work with \nthe global community. Whatever the route, the world community, with \nAmerican leadership and generosity, must do more to address this \nhumanitarian crisis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/14/senate-section/article/S4126-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4126-S4127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, free market fundamentalism tells us that \nall we have to do is get Government out of the way and the miraculous \npowers of competition and supply and demand will solve all our \nproblems. This is a cardinal principle of the administration now in \npower. They have had 7 \\1/2\\ years to test their theory, and the \nresults--for our economy and America's working families--has been a \ndisaster. They have put their theory to work, and it has thrown \nAmericans out of work. The middle class in America is shrinking and \nsuffering. Today, more Americans are falling out of the middle class \nthan are working their way into it.\n  A new poll by the respected Kaiser Family Foundation provides a \nsobering look at the economic situation and the reality of economics in \nAmerica today. The Kaiser Foundation asked people about seven economic \ntrends or changes that they considered serious problems. Forty-four \npercent of Americans said problems paying for gasoline is a serious \nproblem for their family's financial well-being. Twenty-nine percent \nsaid problems getting a good-paying job or a raise are serious. Twenty-\neight percent of Americans said problems in paying for health care and \nhealth insurance were serious and hurting their economic well-being. \nThose are the top three economic strains on family budgets: The price \nof gasoline, jobs--good-paying jobs--and paying for health care.\n  They also rated serious problems when they were asked about the \nstrains and problems their families face. Problems paying for mortgage \nor rent: One out of five. Problems paying for food and credit card \ndebt: One out of five. Losing money in the stock market: About one out \nof six.\n  We have heard a lot said about the strain the record gas prices are \nplacing on families and our economy. Yet in the midst of all this, with \nthe knowledge of what it is doing to our economy, to families, to \nbusinesses, to farmers, big oil companies continue to rake in record \nprofits at the expense of the American economy.\n  I wish to take a few minutes to talk about another economic problem \nthat is hurting America's families and businesses: out-of-control \nhealth care costs. A recent essay in Newsweek magazine contained an \neye-opening title: ``The Myth of the Best in the World.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the \nCongressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Newsweek, Mar. 22, 2008]\n\nThe Myth of `Best In The World'--A Spate of New Research Shows the U.S. \n      Behind Other Countries in Cancer Survival and Diabetes Care\n\n                           (By Sharon Begley)\n\n       Not to be heartless or anything, but let's leave aside the \n     dead babies. In international comparisons of health care, the \n     infant mortality rate is a crucial indicator of a nation's \n     standing, and the United States' position at No. 28, with \n     seven per 1,000 live births worse than Portugal, Greece, the \n     Czech Republic, Northern Ireland and 23 other nations not \n     exactly known for cutting-edge medical science--is a tragedy \n     and an embarrassment. Much of the blame for this abysmal \n     showing, however, goes to socioeconomic factors: poor, \n     uninsured women failing to get prenatal care or engaging in \n     behaviors (smoking, using illegal drugs, becoming pregnant as \n     a teen) that put fetuses' and babies' lives at risk. You can \n     look at 28th place and say, yes, it's terrible, but it \n     doesn't apply to my part of the health-care system--the one \n     for the non-poor insured.\n       That, in a nutshell, is why support for health-care reform \n     is fragile and shallow. Yes, many people of goodwill support \n     extending coverage to the 47 million Americans who, according \n     to the Census Bureau, had no insurance for all or part of \n     2006. An awful lot of the insured, though, worry that messing \n     with the system to bring about universal coverage, even if it \n     allows more newborns to survive, might also hurt the quality \n     and availability of care that they themselves get (``If I \n     have trouble getting my doctor to see me now, what will \n     happen when 47 million more people want appointments?''). \n     This is where you start getting the requisite genuflection to \n     the United States' having ``the best health care in the \n     world.'' One problem: a spate of new research shows the \n     United States well behind other developed countries on \n     measures from cancer survival to diabetes care that cannot \n     entirely be blamed on the rich-poor or insured-uninsured \n     gulf. None of this implies a specific fix for the U.S. \n     health-care system. It does, however, say that ``the best in \n     the world'' is a myth that should not be an impediment to \n     reform.\n       How widespread is the ``best in the world'' view? In a \n     survey of 1,026 U.S. adults, the Harvard School of Public \n     Health and Harris Interactive reported last week, 55 percent \n     said they thought the United States has the best quality care \n     of any country. (Fewer called the U.S. system the best \n     overall, due to poor access and high costs.) ``Health-care \n     reform has failed before and will fail again if middle-income \n     people with insurance think it will make quality go down,'' \n     says Harvard's Robert Blendon.\n       One thing Americans love about their system is the \n     availability (for the insured) of high-tech equipment and the \n     latest procedures. But there is abundant evidence that these \n     are not necessarily beneficial. I remember breast-cancer \n     patients screaming bloody murder in the 1990s when they were \n     denied access to bone-marrow transplants. Sadly, once the \n     treatment was subjected to rigorous study, it was shown not \n     to extend life. But it made women who worked the system to \n     get it (some private insurers agreed to cover it) suffer even \n     more than they already were. In a centralized system such as \n     Medicare, science more than the market shapes what treatments \n     are available. ``Some of the things patients scream for,'' \n     says Blendon, ``aren't going to help them.'' Though they do \n     run up the U.S. medical bill. At $6,697 per capita in 2007, \n     it is the highest in the world (20 percent more than \n     Luxembourg's, the next highest) and more than twice the \n     average of the 30 wealthy countries in the Organization for \n     Economic Cooperation and Development.\n       If only it bought better care. Only 55 percent of U.S. \n     patients get treatments that scientific studies show to work, \n     such as beta blockers for heart disease, found a 2003 study \n     in The New England Journal of Medicine. One reason is that \n     when insurance is tied to employment, you may have to switch \n     doctors when you change jobs. In the past three\n\n[[Page S4127]]\n\n     years, says Karen Davis, president of the Commonwealth Fund, \n     32 percent of Americans have had to switch doctors. The \n     result is poor continuity of care--no one to coordinate \n     treatment or watch out for adverse drug interactions. Such \n     failures may contribute to the estimated 44,000 to 98,000 \n     annual deaths from medical mistakes just in hospitals, and to \n     ``amenable mortality''--deaths preventable by medical care. \n     Those total about 101,000 a year, reports a new study in the \n     journal Health Affairs. That per capita rate puts America \n     dead last of the study's 19 industrialized countries.\n       Other data, too, belie the ``best in the world'' mantra. \n     The five-year survival rate for cervical cancer? Worse than \n     in Italy, Ireland, Germany and others, finds the OECD. The \n     survival rate for breast cancer? You'd do better in \n     Switzerland, Norway, Britain and others. Asthma mortality? \n     Twice the rate of Germany's or Sweden's. Some of the U.S. \n     numbers are dragged down by the uninsured; they are twice as \n     likely to have advanced cancer when they first see a doctor \n     than are people with insurance, notes oncologist Elmer Huerta \n     of Washington Hospital Center, president of the American \n     Cancer Society. But the numbers of uninsured are too low to \n     fully explain the poor U.S. showing.\n       It isn't realistic to expect America to be the best in \n     every measure of medical quality. And none of this tells us \n     how to reform the U.S. system. But it does say the ``best in \n     the world'' is misguided medical chauvinism that should not \n     block attempts at reform.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. This column points out that the United States spent \nalmost $7,000 per person on medical care last year--$6,697 per capita. \nThat is the highest in the world. It is 20 percent more per person than \nthe next highest spending nation of Luxembourg, and it is more than \ntwice as much as the 30 wealthiest countries around the world.\n  In a survey of over 1,000 adults, the Harvard School of Public Health \nand Harris Interactive found that 55 percent thought the United States \nhad the best-quality care in the world.\n  The fact that we spend so much per person may lead people to that \nconclusion--that we have the best care. After all, we spend the most \nmoney. Yet the facts tell us otherwise. The highest cost doesn't mean \nthe highest quality. We rank below other nations in many critical \nhealth outcomes. There is no doubt in my mind if I were seriously ill \nin any part of the world, I would try to find my way to the United \nStates. There is no question we have the very best doctors, the very \nbest medical professionals, hospitals, and medical technology.\n  But when you take a step back and look at the outcomes for the \nAmerican people, it tells a different story. The 5-year survival rate \nfor cervical cancer in the United States--cervical cancer--is worse \nthan Italy, Ireland, Germany, and many others. The survival rate for \nbreast cancer in the United States is worse than the survivor rate in \nSwitzerland, Norway, Britain, and other nations. Our asthma mortality \nrate is twice the rate of Germany and Sweden. True, we have the best \nhospitals but not the best outcomes, in many instances.\n  Only 66 percent of U.S. patients receive treatments that scientific \nstudies show to work, such as beta blockers for heart disease, \naccording to the New England Journal of Medicine.\n  According to a 2007 survey by the Independent Commonwealth Fund, \nadults in the United States are more likely to forgo needed health care \nthan adults in Australia, Canada, Germany, Netherlands, New Zealand, \nand the United Kingdom. Nearly one out of five American adults surveyed \nsaid they have serious problems paying medical bills. That is more than \ndouble the rate in the next highest country. Nearly a third of those \nsurveyed had spent more than $1,000 out of pocket in the last year on \nmedical costs not covered by insurance. Only one out of five \nAustralians and one out of eight Canadians spent that much money on \nout-of-pocket health expenses. No other nation came even close.\n  Seven years ago, the World Health Organization made the first major \neffort to rank the health systems of 191 nations. The top two nations \nin the world: France and Italy. The United States did not even make the \ntop 10; not even the top 20. We ranked 37th in the world, according to \nthe World Health Organization, when it came to our health care systems. \nWe have this vanity in the United States that because we spend so much \nmoney on health care, we must be the best in the world. It is not true.\n  More people die each year from medical and surgical mistakes in the \nUnited States than in any other industrialized nation. Incidentally, \nmore Americans die of medical mistakes each year than die from AIDS, \nbreast cancer, and automobile accidents combined.\n  In health information technology, we lag far behind. By 2005, the \nUnited Kingdom had invested 450 times more per person in public funding \nof health information than the United States. We rank the highest in \ninfant mortality among 23 nations and near the bottom in healthy life \nexpectancy at age 60. We are 15th among 19 countries in deaths from a \nwide range of illnesses that would not have been fatal if treated \ntimely and in an effective way. We do well in reducing smoking, but we \nstill have the worst rates of obesity.\n  When you get beyond the myths and look at the studies, it becomes \nclear. The quality of a nation's health care is determined not by how \nmuch we spend but by whether we provide universal care that works. The \nUnited States is the only major industrialized nation without universal \nhealth coverage. We cannot give an assurance to every single American \nthat they will have a doctor at hand when they need one. We can't give \nthem the assurance that they can have basic access to needed health \ncare when they absolutely need it for their family. Other nations have \nmet that responsibility. We have not.\n  Ironically, the persistent and unfounded belief that Americans \nreceive the best health care is a major reason why we don't move toward \nchange and don't move toward providing the peace of mind which every \nAmerican and every American family deserves. The health care and \ninsurance companies spend millions of dollars to frighten Americans \ninto thinking that covering everyone with health insurance will somehow \nmean less coverage for others and less choice for Americans who already \nhave health insurance. That is a scare tactic. Look at all the other \ncountries in the world that have better health care at much lower cost. \nBy the way, when it comes to health care choice--especially choice of \ndoctors--a third of Americans with health insurance say they had to \nchange doctors in the last 3 years because their insurance company \ninsisted on it. One out of three Americans. So the idea that consumers \nare in charge of their own health care choices is belied by that \nstatistic.\n  There is no reason why we can't build a better health care system in \nAmerica that lowers costs, covers everybody, and makes us a healthier \nnation. One of the first steps is to get beyond the myths and the \nvanity and actually look at the facts.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I want to join others of my colleagues in \nhelping the nation of Israel celebrate its 60th anniversary.\n  The nation of Israel was founded, of course, on May 14, 1948. I think \nit is appropriate that we honor this ally of the United States and \nreaffirm the bonds of close friendship and cooperation between our two \ncountries. This alliance, this friendship, has never been more \nimportant to the mutual security and safety of our people than it is \ntoday. This friendship, of course, spans oceans and is based on shared \nvalues.\n  I was pleased when Congress recently reaffirmed our commitment to \npreserving and strengthening that alliance by passing a concurrent \nresolution honoring Israel and recognizing its important mission and \nits history.\n  In the face of common threats, our relationship with Israel today is \nas important as ever. We have mutual goals in defeating radical Islamic \nterrorism, fostering Middle East stability, and promoting freedom.\n  Israel has shown an unwavering conviction in democracy, justice, \nsecurity, and peace. The nation of Israel and its people deserve not \nonly our friendship and our support but our admiration as\n\n[[Page S4128]]\n\nwell. I extend my warmest congratulations to the State of Israel and \nthe Israeli people for this important anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/14/senate-section/article/S4128-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4128-S4130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SENATE INACTION\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want to turn to an important vote that \nwe had yesterday in the Senate. Unfortunately, yesterday morning, we \nsaw only 42 Senators voted to do anything significant about the high \nprice of gasoline at the pump. This is just the latest example, I am \nafraid, of congressional intransigence and turning a deaf ear to the \ncries of the American people for Congress to do something to help bring \nrelief at the gas pump. Unfortunately, it is just the latest example.\n  I know most of us came to Washington to serve in the Congress to try \nto solve problems. Unfortunately, the mentality inside the beltway \nseems to be that we ought to spend more time shooting at each other on \na partisan political basis and not working together to solve problems. \nUnfortunately, there are more examples than just high gas prices to \ndemonstrate this mentality.\n  I will just point to four areas where we have seen significant delays \nin congressional action that have had tremendous consequences on the \nAmerican people. First and foremost is on our national security. It was \n89 days ago that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act basically \nexpired. The most recent authorization would have allowed us to \ncontinue to listen in to foreign terrorists communicating with each \nother on the telephone in a way that would allow us to detect and deter \nterrorist activity and defeat terrorist activity.\n  Why the House of Representatives and Speaker Pelosi would refuse to \nallow this important piece of legislation to come to the floor after it \npassed the Senate on a strong bipartisan vote is, frankly, beyond me. \nBut it has been 89 days now since we have had the ability to detect new \nterrorist threats, when the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \nbasically went dark and expired.\n  Secondly, it has been 540 days since we have failed to act on the \nColombia Free Trade Agreement. Free-trade agreements should not be \npartisan affairs. It is good, in fact, for us to have free-trade \nagreements because it opens markets to American farmers and American \nmanufacturers and producers for their goods in other countries. In \nfact, Colombia does about $2.3 billion in trade with the State of Texas \neach year, which is very important to my State. Unfortunately, when \nTexas sells goods and produce to Colombia, they carry large tariffs, \nwhich disadvantages my manufacturers, my producers, and my farmers in \nTexas, while Colombian goods that are sold in the United States, \nbecause of other agreements, basically come in duty free.\n  Why Speaker Pelosi would fail to allow this important free-trade \nagreement to be taken up and voted on in the House of Representatives, \nagain, escapes me. This is in the best interest of the United States. \nIt is in the best interest of my State and the people who work there. \nAt a time when we are dealing with stimulus packages because we are \nconcerned about the softening of our economy, what better stimulus \ncould we enact than to pass this free-trade agreement, which would \nstrengthen the robust markets in Colombia for American goods and \nproduce? But here we are 540 days later, and it is bogged down in \npartisan disagreements.\n  The next number is another important number. I think one of the most \nimportant jobs the Senate has is to take up and consider the \nnominations of individuals who have been proposed for service on the \nFederal bench and to serve in that important branch of Government. But \nwe have seen that because of inaction in the Judiciary Committee, on \nsome nominees such as Peter Keisler--nominated more than 685 days ago--\nand we have seen nominees out of North Carolina pass the 300-day mark \nwithout even so much as a hearing in the Judiciary Committee.\n  This is another example of partisan delays that, frankly, I think \nfrustrates the American people. It certainly frustrates me. It is an \nexample of where we ought to act and find an opportunity to come \ntogether to solve a problem, and the problem is particularly in the \nFourth Circuit Court of Appeals, where many litigants simply cannot \nfind access to the courts because there are not enough judges sitting \non those benches to listen to cases. Whether you are a crime victim or \na small business man or woman or whether you are just a regular citizen \nin that Fourth District, we have a judicial emergency with about one-\nthird of the seats vacant. Frankly, that creates a lack of access to \njustice. So, again, it has been 685 days without a vote on some of the \nnominees in the Judiciary Committee. We need to do better.\n  Of course, it was 751 days ago when Speaker Pelosi,--then running for \nelection, and before the 2006 election, where Democrats were given the \nmajority status in both the House and Senate, said: Elect us and we \nwill produce a commonsense plan to help bring down the price of \ngasoline at the pump. Unfortunately, the price of gasoline at about the \ntime that she took office as Speaker of the House was about $2.33 a \ngallon, I believe. And now, of course, it is about $3.75 a gallon.\n  Yesterday, as I mentioned, we had an opportunity to help provide \nrelief for American families, to help them deal with their family \nbudgets when it comes to the cost of gasoline. But I think we took a \nhalf step that did not do very much. What I mean by that is we did vote \nto quit filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but if you look at how \nmuch oil that represents that would then be available in the open \nmarket, it is roughly 70,000 barrels of oil a day. Now, 70,000 barrels \nof oil a day sounds like a lot of oil, unless you consider the amount \nof oil consumed globally by all the countries on the planet. That is 85 \nmillion barrels of oil a day. How much of an impact do you think it \nwill have on gasoline at the pump to provide an additional 70,000 \nbarrels of oil, when worldwide consumption is 85 million? You don't \nhave to be a Ph.D. in mathematics to figure that out. It will not be \nbig. As a matter of fact, it will be minuscule--not completely \ninsignificant but not very much.\n  On the other hand, we had an opportunity to vote to reduce our \ndependence upon imported oil and gas from dangerous enemies of the \nUnited States, countries such as Iran and Venezuela, both of whom are \nmembers of OPEC, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate turned down that opportunity to produce as \nmuch as 3 million barrels of oil a day from the U.S. reserve because we \nwould not allow or authorize Alaskans to produce oil in Alaska. We \nwould not authorize the States along the Outer Continental Shelf to be \nable to develop their oil reserves in the Outer Continental Shelf, and \nwe would not allow States in the West to develop the oil shale that \ncould produce massive amounts of oil right here in America, reducing \nour dependency on imported oil from dangerous countries such as Iran \nand Venezuela.\n  What I don't understand is, if our friends across the Senate--and I \nbelieve there was only one vote against the decision to stop putting \noil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. But if everybody in the Senate \nvirtually agrees that adding 70,000 barrels of oil to the worldwide \nsupply of oil would help bring down the price of gas at the pump--\nhowever minuscule that figure may be--how much more would it be likely \nto bring down the price of gas at the pump to add 3 million additional \nbarrels to worldwide supply? Of course, this would not be from Saudi \nArabia or Iran or Venezuela. It would be from the good old USA.\n  Again, how many new jobs would that create at home, when our economy \nhas turned soft? It would create a lot of jobs in Texas. I know it \nwould create jobs in Louisiana and, frankly, all over the country.\n  Instead of taking an opportunity to take a bold move on a bipartisan \nbasis to increase the supply of American oil and gas, we find ourselves \nwith half steps and relatively insignificant votes to increase \nproduction. I am glad that, finally, the Congress has recognized that \nthe laws of supply and demand are not inapplicable in the District of \nColumbia. As a matter of fact, for a long time, it seemed that we \noutright refused to recognize the economic laws that apply across the \nplanet right here in Washington, DC.\n  So I ask my friends and colleagues, if you are unwilling to allow us \nto open\n\n[[Page S4129]]\n\nAmerican oil reserves when the price of gasoline is $3.75 a gallon and \nthe price of a barrel of oil is $125, will you allow us to do it when \ngasoline hits $4 a gallon? How about when it hits $4.50 a gallon or $5 \na gallon or $10 a gallon? How about when the price of oil hits $150 a \nbarrel or $200 or $250?\n  We know because of the geopolitical situation with countries such as \nIran, which are no friend to the United States and are major oil \nproducers and are part of OPEC, that causes speculation on the spot \nmarket to push the price of oil higher. I believe it would have a \ndramatic impact on those prices and, ultimately, because oil represents \n70 percent of the price of a gallon of gasoline, I believe it would \nultimately bring down the price of gasoline and provide some much \nneeded relief to the average American family.\n  Congress's failure to act on a strong bipartisan basis to do it is, \nfrankly, inexplicable to me, just as it is inexplicable to me why we \nwould not allow our intelligence officials to listen to the \nconversations of new targets of foreign terror surveillance, and why we \nwould continue to let American businesses and farmers be disadvantaged \nby tariffs on goods and produce sold to the nation of Colombia, and why \nwe would wait more than 685 days to consider the nominations of \njudicial nominees and allow crime victims and small businesses and \nothers to go without their day in court.\n  Just for the same reasons those delays are inexplicable, why are we \nstill waiting 751 days after Speaker Pelosi made the statement that she \nwould produce a commonsense plan to bring down the price at the pump?\n  It is inexplicable to me why we have to wait with no real solutions \nin sight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask that I be notified when I have \nconsumed 6 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair will so advise.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I also rise on the Senate floor today to \ntalk about the crisis we face in terms of gasoline and energy prices \nand the need for us to act in terms of this true crisis that affects \nevery Louisiana family I represent and every American family this body \nrepresents.\n  When this new Congress, led by Democratic leadership, took office, \nenergy prices, gasoline prices were supposed to be a top priority. At \nthe time, the price at the pump was $2.31. Yet today it has risen to \n$3.76 a gallon. That is a 61-percent increase.\n  If this was such a priority at $2.31, if we have had this dramatic \nincrease, the fastest, the most dramatic, the most onerous on the \nconsumer in history, why isn't this leading to action? The simple \nreality is that it is not.\n  This Congress has been tangled in inaction, unable to take \nsignificant action on this issue, and that has to end for the good of \nthe American people.\n  As my colleague from Texas reiterated, this is not overly \ncomplicated. Price is set by the equation of where supply meets demand. \nThat is economics 101. That is the first lesson of economics. So we \nneed to do everything we can to reduce demand, mitigate worldwide \ndemand, which is clearly increasing, particularly from rapidly growing \ncountries such as China and India, and we can do that through \nconservation, fuel efficiency, and new sources of energy. But we also \nneed to increase supply. We need to do both at once because our energy \npicture is so challenging and so dire.\n  So I rise to join my colleagues who are saying we need to act, we \nneed to break out of this gridlock, we need to act on energy prices \nwhich affect all American families.\n  Unfortunately, we had that opportunity in the last several weeks and, \nonce again, the Senate passed on the opportunity, shut down the \nopportunity to take real action.\n  Again, this is an enormous challenge, and we need to do everything we \ncan, both on the demand side--and I support those measures: increased \nenergy efficiency, increased levels of conservation, development of new \ntechnology and new energy sources. We have done a little bit of that, \nbut we need to do more. But we also need to act on the supply side, \nincreasing our supply of energy, particularly our domestic supply which \nincreases our energy independence, lessens our dependence on unfriendly \nforeign nations.\n  Several weeks ago, we were on an FAA bill, and I had an amendment at \nthe desk that would constitute real, meaningful action. It was very \nsimple. It would have established a trigger at the price of $126 per \nbarrel of oil. When the price reached that mark--and we are, \nunfortunately, perilously close already--then the trigger would have \nbeen pulled, and we would have been able to explore and produce off \nAmerica's Outer Continental Shelf, where we have vast resources of \nenergy. But we would only do that with two significant caveats, with \ntwo significant demands.\n  The first is that the host State involved, wherever we were proposing \ndrilling, would have to want that activity. The Governor and the State \nlegislature would both have to affirm that they wanted to produce off \ntheir coast. It is very important, very fair, respecting State \nsovereignty and States rights.\n  Secondly, my amendment would have built on provisions we passed \nseveral years ago to give those host States significant royalty sharing \nso anything produced off their coast, 37.5 percent of that royalty \nwould go to the State for the State to use on its top priorities, \nwhether they be highways or higher education or, in the case of \nLouisiana, coastal restoration, hurricane protection, hurricane \nevacuation routes. That was a very sound, sensible policy we set a \ncouple years ago as we opened new areas of the gulf.\n  My amendment, which I had at the desk for the FAA reauthorization \nbill, would have expanded on that good policy initiative. \nUnfortunately, we couldn't have a full debate on that amendment. We \ncouldn't have any vote on that amendment because the Democratic \nmajority leader filled the amendment tree, took up all opportunity for \namendment for himself and blocked all other amendments from coming to \nthe floor.\n  That is unfortunate on any issue. It is particularly unfortunate, \nagain, on the top concern of the American people, when prices at the \npump are sky-high and continuing to rise, when they have risen from \n$2.31 a gallon at the beginning of this Democratic Congress to $3.76 a \ngallon today--a dramatic, onerous, 61-percent increase.\n  Yesterday, we had another opportunity to break through the gridlock \nand act, and it was by adopting the McConnell-Domenici amendment. That \namendment proposed a number of measures, including something very \nsimilar to my Vitter amendment regarding the Outer Continental Shelf.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator has used \n6 minutes.\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank the Chair. That McConnell-Domenici amendment \nincluded a number of measures, something very similar to my proposal \nwith regard to the Outer Continental Shelf. It would have dramatically \nexpanded our domestic supply. It would have done something real, \nconcrete and meaningful and have a significant impact over time on the \nprice at the pump.\n  Yet again, the Senate refused to act, refused to move forward with \nthat significant proposal that would do major things on the supply side \nand would couple it with other actions we are taking and further \nactions we need to take on the demand side.\n  Instead, we did something extremely modest. We said: For now, we are \nnot going to continue to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. I \nsupported that move. It is true that will free up 70,000 barrels of oil \nto put into the open market versus pumping into the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve, but that is very modest. That is hardly going to make a dent \non the price at the pump.\n  In contrast, all the provisions of the McConnell-Domenici amendment, \nall that extra supply domestically would have meant 3 million barrels \nin contrast to 70,000. Yet again, the Democratic leadership and the \nSenate overall refused to act, refused to address this issue, the most \nserious that Americans are facing today, the one that hits their \npocketbook over and over, causing them real concern about their family \nbudget and how they are going to make it.\n  I urge the Senate to get out of this do-nothing attitude. I urge the \nSenate\n\n[[Page S4130]]\n\nto act on this crucial issue for all American families.\n  Again, this is not brain surgery. This is economics 101, supply and \ndemand. It is not either/or. We need to do everything we can to lessen \ndemand, and I support those measures to increase efficiency, to \nincrease efforts at conservation, to increase new technology efforts \nthat will lead us to new fuel sources. That is absolutely necessary. \nBut it needs to be coupled with action to increase supply, particularly \ndomestic supply, by tapping those vital reserves, particularly on our \nOuter Continental Shelf.\n  I join the Senator in Texas in asking, if we are not going to do it \nnow at $3.76 a gallon, when are we going to act? Are we going to wait \nfor $4? Are we going to wait for $5? We need to act now. This is a \nserious issue for all Americans. This hits the pocketbook of every \nAmerican family. We need to act now. We need to act not with political \ndemagoguery, not with pure rhetoric. We need to act with measures that \nhave an impact, both on the demand side and the supply side. I hope the \nSenate and the Congress move to do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/14/senate-section/article/S4130-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ISRAEL'S 60TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I wish to also speak on Israel's 60th \nanniversary. It is a very important date for a truly remarkable country \nand a remarkable people who, in a mere six decades of existence, have \nbuilt a vibrant, successful, modern democracy out of almost nothing.\n  When I was still a student, I had the opportunity to visit Israel \nwith my sister. She had a college friend who had moved to Israel after \ngraduation. Even back then--I was very young--I couldn't help be \nimpressed by the determination and perseverance of all the people I met \nand their effort to build a vibrant, democratic state, to create a \nsafe, secure homeland for all Jews, no matter where they may have \noriginally been from around the world.\n  I had a second opportunity to visit Israel as a Member of Congress \nmany years later. It was a very different sort of trip, very different \nitinerary, a very different set of meetings than when I was a student. \nBut I left with the same strong feelings of respect and admiration for \nall the people of Israel, the same recognition of their determination \nand unflagging faith in their nation and countrymen. Their belief in \nthe importance of their mission had not faded at all in the years \nbetween my visits.\n  What makes today especially notable is it is the 60th anniversary of \nthe founding of the State of Israel. There is wonderful hope in this \ncelebration of the 60th anniversary, and there is also sober \nappreciation of the challenges that remain.\n  On the hopeful side, on the impressive side, is that in a mere 60 \nyears, as I have said, Israel has created a nation characterized by \nstrong democratic principles, a compassionate and determined people, \ninnovative industry, especially in technology, medicine, and science, a \ncompetitive global economy.\n  In a mere six decades, Israel has built all that tremendous \ninnovation, tremendous economic prosperity and progress virtually out \nof nothing, virtually out of the sands of the desert. It has become a \nbeacon of freedom and democracy in a region that has very few examples \nto speak to. Israel is the only fully developed democracy in that \nsense. It represents to all peoples what can be achieved when people \ncome together in a common cause, set aside differences, work together \nin a very determined way to make life better for them and their \nchildren. I recognize this important anniversary.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/14/senate-section/article/S4130-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see my friend and colleague, Senator \nEnzi. I will now make a comment about the pending legislation. I \nthought we did have some good discussion and debate on yesterday. A \nnumber of important issues were raised. I will try this morning at \nleast to respond to some of those matters to clear up what I think are \nsome questions we had. Obviously, we are interested in moving this \nprocess forward, considering amendments, and getting to the Senate's \nbusiness.\n  Once again, I will mention two organizations that support our Public \nSafety Employee Cooperation Act: the International Association of \nFirefighters and the Union of Police Associations. We pointed out this \nweek is set aside in our Nation, and has been set aside since 1962, to \ngive special honor to our men and women in the police organizations who \nhave lost their lives in the line of duty. It is a very special, solemn \nceremony in which they participate. We are mindful of their service \nevery day but especially this week. We are grateful for their strong \nsupport for this legislation. They have studied it, analyzed it, looked \ninto it, and support it.\n  The National Association of Police Organizations and a great many \nother organizations have supported this legislation--our first \nresponders. These are the organizations that speak for firefighters, \nspeak for police officers, speak for the first responders.\n  Yesterday we had a good debate about the bill. I think we are off to \na good start. I would like to take some time today to set the record \nstraight as to what the bill does do and what the bill does not do. \nFundamentally, this bill is about choice, who should make the choice \nwhether public safety workers get a union--the Federal Government, \nState government, or the workers themselves.\n  Right now we have a system where the Government makes the choice--26 \nStates give workers the ability to form a union if they want one; 24 \nStates deny workers that option. These 24 State governments think they \nknow better than the workers themselves what is best.\n  I disagree. Our public safety officers are on the front lines every \nday fighting fires, stopping crimes, saving lives. They know best how \nto protect the public. They know best how to keep safe on the job. They \nknow best whether they need a union to represent their interests.\n  The Cooperation Act gives this choice to the workers. It says the \nStates have to provide a path that workers can use if they decide they \nwant a union. If the workers do not want a union, fine, they do not \nhave to walk down that path. But the State has to make it available and \nlet the workers choose, just as it is with the right to vote. \nIndividuals do not have to vote, but they have the right to vote. This \nis the State making that judgment. We recognize that as a fundamental \nright there and here.\n  Under current law, States make the judgment decision. With the \nAlexander amendment it will allow the States to make the judgment and \ndecision. Under the Corker amendment, that is it. Under our Cooperation \nAct it is the workers themselves who make the judgment--do they want \nit, don't they want it--and we abide by the outcome. That is a basic, \nfundamental difference.\n  It is not going to be hard for the States to build this path. All \nthey have to do is provide for four core rights: No. 1, the right to \nform and join a union; No. 2, the right to sit down and\n\n[[Page S4131]]\n\ntalk at the table; No. 3, the right to sign a contract if both parties \nagree; and, No. 4, the right to go to a neutral third party when they \nhave disputes.\n  They can make the judgment whether they want arbitration, whether \nthey want mediation, whether they want fact finding. There are no \nrequirements. They can make those judgments; they can make those \ndecisions. They make the judgments.\n  Apart from these four things, all other details of the collective \nbargaining system are left up to the States. States have the \nflexibility to decide whether to exempt small communities. They decide \nhow workers can select a union--through card check, elections, or both. \nDo we understand? The States make those judgments and decisions.\n  States can decide how workers and employers should resolve disputes--\nthrough arbitration, mediation, fact finding, or some other mechanism. \nIf a State decides not to pass a law providing a framework for \nbargaining, or if the State law does not provide for the four core \nrights, the Federal labor relations authority will step in to ensure \nthat workers have these rights. But that is only if the State refuses \nto act.\n  We heard a good deal of discussion about the role of this authority \nand how we do not understand what this is all about and how this is \ngoing to change federalism. It is very simple what this legislation \ndoes do and what it does not permit. Our first responders sacrifice so \nmuch for us each day, the least we owe them is the ability to choose \nfor themselves whether they want a union. We owe them at least that \nmuch dignity and respect, and that is what the Cooperation Act \nprovides.\n  I hope this explanation will ease the minds of many of my colleagues. \nI think there have been a lot of misconceptions about this bill \nfloating around. I hope this explanation can alleviate some of those \nconcerns. We heard a lot of talk yesterday about this bill imposing \nWashington's will on the States. Of course that is not true. I happen \nto think that unions are good for workers, but nothing in this bill \nimposes my opinion or the opinion of my colleagues on public safety \nofficers. Under this bill, Congress does not make the decision whether \npublic safety officers have a union. Instead, firefighters, police \nofficers, have the choice. That is where the decision will be made.\n  Several amendments were filed yesterday that would give the State and \nlocal governments, the employers, the opportunity to opt out of the \nrequirements of this bill. But these opt-out provisions actually block \nthe rights of the first responders. They would allow the State and \nlocal governments to cut off public safety officers' rights. We should \nlet police and firefighters decide whether they want to exercise their \nrights to have a union. That is what this bill would do.\n  Senator Alexander and Senator Enzi said people in their States are \nhappy without unions. If that is true, then it is likely nothing will \nchange. If those public safety officers believe their voices are being \nheard and their concerns are being addressed, then they will choose not \nto form unions. Nothing in this bill forces them to make a different \nchoice.\n  Senator Alexander and Senator Enzi should put their assertions to the \ntest and pass this legislation. If they are right, nothing will change. \nBut if they are wrong, public safety officers in Tennessee and Wyoming \nwill vote for unions and get a voice in the workplace.\n  We also heard that Washington was imposing a one-size-fits-all \nfederal system on the States. This is another misconception. At every \nturn in drafting this legislation, Senator Gregg and I went out of our \nway to give States the flexibility to adopt a collective bargaining law \nthat works for them. Under this bill, Congress will not tell Tennessee \nor Wyoming or any other State how to implement the law. States can \nchoose how to comply.\n  As I mentioned, States only have to provide the most basic rights. \nOther than those basic rights, States have the flexibility to adopt the \nsystem that works best for them.\n  I would note that several of the amendments filed yesterday would \ntake these basic choices away from the States and mandate a Federal \nrule on issues such as right to work or card check. That is not what \nthis bill should be about. The flexibility for States is important as \nlong as the core rights are there.\n  States also have the flexibility to completely control costs under \nthis bill. This control means there is no risk of unfunded mandates. My \ncolleagues across the aisle love to talk about charges of unfunded \nmandates, but it simply does not fit.\n  This bill comes with no--I repeat no--price tag. Nothing in this bill \ntells the State and local governments to spend any money. Nothing says \nthey have to raise wages. Nothing says they have to improve benefits or \nshift money from local priorities into public safety. Governments are \nfree to write their own contracts. At the bargaining table, State and \nlocal governments are free to offer bargaining proposals that are \nconsistent with their local fiscal needs. They cannot be forced to \nagree to any terms they do not want or cannot afford.\n\n  In addition to being able to protect their interests at the \nbargaining table, State and local governments can also safeguard their \nfinancial interests through the legislative process. The bill \nexplicitly allows State and local legislative bodies to retain the \nright to approve or disapprove funding for a contract by requiring an \nagreement be presented to a legislative body as part of the process for \napproving such contract or memorandum of understanding.\n  That simply means elected Representatives have the final say on \nspending. Do we understand that? The bill explicitly allows the State \nand local legislative bodies to retain the right to approve or \ndisapprove funding for a contract by requiring an agreement ``be \npresented to a legislative body as part of the process for approving \nsuch contract or memoranda of understanding.'' Elected Representatives \nhave the final say on spending.\n  Remember also that under this bill, public safety officers have no \nright to strike and no requirement of binding arbitration. That means \nno one can force a contract on a State and local government under this \nbill.\n  The other side's additional argument that there will be costs \nassociated with just implementing any new State law is a red herring. \nThe costs will be minimal. All State and local governments already have \nhuman resource departments in place. In addition, collective bargaining \noften creates new efficiencies that actually save money. In Miami, FL, \nthe local firefighter union worked with the community to reconfigure \nEMS services and ended up saving taxpayers a great deal of money.\n  On top of all these safeguards for State and local governments, we \nhave adopted an additional safeguard for the States' smallest \ncommunities. In addition to the protections I have just outlined, the \nbill allows State governments to exempt these smaller communities if \nthey want. If a town has fewer than 5,000 residents or employs fewer \nthan 25 workers, the State can say: Our law does not apply to you.\n  You can see this bill is a reasonable way to extend the choice of \nwhether to have a union for our Nation's public safety officers. We \nhave taken extensive steps to protect State and local flexibility to \nensure they will not be burdened by these procedures.\n  A final argument that we have heard about States rights yesterday was \nthat this bill violates States rights under the Constitution. This \nargument is simply false. The bill has been carefully crafted to comply \nwith the current Supreme Court cases on the ability of Congress to \nregulate State governments. Throughout our history, our Federal \nGovernment has set core labor standards, such as minimum wage and \novertime rules, that apply also to State workers. Do we understand \nthat? Minimum wage, overtime apply to State workers. They apply to them \nin Massachusetts. They apply in Tennessee.\n  Bargaining rights are no different. I do not think anyone in this \nChamber would argue that the State government should not have to comply \nwith the basic standards prohibiting them from discriminating against \nworkers based on race or gender. The same is true for collective \nbargaining rights. Bargaining rights are civil rights too.\n  Moreover, there is a strong Federal interest in the performance of \nState and local first responders. We have an\n\n[[Page S4132]]\n\nincreasingly Federal approach to national security. We have created a \nDepartment of Homeland Security and appropriated $40 billion for that--\n$40 billion, for homeland security.\n  The last time I looked at the map, all the States fell within that \ncriterion, in terms of being protected. In our post-\n9/11 world, this national response to terrorism increasingly depends on \ncoordination with State and local public safety officers. It is more \nappropriate than ever for the Federal Government to ensure that public \nsafety officers are working as efficiently and as effectively as \npossible. By encouraging strong partnerships between public safety \nofficers and the cities and States they serve, this bill advances the \nGovernment's interests in improving homeland security.\n  Finally, my colleagues have tried to scare even those States that \nhave good, solid collective bargaining laws into believing that their \nlaws are on the line. In truth, more than half of the States in the \ncountry will not be affected by this bill.\n  As I described a minute ago, the bill does not require that State \nlaws have specific provisions, only that they provide the basic \nprotections I outlined. The Federal Labor Relations Authority, which \nwill make those determinations, is not some secret society. It is a \nlongstanding Federal agency staffed by dedicated career servants and \nPresidential appointees who are confirmed by the Senate--not greatly \ndifferent from the National Labor Relations Board, for example.\n  In summary, you can see that this bill is not the aggressive \nintrusion into State government that was portrayed yesterday.\n  In addition, I wish to address some of the other individual concerns \nraised about the bill that are misleading and misplaced.\n  First, this bill will not encourage strikes. In fact, this bill \nprovides additional safeguards to prevent strikes. It specifically says \nthat a public safety officer may not engage in a strike, work slowdown, \nor any action that will measurably disrupt the delivery of emergency \nservices. There is no room for interpretation. That is an ironclad ban \non any action that will impair public safety. This language \nspecifically says that a public safety officer may not engage in a \nstrike, work slowdown, or any other action that will measurably disrupt \nthe delivery of emergency services. More importantly, it creates a \nmechanism for public safety officers and their employers to communicate \nand build strong bipartisanship that enhances cooperation, decreasing \nthe likelihood of strikes.\n  It is an insult--it is an insult to public safety officers to suggest \nthat they will strike. It has been decades since there has been a \npolice or firefighters strike in this country. Police and firefighters \nin most States already have the right to bargain, and there has been no \nproblem with strikes. These brave men and women take their duty to \nserve the public very seriously, so seriously they are willing to die \nfor it. The suggestion that they would shirk their duty in order to \nargue over a contract dishonors them and dishonors their sacrifices.\n  Next, I wish to underscore that this bill will not harm communities \nthat rely on volunteer firefighters. This legislation expressly applies \nonly to employees, which means volunteers are excluded. Any suggestion \nthat cities and towns are going to be forced to bargain with and \npossibly pay their volunteer firefighters is wrong. What is more, we \nincluded language supported by the National Volunteer Firefighter \nCouncil to ensure that professional firefighters can continue to \nvolunteer in their off-duty hours. This language outlaws contract \nprovisions that would prohibit an employee from engaging in part-time \nemployment or volunteer activities during off-duty hours. That includes \npart-time or volunteer firefighting. Senator Enzi says that is not \nclear, but it seems pretty clear to me.\n  My colleagues across the aisle also attacked this bill yesterday as \nhypocritical because it is inconsistent with how our Federal Government \ntreats its own workers. Again, this criticism is untrue and misleading. \nFederal workers have bargaining rights. They also have a say in their \nwages. The law allows them to petition the Government each year.\n  Federal law enforcement offices are an example of how well collective \nbargaining rights and public safety go together. Whether Congress \nshould give Federal public safety officers the right to directly \nbargain over wages is an issue for another day. We do not need to \nresolve that question in order to do the right thing for the State and \nlocal offices.\n  We also heard complaints about the process that brought us to this \npoint. Listening to the debate, you might think this bill was a new \nidea never explored or never debated. That again is simply false. This \nbill has been around for a long time. It was introduced in 1999, almost \n10 years ago, by Senator DeWine, and then by Senator Gregg. It has also \nhad strong bipartisan support.\n  My colleagues across the aisle would have us go through more hearings \nand debate before we act. We do not need more hearings. We have already \nhad a hearing in the HELP Committee. In fact, we have marked this bill \nup twice, once in 2001 and once in 2003. We even voted on this bill \nbefore in 2001. Our Nation's first responders have waited long enough \nfor the basic rights in this bill. We should not make them wait any \nlonger. They do not make us wait when we need them. We should not have \nthem wait any longer.\n  I yield the floor\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, we did have a brief time yesterday to begin \nexploring the multiple flaws and deception in this legislation. I \nbelieve it would be useful today to begin by touching on a few of those \nflaws.\n  I have taken the suggestion of my colleague and friend from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy, and looked very carefully at the Record \nof yesterday's proceedings, and here are a few things worth noting.\n  In response to my remarks and those of Senator Alexander, we were \nrepeatedly told yesterday that it was perfectly all right to federalize \nthe programs of State and local labor relations of States like mine and \nSenator Alexander's and at least 20 others to, in effect, tell those \nStates that the Democratic decisions of their sovereign governments and \ntheir citizens simply did not count, that the Federal Government knows \nbest, that the Federal Government will tell those States what their law \nmust be and how they must conduct their labor relations with their own \nemployees. In essence, the citizens and legislators of a near majority \nof States are being told by the proponents of this bill that they know \nbetter what will work for those States.\n  As Senator Alexander put it so well yesterday, this bill is really \nabout States like Massachusetts or New Jersey telling States like mine \nor his, and at least 20 others, how best to deal with their employees \nand how to fashion their own State laws in the total absence of any \nneed to do so. Now, I completely reject that. However, for those who \nsupport it, they owe it to themselves to at least be consistent in \ntheir approach. They are not. While they would deny a near majority of \nStates the right to determine what they believe to be the best approach \nto public sector labor relations within their States, they staunchly \ndefend the right of a small minority of States to deny public employees \nthe most fundamental democratic rights in the workplace.\n  Five States--New York, New Jersey, Illinois, New Hampshire, and \nMassachusetts--all home to the sponsors of this bill, have card check \nlaws for their public workers. Those States have decided this is the \nway they intend to conduct the labor relations among their employees. I \nrespectfully disagree. I believe that approach to be antidemocratic, \nand it is certainly contrary to the Federal labor policy which \npreserves for workers in the private sector the right to a democratic \nsecret ballot in deciding the question of unionization.\n  However, we are told by the proponents of this bill that this \nfundamental workplace issue is a matter of State choice, while at the \nsame time being told that any State's choice to elect a different \nsystem of labor law than that imposed by H.R. 980 is not. Denying \nworkers a secret ballot election on unionization is somehow a matter of \nlocal choice, but deciding to utilize and meet and confer on a system \nof labor management relations or to decide the issue by local option is \nnot.\n\n[[Page S4133]]\n\nThe inconsistency and hypocrisy of that position is nothing short of \nstunning. It is utterly indefensible.\n  At least that issue is addressed by Senator Hatch's amendments. That \namendment will at least end that hypocrisy by expressly overturning \nantidemocratic card check laws for public sector employees in New York, \nNew Jersey, New Hampshire, Illinois, and Massachusetts. While we should \nnot impose Federal law on States at all, if we ought to do it, we ought \nto do it consistently.\n  Now, lastly, I want to note that yesterday my colleague and great \nfriend from Massachusetts indicated that if the bill were half as bad--\nhe reiterated it again today--half as bad as I had indicated in my \nremarks, he would be against it as well. I take my friend at his word \nbut do not ask that he take me at mine.\n  Late yesterday, the leaders received a letter from Michael Bloomberg, \nthe mayor of New York, regarding H.R. 980.\n  I wish to remind everyone that New York has a full collective \nbargaining statute covering public safety officers. I also wish to \nremind everyone that we are told by all of the proponents of this bill \nthat because of this, New York would not be affected by this law.\n  Here is what Mayor Bloomberg had to say in his letter to Leaders Reid \nand McConnell:\n\n       I am writing to express my serious concerns about \n     legislation before the Senate which would alter the current \n     state of collective bargaining between the City of New York \n     and a number of its unions. The legislation has the potential \n     to harm both New York City and New York State labor \n     relations.\n       As you are aware, the Public Safety Employer-Employee \n     Cooperation Act of 2007 is a bill that would significantly \n     expand the jurisdiction of the Federal Labor Relations \n     Authority, FLRA, into the labor relations between State and \n     local governments and their public safety officers.\n       Though the bill may be well intentioned, its fundamental \n     problem from the point of view of New York is that it does \n     not clearly distinguish States like New York that have long \n     provided collective bargaining rights to their employees from \n     States that have not.\n       Under the bill, States with long histories of collective \n     bargaining face the risk of having their labor relations with \n     public safety officers Federalized to the detriment of long-\n     established public policies.\n       For over 40 years, the New York City Collective Bargaining \n     Law and the New York State Public Employees Fair Employment \n     Act, also referred to as the Taylor Act, have provided a \n     legal framework for public sector collective bargaining in \n     the City of New York. There has been extensive administrative \n     and judicial review of virtually every aspect of this legal \n     framework. The bill has the potential to undermine this long-\n     established framework.\n       One problem is the bill's treatment of the ability of \n     public safety employees to strike. The New York State Taylor \n     Law currently contains a clear and unequivocal prohibition on \n     all strikes by public sector employees and explicit \n     penalties, such as substantial fines against the individual \n     members for violations of the no-strike provision.\n       The language in the proposed language before the Senate is \n     less clear. The City is very concerned that section 6 of this \n     bill can be read to prohibit only a strike that would \n     measurably disrupt the delivery of emergency services.\n       This language, while it may not be intended to limit the \n     prohibition in this way, is an invitation to \n     misinterpretation and litigation. In addition, the same \n     section could encourage employees to refuse to carry out \n     services that many believe are not required under the \n     mandatory terms and conditions of employment in situations \n     where the public safety might be immediately affected by such \n     a refusal.\n\n  The mayor of New York goes on to say:\n\n       Another serious problem with the bill is that it gives FLRA \n     the authority to decide what must be collectively bargained. \n     New York has longstanding legal precedent regarding what are \n     mandatory, permissive and prohibited subjects for collective \n     bargaining. Under section 4 of the bill, such long-\n     established legal precedent could be overturned by the FLRA.\n       A notable example is that disciplinary procedures for \n     police officers and firefighters, including due process, are \n     provided for in the New York City Charter and administrative \n     code and are prohibited subjects of bargaining. The New York \n     Court of Appeals confirmed as recently as 2006 that these \n     procedures may not be subject to bargaining, but the bill \n     would give the FLRA the authority to decide otherwise.\n\n  I think that is a point we made yesterday.\n\n       A decision by the police commissioner, for example, as to \n     whether or not discipline should be brought against a police \n     officer involved in a shooting incident is something for \n     which he remains fully accountable to the public. It is of \n     grave concern to the City that it could be forced to bargain \n     over such procedures as a result of an improper finding by \n     the FLRA, and such public accountability would thereby be \n     lost.\n       Even if the FLRA does not interfere with precedent that \n     restricts bargaining in sensitive areas like discipline, the \n     bill at a minimum would provide an additional means for such \n     precedent to be challenged repeatedly in Federal court, \n     resulting in an extended period of uncertainty.\n       In the final analysis, the bill could significantly affect \n     the ability of the City of New York to ensure the safety of \n     the public in the integrity of essential government services, \n     and is likely, at a minimum, to involve the city in costly \n     and disruptive litigation in Federal court.\n       Any remedy of these concerns should be achieved in \n     statutory language, not merely in legislative history. Given \n     the serious concerns the proposed bill raises for the City of \n     New York, I oppose the bill in its current form.\n       Sincerely, Michael R. Bloomberg, Mayor.\n\n  As I showed yesterday, there are more than 20 States that will have \ntheir laws overturned by this, and 12 more whose laws could be \nchallenged in court.\n  They recognize that. Calls we are getting, letters we are having \nshared with us indicate that is a concern of those out there who have \nto deal with these kinds of problems and the gaps the bill language \nleaves and the new authority of this Federal Labor Relations Authority \nwhich hardly anybody has had to deal with in the past. It is not even \nequipped to handle what is in the bill.\n  This is an ill-conceived and badly drafted bill that would not only \noverturn the law in a near majority of States and disregard the \ndemocratic will of the legislatures and people in other States, it \nwould plainly disrupt the law and labor relations policies of every \nState. This is the price that is paid when the proponents of a bill \npander to special interests and circumvent the regular order of this \nbody in an attempt to advance fundamentally flawed legislation. The sad \ntruth is, I do not believe this bill can be fixed. I certainly do not \nbelieve it can be fixed on the floor of the Senate. It should have been \naddressed in committee, but we are left with no choice. So we will \ncontinue today to take up the floor time of the Senate trying to fix an \nirretrievably broken, totally unnecessary piece of special interest \nlegislation. Is it any wonder the American public holds Congress in \nsuch low disregard?\n  I haven't had a chance yet to even talk specifically on the employee \nbill of rights amendment and the unfunded mandate option. I will take \nthat opportunity at this point in time. Yesterday, the Senator from \nUtah, Mr. Hatch, offered a public employee bill of rights amendment. \nMany of my colleagues have spoken about the tremendous service \nAmerica's public safety employees give to the public. I believe 100 \nSenators believe that and want to help, in every way possible, the \npublic safety employees do their job. I am a little concerned that \noccasionally we think that only through collective bargaining will \nanybody listen to a suggestion of a public service employee. I have \nnever seen that happen. I am not saying it couldn't happen somewhere in \nAmerica, but if they are suggesting something for safety, I think \npeople will listen.\n  A lot of times we don't think of things for safety until after a \ntragedy such as Charleston. Then we think about what could have been \ndone, and it is shared with the Nation. A lot of that is put into \nplace, not through collective bargaining, through common sense. You \nwant to protect the lives of the people who work for you; that is, the \npeople who work for the people of the United States, work for the \npeople in the communities. The toughest job in America is being a mayor \nbecause you are right there with the people. They can grab you by the \nshirt collar--you usually don't have any kind of security--and explain \nin no uncertain terms what they are thinking. Usually, they have a \npretty good idea, not just a complaint but a complaint coupled with a \nsuggestion.\n  I know, on any given day, one of these officers could be asked to put \nhis or her life on the line, and they do so courageously. I agree with \nmy colleagues that individuals who choose these careers deserve \nrespect, gratitude, and special treatment. But the underlying amendment \nwould actually\n\n[[Page S4134]]\n\nresult in diminishing the rights of public safety employees who are not \ncurrently unionized. Once a workforce is unionized, even employees who \ndo not wish to be a part of the union will have pay deducted from their \npaychecks and spent in a manner outside their control. They will have \nlittle ability to question or alter the legal representation \nestablished with or without their support. The Hatch amendment merely \nbalances that diminution of self-determination by establishing a public \nbill of rights. The amendment will do three things. It guarantees the \nright to vote by a secret ballot. It guarantees to limit the right of \npublic unions' dues collection authority to nonpolitical uses. It \nguarantees that financial transparency will be there. By ensuring that \npublic safety employees in all States have the right to vote on whether \nthey unionize by secret ballot, the Hatch amendment guarantees for \npublic safety employees the same right private employees now have in \nmany States. In a democratic society, nothing is more sacred than the \nright to vote. It is undeniable that nothing ensures truly free choice \nmore than the use of a private ballot.\n  The possibility of coercive or threatening behavior toward employees \nwho may not wish to form a union is even more concerning in the context \nof public safety employees who rely on coworkers to reduce the deadly \nrisks they face routinely in the course of their work. The amendment \nwould also limit the right of public unions' dues collection authority \nto nonpolitical uses. Those who choose public service often accept \nlower pay than they might make in the private sector because they are \ndedicated to public service. Let's not insult that choice by allowing \nlabor bosses to take money from paychecks and spend it on purely \npolitical causes the employee does not support. I believe public \nemployees should have the same protections from fraud and abuse as \nprivate employees. This amendment would empower public employees by \nallowing them to observe how their dues are being spent and the other \nfinancial dealings of their unions. It does this by bringing public \nunions under the requirements of the Labor Management Reporting and \nDisclosure Act. That is a 1959 law enacted with bipartisan support, \nincluding then-Senator John F. Kennedy. Public employees who pay union \ndues, especially those who are compelled to do so against their wishes, \nare no less entitled to financial transparency and fraud protections \nthan private sector employees covered under the law today.\n  In regard to the Alexander amendment, I don't think there is any \ndoubt that the bill's mandates would increase costs for States and \nlocalities that are either now unionized or do not allow bargaining to \nthe extent required under the law and will, therefore, be subject to \nnew rules. We have heard the argument that this has to be approved by a \nlegislative body. There is also the clause in there about what the \nFederal Labor Relations Authority can do with any agreements that come \nup. I assume that would be if they didn't think they were tough enough. \nThe costs I am concerned about go far beyond any increased pay or work \nscheduling costs.\n\n  The bill's most burdensome mandate falls on small towns that will \nhave to assemble collective bargaining resources and capability on \nshort notice. We keep looking at the 5,000 figure like it is magic. \nFive thousand is a very small town, and many of them already have \ndifficulty complying with current Federal unfunded mandates. But we are \ngoing to impose one more on them. I don't want people to think the \nsmall town exemption is really just set at 5,000 population. The bill \nsays 5,000 population or 25 employees. Towns have to hire a lot of \npeople to run the facilities that we take for granted. We expect to \nturn on our faucet and have the water there. We expect to flush the \ntoilet and have it disappear. We expect to set our garbage out and have \nsomebody pick it up. We expect the streets to be in good condition so \nthey are safe. A lot of places we expect sidewalks to be there so \npedestrians don't have to be on the street. We even have in some \nmunicipalities the provision of electricity.\n  Gillette, WY, was so isolated and had so few people at one time that \nnobody wanted to provide electricity. So the city provided it. That has \nbeen a growing entity with employees. But it always required quite a \nfew employees for doing the pole work and the meter work and the \nelectrical work that was necessary. So 25 employees is a pretty easy \nthreshold to get to in a small town. So 5,000 population or 25 \nemployees, don't forget the 25 employees part.\n  The costs I am concerned about go beyond increased pay and work \nscheduling costs. This bill will also require them to assemble \ncollective bargaining resources and capability, and on very short \nnotice. I think that means that since the union will be able to bring \nin a negotiator, the city, the town--in Wyoming, 5,000 is a first-class \ncity--will have to bring in different legal and bargaining experts to \nhelp with the negotiations, at least to train them to know how to \nnegotiate. That will happen on both sides.\n  So this requires actions such as hiring labor law experts and \nestablishing contracts with arbitrators, all resources that may be in \nshort supply since small towns all across the country will be facing \nthe same mandate at the same time.\n  As the former mayor of Gillette, I know what it is like to balance a \nmunicipal budget. When the Federal Government imposes costly new \nmandates and provides no funds to pay for them, it is frustrating for \nthe mayor and the council and anybody who works for the city. When I \nbecame mayor, it was a boom town. The town had recognized the need to \nhave better sewer treatment facilities. We had applied to the Federal \nGovernment. We had received a grant. Just as I took office, this new \nsewer treatment facility went on line. The inspector showed up and \nsaid: Your town has grown so much, you are violating the capacity of \nyour sewer system. Since we provided the money for it, we are going to \nfine you.\n  So I needed a new sewer treatment facility. I needed several million \ndollars' worth of new sewer treatment facility. So I went back to the \nsource. The Federal Government said: That one wasn't adequate because \nof the growth you have had. They said: Sorry, you already got one \ngrant. You wind up at the bottom of the list now. So thousands of \ncommunities across the United States, probably rightfully, got to be \nahead of my community. But that didn't stop the fines. Fortunately, I \ngot a judge who said:. Yes, we have to fine you, but we are going to \nmake you pay that money into a fund to build a new sewer treatment \nplant. That helped a little bit because we still had the money to do \nsomething, but we were still being put under this Federal mandate, \nwhich is a good idea. You need to do adequate sewer treatment. That is \nvery important. But how do these small towns afford that? There are \nthousands of them, and they are all going to be put under that law at \nthe same time. There aren't enough people trained to help them do this. \nSo the burden falls on the taxpayers. The taxpayers elect local \nofficials who will pursue their priorities and collect taxes at a level \nto cover the cost of those priorities. That is partly right. You don't \nalways have the right to increase taxes. There are State limits in many \nof the States that say how much a municipality can tax. So that option \nmay be closed down. This bill upsets the democratic order by imposing \nFederal priorities on local taxpayers with no way to pay for them. \nLocal governments don't have ``funny money'' gimmicks like the Federal \nGovernment. Increased costs have to result in increased taxes, such as \nsales tax, property tax or decreased services. So which of those 25 \nemployees are we going to get rid of in order to meet the costs of this \nbill? You can say it is not a Federal mandate because we have some \ndefinitions that explain what a true Federal mandate is, but I think \nthe towns will consider it to be a Federal mandate. So will the people \nwho are taxed or lose services or who are taxed and lose their jobs.\n  This is a choice I believe we should leave to local government. The \nAlexander amendment would leave it up to them by allowing localities to \nopt out of the bill's requirements, if they determine it will increase \nlocal property taxes, compromise public safety or constitute an \nunfunded mandate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey).

Mr. President, I thought things were too good to be true, \nthat we would have a debate on a bipartisan bill. There are a lot of \nthings we could do to bring the Presidential politics into what is \ngoing on here on the floor. I think this is untoward.\n  This is a bill that has been worked on for a long time. Senator \nKennedy and Senator Gregg have worked in good faith to bring this up to \nhelp firemen and police officers. I had a group of police officers in \nmy office today. They were so excited about this bill because we are \ndoing something to help them.\n  We have been through this before. I told Mike Enzi last Friday, \nthrough staff, that I would not fill the tree on this. I wanted to see \nif we could work in good faith for once without the Republicans playing \ntheir petty politics. But, obviously, we cannot do that.\n  Now, is it any wonder--I ask: Is it any wonder--that the Republicans \nhave lost three special elections for House seats? It is no wonder. The \nAmerican people understand what this Republican-led Congress has done, \nled by this man in the White House.\n  Now, is it any wonder that in a poll yesterday in the Washington \nPost, the Democrats have a 21-percent lead on the Republicans on being \nbetter able to handle the problems of this country? It is no wonder \nbecause this is what we have. They are not serious about anything.\n  We have had 71 filibusters that have been filed this Congress we have \ntried to break--we have had to break them--71 filibusters.\n  So I tell my friend, Chairman Kennedy, and Ranking Member Enzi, it is \nobvious we cannot complete this legislation. It is obvious that games \nare being played.\n  Now, can you imagine on this bill dealing with people who are first \nresponders--on 9/11, who were the people rushing into that building to \ndie? Firefighters and police officers. They have asked for some help \nfrom us. For example, in Nevada, we have a situation where the State \nlegislature said local law enforcement officers can bargain \ncollectively. But isn't it interesting, the State cannot. Highway \npatrol officers cannot, those people who are capital policemen in \nNevada cannot.\n  That is what this legislation would do. It would direct attention to \nsome of the problems law enforcement has in this country, and we are \nnot going to be able to do it because we are working now and are going \nto have to vote on whether there should be a holiday on gas prices. I \ntalked to a woman in Pahrump, NV, yesterday, 50 miles out of Las Vegas. \nShe moved to Pahrump because it would be cheaper to live. She works in \nLas Vegas. Well, that was a bad bet she made because she has a diesel \nvehicle. Yesterday, it cost almost $130 to fill it with diesel fuel, \nand she has to fill it once a week.\n  So we have a situation here where now we are going to start debating \nthe energy policies of this country. We are happy to enter into that \ndebate because we know the energy policy in this country has been set \nby Dick Cheney. He met with oil companies. It was all secret. They \nprotected themselves, even through the Supreme Court, that we would not \nknow whom they met with and what they met with. But it is obvious the \npolicies they came up with have been a real big boon to the energy \ncompanies, making more money than any companies in the history of the \nworld.\n  So if my Republican colleagues want to debate energy, we are happy to \ndo it. What we wanted to work on is something to help police and fire. \nI am very disappointed. We on this side wanted to finish this \nlegislation. But we have a cloture motion filed on the McCain proposal, \nand I am forced to acknowledge that probably he is trying to do \nanything he can. He is a flawed candidate, and he is wrong on the war, \nand he is wrong on the economy. But it is too bad he is still \ninterfering with what we are trying to do here to start doing some \nserious legislating, ``he,'' meaning John McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, before the leader departs the floor, I \nwish to thank him again for his strong support for this legislation \nthat is so important to our first responders, to our firefighters, and \nour police officers in this country.\n  We have seen this parliamentary gimmick that has taken place offered \nby the Republican leadership that is a slap in the face to every \nfirefighter and police officer and first responder in the country.\n  We have bipartisan support for this legislation. We have four \namendments that are now pending. We had some understanding that we \nwould have an opportunity to address those amendments during the course \nof the day. They are all related to this legislation. But oh, no--oh, \nno--the games are going to be played, and we are saying to the \nfirefighters of this Nation and to the police officers of this Nation \nand the first responders of this Nation: Your interests, the safety and \nsecurity of our communities across this Nation,\n\n[[Page S4136]]\n\nshould be put aside in favor of some political gimmick by the \nRepublican leader in the Senate.\n  That is what this is about. Make no mistake about it. Every \nfirefighter ought to understand that. We are here now at noontime, \nready to do the public's business, ready to take a vote on these \nissues, but oh, no, the Republican side says: No, you can't do it. You \ncan't do it.\n  Look, the underlying position the Republicans are talking about is \nhelp for our GI bill. Senator Webb has his proposal. I am all in \nsupport of what Senator Webb is doing. Why not have that done after \nthis bill is over? Why not have it done after then? Why didn't the \nRepublican leader come on up and speak to the Democratic leader and \npropose: Let's do that at the end of the week. Do it Friday, Saturday, \nSunday, and Monday. Maybe Senator McCain will come back for it; maybe \nhe won't. Do it after we finish this bill. But, no, we are going to \ninsult--and this is an insult, make no mistake about it. I have been \naround here long enough to know when the insults are being played, and \nthis is it. This is saying: Your interests are not as important as a \npolitical hit. That is what is happening. That is what is happening.\n  Who are these individuals? Forty billion dollars we spend on homeland \nsecurity. Forty billion we are spending on homeland security. Who are \nthe people who implement homeland security? They are our firefighters, \nour police officers, and first responders in all 50 States. They \nbelieve they have ways of doing it better than it is being done at the \npresent time. I do too. So do Democrats and so do a few Republicans. We \nwant to work through the political process to give the opportunity to \nhave that done. But oh, no--oh, no--we are not going to do that. We are \ngoing to play games. It is Wednesday. It is noontime. We are just going \nto play some more games. We did it with you guys in the Senate last \nweek on energy. We are going to do it here.\n  Listen, we are glad and willing to vote. I have been doing that for \n45 years, and I am glad to do that now. But make no mistake about it \nwho the target is--who the target is. The Republicans are saying: We \nwill not take the time. We will not take the time to let the Senate \nwork its will in terms of the firefighters and policemen of this \ncountry. That is outrageous. It is a gross insult to each and every one \nof them. It is a slap in the face to each and every one of them. Make \nno mistake about it, that is what is going on here. That is what is \ngoing on here.\n\n  Well, we are not giving up. We are not giving up on them. Maybe the \nother side wants to give up, but we are not giving up on them. We \nbelieve their service--their service--is too important to this country, \ntheir lives too important to this country. When are we going to be \nthreatened again? Too important to this country.\n  Maybe the leadership on the other side can tell us whether Senator \nMcCain approved this strategy. Maybe we can find that out. I think the \npolice and firefighters of the country would like to know whether \nSenator McCain--we have Senator McCain's proposal here. It is difficult \nto believe an effort would be made to bring this up without his \napproval. I think firefighters and policemen ought to understand \nwhether Senator McCain supports this proposal. You cannot get away \nwithout believing that he does and that he has been an architect. You \ndon't just go around and get 16 Senators. You have to go around here \nand get all those. This thing has been in the cooking for a period of \ntime. This just did not happen, although it looks--they duck in the \ncloakroom, and then they run out and do that--all that business.\n  This has been going on. This is a conscious act, and one will have to \nassume Senator McCain is absolutely against it. I hope he is able to \ntalk to the firefighters and the police officers and the first \nresponders. Why are you interrupting this bill--this bill--that is so \nessential to the security, homeland security? Why interrupt this bill \nwhen we are in the process--at least we thought so--that we were going \nto be moving ahead to get some votes on these particular measures? Why? \nNo, no effort at all to try and talk to the leadership, certainly not \nto--I do not expect--although, for the first 20 years or so I was in \nthis body, people used to do that. They used to talk to people and tell \nthem what was going to come on up. But I do not expect that anymore. \nBut you would have thought: At least talk to the leadership who has \nresponsibility.\n  So I hope each and every one of the firefighters, police officers, \nfirst responders who have been working on this legislation for years--I \nwish to mention about how long they have been working on this. It was \nintroduced on May 12, 1999. On July 25, 2000, we had a Health Committee \nhearing. On September 19, 2001, we had a committee markup and reported \nit out. On November 6, 2001, we had a Senate vote, No. 323. On November \n24, we had a HELP Committee markup. On February 4, 2004, it was offered \nas an amendment to S. 1017. On November 13, 2007, it was offered as \namendment No. 2419.\n  For 8\\1/2\\ years this has been before the Senate--8\\1/2\\ years. Two \ncommittees, one chaired by the Senator from New Hampshire, the HELP \nCommittee, and the other one by myself, and we supported this bill out. \nWe finally have a chance to debate this. We had a good debate \nyesterday, and we are prepared to deal with the amendments on a matter \nof vital national security for our country and for respect for those \nwho are our first responders who have done so much. But the answer is, \nno.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, all except the 9--10 new Senators we have \nremember the time that I lived on the Senate floor. For 6 years I was \nhere from the time we came in session until we left, with no \nexceptions. I tried at that time to be as fair to the Republicans as \nthe Democrats. If someone asked for more time on our side, with the \nRepublicans not being here, they automatically got that time.\n  That is what took place today--I want Senator Kennedy to hear this. I \nwant Senator Kennedy to hear this. Here this morning I congratulated \nyou and the ranking member, Senator Enzi, because we were having a good \ndebate and we were going to be working from the idea that we would try \nto improve this bill. I said specifically that Senator Enzi said he \nwished he had more time to do some committee work, and he wanted to do \nsome work out here.\n  More power to him. That is what he should be able to do. I \ncomplimented everyone for the way this bill was being handled. Do you \nknow the sad part about it, I say to my friends. Senator McConnell was \nstanding right there. We had a conversation walking out the door. \nShouldn't he have said to me: Well, maybe you shouldn't feel that way; \nI am going to file cloture on the McCain amendment to get the tax \nholiday on gas.\n  But I am so surprised. I never try to avoid a phone call from my \nRepublican counterpart. I always try to be available. I would say this: \nI would never do to him what he did to me this morning. It is untoward.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Because we had so much notice on this, I thought it was the \nMcCain tax holiday amendment. But, no, it is the McCain effort to \nchange the Jim Webb bipartisan GI bill of rights because it is too \ngenerous. So this idea is about the same as the gas tax holiday. He \ndoesn't like the GI bill of rights because it is too generous. Now I am \nwondering if we want to debate Iraq on this bill because we are happy \nto do it. We are happy to debate an intractable civil war that is \ncosting the American people $5,000 a second every day of the week, \nevery week of the month, every month of the year, $5,000 a second. No \nweekends off, no holidays, $5,000 a second of borrowed money.\n  Do we want to debate the Iraq war? Is that what we want to do on this \nbill that was set aside to deal with firefighters, police officers, and \nfirst responders?\n  Those people came to my office today, some in uniform, some in plain \nclothes, because that is what they do. Some of them wear their uniform \nto work every day. Some do other work so they can't wear the uniform. \nThey are\n\n[[Page S4137]]\n\nundercover. But no--I apologize to everyone. I thought we were on the \nMcCain tax holiday. But, no, we are now on the GI bill of rights McCain \neffort because it is too generous.\n  The bipartisan bill of Jim Webb that he wrote himself, bipartisan in \nnature, is too generous according to John McCain. We are happy to \ndebate that. If that is what this body needs to do is to start the \nsupplemental debate a week early, we can do that too.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Senator withhold that request?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I understand what the majority leader is saying, he \nis prepared to see the Senate vote on the McCain amendment as well as \nhave a vote on the Webb amendment, and do it in a timely way. Is that \nwhat I am gathering here?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. We are going to do it next week anyway. Do you want to \ndo it a week early? Fine.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The majority leader has indicated they are prepared to \ngo for a time limit on the McCain amendment, a time limit on the Webb \namendment, and then have a vote so Members can do it here, and do it in \na prompt way. I also understand that we would be able to continue the \nconsideration of this matter but, as I understand, we are not getting \nany cooperation from the other side.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend not only was an amendment filed, but \nuntoward cloture was filed at the same time on that amendment. Now, \nwhat would happen if on every piece of legislation around here, when \nyou offer an amendment, a person walks in and files a cloture motion at \nthe same time? That is a little funny way to do it. But maybe the \nRepublicans love this filibustering so much--they broke the record, the \nfilibuster record, in 10 months. Maybe they really want to in effect \nbreak Hank Aaron's record big in the way of filibusters. It is not \nenough to break it in 10 months, they want to really break it big, so \nnow they are going to start filing cloture motions on their own \namendments.\n  So I think what we need to do is just relax a little bit. We are \ngoing to suggest the absence of a quorum in just a second, and we will \ntalk a little bit to see if there is a way out of this. I hope there is \na way out of it for the benefit of the police and firefighters and \nfirst responders of this country. They are in town this week because \nthere is going to be a memorial for those who were killed this year, \npolice officers who were killed this year in service to their counties, \ntheir cities, and their States. They are here. Part of the reason they \nare here and the reason we scheduled this at this time is because they \nwere going to be here.\n  So I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I yield for a question without losing the right to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would ask the majority leader if I might \nbe recognized to speak after he completes his speech and his statement \nbecause I would like to speak.\n  Mr. REID. As I said, Mr. President, we are going to go into a quorum \ncall and huddle down here and find out if there is a way out of this.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the majority leader yield for a further question?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I think the majority leader has made his case as to the \nstatus of the situation. But I do believe we should not shut off debate \nin the sense of not allowing for those of us who would like to express \nthe way we see the situation to also be able to speak. That is why I \nwould like to have an opportunity to speak.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, and he is my friend, we are not going \nto have any more discussion on this piece of legislation until we \nfigure out a way to help the police and firefighters. The decision was \nmade by the Republican leader to debate the GI bill of rights, OK? That \nis where we are now.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \nquorum call so that I can answer some of the questions that have been \nasked on the other side.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). Objection is heard.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the patience of all Senators. I \nam going to, in a couple minutes, move to table the Graham first-degree \namendment. That vote will take place shortly. Following that, I have \nasked Senators Kennedy and Enzi to sit down and see if there is a way \nwe can finish this important legislation. We have other things to do \nthis week. We have the farm bill that will be here within the hour from \nthe House. We have the budget conferees we have to appoint. Senator \nDorgan is pushing hard on the media cross-ownership. That is something \nwe need to complete this week. I want all Senators to see what they can \ndo to exert influence on their friends to finish this bill. I have \ntalked to the head of the firefighters. He is tremendously troubled \nthat we ran into this roadblock. The underlying bill is very important. \nI would hope everyone understands that. We have all next week to do \nwhatever needs to be done on the supplemental appropriations bill. We \nwill get into a lot of discussion on the war in Iraq and what is going \nto happen to returning veterans.\n  In the meantime, it is my understanding the matter before the Senate \nis the Graham first-degree amendment. I move to table Graham amendment \nNo. 4763 and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN, I announce that the Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton) \nand the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necesarily absent: the Senator from \nArizona (Mr. McCain.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Are there any other Senators \nin the Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 55, nays 42, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 127 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--55\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n[[Page S4138]]\n\n\n\n                                NAYS--42\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Barrasso\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Clinton\n     McCain\n     Obama\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, may we have order? The Senator is \nentitled to be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in a quorum call.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent that further proceedings under \nthe quorum call be suspended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator cannot reserve the right to \nobject.\n  Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Then I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the next \nhour be evenly divided between the two parties for the purposes of \ndebate only and at the end of that time, a quorum call be in order.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I \nam not going to, but I wish to explain that Members on this side of the \naisle are prepared to go forward with the amendments Senator Enzi has \nbeen suggesting we vote on. We are having some difficulty achieving \nthat, but we would like to have some more votes on the underlying bill \ntoday.\n  Having said that, I do not object.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I am happy \nto agree to this because I have been trying to speak now for 4 or 5 \nhours, and the last three times I rose to speak, the majority leader \nwould not allow me to speak. I understood his concern and his pique \nabout what he perceived as to what was happening on the floor, but \nindependent of that, I still think I should have the right to speak. \nTherefore, since I sought the floor initially and was seeking the floor \nthe last time this exercise took place, I would request that the \nunanimous consent request be adjusted so that I be recognized first and \nthat I be given 5 minutes to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator so modify his request?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I so modify, with the understanding that following the \nSenator from New Hampshire, the Senator from Virginia be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I just want to say in terms of the voting that we are \nprepared to vote on our side on the underlying amendments, but we were \nnotified by the other side that we would not be permitted to vote. \nThere was objection from the Republican side to voting on a Democratic \namendment, and we insist on getting that worked out so we can move \nahead.\n  Hopefully, we can put aside the games and get moving on this \nunderlying legislation, which is so important. Madam President, I ask \nunanimous consent further that after Senator Webb, the speakers be \nrotated from side to side and the time, as mentioned earlier, be evenly \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized for 5 minutes--the \nSenator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized on this side after Senator Webb.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I wanted to rise earlier to put into \ncontext what the exercise we were involved in was about and the fact \nthat the issue of the Graham amendment, in my humble opinion, did not, \nin any way, adversely affect the capacity to pass and proceed on the \nunderlying bill, which is the firefighter initiative here that I and \nSenator Kennedy have brought forward.\n  I think there were representations from the majority leader that the \nGraham amendment was some sort of attempt to basically sidetrack the \nfirefighter bill. It was not that at all. It was simply the Senate \ndoing its natural business, which is to amend bills on the floor of the \nSenate and get votes on those amendments. The Republican leader, in his \nabsolute right, set the matter so it would be voted on. If he had not \ndone what he did, there probably would have been no vote on the Graham \namendment because the majority would have been able to sidetrack that \namendment.\n  I think Senator Graham had every right to come forward with whatever \namendment he wanted. Every Member has that right when a bill is open to \namendment. That has been a huge debate for quite a while. The majority \nparty, for some reason, has decided to try to run the Senate as if it \nwere the House of Representatives, which means they are trying to \nproceed in an autocratic way, where they decide for the minority party \nwhat amendments will be brought forward. That is not appropriate. That \nis not the tradition or the purpose of the Senate. The minority party \nhas an absolute, sacred right to bring forward amendments, and there is \nno right in the majority party to ban the capacity of the minority \nparty to do that, unless the majority party has the capacity to \nbasically bring down the entire operation of the Senate, which is what \nit consistently has been doing--filling the tree time and time again in \nan attempt to shut off our party, the minority, from making its points \nand bringing forward amendments, which can be debated and voted on, and \nthen you can get to the underlying bill--which is the way the Senate \nworked, by the way, for over 200 years.\n  Now, another action is occurring here which required Senator Graham \nto offer this amendment. He didn't, by choice, pick this bill out of \nhis interest in the bill to offer the amendment on. He had to offer it \nbecause the majority party is using the rules of the Senate to shut off \nall amendments to the bill being proposed by the Senator from Virginia.\n  The bill of the Senator from Virginia will be marked up in a manner \nthat will bring it to the floor so that it would not be amendable. That \nhas been public knowledge around here for weeks--that we were not going \nto be given the opportunity to amend the Senator's bill. That is \ninappropriate also. So the only way Senator Graham could protect his \nrights was to bring this amendment forward at this time. It did nothing \nto undermine the movement of this bill forward. If this bill doesn't \nmove forward--the firefighter bill--it will be because the Democratic \nleadership has not been able to schedule the floor in an efficient \nenough way to get the bill across the floor. That is the reason. It is \nnot the failure of the minority to move this bill across the floor. It \nis failure of the majority to bring forward the bill in a proper \nprocedure and allow for a proper amendment process to occur.\n  I think that point needs to be made. It is like the story of the guy \nwho kills his parents and throws himself on the jury's mercy because he \nclaims he is an orphan. The majority party has killed its parents. They \nare trying to deny the right of the minority to offer amendments to the \nWebb measure. It is inconsistent with the way the Senate should act.\n\n[[Page S4139]]\n\n  I think we had a legitimate case with the Graham amendment. I think \nthe Republican leader did the right thing in filing cloture to force a \nvote on that amendment. We have now had a vote, which was a vote to \ntable. As a practical matter, it hasn't slowed down the firefighter \nbill. The bill has not been prejudiced by this action. Rather, the \nactivity of the Senate, which is to give the minority the right to \namend, has occurred in a proper way. It took work to get it done and \nhuffing and puffing from the other side of the aisle, saying it should \nnot be done. The proper order was done, and I congratulate the \nRepublican leader for following this course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto engage in a colloquy with the senior Senator from Virginia and the \nsenior Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, I wish to speak for a few minutes about \nour bill that the senior Senator from Virginia, the Senator from \nNebraska, and 58 Members of this body in total have cosponsored because \nI regret this vote that has just occurred.\n  I personally did not think it was appropriate that the amendment of \nthe Senator from South Carolina be placed into this particular \nlegislation, particularly at a time when there had been a good bit of \ndiscussion about how any suggestions that were viewed as appropriate to \nour legislation were welcome. They have been welcome for 16 months.\n\n  So I don't want the Members of this body, or other people in our \ncountry, to think that in any way our GI bill legislation is a partisan \nmeasure or a piece of legislation that simply is being driven by the \nmajority party. In fact, as I said, we have 58 sponsors in the Senate--\n11 of them Republicans--including the senior Senator from Virginia, \nwho, other than myself, is the only person who has served in a policy \nposition in the Pentagon and who is a former chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, and including the former chairman of the veterans \ncommittee, a Republican, and also including the current chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee and the chairman of the veterans committee.\n  This is a strongly bipartisan bill. It is an attempt to give those \npeople who serve and have served since 9/11 equitable opportunities for \nthe future on a level of the people whom we have come to call the \n``greatest generation,'' the World War II veterans. That is all this \nis. I hope the other Members of this body will come together with us to \npass this legislation.\n  With respect to amendments to this legislation, I wish to say a \ncouple things. One, we have worked with all the major veterans groups \nover a period of 16 months. We have worked with other Members of this \nbody over a period of 16 months--Democrats and Republicans. We have \nincorporated many different suggestions. This is a bill that I believe \nwill be dramatically helpful to those who have served, and it will be \nsomething of which the American people can be proud.\n  In that regard, I say, first of all, on the House side, we have 295 \nsponsors of this identical legislation, including 91 Republicans. So \nlet's all get together and let's set partisan bickering aside and do \nsomething affirmative that will allow the people who have been serving \nin these arduous times to have a true first-class shot in the future.\n  With that, I yield to the senior Senator from Virginia, whose advice \nand counsel on this bill has been greatly appreciated and whose support \nI also appreciate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I stand before this Senate, which I have \nbeen in now almost 30 years, with a great sense of humility. I simply \nsay that I would not be here had it not been for previous GI bills. I \nvolunteered and served in the last year of World War II as a young \nsailor, 17 years old. Subsequently, I volunteered to go into the Marine \nCorps in 1948 and served on active duty during the Korean conflict, \n1950-1952. That modest World War II service gave me a GI bill to get my \nundergraduate degree then, and my modest service in the Marine Corps on \nActive Duty--and I stayed in the Reserves for many years afterward--\ngave me a second GI bill enabling me to get my law degree. I am here \nbecause of that education given to me and many other by a generous \nNation.\n  I have joined my distinguished colleague, and dear friend, the junior \nSenator from Virginia, Mr. Webb, who was a part of my staff when I was \nUnder Secretary and Secretary of the Navy. We have known each other for \nmany years and have worked together prior to coming to the Senate. I \nhave the greatest admiration for him. He is too modest to talk of his \nmilitary career, his service in the Department in the Defense, as \nAssistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs, and later as \nSecretary of the Navy. We have collaborated with the Senator from \nNebraska, who is another distinguished veteran of the Vietnam period. I \nthink the three of us are highly conscious of what we want to do for \ntoday's generation of young men and women in uniform and their \nfamilies.\n  In the aftermath of World War II, the first GI bill was passed in \n1944. Sixteen million men and women were given that educational \nopportunity, of which 7.8 million veterans availed themselves of these \nGI bill benefits.\n  All those individuals, including this humble Senator, were given the \noption to go to that university or that college of their choice, and \nthat university or college, because of their academic credentials, \nwould accept them. The dollars were not a subject, because the GI bill \nlargely paid for all the expenses incurred by the veterans.\n  That is the purpose of the Webb bill, to now give to this very \ncourageous generation the same opportunities my generation had \nbeginning in 1944. I think today's generation will be judged by history \nas just as great, or greater, than the World War II generation. We \nshould give to this generation nothing less.\n  I can assure you that, based on my experience--and I think my \ncolleagues will agree--this will be an inducement to bring more high-\nquality individuals into uniform, knowing that for that service, their \nNation would recognize it with the opportunity for them to pursue \nfurther education.\n  Madam President, I will soon ask to have printed in the Record a part \nof the law as it exists today. Much has been said about the \ntransferability of the GI bill rights to a spouse or a child. The \nCommittee of the Armed Services on which I serve, put into law the \nfirst option by which a service person could have what is known as \ntransferability of their GI bill to a spouse or child. It is still the \nlaw of the day.\n  I think my distinguished colleague from Virginia, having recognized \nthis as existing law, might well consider it as a part of his \nlegislation. That is a decision he will make and one I will support.\n  With that, I will yield the floor at this time.\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, first of all, I say to the senior Senator \nfrom Virginia, I have raised this piece of existing law a number of \ntimes when the individuals who introduced the measure that was just \ntabled talked about the need for transferability. This option is \navailable to service Secretaries at their discretion under the existing \nlaw that the senior Senator from Virginia introduced more than 6 years \nago. It would be, I believe, logical and proper to extend that law to \nthe new GI bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague. Might that be in the \nform of an amendment to the Senator's existing bill?\n  Mr. WEBB. We would be happy to discuss that as soon as we can meet.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I admire the Senator's willingness to \naccept that. It was my hope that perhaps Senators could have worked \ntogether with those who sponsored the bill we just voted to table. But \ncertainly Republicans exercised their right to have this vote on the \nmeasures put in by Senator Burr and Senator Graham.\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, the Senator from Nebraska is getting ready \nto speak. I will point out a couple things. One is that he has served \nour country with great distinction as an infantry sergeant in Vietnam \nand was wounded. He has been a great friend for many years, 30 years. \nHe and I came up together working on veterans laws years ago.\n\n[[Page S4140]]\n\n  Just as importantly, when I mentioned the senior Senator from \nVirginia and myself were the only ones who served in policy positions \nin the Pentagon, I believe Senator Hagel is probably the only Member of \nthis body who has served in a senior policy position in the Department \nof Veterans' Affairs.\n  If anyone is looking at the sense of fiduciary responsibility and the \nwisdom that has gone into our bill, I hope they will consider those \nsets of experiences.\n  With that, I yield to the senior Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I thank both of my distinguished \ncolleagues for their service to our country and for their leadership on \none of the most important efforts we can make on behalf of those we ask \nto do so much for our country.\n  The reality is, today we are asking less than 1 percent of our \nsociety to bear all the burden, to carry that burden with tremendous \nsacrifice, not just for themselves but also a sacrifice called for from \ntheir families. They do it willingly, they do it because they love \ntheir country, and they care about the future of their country.\n  What this bill is about, as much as any one thing, is supporting our \ntroops in a time of peace, just as we support our troops in a time of \nwar. These are men and women who have earned this benefit. Every \ngeneration of veterans since World War II has been acknowledged by a \ngrateful nation, acknowledged in many ways. Maybe the most important \nway is a set of educational benefits they have been given in \nappropriate recognition of their service to our country.\n  Just as Senator Webb noted, what we are doing is rotating these \nbenefits forward into the 21st century so they are relevant to the \nrealities of the costs of education today, giving these veterans the \nsame kinds of opportunities and options that Senator Warner, all of our \nWorld War II veterans have had--our Korean war veterans in the \nCongress, and our Vietnam war veterans, all of them have had.\n  This is not a new program. This is not a welfare program. At a time \nwhen we have no difficulty finding the money to go to war, to place \nthese men and women in war, we are having some debate over whether we \nhave the resources, the commitment in this country to find the \nresources to do not only what is right but what our Nation has always \ndone since 1944.\n  Is that the debate? If that is the debate, we should have a debate \nbecause it is about the prioritization of our people. These young men \nand women are expected to go to war, fight and die, many will come back \nwith tremendous scars, ruined families, and then we disconnect? It is \nnot enough to slap a bumper sticker on your car and say, ``I support \nthe troops,'' or for us to stand in the Senate or the House and speak \nin abstractions about supporting the troops. This is about supporting \nthe troops.\n  My goodness, what is a wiser investment in our society, in our \nfuture, in our country than giving these special men and women the same \nopportunities we had to make a better world, not just for themselves \nbut for our country, through helping to educate these men and women.\n  We have missed some points in this debate so far. I hope the points I \nhave covered briefly will come back into some clarity, in some \nframework of understanding by the American people as to what this is \nabout because, as I note again, if this is about not having the \nresources to fulfill the commitments we have made for almost 70 years \nto America's veterans, if that is the case, then that debate needs to \nbe ongoing throughout this Nation because I think the American people \nwill want to say something about this, will want to have something to \nsay about this, and they should. It is their Nation, their sons and \ndaughters we send off to war.\n  This, as Senator Webb has noted, should be an effort to bring our \ncountry together, not divide our country, not divide us between \nRepublicans and Democrats or between States. This should be some \nconsensus of purpose to acknowledge these men and women who do so much, \nwho bear all the burden. That is what this is about.\n  There will be more debate, and there needs to be more debate. I am as \nproud to be part of this effort with my colleagues from Virginia, \nSenator Webb and Senator Warner, with 57 other colleagues in the \nSenate, and almost 300 in the House, as I have ever been since I have \nbeen in the Senate on behalf of a piece of legislation. This should be \nan effort to unite our country, and I believe the American people will \nsee it that way.\n  I appreciate very much an opportunity to express some of these points \nand for the continued leadership of my friend, Jim Webb.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I say to my good friend and the leader \nof this effort, and Senator Hagel, let's clarify what I recommend we \nconsider. That is the insertion of a provision, if it is so decided by \nSenator Webb, on transferability, which would be for an individual to \nserve a second tour of service upon the completion of the first tour of \nservice. This tracks with the 2001 legislation.\n  Will the Senator from Virginia concur?\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, I say to the senior Senator that I have \nread the existing law, and the understanding I have of it is, at the \ndiscretion of a Service Secretary for military occupational \nspecialities, that as they determine with a reenlistment, that \ntransferability in increments would be allowed. That is in keeping with \nthe statements of concern by the Senator from South Carolina about \nwanting to use transferability as a retention incentive. It is in \nexisting law. It has not really been used extensively by the Service \nSecretaries. But I agree with the senior Senator that we should look \nfor a way to continue that in our legislation as well.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank my distinguished colleague. I am \nproud to note that on the Webb bill I think it remains correct at this \ntime that there are 11 Republican Senators who are cosponsors of the \nbill. This clearly indicates that Senator Webb has devised legislation \nwhich is bipartisan, and does reflect, as our colleague from Nebraska \nsaid, the will of the people of the United States to recognize the \nextraordinary heroism and commitment of the individual in uniform and \ntheir family and loved ones at home.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord current law enacted in 2001, to which I referred earlier.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              FY2002 NDAA\n\n                       Subtitle E--Other Matters\n\n     SEC. 654.

How much time remains, Madam President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 23\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts; 12 minutes to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI.

Madam President, I will be glad to yield 10 minutes----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Each Senator who spoke was charged with the \ntime based on their party.\n\n[[Page S4142]]\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I thought I was in charge of half of the time, and I didn't \nallocate that time. I can see how the rules go here.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask for additional time.

I ask unanimous consent for 10 additional minutes on our \nside and for 15 additional minutes on the other side--or 20 minutes on \nthe other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. There \nwill be 20 additional minutes added to the minority side and 10 \nadditional minutes added to the majority side.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, we have had a very interesting exchange \nwith both Senators from Virginia and the Senator from Nebraska on a \nmatter of enormous importance and consequence, and that is our support \nfor a GI bill that is worthy of the bravery, courage, and valor of \nthose who are serving in the Armed Forces.\n  The stated legislative purpose of the Senator from Virginia, Mr. \nWebb, who is the architect of this program--and I welcome the chance to \nbe a cosponsor--is to try and do for those who are in the service of \nour country at this time a similar kind of support in education that \nthose who had served in the colors in World War II received. He has \nexplained it in great detail.\n  I look forward to supporting that proposal when it comes up on the \nfloor of the Senate, probably the early part of next week. I commend \nthe strong bipartisan support that it has been able to receive. I \ncommend my former chairman, Senator Warner, who led the Armed Services \nCommittee so brilliantly for so many years and has made such an \nextraordinary contribution to the security of this Nation, both as a \nserviceman and also as a policy leader, and to Senator Hagel whom I \nthink for all of us has demonstrated enormous courage in service and \noutside guiding national security policy.\n  We are going to, after our next couple of speakers, be moving toward \nconsideration of the farm bill conference report. That is a privileged \nmatter, and it displaces the underlying legislation we have been \ndebating, the Cooperation Act, public service legislation we have been \nconsidering both yesterday and today. I expect we will continue through \nthe evening on the farm conference report. Further action on our \nlegislation will be deferred until tomorrow.\n  In conclusion for this afternoon, on the floor we are considering the \nservice of extraordinary Americans: On the one hand, as Senator Webb \npointed out, those who serve in the armed services of our country, and \non the other hand, we are talking about the 659,000 police officers, \n262,000 firefighters, who are in the service of our country trying to \nprovide for our national security.\n  We are mindful that we spend $40 billion a year on homeland security. \nWhat this legislation at its heart is all about is to make sure those \nservice men and women, those police officers, those firefighters, those \nEMTs, are going to be safe and secure; that they are going to have the \nbest in terms of equipment, and that we are going to listen to those \nindividuals who have dedicated their lives to protecting our fellow \ncitizens all across America. We are going to listen to their \nrecommendations and suggestions on how we can improve their safety and \nthe safety of the American people. We give them a mechanism to be able \nto do that. That is the framework which is the underlying aspect of the \nlegislation we have before us.\n\n  People can talk about unfunded mandates and problems of strikes and \nall these other items, but nonetheless we cannot and should not and \nwill not get away from the fundamental thrust of this legislation and \nits importance. We have an extraordinary opportunity to make America \nsafer and more secure--here on the floor of the Senate. Who wants to \nhave that challenge? It is the police officers and the firefighters and \nthe first responders who are prepared to accept that responsibility. \nAll they are asking is to have a voice at the table when judgments and \ndecisions are being made by maybe well-intentioned policymakers, well-\nintentioned bureaucrats. But we want to make sure those out there on \nthe front lines are at least going to have a voice in these policy \njudgments and decisions. That is what this legislation is about. That \nis why it is so important.\n  We are prepared to deal with the various amendments that come up. We \nlook forward to it. We have gotten off track over the course of the \nday. With all due respect to others, we find that with the exception of \nthe amendment that was being offered by the Senator from Vermont, \nSenator Leahy, on bulletproof vests--about which we don't know there is \nany substantive objection--all the other amendments have been on the \nother side; not from our side, from their side. We have not tried to \ninterfere with the order those have been offered.\n  Senator Alexander has been down here and has spoken eloquently. Many \nSenators have spoken about their amendments. Senator Hatch was down and \nspent time talking about his amendment.\n  We are prepared to move ahead. If there is need for further debate, \nwe will have further debate; if not, we are prepared to move ahead and \nhave the judgment made here in the Senate.\n  This legislation is extremely important. As I have mentioned, it has \nbeen around for some 9 years. It was introduced initially by a \nRepublican. It has strong Republican--has strong bipartisan support. I \nlistened to my friend Senator Warner talk about the strong bipartisan \nsupport there is for the GI bill. There is strong bipartisan support \nfor this legislation as well, as indeed there should be, and as we have \nattempted to achieve. We will continue to work in that area.\n  We look forward, I expect, to have further consideration on this \ntomorrow. I am very appreciative, as always, of my friend and colleague \nfrom Wyoming, Senator Enzi. We have a remarkable area of agreement in \nsome public policy areas, but we have sharp areas of differences. This \nhappens to be one of those. This legislation happens to be one of \nthose. But it does not take away the great respect and affection I have \nfor him as a legislator and as a friend.\n  We look forward to continuing this debate and hopefully a resolution \non some of these matters tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, it is my understanding our side has 32 \nminutes remaining. I wish to yield myself up to 10 minutes of that \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 25\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am going to yield 15 minutes--10 minutes to Senator \nKlobuchar and 10 minutes to the Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, \nat an appropriate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, this Saturday the people in my home \nState of Texas will join to celebrate Armed Forces Day and, of course, \nshortly thereafter Memorial Day. These are the days we set aside to \nhonor the men and women who have worn the uniform of the U.S. military, \nto honor them for their service and particularly remember those who \nmade the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our freedom.\n  As I prepare to go home this weekend to join my fellow Texans in \ncelebrating this important event, I am reminded of the immense debt we \nall owe those who have worn the uniform. Of course, this is a debt we \nknow we can never repay.\n  From a personal perspective, my father served as a B-17 pilot in \nWorld War II, and served honorably for 31 years in the U.S. Air Force. \nHe was shot down and spent 4 months in a German prisoner-of-war camp \nbefore General Patton and his army came along and liberated him and his \nfellow POWs.\n\n[[Page S4143]]\n\nOf course he, like so many of that generation, came back to his home \nand took advantage of the GI bill in order to get an education so he \ncould then become the foundation upon which America would continue to \nbuild itself in those postwar years and beyond.\n  The GI bill has done an incalculable benefit not only to the \nindividual veterans who received those educational benefits but to our \ncountry as well. It is important now, many years later, in 2008, that \nwe focus our efforts on modernizing that GI bill to make sure the \nbenefits I know we all want to see directed toward our men and women in \nuniform are available to allow them, when they return home from the \nfight, to take their uniform off, to get an education, and to achieve \ntheir dreams.\n  Because I believe we need to modernize the GI bill of rights, when it \ncomes to educational benefits for our veterans, I have chosen to \ncosponsor a bill called S. 2938, the Enhancement of Recruitment, \nRetention, and Readjustment Through Education Act. Sadly, and for some \ninexplicable reason, we saw that bill tabled by the Senate. I do not \nknow why, at a time when we ought to be talking about and acting on our \nappreciation for our men and women in uniform, the Senate decided to \ntable this important piece of legislation. But I wish to talk about it \nfor a minute, to explain to my colleagues what is contained in this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n\n  This bill would help our military personnel with an extended range of \noptions under the GI bill to ensure that they get the benefits they \ndeserve. It immediately increases education benefits for active-duty \npersonnel to $1,500 a month and, to encourage retention and \ncontinuation of service in the military, it gradually increases the \neducation benefits to $2,000 a month after 12 or more years of service.\n  It expands the authority for servicemembers to transfer--and this is \none of the most important elements of this legislation--it allows them \nto transfer their educational benefits to members of their family, a \nspouse or a child. After 6 years of service, half of that benefit can \nbe transferred, and after 12 years of service, 100 percent of the \nbenefit can be transferred to a child, to a spouse, or some other loved \none.\n  It increases from $880 to $1,200 per month the education benefits for \nGuard and Reserve members called to active duty since September 11, \n2001. It allows servicemembers to use up to $6,000 per year of \nMontgomery G.I. bill education benefits to repay student loans, and it \nprovides access to Montgomery GI bill benefits to service academy \ngraduates and senior reserve officers' training corps officers who \ncontinue to serve beyond their initial commitment.\n  This legislation is offered as an alternative to S. 22, a bill \nproduced by my distinguished colleague from Virginia, Senator Webb, and \nactually cosponsored by our other distinguished colleague from \nVirginia, Senator Warner. I believe both of these bills are born out of \nthe noblest of aspirations and intentions, but I do believe the \nalternatives offered in the bill that has been laid on the table here a \nmoment ago would actually provide a better range of services to more of \nour troops as well as their families. Simply put, I do believe it is a \nbetter fit for our Nation and a better fit for the people of my State \nof Texas.\n  I mentioned the issue of transferability. This is something not found \nin the Webb bill that is found in the alternative. To begin with, \nSenator Webb's bill fails to recognize the enormous sacrifices our \nmilitary families make in support of their loved ones who wear the \nuniform of the U.S. military. Talk to any sailor, soldier, airman, or \nmarine and they will tell you that being able to transfer their GI \neducational benefits to their spouses or their children is enormously \nimportant to them. At a time when we depend on an all-volunteer \nmilitary, isn't it important that we provide the maximum range of \nbenefits not only to our veterans but also to the military families, \nthe people who stay behind while their loved ones are deployed and \nwhose support they need and depend on, and frankly whose support our \nNation depends on--our military families?\n  According to all the service chiefs and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \ntransferability of this benefit is their No. 1 priority and something \nwholly missing from the Webb bill.\n  As I mentioned, my father served as a bomber pilot in World War II. I \nhave experienced, as have other military family members, the joint \ncommitment military families make in support of their loved one in the \nmilitary.\n  In addition to the other benefits, I think this particular provision \nof transferability recognizes a fundamental fairness issue and impacts \ndirectly on our ability to retain our servicemembers. Obviously, we \nwould not want to do anything intentionally which would encourage \npeople to leave the military after 3 years of service. It is in the \nbest interests of the United States of America, our strength and \nsecurity--it is in the best interests of our all-volunteer military \nforce to actually encourage and facilitate service of our active-duty \nmilitary beyond just an initial tour of 3 years of service.\n  While we applaud and honor those who serve any period of time in our \nmilitary, we do need to make sure we do not create an incentive for \npeople to leave early in order to get a benefit under this bill. That \nis why, under the legislation I am cosponsoring--Senator Graham's bill, \nalso cosponsored by Senator Burr, Senator McCain, and others--our \ncareer military will receive additional GI bill benefits to reward them \nfor their continued service.\n  This bill clearly recognizes you do not have to get out of the \nmilitary to be able to continue your education. Like the Webb bill, \ntroops will be eligible for up to $1,500 monthly benefits after 3 years \nof service. However, in order to recognize our career troops as well, \nbenefits would increase to $2,000 a month after 12 years of service--\nclearly providing both a benefit and incentive for people to continue \nin military service and not to feel as if they have to leave after 3 \nyears in order to take advantage of this benefit. Unlike the Webb bill, \nwhich caters to those who choose to remain in the service for only 3 \nyears--whose service we earnestly appreciate--the Graham bill I believe \nprovides short-term rewards and also rewards our career troops as well.\n  According to the RAND Corporation study conducted in January, 2008, \nSenator Webb's bill would:\n\n       . . . reduce first-term Army reenlistment by about 12 \n     percentage points from the current rate of 40 percent to \n     about 28 percent.\n\n  This is an important point. The unintended effect of Senator Webb's \nbill would actually be to reduce retention from 40 percent to 28 \npercent.\n  Madam President, I ask for an additional 2 minutes by unanimous \nconsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, why in the world would we want to do \nanything that discriminates between those military members who serve \nfor 3 years and then decide to leave and those who decide to make the \nmilitary their career? Why would we want to discriminate against their \nfamilies, who might benefit from the transferability option contained \nin this alternative legislation which I am supporting? Why would we \nwant to do anything that would actually damage our ability to encourage \npeople to stay in the military should they choose that for themselves \nand for their families?\n  I believe this legislation is important not only to our Nation, it \nprovides an important benefit to our military and their families. It \nencourages retention and continuation of service, facilitates those who \ndo want to stay longer, and creates an enhanced benefit for them.\n  In a State such as Texas where 1 out of every 10 people in uniform \ncalls our State home, this is very important to my State and my \nconstituents. But I will tell you, this is even more important to our \nNation in encouraging that our strong, all-volunteer military force \nremain strong and that we meet our commitment to make sure they receive \nthe benefits they need and they deserve and are not limited only to the \nservicemember but can also be extended to family members as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, please advise me after I have spoken for 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is an agreement to alternate sides, \nSenator.\n  The Senator from Washington State.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n\n[[Page S4144]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Refueling Tankers\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, when our constituents make decisions \nabout big purchases such as buying a house or buying a car, the first \nthing they do is consider how much money they have to spend, and then \nthey shop for the best quality they can get for the most reasonable \nprice for the item that best meets their needs. When the Government \nmakes a purchase, they expect it to follow that same sort of analysis, \nwhether it is buying a pencil or jet engines. But that is not what our \nmilitary did when it made its decision to buy the next generation of \nrefueling tankers from Airbus instead of from Boeing.\n  Compared to Boeing's 767, Airbus's A330 is massive. The simple truth \nis that a bigger plane is going to be more expensive. The bigger plane \nthe Air Force wants to buy is going to burn more fuel, it is going to \ntake up more space, and it is going to require more people to maintain \nit. But our hangars, our runways, and our ramps today are all designed \nfor a much smaller tanker.\n  I also have serious concerns and questions about how much Airbus's \ntanker is going to cost in fuel and personnel and maintenance. In the \nmonths that have passed now since the military announced it had \nselected Airbus for this massive contract, I have repeatedly asked the \nPentagon whether it considered how it will pay for the extra costs of a \nmuch bigger plane. I have been astounded that no one has been able to \nanswer my questions. In other words, the military said it wants to \nspend more than $100 billion to buy bigger planes, but it has no idea \nwhere it is going to put them, it does not know who is going to \nmaintain them, and it does not know how we are going to pay to operate \nthem. That makes no sense to me. I am very concerned about how much \nthis decision is going to cost us, and that is why I have come to the \nfloor this afternoon. Let me explain why I am troubled about this \ndecision.\n  First of all, we do not know what the possible military construction \ncosts might be for this purchase. It is estimated that these planes are \ntoo big for many of our hangars and that they are too heavy for many of \nour runways and our ramps. These tankers I am talking about are the \nbackbone of our military. These refueling tankers make our global Air \nForce possible. Today, they are stationed around the world. So we are \nnot only buying airplanes we can keep anywhere, the tanker has to be \nable to take off and land from almost anywhere in the world.\n  The new tankers are supposed to be a replacement for our current \nfleet of medium-sized Boeing KC-135s. But compared to our current \ntankers and compared to the 767, the Airbus plane the Air Force has \ndecided to purchase is massive. Airbus's A330 is 32 feet longer than \nBoeing's 767. The Airbus A330's wingspan is 41 feet wider. The A330 \nweighs about 20 percent more than the Boeing plane. Our military \nexperts have said they think the A330 will be able to operate on only \nabout half of the airfields the Boeing 767 can use--about half of our \nairfields. That means some of our infrastructure in this country and \nacross this globe is going to be torn down and refitted to accommodate \nthese new planes they have decided to buy.\n  Secondly, oil and gas prices are a major factor of the cost of \noperating a refueling tanker. I am very concerned because a larger \nplane is obviously going to burn more fuel and cost dramatically more \nover the lifetime of these planes. In fact, because the Airbus A330 is \nlarger and heavier than the Boeing 767, it is going to burn 24 percent \nmore fuel. That means that fueling planes the size of the A330 will \ncost $30 billion more over the lifetime of this plane. That is \nastonishing when you think that the initial cost for this contract is \n$35 billion. Fuel alone is going to double the cost of these planes. \nAmericans are up in arms today about the cost of gas for their own \ncars. How do you think they are going to react if our Air Force chooses \nto use their tax dollars, American tax dollars, to fuel massive \nairplanes when there is a cheaper option available?\n  Third, the larger A330 is going to require bigger refueling and \nground crews. Because buying a larger plane means it will not be able \nto use standard-size military pallets, the military, in making this \npurchase, is now going to need more personnel and airmen to load and \nunload every A330 tanker.\n  Finally, these larger planes are going to cost the military more to \nmaintain. Not only will the A330 simply need more maintenance over its \nlifetime, larger crews are going to be needed to work on them. Because \nthe planes are bigger, they are going to have to be packed in closer at \nour bases, and packing them in closer is going to make maintaining and \ngetting them off the ground more dangerous for our airmen and airwomen.\n  Now, I have been asking some pretty tough questions about how we got \nto this point, how the Air Force chose the Airbus plane over the Boeing \nplane, because it does not make sense to me that we would send this \ncontract overseas when we have the capability and the right plane right \nhere at home.\n  I have specifically asked about the military's construction costs. At \nfour hearings now, four hearings in the last 3 months, I have asked our \nmilitary officials whether they can tell me if they did an analysis of \nthe potential construction costs of buying these larger planes before \nthey reached their decision. Do you know what. I was shocked by their \nanswer. It was: No. No. No. They did not do an analysis of how much it \nwould cost for these larger planes. That means the Pentagon launched a \nmajor contract to replace a plane that we will have for decades that is \ngoing to cost us billions of dollars, but apparently it never did a \ncomplete, independent analysis of the potential military construction \ncosts of buying that much larger plane.\n  I am concerned that even though I have asked for an estimate of these \ncosts and even though several of my colleagues here in the Senate and \nthe House have asked for the same information, we do not have an \nanswer.\n  I first asked Air Force Secretary Wynne about these costs on March \n12. I asked him: What will be the associated costs for our military \nconstruction budget, and can these Airbus planes fit in the hangars we \nhave today? That is what I asked. At the time, Secretary Wynne could \nnot answer me. He only said to me that the RFP did not indicate any \nsize. So I asked again on April 24, this time with two Pentagon \nofficials, Comptroller Tina Jonas and Under Secretary of Defense Wayne \nArny, and they said they were not part of any decisionmaking process \nand could not comment. So on May 8 and then again today, I asked what \nthe cost of this larger tanker would be for the National Guard and \nReserve. Today, the Guard promised to get back to me with an answer. \nWell, I hope they do.\n\n  I am extremely frustrated that we cannot get this information. We are \ntalking about spending billions and billions of taxpayer dollars, and \nwe are talking about a decision that affects our global military power. \nI am baffled as to why the Pentagon did not do a top-to-bottom analysis \nof every aspect of this very expensive decision. ``I don't know'' is \nnot an acceptable answer when we are asking American taxpayers to foot \nthe bill for purchasing these planes.\n  Now, this process has been flawed from the start. As a result, it is \nnow being appealed to the GAO. But regardless of the GAO's findings, I \nthink we, as Members of Congress, as representatives of the American \npeople, should be very concerned about the way the military reached \nthis decision. No family would buy an 18-wheeler if all they needed was \na station wagon. And the military should not be buying a jumbo jet that \nis extremely expensive when what it really needs and what it has told \nus it needs is an agile refueling tanker. It is common sense.\n  I think we need some real answers about why the Pentagon believes \nthis decision is worth the taxpayers' money. I hope our colleagues will \njoin with me in demanding that we get that information before we make a \nmistake that will cost us billions of dollars that we cannot afford to \nwaste.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to change the \norder. My friend from South Carolina, Senator Graham, has allowed me to \ngo. I ask unanimous consent to speak and then to be followed by the \nSenator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4145]]\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I come to the floor today to express \nmy strong support for the Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation \nAct that the Senate is currently considering, legislation that will \nensure our public safety officers are treated with the respect and the \ndignity they unquestionably deserve.\n  I have always believed the first responsibility of government is to \nprotect its citizens. I believe that responsibility begins right here \nat the local level in our neighborhoods and in our communities with our \nlaw enforcement officers. To fulfill that essential responsibility, our \nlocal public safety officers need the support of the Government in \nWashington.\n  Before I came to Washington, like you, I served as a prosecuting \nattorney. I served for 8 years as a chief prosecutor for Minnesota's \nlargest county. During that time, I saw firsthand the critical and \ncourageous contributions our police officers, firefighters, paramedics, \nand our public safety personnel make on a daily basis. I gained an \nunending appreciation for their service in keeping our communities safe \nand secure. When I came to Washington, I made a commitment that I would \nremember the officers I had worked alongside in Minnesota and that I \nwould do everything I could to see that they received the full \nresources and support they deserve.\n  This bill would demonstrate our support by allowing public safety \nofficers to be treated as they should, by promoting basic fairness in \ntheir working standards. It does so in a way that allows States to \nretain the flexibility to craft their own standards to suit their local \nconditions.\n  My State of Minnesota is fortunate to be one of 26 States that \nalready grant collective bargaining rights to their public safety \nemployees. Our police officers, firefighters, and paramedics enjoy \nstrong relationships with the State, counties, and cities that employ \nthem, which enhances their ability to protect the communities they \nserve.\n  When public safety employers and employees work together, it reduces \nworker fatalities and improves the quality of service. We need these \nvaluable partnerships to be at their strongest if we are going to be \nable to properly respond to disasters and emergencies that strike at \nour homeland security.\n  Our State is well aware of this. We have had our share of tragedies \nthis year, from the collapse of the I-35W bridge to the floods in \nsouthern Minnesota in which several people died, to the fires up in \nnorthern Minnesota in the Ham Lake area over through the Canadian \nborder. This week thousands of police officers have come to Washington \nto commemorate National Police Week. I have had an opportunity to meet \nwith these police officers. I had the opportunity to meet with \nparamedics when I was home a week ago. I have had the opportunity to \nsee our firefighters at work. We must respect these hard-working public \nservants. This respect should be fundamental to the work we do.\n  I told these officers and paramedics and firefighters that I would \ncome to the floor to speak in support of this legislation and that I \nwas hopeful our colleagues on the other side of the aisle would join us \nin passing this law. What they want is what they have in our State. \nThey want the right to be treated with the respect of colleagues all \nacross the country. In the last several years, specifically after 9/11, \nwe have placed even greater responsibilities on police and other public \nsafety officers. At a time when State and local budgets are tight, \nthese Federal funds have become more important in assisting local law \nenforcement to fulfill their duties to protect communities. By passing \nthis legislation and guaranteeing the basic rights it provides and \nworking to deliver the full resources and assistance these officers \nneed to continue their exemplary work, we can demonstrate our \nacknowledgment and appreciation for the work they do every day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask to be notified after 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. First, I compliment Senator Warner and Senator Webb for \nseveral weeks ago crafting legislation to provide some changes in our \nGI benefits for educational purposes. I support an alternative measure \nwhich has been developed in the weeks since then, among other things, \nbecause the Defense Department, led by Secretary Gates, has analyzed \nthe requirements that the Defense Department has and has suggested a \ndifferent approach than that originally taken by Senators Warner and \nWebb. That approach is embodied in legislation authored by Senator \nGraham, Senator McCain, Senator Burr, and others. It is S. 2938. I will \ndescribe the key point in a moment, but I was very disappointed an hour \nor so ago when, after Senator Graham had offered this legislation as an \namendment, it was tabled. Our colleagues didn't want to have a vote on \nit. I would think that at least we could have a fair up-or-down vote on \nthe legislation, particularly since it is the approach that has been \nrecommended by Secretary Gates and the Defense Department. I believe it \nis the approach President Bush would prefer. I believe it would solve \nthe problem we are trying to solve.\n  Everybody knows that next week, when the supplemental appropriations \nbill comes before us, the bill that will enable us to fund the troops \nmissions in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Warner-Webb bill will be included \nas a part of that. We will not have an opportunity to try to amend it. \nThat was the purpose of the Senator from South Carolina offering the \namendment today. We have now been foreclosed from voting on that. That \nis not right, especially since this is the superior of the two \napproaches.\n  The key here has to do with the original intent of the GI bill and \ntoday's circumstances. After World War II, when most of the members of \nthe Armed Forces had been drafted, came back from the Pacific and \nEuropean theaters, many of them had been drafted right out of high \nschool or perhaps they were not even in school. They, obviously, saw \nthe importance of getting a college education. A grateful nation said: \nYou have been plucked out of your family circumstance, maybe out of \nhigh school. You were not able to attend college, although some were in \ncollege when they were drafted. We want to pay something back to you \nand send you to college, if you would like to do that. That was the GI \nbenefit.\n  Today the circumstances are much different. We don't have the draft \nanymore. We didn't have millions and millions of servicemen mustered \nout of the service, ready to go to college. Today we have exactly the \nopposite. We need to attract good men and women to serve in our forces, \nand we need to provide them the kind of benefits that are attractive to \nthem in today's world. They are a very different, diverse group of \npeople. The kind of educational benefit likewise needs to respond to \nthat kind of diversity and circumstance. That is the reason this GI \nbill is being modernized and updated.\n  The key point Senator Graham will make and that Secretary Gates has \nmade, as my colleague Senator McCain has said, is that instead of a \ngroup of people who have been mustered out of the service, we aren't \ntrying to get people out of the service. Today we are trying to retain \nfolks, good people who have been educated and trained in the military. \nWe want to have as many of those men and women stay in the military as \npossible.\n  Clearly, recruitment and retention in an all-volunteer force is \ncritical to an effective military. That is what Secretary Gates was \nspeaking of when he said:\n\n       Our first objective is to strengthen the all-volunteer \n     force. Accordingly, it is essential to permit transferability \n     of unused education benefits from servicemembers to family. \n     Transferability supports military families, thereby enhancing \n     retention.\n\n  That is the key difference between these two approaches. I would hope \nthat my colleagues who originally wanted to support an approach that \nSenators Warner and Webb wrote would recognize that there has been an \nimprovement to that in the legislation Senators Graham, Burr, and \nMcCain have offered and would support that alternative which provides \nfor transferability.\n  There are a couple of other differences. I wish to briefly highlight \nthem. The fact that the Warner-Webb\n\n[[Page S4146]]\n\nbill costs more certainly should not be necessarily an argument against \nit, but it certainly should not be an argument for the legislation \neither. If we can deliver the same services in a more efficient way, \nthat is good, not bad. As to that point, one of the other differences \nbetween the legislation of Senator Graham and the previously introduced \nbill is that this recognizes everyone in a fair way, providing the same \nbenefit. It doesn't discriminate against people who attend a less-\nexpensive, State-sponsored school in favor of one who attends a more \nexpensive private school, for example. You have the same kind of \nbenefit. It is an adequate benefit because of the increases provided \nfor in the bill.\n  The bottom line, the reason I strongly support the legislation \nintroduced by my colleagues from South Carolina and from Arizona is \nbecause it responds to today's circumstances, the all-volunteer force, \nwhere we are trying to keep more people in the military as opposed to \nthe other approach, which is an extension of the old GI bill which was \nprovided for people who were leaving the military. That is the key \ndifference and the reason why I urge my colleagues to support the \napproach Senator Graham is providing. I hope, even though we have had \nthis legislation now tabled, that we will have an opportunity to \nactually vote on it in the future. I encourage my colleagues to support \nus in providing an opportunity to vote on the legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Can the Chair let me know when I have 2 minutes \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. How much time does the Senator request?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Fifteen minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 14 minutes remaining. The Senator \nwill be advised when there is 12 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Let's talk about the policy and then the politics. \nEverything seems to be in the case of politics. Most Members of the \nbody would like to pass some legislation this year that would improve \nGI benefits for those who serve and leave and for those who continue to \nserve. Putting this bill, the Webb bill, on the supplemental emergency \nfunding for the war, a mandatory entitlement program put on a \nsupplemental emergency spending bill for the war is not the way to go. \nHaving a supplemental involving spending for the war that can't be \namended is not the way to go. Putting the bill on the firefighter-\npolice officer legislation is not the way to go, but it is the only way \nI had to go. I have sat down with Senator Webb and his staff. I hope we \ncan find common ground. I have never doubted the desire of Senators \nWebb or Warner to increase the benefit. Senator Webb's service to the \ncountry has been extraordinary in combat, as Secretary of the Navy, as \nhas Senator Warner's. Obviously, they have a desire and some expertise \nin this area to upgrade basic GI benefits. I share that desire and hope \nthis body can do something necessary.\n  But as Senator Kyl said, quite frankly, I don't agree with their \napproach. The need is there, but the first thing all of us in this body \nshould do is not compound a problem our current forces have, and that \nis retention. In the name of trying to help recruit people to the \nmilitary, you don't create a benefit that the Congressional Budget \nOffice and the Pentagon say will hurt retention. It makes perfect sense \nto me that the approach of Senators Webb and Warner will hurt \nretention. It is $50-something billion of new spending, and it is all \ngeared to the people who leave the military after 3 years. As Senator \nKyl indicated, this is a different war. Unless we start drafting \npeople, which nobody appears to want, including me, we need to let \nthose who serve and continue to serve know how much we appreciate what \nthey are doing and give them incentives to stay around because every \nperson who will stay in the military to make it a career is a godsend \nto this country because we are being defended by volunteers.\n  So how about this idea? Increase the basic benefit, as Senators \nWarner and Webb have proposed but do it in a way that makes the most \nsense for the entire force. The current amount of money available to \nsomeone who leaves the military after 3 years of service to go to \ncollege is $1,100 a month. That used to be the average cost of a State \ncollege tuition, including room and board. It is now up to $1,500 a \nmonth as an average cost. What we have done in our approach is raise \nthe benefit to $1,500, which is the average cost of a State college, \nroom and board. To me, that is a worthy goal for the Nation to pursue.\n  Senators Webb and Warner have a new formula, a new way of delivering \nbenefits that misses the mark. Instead of paying every GI who leaves \nthe service $1,500 a month, and under our bill $1,000 a year for books \nand fees, what Senator Webb proposes is that you would look at the \nschool, the highest State school, the highest State institution in \nterms of tuition in each State, and the GI would receive the amount of \nmoney that would pay for that school. So in Michigan, the most \nexpensive State school is $13,000. In South Carolina, it is $5,000 or \n$6,000. So based on where you live, you could have a disparity in how \nmuch benefits come to the veteran. I don't think that is the way to go.\n  What we have tried to do is make the benefit that exists today \nreflect the reality of today for those who leave.\n  If somebody wants to go to Harvard or Yale, what we do under the bill \nis we tell the institution, if you will forgive 25 percent of the \ndifference between what the Government pays and the tuition, we will \nput an extra thousand on the table. If you will forgive 50 percent of \nthe indebtedness, we will put more money on the table. If you will \nforgive the entire indebtedness, I think we would go up to like $3,000, \nmaybe $3,500 a month. That way the institution can get over $40,000, \nand the veteran can go to that school without any debt. So we have a \nprogram in the bill to try to get institutions on the higher end, \nprivate schools, to work with veterans to get them through their \ninstitutions and put more money on the table.\n  But the big point I am trying to make is, under our approach, we have \na component not found in the Webb bill that the country needs. Right \nnow the GI benefits that are earned after 3 years of service under the \nWebb approach, $55 billion is spent on that population, not one penny \nof additional incentive to stay around. Do you know what America needs? \nWe need to take care of those who serve and leave because they have \ndone the country a great service. But as a nation, we need to \ndesperately try to retain people who are willing to serve longer. So \nwhat do we do? Senator Burr and myself, Senator McCain, we have \nlistened to the troops. What do the troops want? What do those in \nuniform want from the GI benefit reform? They would like to transfer \ntheir benefits to their spouse or their children.\n  Under our approach, if you stay 6 years, that $1,500-a-month benefit, \nthat $1,000-a-year payment for books and fees, 50 percent of it can be \ntransferred to a spouse or child. That would revolutionize the way this \nbenefit package is being used today. Fifty percent of the people \neligible for GI benefits in today's world never use them. If you could \ntransfer those benefits, it would be a higher utilization, and the \nbenefit would be to the family members of the military member, the ones \nthey love and care about the most. If you will stay in 12 years, at the \n12-year point under our bill, the benefit goes from $1,500 a month to \n$2,000 a month, and you can transfer all of it.\n  Now, what does that mean? That means if you will continue to serve \nour country, at the 12-year point you do not have to worry about your \nkids' ability to go to college anymore. What does that mean? That means \nyour retirement pay has more value. A lot of people are getting out of \nthe military at the 8- and 10-year point because they have a couple \nkids and they wonder: Can I send them to college on a military salary? \nWouldn't it be wonderful to check that block and say: You can stay in \nthe military, get your 20 years, get your retirement, and also have a \nbenefit to pay for your kids' college that will not come out of your \nretired pay? This will revolutionize retention.\n  The CBO says for every $10,000 of educational benefit increase, you \nlose a percent in retention. Under the Webb approach, we would lose 8 \nto 9 percent a year in retention, at a time we need to retain more.\n\n[[Page S4147]]\n\n  Under our approach, not only are we going to give more money to those \nwho serve and leave--a very generous benefit--we are also going to put \nmoney on the table for the first time in the history of the GI program \nto reward those who stay. Most people who serve 20 years are going to \ncome out with a college degree they earned in the military without ever \nusing their benefits. The ability to transfer the benefit to a family \nmember is enormous. Again, it will allow the retired pay--of those who \ngo to 20 years--to have much more bang for the buck. They will have \ntheir college paid for.\n  When I talk to people in the Guard and Reserve and Active Forces, \nthey tell me they would love to have the ability to transfer their GI \nbenefits once they get their degree to a spouse or a child.\n  It would help retention. It would help families. It is, in my \nopinion, the best bang for the taxpayer buck.\n  Now, where are we going to go? Here is what is going to happen.\n  Madam President, how much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes more before his 2-\nminute warning. The Senator has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, thank you.\n  We have a choice to make as a body. We can find some middle ground \nand pass a bill that 100 people would vote for or we can put the Webb \namendment on the supplemental in its current form without any changes, \ntable my bill, and say: Go off in the corner and be quiet. Well, that \n``ain't'' going to happen. I am not going to be quiet. I am going to \nurge the President to veto the Webb bill in its current form because no \nmatter how well-intended it is, it will hurt retention. It will hurt \nretention at a time, as a nation, when we need to enhance retention.\n  I have a different approach, and I think it makes sense. But I am \nwilling to meet people in the middle. I am not going to be put in a box \nof having to vote no and be accused of not caring. Well, I have another \napproach. I think it serves the country well. I am willing to meet in \nthe middle. I hope we can find some middle ground. At the end of the \nday, helping veterans and rewarding those who serve is a shared value--\nnot a Democratic value. It is a shared value by all Americans: \nRepublicans, Independents, and Democrats.\n  Two things are important to the American people at a time of national \ncrisis, at a time of a two-front war. Let's come together and help \nthose who are willing to put on the uniform. Count me in for increasing \nthe benefits for those who serve 3 years and leave. You have done your \ncountry a great service. I want to make sure you have money to go to \ncollege, that you are well rewarded for your service.\n  But work with me to do something for those who continue to serve. \nReward them. That has never been done before in the GI bill. It is time \nfor the GI bill to change. It is time to have money on the table to \nreward those families and military members who stay around and keep \ngoing back and keep fighting. If you want to help the military, the men \nand women in uniform who decide to make this a career, allow their \nbenefits to be transferred to their loved ones, allow military members \nwho serve for 12 years and beyond a chance to send their kids to \ncollege with GI benefits and not have to use their retirement.\n  So I look forward to this debate. It is going to be a chance to do \nsome good or it is going to be politics as usual. Well, that is a \ndecision we are all going to have to make. I hope we can do the country \nsome good. To me, the best thing we can do for the country and for \nthose men and women who serve--and continue to serve--is to do \nsomething new, something long overdue and new; that is, to allow them \nto transfer their benefits to their family members. That will help \nretention. It will reward those families who sacrifice alongside the \nservicemember. I have talked with enough family members to know how \nmuch this would change and help improve family life in the military.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I thank the Presiding Officer and I thank \nmy colleague, Senator Graham, and I really do thank my colleagues from \nboth sides of the aisle who have come to the floor and talked about the \nGI bill and the fact that we were asleep for a number of years from the \nstandpoint of making changes in the law that reflect the cost of \neducation.\n  But what I want my colleagues to understand and the public to \nunderstand is that the Department of Defense used what we call \neducation kickers to provide retention tools for our Active-Duty \ntroops. Throughout this whole period, as they saw promising service men \nand women and they wanted them to stay in the military, they used what \nwe call education kickers. They upped the amount of their education \nbenefit if they would re-up for a period of time--3 years, 5 years, 6 \nyears.\n  So to say that $1,100 was the ceiling, that is not accurate. The fact \nis, we have reached a point in time when we need to change the number \nin the law, what the base amount is that is the promise this country is \nmaking to our service men and women when they serve. I think it is \nappropriate, given we have gone through a decade--and I am sure most \nAmericans would not find this hard to believe--where the highest area \nof inflation in America over the last 10 years has not been health \ncare. It has been higher education. For any parent who is going through \nhigher education with a child today, they know exactly what that \nmeans--that it costs a whole lot to go there.\n  Senator Webb deserves a lot of credit because for 18 months he has \ntalked about changing our financial level of commitment. I have to say \nthat has been healthy for the men and women who are serving. It has \nbeen healthy for this Senate to begin the debate on it. I do not want \nanybody to leave this debate and feel we are not both headed in the \nsame direction. It is just that I have some fundamental disagreements \nwith the way he structured it.\n  I believe there is a way to fulfill the promise, that if you serve, \nthen we are going to commit to you, we are going to provide you with a \nquality education. When my dad came back from the Second World War, he \nhad most of his education paid for before he left, but this is not \nsomething he went out and shopped. This is not something where he said: \nGee, there is a benefit. Let me find the most expensive place I can go, \nand let me exercise it there. He focused on what he wanted to be and \nwhere the tools were that were available to him.\n  Sometimes we have to stop for a minute and reflect: What are the \nunintended consequences of what we do in this body? Well, one thing \nwith the Webb bill is we disregard the fact that part of higher \neducation comes out of the Department of Education today. It is called \nPell grants. For those service men and women who qualify for them, that \ngoes toward their education. The way this bill is written, we pay for \ntheir education, and the Pell grant, if they qualify--which most \nwould--is then available for them after their education to pocket as \ncash. I am not sure that is the promise we made. I am not sure it is \nthe promise the American people are committed to fulfill. I am not sure \nit is what our service men and women expect. They want an education.\n\n  What we have done is we have structured an alternative, the Grahamm-\nBurr-McCain bill, that provides exactly that. It is targeted at the \naverage of the cost of public education in America. Now, fundamentally, \nI do not believe a student who picks an art and design school in the \nState of Michigan should be entitled to $13,000 for that school. Yet if \nhe chooses the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, then he is \nonly going to get $5,300.\n  Why is there a discrepancy in those two schools? Because States \nsubsidize higher education at a different level because it is a State \ndecision. It is State money that is used to subsidize higher education. \nIn North Carolina, we choose to subsidize higher education to the tune \nof 70 percent. We do not expect every State to choose to subsidize it \nat that level.\n  But by the same token, why would we create a program that \ndisenfranchises North Carolina, that says to North Carolina: Oh, boy, \nyou are going to be cheated because you subsidize higher education so \nthat more of your kids can have an affordable option. And because now \nthe Federal Government\n\n[[Page S4148]]\n\nwould have paid everything, you are going to lose money because you \nsubsidize higher education. Unintended consequence: We are going to \nchase States out of the business of subsidizing higher education.\n  What is the net effect? Every kid in America who does not serve 3 \nyears Active Duty, cumulative, is going to pay more because States are \nnot going to subsidize. I am not sure that is what we are after. I \nsurely do not suggest that is the intent of Senator Webb's legislation. \nIt is what will happen if, in fact, we pass the legislation.\n  So Senator Graham and I and Senator McCain looked for: How do we take \nthe existing system--not create a new one; this is not a wheel that is \nbroken; it works, but let's fund it at today's funding needs.\n  Now, Senator Graham covered a lot of things that are in the bill. For \nan Active-Duty servicemember who serves 3 years Active Duty, we are \ngoing to provide $1,500 in living expense and tuition every month as a \nbenefit. We are going to provide $1,000 for books and fees a year. For \nthat individual who stays in the military over 6 years, 50 percent of \nthe education benefit they accrue is transferable to a family member: a \nspouse or child. If a servicemember chooses to serve for 12 years or \nmore, 100 percent of their GI education benefit is now transferable to \na spouse or a child.\n  I think it is safe to say that for most who make a career out of the \nmilitary, they have numerous opportunities to enhance their academic \nachievements on Active Duty. So the likelihood is a 20-year veteran of \nour services probably has all the education they need, and they have a \nhuge education benefit. I cannot think of a better reward to people who \nhave served their country than to say: Let's make this benefit \navailable so you can educate your children. Let them choose the States \nthat highly subsidize so they get more bang for their buck.\n  Senator Graham covered the fact that we put the responsibility for \nprivate schools to fill the gap on the private schools. We say to an \ninstitution: Do you know what. You are willing to retire debt for low-\nincome Americans today. Well, let's see what type of commitment you are \ngoing to make for veterans, people who are part of the GI program.\n  Senator Webb's bill says to the school, Harvard, Yale, Duke, schools \nthat have $35,000 tuitions: Do you know what. We are only paying $5,000 \nin North Carolina, so, Duke, if you get one of these, that $20,000-some \ndifference--$25,000, $30,000 difference--for every dollar you put in, \nthe Federal Government is going to put in.\n  What I say, in the legislation, to Duke is: All right. We are putting \n$14,400 in the pot for that GI. The difference is indebtedness at the \nend of his career. If you are willing to retire 25 percent of it, then \nwe are going to put an extra $1,000 in the pot. If you are willing to \nretire 50 percent, we are putting $2,000 in the pot. If you are willing \nto retire 100 percent of the debt, we are going to put more money into \nthe pot. We are not going dollar for dollar because I do not think that \nis our responsibility. There has to be a side of the academic \ninstitutions that is willing to also recognize the service of our men \nand women in uniform.\n  We were denied the opportunity to have a vote on a piece of \nlegislation earlier today. It is a rule of the Senate that you can \noffer a motion to table an amendment. What does tabling an amendment \nmean? It means we were denied the opportunity to vote on a real \neducation package for our service men and women.\n  What is the reason somebody would do that? Well, fear that we were \ngoing to win. Fear that enough Members would look at it and vote for it \non the merits of the legislation, that we would win. What is the \nlikelihood we are going to have an opportunity to offer our amendment? \nProbably none. Because the Webb amendment is going to be masked in an \nemergency supplemental that is going to be made up of war funding, \nfunding that most Members--this one has no idea what other earmarked \nprograms Members of the Senate are going to stick in it or the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I would say to my colleagues, we ought to vote against the entire \npackage, except for war funding. We ought to come to the floor. We \nought to have a side by side: the Webb bill, the Graham bill. We ought \nto debate it on the merits, but we ought to take into account the needs \nof our military. To ignore retention, to ignore the tools the military \nneeds to make sure our Nation is secure and strong, is absolutely \nignorant. Now, it may be before it is over we are able to influence the \nauthors of the other legislation to put transferability in theirs. But \nI have to say to my colleagues that the structure is fundamentally \nflawed.\n\n  I am the ranking member of the Veterans Affairs' Committee. \nCurrently, the GI bill is administered partly out of DOD, partly out of \nthe Department of Education, partly out of the Veterans' \nAdministration. We have a Veterans' Administration today that is \nchallenged to process the amount of disability claims, the appeals to \ndisability claims, the appeals to medical services that are delivered. \nNow we are saying let's create a big new program and let's dump it in \nthe Veterans' Administration and let's ask them to run it. How \nincredibly insensitive to the work that is currently going on but how \ninsensitive to the needs of our veterans who are injured--those who \ncome back from Iraq and Afghanistan, those who transition out of Active \nDuty to veteran status who need a Veterans' Administration that is 100 \npercent focused on the delivery of health care, the processing of \ndisability claims, and making sure every veteran is matched with a \ncheck that they need for their livelihood.\n  Now we are going to say: But we want you to now run education. We \nwant to take the Department of Education out of it. We want to take DOD \nout of it. We want the Veterans' Administration to be responsible.\n  Millions and millions, hundreds of millions of dollars is going to be \nneeded to administer this program, hundreds of millions of dollars. \nForget the fact that to write the regulations out of a new agency is \nprobably going to take well over a year. That is why the Webb bill is \nnot proposed to start for some time after this body passes it.\n  I am sure we are going to have ample time to talk about the education \nbenefit for our military members. I am not sure we are going to have an \nopportunity to have a choice. I am convinced people asked me to come \nhere and serve to represent North Carolina to make sure we have a \nchoice, and that it wasn't a choice between something and nothing, but \nthat it was a choice between something and something. Every Member of \nthe Senate--100 Members--should have the opportunity to come to this \nfloor and to offer what they think is the solution to a problem. Not on \nthis. We tried to do it because we didn't think we would get an \nopportunity, and instead of getting an up-or-down vote on a very \nimportant piece of legislation that provides and extends and revamps \nthe GI education benefit for our military, it was decided that we were \nall going to have the opportunity to table consideration. I am not sure \nthat is why we were all elected to be here. I think to some degree it \nshows what is worse about the institution that we are not willing to \ntackle.\n  This is the institution of great debate, and when we have big issues, \nwe run from the debate, hoping that the American people aren't looking, \nhoping that nobody will read about what we have done, that nobody will \nsee the missed opportunity. I will tell my colleagues, our service men \nand women aren't going to miss this one. It is not going to be over \nwith a simple tabling vote. This is something that will continue to \neducate the American people and, more importantly, the men and women \nwho put on a uniform and never ask why but go exactly where our \nCommander in Chief asks them to go.\n  I urge my colleagues to pay very special attention as we go through \nthe debate on this legislation. Ask yourself not only is it right, ask \nyourself are the consequences of what we do the consequences that we \nwould want to have happen. If there are unintended consequences to \nthis, the general public of young people who are looking at higher \neducation as an absolute necessity of their livelihood in the future \nare disenfranchised in some way by this. If servicemembers aren't \nallowed to extend an education benefit to their children or to their \nspouse, and it just goes away, have we really done our job? I think the \nanswer is going to be no.\n  So I encourage the leadership in the majority to give us an \nopportunity to\n\n[[Page S4149]]\n\nhave a fair up-or-down vote. Give us the opportunity to compare two \npieces of legislation. Nobody should be scared to do that. Let America \ndecide based upon their representatives in the Senate which one better \nfulfills the promise we have made to the men and women who serve but, \nmore importantly, what upholds the structure of higher education in \nthis country and doesn't disenfranchise or disadvantage any student now \nor in the future.\n  I am convinced we can only achieve that if we recognize a benefit \nthat is uniform and equal across the board, not one that is determined \nby where you choose to go to school, not a benefit that is determined \nby where you choose to live, but a benefit that fulfills every promise \nthat we are going to provide an education and put some degree of \nindividual responsibility on how that is exercised. I am convinced that \nfor those who may choose a community college versus a 4-year \nuniversity, the savings they have should be savings they extend to \ntheir children and to their spouse.\n  That would not happen under the current Webb bill; it will just go \naway. They will miss out on that opportunity. They will never know that \nunless we are willing to have a debate on this floor. They are never \ngoing to know it unless we are provided the opportunity to present them \nwith a choice between something and something versus something and \nnothing.\n  I thank the Chair for the time extended to me.\n  At this time I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak \nin morning business for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the question of updating GI bill \neducation benefits for our veterans and service personnel is something \nthat we need to do. I think all of us agree on that. I have to say that \nhow we do it, however, is very important.\n  The Webb-Warner bill, as written, fails in some very important ways, \nways that make it poor legislation. We need to be honest about that.\n  I believe the bill offered by Senators McCain, Burr, and Graham is \nmuch better legislation. Frankly, I thank Senator McCain for having the \ngumption to stand up and see the problems with this legislation. He \nsaid he knew it was important and he was willing to take some political \nheat here to try to do the right thing.\n  Let me read you what the Congressional Budget Office has said about \nthis legislation.\n  This is what they say about retention. We heard that in remarks from \nsome Senators earlier, but retention deals with how many people re-up \nand decide after their initial tour of duty is up to make a longer--a \nnew commitment to stay in the military for a longer period or even make \nit a career. We are in a career military, and I could not be more proud \nof them. They are performing so exceptionally well. No person who has \nbeen around the military for a few years would ever want to go back to \nthe system we had before. This one is working surprisingly well, beyond \nour expectations. And even in this war where if you reenlist you are \nlikely to be sent abroad, retention continues to be very high.\n  What will this bill do? According to the Congressional Budget Office, \nS. 22, as amended, would, in effect, result in ``a 16-percent decline \nin the reenlistment rate.'' I am telling you, those of us who have been \nwatching the reenlistment rate as members of the Armed Services \nCommittee--and I have been on that committee since I have been in the \nSenate, and I know the Presiding Officer, Senator Pryor, is on that \ncommittee and knows these issues--reenlistment is critical. This Webb \namendment has the perverse effect of paying people to leave the \nmilitary. We should not do that. We should create incentives as the \nBurr-McCain-Graham bill does. It encourages people to stay in and gives \neven more rewards if they stay in and their family more rewards if they \nstay in. That is the right thing for us to do. I wanted to mention that \npoint.\n  I am also troubled by how the money is allocated. We have done a \ncalculation. The way it is set up under the Webb amendment, if a person \nwere to take advantage of this GI bill benefit under his provision, a \nUniversity of Alabama student could receive $13,569 per year and a \nstudent at Auburn University would receive $13,355 a year, but a \nstudent at the University of Michigan would receive $22,413. That is an \n$8,000 difference. That is a lot. Is this what we want to do? I don't \nknow what they would give somebody who is an Arkansas Razorback. They \nwould probably give them less than that. No, that is a great \nuniversity. I don't see any need for me to be supportive of a bill that \nis going to discriminate that much between State universities. In fact, \nif the McCain legislation were to pass, students at Alabama and Auburn \nwould receive an additional $400 and $500 under his bill. It would be \nmore generous to students in my State under the McCain bill.\n  I say to my colleagues, I think Senator Webb and others who supported \nthis legislation are on the right track. It is time for us to improve \nthe GI bill benefits for our soldiers and their families. We can do \nthat. We ought to put some money in it. I understand our budget is \ntight, but I am prepared to vote some resources to improve this idea. \nBut I do not believe we should ever consider--please understand--ever \nconsider setting a policy that would essentially encourage and pay \npeople through subsidies to leave the military. We ought to create \neducational benefit programs that affirm them, affirm their families, \nas they make the military a career. That is what our current \ninvolvement is.\n  Before I yield the floor, I will say that is why I have chosen to not \nsupport the Webb approach and have chosen to support the McCain \napproach. I think it is preferable.\n  I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have tried very hard. I was here a few \nhours ago when the Senate opened, congratulating the Senate for moving \nforward on a very important bill for firefighters and police. I guess \nmy expectations were far too high. I thought we were going to legislate \nand finish this bill. It is a bill that is so important.\n  I had the opportunity after the log had been thrown in the road to \nspeak with the head of the firefighters union. I don't run from \norganized labor. I think it is important that we recognize the good \nthey do in the country, and no one can dispute the work that \nfirefighters do. I talked with Mr. Schneeberger and told him I don't \nknow if we can do this bill; it appears Republicans don't want to do \nit. They have offered a mini GI bill of rights. Of course, we have been \ndelayed. That is very unfortunate.\n  I hope Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi can work something out to \ncomplete the bill in a very short period of time. We have done about \nthe best we can.\n  I spoke with Senator Enzi last night--I don't know what time it was--\n4:30, 5 o'clock. I asked if he wanted votes last night. He said no \nbecause he didn't get the work done in committee that he wanted and he \nhad some work to get done on this bill. I accepted that. I said fine.\n  I was hoping we would do more today. We tried to get a vote on an \namendment and could not get agreement to get a vote on an amendment. So \nat this stage, we are going to see if we can invoke cloture on this \nbill. If it doesn't work, it is just another bill the Republicans \nbrought down.\n  Mr. President, I said this morning, is it any wonder that three \nspecial elections held for House seats have gone to Democrats in \ndistricts where no one expected a Democrat to win? The reason is \nbecause the American people are seeing what is going on here. They see \nwhat is going on at 16th and Pennsylvania Avenue, and it is down here \nnow\n\n[[Page S4150]]\n\nwhere we cannot do anything, nothing. Mr. President, 71 or 72 \nfilibusters. I don't know how many we are at. We are moving up the \nroad. Is it any wonder that a poll came out yesterday in the Washington \nPost saying that the American people believe Democrats in Congress are \n21 percent better able to handle the problems of this country than \nRepublicans? It is no wonder.\n  In spite of that, in spite of 7 years and almost 5 months for \nPresident Bush, I still would like to work for the next 7 months with \nhim to try to get things done. I would hope he would pick up the phone \nsometime and call down here and maybe help us get Federal aviation \nreauthorization done, just as an example. That is fresh in my mind \nbecause that was legislatively killed last week.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on H.R. 980, the \n     Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act.\n         Harry Reid, Edward M.

Carper, Sheldon Whitehouse, Barbara A. \n           Mikulski, Blanche L. Lincoln, Amy Klobuchar, \n           Christopher J. Dodd, Tom Harkin, Richard Durbin.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am here today to speak in support of the \nPublic Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act of 2007, for which I am \na proud cosponsor. While the vast majority of private and public \nemployees enjoy the right to bargain collectively, thousands of our \npublic safety employees across the country are denied this basic \nAmerican right. If enacted, this bill would provide our public safety \nworkers with the right to negotiate for the level of pay and benefits \nthey deserve.\n  Every day, we rely on the service of these men and women, who risk \ntheir lives to provide safety and protection to our communities. Yet \nmany States and local governments deny these workers the right to \norganize. It is not fair, and it should not be tolerated.\n  Those who oppose providing public safety employees these fundamental \nrights claim that the legislation will interfere with existing State \nand local laws that govern collective bargaining. This is simply false. \nThe legislation ensures that existing collective bargaining units and \nagreements that have already been issued, approved, or ratified at the \nState or local level would be maintained. Additionally, this \nlegislation prohibits strikes and work slowdowns by public safety \nofficers and labor unions, as well as lockouts by public safety \nemployers, ensuring that the safety of the public will not be \ncompromised as a result of a work stoppage.\n  This legislation enjoys broad bipartisan support. Introduced by \nSenators Kennedy and Gregg, there are 34 cosponsors, including 11 \nRepublicans. The House version of the bill passed by a vote of 314 to \n97, supported by a majority in both parties.\n  It took a national tragedy in the form of the terrorist attacks of 9/\n11 to remind us all of the critical role public safety officers play in \nour lives. Hundreds gave their lives that day, and hundreds more give \ntheir life in service each year, to ensure our safety and to protect us \nfrom danger. It is inexcusable that workers so dedicated to keeping \nAmerica safe should be denied the basic and fundamental right to \norganize.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and to stop denying \nour firefighters, our police, and all of our first responders the right \nto organize.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 2419\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to shift gears now and express my \nappreciation to lots of different people.\n  I mentioned briefly this morning my congratulations to Senator \nHarkin, Senator Chambliss, Senator Baucus, and Senator Grassley, but \nthere are other team members who worked so hard to get this most \nimportant bill done, the most important bill being the farm bill.\n  We only do a farm bill every 5 years. There are some who say it took \nus 5 years to get this bill done. That is really not the case, but we \nworked on it for a long time, worked very hard.\n  I mentioned in my caucus yesterday that this was an example of how we \nshould legislate because we had conferences. We have been kind of \ngetting out of the habit of having a public conference where Democrats \nand Republicans are appointed and sit down and try to work out the \ndifferences on a bill. That is what they did here. I think it was \nexemplary legislative work.\n  Was there any side that was more right than the other side? No. But \nthey worked together to come up with a fine piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate now proceed to the \nconference report to accompany H.R. 2419, the farm bill, and during \ntoday's session there be 5 hours of debate--remember, this farm bill \ndeals with food, it deals with energy, and it deals with security--with \nthe time equally divided and controlled between the leaders or their \ndesignees; and when the Senate resumes the conference report tomorrow \nthere be an additional 90 minutes of debate divided in the same manner; \nfurther, that if any motions to waive are made in response to points of \norder, then these votes occur in the order in which they were made \nprior to the vote on adoption of the conference report on Thursday; \nthat on Thursday, upon the yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to \nvote on adoption of the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENZI. Reserving the right to object, until I get 5 minutes to \nrebut a little bit of what the leader said about the collective \nbargaining bill. I do not need much time, but I was cut out of the \nprocess earlier today and I deserve the opportunity.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend can have all the time he wants--10 \nminutes?\n  Mr. ENZI. Ten will be plenty. I appreciate it.\n  Mr. REID. How about doing this then? We will go ahead and have this \napproved, and you do 10 minutes or however much time you want?\n  Mr. ENZI. That would be part of the unanimous consent? Do I \nunderstand that under the unanimous consent I would get my 10 minutes \nbefore the farm bill.\n  Mr. REID. You would get it as soon as the consent is granted--right \nnow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before my friend starts, I have said \npublicly, I have told him privately--we do not have a Senator, Democrat \nor Republican, who is easier to get along with and who is a better \nlegislator than Mike Enzi. He is a very fine man, and I am sorry he was \ncut off.\n  There will also be no more votes today as a result of this unanimous-\nconsent agreement.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I appreciate the leader's kind remarks. I \nhave been diligently working on the collective bargaining bill. It is \nan important part of the process to get the full debate out. We are \nbeing precluded from that process now.\n  We have had three amendments brought up. None of those were mine. I \nhave five amendments that I would like to have debated that address \nwhat\n\n[[Page S4151]]\n\nI see as serious flaws in the bill, but I am being precluded from even \nbringing up one of those. I was given the offer, take it or leave it, \nthat there could be two Republican amendments, period, and I could \ndecide from among my own and others which would be the two.\n  As I pointed out at the very beginning of this bill, this bill is \nflawed. It did not go to committee. This happens every time a bill does \nnot go to committee. We have a process with bills before the committee \nwhere people can sit down and look at amendments and revise the \namendments until there is agreement between the two sides. That is the \nonly reason that a committee such as Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions can get bills done.\n  We often take a look at all of the amendments when they are in \ncommittee and decide that we will work on those before they go to the \nfloor. Otherwise, as contentious a committee as we have, which handles \nthe volume of work it does, we would get nothing done. But we get a lot \ndone. In fact, last week when we were at the signing with the President \nof one of the bills we passed, the President said: You know, you are \nthe only committee sending us any bills. It is because we go through \nthe whole process.\n  Usually Senator Kennedy and I sit down, we list our principles, we \nagree on the principles, we plug in some details, and then we talk with \nthe stakeholders. That is everybody with an interest in it. Usually at \nthat point there is someone who says: No, we have one provision we have \nworked on for 12 years, and we never have gotten that provision. And \nuntil we get that provision, we don't care about the rest of the bill. \nWhoever's constituent it is, Senator Kennedy or I, we take the lead on \nit and say: You know, you have been asking for it for 12 years and you \ngot nothing. How would you like to get the other 80 percent that you \nalso claim you like? That is the way we do bills. It is working to get \ncommon ground, which is a third way.\n  There are so many issues around here that have been polarized, so the \nsecond they come up people jump into the weeds. They talk about a \nlittle glitch here or there that irritated people in the past and that \ngets us nowhere. So we have been able to elevate that to coming up with \na third way to achieve the same thing, the same principles we agreed \non.\n  This bill didn't go through any of that process. We just slammed \nright over here to the floor of the Senate and then they are surprised \nat the result, that we want to do a few amendments. I saw the House \nbill, and then I saw the negotiations with some of the Senate people \nfrom our side on some amendments that they thought were critical. A lot \nof those didn't get in at all, even though I think a few of them \nthought they were in there. They are not in there. That is what I am \nbringing up--what were good ideas that ought to be contained in this \nkind of a bill so the rhetoric we have had so far actually winds up \nmeeting what is in the bill.\n  That is our job. It is really supposed to come out doing what we said \nit would do. This bill does not do what the chairman said it would do. \nThis bill doesn't say what the Republican cosponsors said it would do. \nIt could be clarified. It is not easy to clarify it when we are out on \nthe Senate floor. It is difficult to do out here because it is more of \na take it or leave it. In fact, that is what I was offered: take it or \nleave it on getting two amendments. What kind of a choice is that? I \nhave five germane amendments and many other germane amendments have \nalso been filed and offered. But, of course, I will have to get \nunanimous consent to bring up my amendments later if at all. Unanimous \nconsent is not the easiest thing to get around here, particularly when \nit starts getting into this little friction area.\n\n  I want to comment on the 71 filibusters. I suspect the two motions \nthat were just filed count as two more filibusters. What they are is \ntwo more attempts to protect the rights of the minority. We have a \nright, just as that side did when they were in the minority, to bring \nup amendments. They protected their right, and we are protecting our \nright.\n  You heard one of the cosponsors of the collective bargaining bill \nmake those same comments earlier today when the big discussion happened \non the amendment that was put on the other side of the tree. He voted \nnot to table that because he respects the rights of the minority. That \nis what has always had to happen around here.\n  I have to tell you, on filibusters, one of the reasons we get \nfilibusters is because there is still a Presidential campaign going on \non one side of the aisle, and that means two of our Members are not \nhere except in unusual circumstances. So the way it has to happen is, \non Monday when we come in we vote on a cloture motion. It is not \nlegislation that necessarily needs a cloture motion because a lot of \nthose have been passed 98 to 0, 96 to 0, maybe 95 to 1. That is nowhere \nnear a filibuster. But that allows us--that forces us into a situation \nwhere, for the next 30 hours, we debate whether to debate. That way, by \nWednesday the candidates can show up so there is enough of a vote to \nagree to some of the amendments that go on there. So part of it is a \ntactical procedure being used by the majority, who still has a primary \ngoing on in their Presidential race, to assure they will have the votes \nthere when the time comes.\n  You can see this is 51 to 49, so if two people don't show up on that \nside, it is 49 to 49 and that gives the Vice President a chance to \nvote. So far he has always voted with me. So that gives the minority a \nwin, and I understand that.\n  But I do not stand for being blamed for all of those cloture motions \nthat have been put out here. Some of those have been to protect the \nmajority as a majority. They need to take credit for those instead of \nblaming us for it.\n  This is a kind of do-nothing Congress. If it were not for bills \ncoming out of this committee there wouldn't be a lot of bills passing \nout here, but a lot of the failed bills come from skipping the process \nand coming right to the floor, like the immigration bill. The way to \nget things done is take them through committee and then we don't need \nto do as many amendments on the Senate floor.\n  In fact, if you check back on the bills Senator Kennedy and I worked \non, it is very unusual for us to have an amendment on the floor. And \nthey usually pass unanimously here and in the House. That is how they \nget to the President. There is not a conference committee involved in \nit. We have already preconferenced with the House and found out what \ntheir potential objections were with the House and worked it out. But \nnot on this bill. On this bill what we said--not we said; they said--\nyou know, the policemen and the firemen are going to be in DC for this \nbig memorial event this week. We ought to time it so we can really put \nthe crush on the Republicans.\n  I have to give you congratulations for that. It would not be enough \njust to recognize the tremendous sacrifices these people make and the \ndifficult jobs they have. No, we can make some points against the \nRepublicans because they may want to make sure Government still works \nwhen we are done with the process.\n  There are a lot of people commenting that there are some problems \nwith this bill. The mayor of New York City--that is a State that \nrequires collective bargaining--sent us a letter that said: Don't pass \nthis bill. This will affect the way that we do business. It is not a \none-sided thing, but I tell you, when it gets one-sided, nothing \nhappens and that is kind of the process we are in.\n  I am going to be asking people to vote with me against the cloture \nmotion because I have not been able to bring up my amendments. I \nhaven't been able to get votes on the other side.\n  That has an interesting little twist to it too. We have four \namendments: three that are germane--those are the three the Republicans \nput in, which means they relate to the bill--and one offered by Senator \nLeahy that is actually a reauthorization bill on some grant money. It \ndoesn't relate to this bill, but I am willing to have votes on all four \nof them. I am willing to accept the Leahy amendment and get it done. \nBut there will be objections to that because he chairs the committee \nthat handles judges, and we were promised three circuit court judges \nbefore Memorial Day. As I understand it, tomorrow morning there is a \nmarkup around here that does not have a single circuit court judge on \nit, which means that deadline cannot be met.\n  So, again, protecting minority rights, there are some people on the\n\n[[Page S4152]]\n\nRepublican side who are saying if they are not going to follow their \nword, we are not going to follow--The Senator from Vermont then says: \nIf they are not going to take my amendment, then I am not going to \nallow the other three to be voted on. That happened earlier today.\n  There is plenty of blame to go around. But to stick it on any one \nparty is the wrong thing to do. And to proclaim that we really want to \nhave this bill done without taking it through the regular process is a \nmisnomer--and I need to have my rights--and I appreciate this time to \nspeak. The majority leader was very kind in that. I appreciate the way \nhe let us at least work for a day, an interrupted day and a partial day \nat that, before the cloture motion went into effect.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/14/senate-section/article/S4152-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4152-S4172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      FOOD CONSERVATION, AND ENERGY ACT OF 2008--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The conference report will be stated.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2419), to provide for the continuation of agricultural \n     programs for fiscal year 2012, and for other purposes, having \n     met, have agreed that the House recede from its disagreement \n     to the amendment of the Senate and agree to the same with an \n     amendment, and the Senate agree to the same. Signed by a \n     majority of the conferees on the part of both Houses.\n\n  The conference report is printed in the proceedings of the House in \nthe Record of May 13, 2008.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, here we are, finally after a long year \nand a half. That is how long I have been chairman. Of course, my friend \nand ranking member was chairman before that, actually started the farm \nbill when he was chairman. So I guess we can say after about 2 years we \nare finally here with this farm bill on the floor for final passage and \nready to send to the President.\n  It has been a long road to get to this point. But it has been a road \nI have had good friends to travel with, good colleagues to travel with. \nWe have had a few bumps along the way, but through it all, we have come \nhere on the floor of the Senate with a strong, good farm bill, and it \ncame from the House today with a strong 318 votes. So the House has \npassed a conference report with 318 votes this afternoon.\n  As I said, some people call it a farm bill. Here is the title of it: \nthe Food, Conservation and Energy Act of 2008. Food, Conservation, and \nEnergy Act. We do not have ``farm'' in it. Farm is subsumed under food \nand conservation and energy, because all three of those apply to our \nfarmers today. So we have a bill here, a Food, Conservation, and Energy \nAct, passed with bipartisan votes in the House.\n  We have a coalition of over 500 farm, conservation, nutrition, \nconsumer, and religious groups all together supporting this bill.\n  This is my seventh farm bill, counting my time in the House of \nRepresentatives and my time here in the Senate. I have never seen a \nfarm bill in all of those years with this much broad support. As I \nsaid, over 500 farm, conservation, religious groups, antihunger groups, \nconsumer groups, all are supporting this bill.\n  This is a food bill. Why do I say that? Because $10.4 billion of new \nspending in this bill, every single penny of the new money allocated to \nour committee by the Finance Committee on this side, the Ways and Means \nCommittee on the House side, every single penny of that $10 billion was \nput into nutrition, plus another $400 million, $10.4 billion.\n  Now, with the changes to nutrition program included in this bill, 67 \npercent of all of the spending in this bill goes to nutrition; 67 \npercent. Then I will talk on why we call it a conservation and energy \nbill in a few minutes. But let's talk about the food aspect of this.\n  In the last dozen years, we have seen a steady erosion of the food \nsafety net for our low-income families. Let me point to the standard \ndeduction in the Food Stamp Program. This chart indicates what has \nhappened. In 1996, the standard deduction--that is the deduction you \ntake to see if you qualify as a family to get food stamps. In 1996 it \nwas $134 a month. That was frozen in 1996. It has not moved since. It \nremains $134 to this day for the vast majority of families. But think \nof all of the increases low-income families now have to pay: higher \nenergy prices, higher food prices. Everything else has gone up. So you \nwonder why so many people have fallen through the safety net of having \nan adequate supply of food? It is because we froze it in 1996. Twelve \nyears later now, it has not moved. Now we have increased everything \nelse around here for everybody in 12 years but not for low-income \nAmericans. This Congress--I do not mean this Congress, but I mean all \nof these Congresses--we have not met our responsibility to low-income \nAmericans. We finally do it in this farm bill.\n  If the standard deduction in 1996 of $134 had kept pace with \ninflation, it would be $188 today rather than $134. Well, we could not \ngo as high as $188, so we went to $144. So now we have increased the \nstandard deduction of $144 a month. But the single most important thing \nis we have indexed it for inflation in the future. No more will we have \nan erosion because of inflation that hurts our lowest income families \nin America. So that is the important thing. We have indexed it for the \nfuture.\n  Secondly, the asset level. Under current law a family can have no \nmore than $2,000 in assets and still qualify for food stamps. We did \nnot raise it in this bill, but we indexed that also for the future. So \nwe have two indexes here for the future; one on the standard deduction \nand one on the asset level.\n  For the first time ever, we exclude retirement and education savings \nfrom counting against the asset limit. Here I give accolades to my \ncolleague from Georgia, Senator Chambliss. It was his intervention that \nprovided that low-income seniors do not have to dip into their \nretirement savings to meet their food needs. If they are temporarily \nout of a job, for example, but they have retirement savings, they can \nstill qualify for food assistance and they will not have to dip into \nthat savings. Again, I compliment my colleague from Georgia for \nfighting hard for that.\n  We also did something on childcare costs. Here again is something we \nhave not kept up with, and it hurts our low-income families. Right now \nthe childcare deduction is $175 a month. It has been there since 1993. \nThink about childcare costs since 1993. It has been $175 ever since \nthen. Right now the average cost of childcare per month is $631 \naverage. We only allow $175 for food stamp recipients to qualify. So \nthere is a $456 a month gap and it is growing.\n  In this bill, we remove the cap. There is no longer any cap on \nchildcare expenses. Whatever your childcare expenses are, that is what \nyou can deduct from your monthly income to qualify for food stamps.\n  Again, we have also raised the minimum benefit by 50 percent, and we \nindex that to the future.\n  This bill also provides relief for our food banks. Our food banks in \nthis country provide a backstop for people who may get food stamps but \nthey run out before the end of the month. They do not have enough to \nget their families through, so a lot of times they go to our food \nbanks.\n  Well, what has happened? What has happened is that the bonus \ncommodities to our food banks have gone down 75 percent since the 2002 \nfarm bill; 75 percent. That is why we keep hearing from our food banks \nthat they are running out of food. They do not have enough to meet the \nrequirements of people who come in. They need something to get them \nthrough the weekend, get them through a holiday, because they do not \nhave enough food and they do not have food stamps.\n\n  What we did is put $1.2 billion of new money into the TEFAP, the \nTemporary Emergency Food Assistance Program, which provides staple \ncommodities to food banks. This year we have raised it. Current law \nprovides for $140 million annually. Here we raised it to $250 million.\n  As soon as this bill is passed and either signed by the President, \nwhich I hope he will do, or we override the veto and it becomes law--as \nsoon as this bill becomes law, immediately $50 million will go out to \nthe food banks around America immediately. Then we index that for the \nfuture. So we have indexed the TEFAP commodities for the future.\n\n[[Page S4153]]\n\n  Lastly, we know low-income Americans have the highest incidence for \ndiseases and illnesses, such as heart disease, obesity, diabetes, and \ndiseases related to diet.\n  A lot of that is because low-income people have a difficult choice to \nmake in terms of their purchases of food. Some of the healthier foods, \nsuch as whole grains, fruits, vegetables, those types of things, are \ngenerally higher priced. So to stretch their dollar as far as possible, \nlow-income people go in the grocery store and they stretch their food \ndollars to get to the next paycheck. But the foods with the least \nnutrition happen to be the cheapest, and it gets them through the \nmonth.\n  In this bill we provide a pilot program with about $20 million to put \nincentives in there for low-income Americans to see if we can give them \nincentives to purchase healthier foods as part of their diet.\n  Lastly, I want to quote here Vicki Escarra, who is president and CEO \nof America's Second Harvest. I think she summed it up all well on \nbehalf of all the antihunger groups.\n\n       On behalf of our nation's food banks, I urge Senators to \n     vote in favor of this hunger-fighting farm bill. Millions of \n     low income Americans are on the brink of catastrophe, facing \n     some of the most difficult economic times they have had to \n     endure in years. I urge Senators to support this vitally \n     important and necessary legislation.\n\n  That is why we talk about this as being a food bill, because 67 \npercent of the new money goes for nutrition.\n  This bill does not just provide food in this country for low-income \nindividuals, but also for poor people abroad.\n  There has been a lot of talk about the McGovern-Dole Program. This is \na program, of course, named after former Senators Dole and McGovern \nthat provides money and food for a school lunch program in other parts \nof the world, in places where they have low income, a lot of hunger. It \nis a good program because not only does it get a good meal to kids at \nleast once a day, but it is a magnet to get kids in school. In \ncountries where maybe 60, 70, 80 percent of your disposable income goes \nfor food, one nutritious meal a day to a child saves the family a lot \nof money. If the place to get that food is in a school, you ought to \nsend your kid to school. So it does two good things. In this bill, we \nprovide $84 million in mandatory money for the McGovern-Dole School \nLunch Program for kids in other countries and I expect that additional \nmoney will be provided through the appropriations process, as it has in \nthe past.\n  There is one other area that deals with food and health. That is the \nspecialty crop title of the bill. We have two new titles in this farm \nbill, the livestock title and the specialty crop title. They have never \nbeen in the farm bill before.\n  Under specialty crops, we have a 100-percent increase in the level of \nfarm bill spending for specialty crops programs. This is an historic \ninvestment. The 2002 farm bill provided $1.3 billion. We provide $2.7 \nbillion in this bill, just shy of $3 billion--a 100-percent increase in \nsupport for fruits, vegetables, organics, farmers' markets, \nhorticulture--all in this farm bill. That is one of the reasons why the \n120 groups that have interest in fruits, vegetables, and organics are \nsupporting this legislation, because of all we have provided to support \nour fruit and vegetable farmers and organic farmers, who comprise the \nfastest growing segment of American agriculture. We have $22 million to \nhelp farmers who are trying to transition from conventional production \ninto organic. We also provide more for farmers' markets. We provide \nmore money for research into organics to get it up to a level where it \nmatches the level of organics in our food supply chain.\n  For those interested in organic agriculture, we have really invested \nheavily in those who want to become organic farmers, those farmers' \nmarkets where they may collect organic products, and even farmers' \nmarkets that may not be organic but may provide locally-grown produce.\n  We have put money into this bill to provide support for what I would \ncall aggregators--an entrepreneur who understands that perhaps Whole \nFoods can't go out to each individual farmer for a supply of organic \nfoods, so you need somebody in the middle to put all this together. \nThat is what we have done. We have provided funds and support in this \nbill for entities that would aggregate, go out to each individual \nfarmer and pull the organic foods all together--it doesn't have to be \norganic, it could just be locally-grown--bundle them, and then they can \nsell those to Whole Foods or Safeway or Hy-Vee out in my area.\n  This is an opportunity to help organic producers get into the market, \nalso for locally-grown produce. It doesn't have to be produce. It could \nbe meats, poultry, beef, whatever that is local, to also get them into \nthe market supply as well.\n  The last thing I will say in terms of health and specialty crops \npertains to the fruit and vegetable snack program. This is something we \nstarted in the 2002 farm bill.\n  I sort of have a history on this. In the 1996 farm bill, I introduced \namendments to get vending machines taken out of schools. As anyone can \nsee, I was a spectacular failure at that one. But as time went on, it \nbecame clearer that vending machines were not the only problem. The \nproblem is what kids were eating in school. If we could provide \nhealthier foods for kids in school, we would all be better off.\n  Again, we know low-income kids in these schools are the first to get \ndiabetes and be obese and have all the problems that lead to illness \nand disease later on.\n  In the 2002 farm bill, I tried an experiment. I put in a provision to \nsupply about $6 million to test a theory of mine. The theory was that \nif you gave free fresh fruits and vegetables to kids in school, they \nwould eat them. If they would eat the fresh fruits and vegetables that \nwere free, they would not be eating candy and sugary snacks, cookies, \nthings such as that.\n  So we tried it. The idea behind it was not to do it in the lunchroom \nbut to do it in the classroom or in the hallway outside the classroom, \nnot just at lunch but in the morning when kids got the growlies about 9 \no'clock in the morning.\n  The idea was to provide it as a snack when kids got hungry in the \nmorning or in the afternoon and not just in the lunchroom.\n  I have to tell you, a lot of people said to me: Harkin, you are nuts. \nYou are going to have kids throwing apple cores around, orange peels, \nbanana peels. They will be throwing grapes at each other. They are \ngoing to make a mess.\n  I said: OK. Let's see what happens. It is all voluntary. No school \nhas to participate. If they participate and they don't like it, they \ncan drop out the next day. But let's see what happens.\n\n  So we took 4 States, 25 schools in a State, 100 schools, and an \nIndian reservation just to see what would happen with that $6 million, \nproviding free fresh fruits and vegetables. What happened to my test? \nEvery single school says that they don't want to drop out. They want to \ncontinue. And we don't have kids throwing apple cores around and orange \npeels and things like that. These kids are eating better. They are \nbetter behaved. Talk to any teacher who has had experience with this \nprogram, talk to any principal, and they will tell you these kids are \nbetter behaved. They eat better. They go home and tell their parents \nabout the great fruit and vegetable snacks they are getting, and then \nthey tell their folks to buy them at the grocery store. Those four \nStates have now gone to eight States. We are up to about $8 or $9 \nmillion a year now.\n  So because this has been so successful, this conference report has $1 \nbillion in it to expand the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program \nnationwide. Again, we can't do it all next year, so we ramp it up. It \nhas to be ramped up over several years. But in 5 years, by the time we \nramp this up, we will be at $150 million a year. And when we reach that \nlevel, nearly every low-income elementary school kid in America who is \nin a school that has a high rate of free and reduced priced lunches, \nevery one of those kids is going to be getting free fresh fruits and \nvegetables as a snack during the day.\n  Think what this will do for our kids and their health. I am really \nhappy about this. I am happy first that the test worked. Now I am happy \nthat we are going to take it nationwide to every State. We are \ntargeting it to elementary schools, and we are asking States, since \nthis goes to the States, to further target it to those schools that\n\n[[Page S4154]]\n\nhave a majority of low-income kids so we can get to them first.\n  Again, this is helpful not only to the nutrition of our kids but also \nto the specialty crops all over America because we are going to rely \nupon them to grow these crops and make them available for the fruit and \nvegetable snack program.\n  We said the second part was conservation. Let's talk about the \nconservation part of this bill. On this chart, I compare the proportion \nof funding going to conservation as compared to the commodity programs \nin each farm bill back to 1985. The red portion is the part that goes \nfor conservation as compared to commodities. Why do I compare it to \ncommodities? Because this is the part of these farm bills that go to \nfarmers. The conservation share of the total of conservation and \ncommodity payments has never been even 20 percent. But look at 2008: 41 \npercent of what we are putting out to farmers is in conservation. We \nhave never done that before. We have never even come close to that \nbefore.\n  I was proud of the 2002 farm bill. In 2002, I said we would put more \ninto conservation in the 2002 farm bill than ever before. That was true \nin 2002. In 2008, we have more than doubled the share of conservation \nthat goes out, to 41 percent.\n  The administration said one of the reasons they wanted to veto the \nfarm bill was because we didn't put enough into conservation. But the \nadministration's own bill only put $4.2 billion into conservation, as \nscored by the congressional budget office. Our bill puts $5.2 billion \ninto conservation, as scored by the same neutral financial accounting, \nusing the same assumptions. So we exceeded what the administration \nasked for in total conservation spending. And what's more, we have done \nit in a way that is going to clean up our soil and water, provide \nincentives to farmers to be good conservationists.\n  In the all-important EQIP, the Environmental Quality Incentives \nProgram, we put in $15.8 billion over 10 years in total funding. For \nthe Conservation Security Program, now called the Conservation \nStewardship Program, we provided $12 billion over 10 years. Why do I \nsingle those out? Because those are conservation programs that go to \nworking lands.\n  Most people think of conservation as taking land out of production. \nIn the past, that has been true. We still do some of that with the \nWetlands Reserve Program, and in the Conservation Reserve Program. For \nfragile, erodible acres and wetlands, taking the land out of production \nis often the best way to conserve the land, and provide vital wildlife \nhabitat.\n  But we know, because of the demand for food and the high prices of \nour commodities, more and more land is coming out of the Conservation \nReserve Program. It is being tilled. It is being cropped. This is a \nfree country and these are voluntary programs, so if a farmer has \ncompleted a Conservation Reserve Program contract, the land can go back \ninto production if the farmer chooses.\n  But what we can do about it is put more money into conservation on \nworking lands, to give incentives to farmers to be good \nconservationists. One of the most important programs, I believe, is the \nConservation Stewardship Program. This is a program I included in the \n2002 farm bill.\n  We put in place what was then called the Conservation Security \nProgram, an uncapped entitlement program to go to farmers to be good \nconservationists on working lands, to give them the incentive to \nprotect the soil, the water, and the wildlife habitat.\n  CSP has had a little bumpy history, I will be the first to admit, \nbecause of rules and regulations that were written and cuts to funding. \nFirst of all, they limited enrollment only to specific watersheds, \nrather than making it available to producers across the country. That \nwas very discriminatory. So under this bill we have revamped it. We \nhave made it applicable to every farmer in this country, no longer just \nbased on watersheds. Every farmer willing to meet the eligibility \nrequirements can get into this program now. The program will be \navailable to producers from Florida to Washington State and from New \nMexico to Maine. The program pays not for what you grow, but for how \nyou grow it--the environmental benefits your conservation activities \nproduce. We are devoting over $12 billion over 10 years to the program. \nWe will enroll, under this program now, about 13 million acres a year.\n  Now, what does this mean? It means we will be giving payments to \nfarmers to take care of the soil, to protect the water, provide \nwildlife habitat, and to be good producers and deliver important \nenvironmental benefits. We know we have to have the production, we have \nto produce the food and the fiber in the country. But you can have both \nproduction and a good, clean environment at the same time. They are not \nmutually exclusive.\n  This picture I have in the Chamber shows what I mean. This is what we \nought to be about: This is a farm. A river runs through it--but the \nfarmer is using good conservation practices to help keep the river \nclean. What you see along the river is a barrier strip of grass and \ntrees; barriers to stop the runoff of fertilizer or pesticides that may \nbe put on the land, to keep it from going into the stream. You do not \nfarm right up to the riverbank. The farm is using minimum tillage. And \nin different fields around the farm you see different kinds of crops. \nYou have a crop rotation that goes on. The farmer has also planted \ntrees as wind breaks along the fence rows.\n  That is what the Conservation Stewardship Program is all about: \nmaking sure we have good production but good stewardship of the soil, \ngood protection for the water, and good wildlife habitat and corridors \nat the same time.\n  Why do we need to devote federal spending on conservation? I have a \nphotograph I show you in the Chamber that was taken on April 14, 1935, \nnow known as Black Sunday, near Liberal, KS. This terrible dust storm \nrolled across Kansas. All of us in grade school have seen this picture \nin our textbooks of the dust clouds rolling over Kansas in 1935.\n  Because what had happened? What had happened is, after World War I, \nbecause of the demand for food around the world and here, we plowed up \neverything in the plains States--lands that been unplowed for thousands \nyears. We plowed it up, and when the rain didn't come, it turned to \ndust. People say: Well, that was 1935. Well, that was 1935, yes.\n  Let's take a look at another picture I have in the Chamber, taken \nwithin a few miles of that picture you saw from 1935. Look at this. Now \nwe have a color picture--the same big dust clouds rolling over the \nplains--taken in 2006.\n  Let's not make the same mistake again. That is why we have put so \nmuch effort and so much into conservation on working lands--yes, to \nmake sure farmers can make a profit, they can grow the food and the \nfeed and the fiber we need for our people and for exports, but to do it \nin an environmentally sound way, which can be done so we do not have to \nhave those dust bowls any longer. So we are going to have more land in \nproduction and more need for conservation.\n  Lastly, on conservation, there are important needs across this \ncountry, not just in the midwest. Here is a chart of the Chesapeake Bay \nwatershed. Those of us who have been around this area for any time or \nwho have ever been out to the Chesapeake Bay know how polluted the \nChesapeake Bay is--killing the fish, taking away a livelihood for so \nmany people who rely on the Chesapeake Bay; not only that, destroying \nbreeding grounds for many of our fish that then go back out to the \nocean.\n  As shown on this chart, this is the watershed that drains into the \nChesapeake Bay. It covers Virginia, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New \nYork, Delaware, and Maryland--all those States. We heard from the \nCongressmen and Senators and people who live in those areas saying we \nhave to do something to help clean up the Chesapeake Bay. And we did. \nWe put $438 million into this bill to help protect the uplands, to take \ncare of it before it gets down to the Chesapeake Bay. So we have done, \nI think, yeoman's work in this area in helping to help clean up the \nChesapeake Bay.\n  Lastly, I said food, conservation, and energy bill--energy--energy. \nNow, I have a chart in the Chamber on that. Let me say this: High \ngasoline prices and diesel prices are hurting our families all over \nthis country. I know. I hear about it all the time from my \nconstituents. The prices at the pump are\n\n[[Page S4155]]\n\nhurting people, especially in rural areas, where people have to drive a \ndistance to get to work.\n  But we have studies that show because of the supply of ethanol in \nthis country, the price at the gas pump is 29 cents to 40 cents a \ngallon cheaper. In other words, if it were not for ethanol, the price \nof gasoline at the pump would be 29 cents to 40 cents a gallon higher \nthan it is today.\n  So what we did in this bill is, we recognized a couple things. We \nneed more production of clean renewable energy here in America. We need \nto get off the oil pipeline. But we also recognize the impact it is \nhaving on grain. So we have put a lot in this farm bill to move us to \ncellulose production, biomass production of ethanol in the future. This \nbill ramps up our capacity to produce clean renewable American energy, \nnot only from grain, but from wood, trees, wood chips, switchgrass, \nmiscanthus, corn stover, wheat stover, oat stover--all kinds of things \nwe basically do not use today. We put over $1 billion in this bill to \nmove us aggressively in that direction. So we can build biorefineries, \nwe give support for farmers who want to grow dedicated cellulose crops \nfor this purpose, and we give them help in growing them, transitioning \nthem, storing them, and transporting them. This is a chart to show you \nwe can do biomass and build biorefineries, and it helps our rural \ncommunities and helps America. There is over $1 billion in this bill to \nmove us in this direction.\n\n  Two last things in rural development. We have included policy in this \nbill to get broadband to rural towns and communities all over America. \nSecond, we put $120 million in the bill that will go out right away to \nreduce the backlog in water and wastewater treatment facilities in our \nsmall towns and communities.\n  I come from a small town of 162 people, where I still live, where \nabout 25 years ago every well in my hometown--including mine--tested \nunfit to drink. But we got rural water, we got clean water. In my \nhouse, I now have clean rural water, and every house in my small town \nof Cumming has that. We know what it means, and I know what it means \nfirsthand. So we have to get better water and wastewater for our small \ntowns and communities, and we have done that in this bill.\n  Lastly, there is a lot of talk about reform. Maybe the White House \nsays we did not reform enough in agriculture. We have done what the \nadministration asked in reforming this bill. We now have direct \nattribution, so we will know from now on exactly where every dollar, \nevery dime goes, to whomever gets it. We did away with the three-entity \nrule, and we significantly reduced the cap on adjusted gross income.\n  Now, I want to be clear about this. Right now if you have $2.5 \nmillion of nonfarm income, you would still qualify for farm programs--\nright now. The administration wanted to reduce that to $200,000. We \nreduced it to $500,000, moving it from $2.5 million to $500,000, and \nput a cap on nonfarm income. That is real reform.\n  Second, if the majority of your income today is from farm sources, \nyou can have an income of $5 million, $10 million, $20 million--no \nlimit--and you will still get farm program payments. Under our bill, we \nput a cap of $750,000 on farm income. If farm income is more than \n$750,000 then no direct payments. That is real reform. It may not be as \nmuch as some might like, but I will tell you, it is far beyond the \nlimits we have now.\n  I know some of our colleagues had to bite down pretty hard on this \nbecause they represent farmers who have higher input costs. They have \nbigger operations because they have to in order to survive. So I know \nthey have had to take a hit on this. But this is real reform. I commend \nthose members of our committee who worked with us on this to make sure \nwe could have these reforms and bring it here where we are today.\n  The last reform we put in this bill: We put in a new optional program \nfor farmers, an average crop revenue election program. They can stay in \nthe present price-based countercyclical program or they can take a \nslight cut in their loan rates, in their direct payments, and then get \na revenue-based countercyclical payment if the combination of prices \nand yields go down. Now, again, I do not know if farmers will take it, \nbut it is an option.\n  I know the National Corn Growers Association was very supportive of \nthis approach. We have it as an option. Maybe this is the future; I do \nnot know. But it is a reform, and we put it in there for farmers to \nconsider as an option.\n  It has been a long road. There is a lot more I could say about this \nfood, energy, and conservation bill. There is a lot more I know I have \nnot covered. But it is a strong bill. As I said the other day, it is \ngood for every American from my hometown of Cumming, IA, population \n162, to New York City, population 8 million, and everybody in between. \nThat is why so many groups, over 500 groups--antihunger groups, \nreligious groups, conservation groups, clean energy groups--farmers \nstrongly support this bill.\n  Finally, before I yield the floor, let me thank my colleague, my \nfriend, my ranking member, Senator Saxby Chambliss, for all he has done \nto bring this bill to the floor today. He started it when he was \nchairman, having hearings all over the country, laying the groundwork \nfor this farm bill. I was privileged to take it over this Congress, as \nchairman. But I could not have asked for a better ranking member, \nsomeone I could work closely with. We worked together on this right to \nthe bitter end--I should not say ``bitter end;'' right to the good end; \nwe have a great bill--but right to the end to bring this bill forward. \nHe has worked very hard to make sure we could get to this point on this \nbill. I wanted to thank him for all of his work, for his close working \nrelationship on this bill.\n  Tomorrow morning I will thank all of our staff who have worked so \nhard on this bill, in particular our staff director Mark Halverson. \nWhen this is done, I am going to make him take a vacation. He has got \nto catch up on about a year's worth of sleep here in a couple weeks. \nBut Mark Halverson has been a great staff director in keeping this bill \ngoing and keeping all the things together and moving it forward. I \ncannot find the words to thank him enough for all he has done.\n  On Senator Chambliss's side, I thank Martha Scott Poindexter, who, of \ncourse, was the staff director under Senator Chambliss, and now for him \nas the ranking member, for all the great work she has done. Both she \nand Mark Halverson together have worked very hard, and their staffs. \nThey have great staffs, and I am going to name them all tomorrow. But I \nwould be remiss if in my opening statement I didn't thank both of them \nfor their extraordinary work and extraordinary effort they have done to \nget this bill to this point.\n\n  So, Madam President, I have taken way too much time. I wish to yield \nthe floor to a great friend and a great colleague and someone who has \nhelped bring us to this point of getting a great farm bill to all the \npeople of America, Senator Chambliss.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Iowa, \nSenator Harkin. This truly has, under his leadership, been a very \nbipartisan effort. As we will see on the floor tonight and tomorrow, \nthere will be some folks on both sides of the aisle who will have a lot \nof good things to say about this bill. Not everybody is in agreement \nwith it, but we never have total agreement on farm bills. They are \nalways controversial. They always contain provisions that some Members \nof the Senate don't like, but by and large this bill is a true \nbipartisan bill. I wish to commend Senator Harkin for his leadership, \nand not just on the substance of the bill. During the conference \nprocess we went through, the Senate stayed in lockstep. All Members, \nall conferees on the Senate side, Republican and Democratic, remained \nloyal to the commitment we made to each other as we went through that \nconference, and I think it was for that reason that we were successful \nin producing a product that somewhat mirrors the product that came out \nof this Senate back in December. So I thank Senator Harkin for his \nleadership and for his commitment to American agriculture.\n  I rise tonight in support of the farm bill conference report before \nus. The Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 provides certainty \nto America's farmers and ranchers and restates the strong commitment of \nCongress to the hungry and less fortunate. This farm\n\n[[Page S4156]]\n\nbill contains the most significant reform of our farm programs in \nrecent memory, if not history, and increases investments in the areas \nof nutrition, specialty crops, conservation, and renewable energy. It \nis no wonder that nutrition groups, food bank organizations, \nconservation and wildlife groups, commodity organizations, cattlemen \nand ranchers, renewable energy advocates, and specialty crop producers \nhave all united in strong support of this farm bill.\n  This bill is simply the single most important piece of legislation \nfor rural America and the small American towns and communities whose \neconomic engines depend on agriculture. To reject this bill is to leave \nbillions of economic development investments on the table and accept \nthe faulty notion that currently high commodity prices will exist \nforever. Every farmer knows there is no certainty in the honorable \npractice of farming. This farm bill is our commitment to provide them \nwith much-needed economic assistance when times are bad and allow them \nto prosper without our assistance when times are good. Our farm safety \nnet is targeted, fiscally responsible, and will ensure the prosperity \nof our farmers and ranchers during the tough economic times that are \ncertainly to come.\n  Yes, this bill helps maintain a safety net for the farmers and \nranchers who produce the food on our dinner tables and the fiber for \nthe shirts on our back. I simply do not understand the critics who \nraise their arms in protest because we attempt to help farmers in this \nfarm bill. Given the amount of investments in the many critical areas \nto all Americans in this bill, it is actually inaccurate to simply call \nthis a farm bill. I wish to point out to the critics that less than \none-fifth of the bill's spending goes toward the production of \nagricultural programs. Furthermore, all the commodity programs in the \ncommodity title combined account for a mere .29 percent of the entire \noutlays of the Federal Government spending. That is almost one-quarter \nof 1 percent. Many are attempting to paint a picture of a bloated bill \nthat provides huge subsidies to large farmers, but the facts present a \ndifferent picture of how the money is actually allocated. Commodity \nprogram spending in this bill represents less than 14 percent of the \ntotal spending, while conservation, nutrition, and renewable energy \nspending account for more than 75 percent of the bill.\n  There is a common misperception in many editorial boardrooms, and \nunfortunately at the White House, that the 2008 farm bill does not \ninclude adequate reform of our current farm programs. This \nmisperception has led to a series of negative news articles accusing \nour farm safety net of hindering African cotton trade, raising food \nprices domestically and globally, providing payments to millionaire \nfarmers who abuse the system, and eroding our ability to provide food \naid to the neediest Americans and citizens of other countries. This \nseries of negative and inaccurate propaganda has culminated in a veto \nthreat from the President. I stand before this body tonight to clearly \nstate that this bill contains sweeping reforms of which all Americans \ncan be proud. Drastic reforms are included in this bill to make sure \nnonfarmers do not benefit from the farm safety net. We rightfully \nbelieve the farm safety net should be used to help those who take on an \nenormous risk every year to produce the crops and livestock that \nsustain the food supply of our country.\n  While we disagree with many of the attacks against our farm safety \nnet, we have nonetheless heard the calls for reform and have responded \nin several meaningful ways. The traditional cotton program has been \nreformed so that it is more market oriented per our WTO--World Trade \nOrganization--- commitments. The GSM program has been reformed to honor \nour obligations under the cotton case that was decided last year. The \nadjusted gross income test for nonfarmers has been reduced by 80 \npercent, ensuring that farm program benefits are targeted to those who \nneed them most. In addition, this bill eliminates the three-entity \nrule, adopts direct attribution for farm program payments, and \neliminates base acres on land developed for residential use. These \naccomplishments represent the most significant reform of the farm \nsafety net in the history of farm bills in this country.\n  Conservation programs are vital to the farm bill and to this Nation's \nfarmers, ranchers, and private forest landowners. Working land--the \ncropland, grazing land, and forest land that is used to produce our \nfood, feed, and fiber--accounts for nearly 1.3 billion acres or two-\nthirds of the Nation's land area. Since the enactment of the 2002 farm \nbill, conservation measures have been applied on more than 70 million \nacres of cropland and 125 million acres of grazing lands. In addition, \nmore than 1 million acres of wetlands have been created, restored \nor enhanced.\n\n  This farm bill continues its great tradition of protecting working \nlands by providing producers $4 billion in new resources for \nconservation programs. In addition to providing new funding, the farm \nbill also makes numerous improvements to the programs to ensure they \nmeet the needs of producers. One notable improvement is that the \nenvironmental quality incentives program will now be available to \nprivate forest landowners. It also looks to the future by helping \nproducers and landowners play a role and get credit for mitigating \nclimate change.\n  In the 2002 farm bill, an energy title was included for the first \ntime, and the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act furthers our \ncommitment to meeting America's energy needs with alternative forms of \nenergy. All Americans must cope with today's extraordinarily high gas \nprices, and with this farm bill, we take the necessary steps to \nalleviate the pressure not only on petroleum-based gasoline but on \ncorn-based ethanol. One day, Americans will be able to fill their gas \ntanks with ethanol made from woodchips or peanut hulls, and when that \nday comes, you can look back to this farm bill as the foundation for \nmaking that a reality.\n  Speaking of energy, I have heard calls from several of my colleagues \nto ensure that contracts traded on electronic exchanges, such as \nnatural gas contracts traded on the ICE Futures, are subject to more \nregulatory oversight by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. In \nresponding to those concerns, this conference report includes a long-\noverdue reauthorization of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, \ncomplete with a newly developed regulatory structure for contracts \ntraded on exempt commercial markets that are determined to perform a \nsignificant price discovery function. This has been a top priority for \nSenators Feinstein, Levin, and Snowe, and I am pleased we were able to \ninclude it in this farm bill.\n  This farm bill also includes a new title devoted to horticulture \norganic production. With specialty crops representing approximately 50 \npercent of U.S. crop cash receipts, the inclusion of this title \nappropriately recognizes that fruit and vegetable growers deserve a \nplace in major farm legislation. This industry is vitally important to \nconsumers, and the inclusion of these provisions will ensure that \nproducers of fruits and vegetables receive the support necessary to \nenhance the healthy foods we have come to demand, as well as improve \nthe viability of this important sector of American agriculture.\n  However, rural America is not the only beneficiary of this farm bill. \nThe entire country will reap the rewards of increased investments in \nnutrition, renewable energy, and conservation. This legislation reaches \nout to low-income Americans to ensure nutritional needs are met by \nproviding schoolchildren with increased access to fresh fruits and \nvegetables and enhancing our investments to the Food Stamp Program as \nwell as to food banks all across America. The numbers speak for \nthemselves: 73 percent--let me say that again--73 percent of the \nspending in this bill goes toward our domestic nutrition programs. \nGiven rising food prices and the skyrocketing price of oil, it is \ncritical that we lend a hand to those citizens in both rural and urban \nAmerica who are struggling to feed their families and fill their gas \ntanks.\n  Local food banks around the country are facing increased demands for \nfood from people in need. This farm bill invests an additional $1.25 \nbillion over the next 10 years to increase commodity purchases for food \nbanks--an increase of nearly double the current level of funding. To \nhelp improve the dietary intake of all citizens, this farm bill invests \nsignificant resources to expand the school-based fresh fruit and\n\n[[Page S4157]]\n\nvegetable snack program to all States and increases support for the \nsenior farmers' market nutrition program to help seniors purchase \nagricultural products at farmers' markets, roadside stands, and other \ncommunity-supported agricultural programs.\n  Most significant, though, is the increased investment in the Food \nStamp Program. The Food Stamp Program--the cornerstone of our country's \ndomestic food assistance effort--currently serves 28 million Americans \neach month. This program has evolved over the decades to become one of \nthe most efficient tools to combat hunger and reduce poverty. The Food \nStamp Program now has one of the best track records among all Federal \nprograms. The payment accuracy rate, which measures the correct level \nof benefit issuance to participating households, is at an all-time \nhigh. Trafficking, which long plagued the program, has been \nsubstantially reduced. Also, the certification process has a proven \nsuccess rate with over 98 percent of food stamp participants properly \neligible for benefits. American taxpayers can be assured that the \nresources dedicated to this program are effectively used for their \nintended purposes.\n  While administration of the Food Stamp Program has turned a corner, a \nstigma still exists that prevents some eligible people from seeking the \nhelp they need. Even though the implementation of Electronic Benefit \nTransfer, or EBT, has restored dignity to those who depend on food \nassistance while at the grocery store, the term ``food stamps'' \nconjures up negative images for many. Food stamps haven't been issued \nin years, and the Federal Government destroyed the remaining inventory \nof stamps in 2003. For these reasons, the Food Stamp Program is being \nrenamed as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. The \nnew name better reflects the mission of our country's premier domestic \nassistance program. Instead of referring to food stamps in the future, \nthe term ``food SNAP'' should be used as we transition to the new name.\n  This farm bill invests $8 billion in food SNAP over the next 10 \nyears. By increasing the standard deduction and minimum monthly \nbenefit, food SNAP will provide improved benefit levels to help low-\nincome families put nutritious food on the table. To make food SNAP \nmore accessible to low-income Americans, this farm bill indexes the \nasset limitation for inflation, exempts IRS-approved retirement and \neducation savings accounts from the asset test, and permits a full \ndeduction for childcare expenses. Simplified reporting requirements are \nextended to low-income seniors to ease their ability to obtain \nbenefits. The improvements made in this farm bill will ensure that food \nSNAP continues to improve the health and nutritional well-being of \nmillions of people in need.\n  Rural development is also a vital part of this 2008 farm bill. Rural \nAmerica is not composed of farmers and ranchers only, but other hard-\nworking men and women reside in these areas with their families. It is \nessential our rural citizens have the same opportunity to participate \nin the global economy as our friends in urban areas.\n  This title helps deploy fundamental services, such as improving \nbroadband Internet capability, funding for water and waste projects, \nand support for the value-added efforts. We promote economic \ndevelopment by reestablishing regional planning authorities and \nencouraging communities to collaborate in their efforts to attract \nquality jobs and promote local investment.\n  I say to my colleagues, this bill before you today is a significant \nand worthwhile investment, not only for American agriculture but for \nmillions of needy Americans. I am disheartened that the President \ndoesn't find these investments worthy of his signature, but I must \nrepresent my constituents who do understand the need for a strong \nsafety net for our farmers and ranchers. Rural America is certainly \nenjoying a period of economic prosperity. But history tells us this \nprosperity will not last forever and that it is our moral obligation to \nbe there to lend a helping hand when the downturn comes. We have the \nopportunity today to display our unwavering commitment to the Nation's \nfarmers and ranchers who supply us with the safest, most affordable and \nmost nutritious food supply in the world. I hope my colleagues will \njoin me in supporting this investment in America's future by voting for \nthe bill.\n  In closing, before I turn to my good friend and colleague from New \nHampshire, I again thank Chairman Harkin for his leadership. I also see \nSenator Conrad on the Senate floor. We have had a terrific working \nrelationship through this process. Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley \nhave played such an integral role in making sure this farm bill has the \nresources with which to stay within the budget numbers we were given.\n  This has truly been a bipartisan effort in the Senate and is the \nreason, or an exhibition of the reason, I came to the Senate, which is \nto work together with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass \npositive legislation and improve the quality of life for men and women \nall across America.\n  I, too, will talk more about staff tomorrow. I would be remiss, \nthough, if I didn't recognize Mark Halverson, who has been such a great \nasset in working on this bill and working with my staff. He traveled \naround the country with us 2 years ago, and we tried to feed him a good \nNebraska steak a couple of times and made sure he was healthy while he \nwas on the road with us. We had a great time in listening to the \nfarmers and ranchers. Martha Scott Poindexter, on my side, has been the \nminority director and has done such a terrific job, No. 1, of not just \nshepherding this bill from our perspective and working with the \nmajority side, but also in putting together, without question, in my \nopinion, the best staff we have ever had on our side of the aisle from \nan Agriculture Committee perspective.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to further discussion of this bill \ntomorrow, as we move ahead. I know a number of our colleagues will be \ncoming on the Senate floor tonight to talk about this bill. I encourage \nfolks on our side of the aisle, if you want to come tonight and speak, \nit is a good time to do it because you can have all the time you want. \nTomorrow it will get cramped. I encourage colleagues from the minority \nside to come out tonight and make their word heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I will just be a brief minute. I wanted to \nadvise the Senate what we have in store the rest of this week.\n  Because of the cooperation on both sides, we have 90 minutes of \ndebate on the farm conference report tomorrow. There could be two or \nthree points of order offered on that, or whatever Senators want to \noffer. We will vote on those points of order after 90 minutes of debate \nprior to voting on the conference report.\n  Following that, we received the papers from the House on the budget. \nThey have appointed conferees, and we also are going to appoint \nconferees tomorrow. Statutorily, there are 10 hours for the ability of \nany Senator to offer amendments to instruct conferees. We don't know \nhow many amendments there will be. Senators Conrad and Gregg have been \nworking on a number of issues they want to have resolved by votes in \nthe Senate. That will be done. We look forward to that.\n  We would like to finish, and we are going to finish, the budget \ntomorrow. It may go into the evening, but that is fine. We have now \nscheduled a cloture vote for Friday morning. I hope during all day \ntomorrow Senators Gregg, Enzi, Kennedy, and others can see if there is \na way of moving forward on the collective bargaining bill. If there is, \nthen there would not be a need for a cloture vote. At least we need to \nspend tomorrow making that decision whether that can be done.\n  The other thing we have to finish before we leave this week--either \ntomorrow night or Friday--is the Dorgan cross-ownership issue that he \nindicated would only take a very short period of time. We have to do \nthat. We have to complete that because it is statute, by June 3. We \nhave 10 hours of debate allowed on that matter. It is also a privileged \npiece of legislation. Senator Dorgan said he thought, in my last \nconversation with him, he would only want 1 hour out of the 10 hours. \nOthers will want to speak on that.\n  So that Senators know, that is what we have ahead of us this week. We \nhave a situation where there are no votes on Monday, but Tuesday we \nenter into a critical stage of what needs to be done.\n\n[[Page S4158]]\n\n  We have coming from the House tomorrow, we are told, a $180 billion \nsupplemental appropriations bill. We are going to have to work hard on \nthat. It will take work. We will be getting a message from the House. \nAs I understand it, there will be three trees in that message they will \ngive us. So we will have to have at least three separate votes on what \nthey send us.\n  I look forward to working with Senators on both sides next week to \ncomplete that. In order to do that, we have to complete all of the work \noutlined a few minutes ago this week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, first, I appreciate my colleague for \nallowing me to proceed at this time. I recognize that we are debating a \nbill the conclusion of which is already foregone. The cards are dealt \nand turned over, and this bill will pass. That doesn't mean it should \nnot be discussed and some of the weaknesses should not be pointed out.\n  I have severe reservations about the way we approached the commodity \nside of the bill, which is, as it has been adequately represented, not \nthe majority of the spending bill, but it is a very significant amount \nof spending, $190 billion, or somewhere in that vicinity.\n  Some may ask--and I guess I may have wondered from time to time--what \nhappened to all of those economists who worked for the Soviet Union \nwhen it failed, who were sitting around their desks and they didn't \nhave a job anymore--the folks who believed in a command economy, in \ntop-down management, and believed in 5-year plans and believed that \nsupply and demand had no relationship to the market. Where did all \nthose people go? We now know. They went into the development of \nAmerican farm policy. It is sort of like, after World War II, you took \nall of the scientists out of Germany and put them in Huntsville. At the \nend of the Cold War, we took the economists out of the Soviet Union and \nput them in the Midwest or maybe in the South because this bill is \nstructured in a world that has no relationship to the market. It \nactually fundamentally undermines the concept of market and relating \nproductivity to demand and supply to the market.\n  It is also a bill that does serious damage to budgeting because it \nuses $18 billion in gimmicks in order to avoid and get around pay-go \nrules and other budget enforcement mechanisms. It even brings back--\namazingly enough--the Customs fees. How many times can we bring back \nCustoms fees? But it brings them back and claims a savings and uses \nthat money and spends it--$10 billion, I believe.\n  So at a time when the farm community in this country is doing pretty \ndarn well--in fact, the average farm income today is about 51 percent \nhigher than it has been, on average, over the last 10 years--$92 \nbillion--real farm income is up $200 billion just in the last couple of \nyears. Farmers are experiencing record income. We are setting up a \nsubsidy structure, the purpose of which is to basically make payments \nto farmers who are making a lot of money on products that are doing \nvery well.\n  Wheat is selling at $6 or $8 a bushel, and the average price has been \naround $3.50. It is almost twice the average price. The same can be \nsaid for corn--corn is higher even--barley, soybeans, and rice, which \nis at three times the average price. We have commodities that are able \nto compete in the market, so why do we need this massive new subsidy \nstructure which essentially creates this command and control attempt to \nmanage the markets? We don't, obviously. We don't in the context of \nthis time.\n  In addition, the bill sets up some new mechanisms that are rather \npoor. It creates this new floor for emergencies. It says there will be \na $3.8 billion kitty for emergencies. We have never handled emergencies \nthat way. The reason is because we don't know what the emergencies are \ngoing to be. We have always taken care of emergencies, whether it was \nKatrina--which cost will be over $150 billion--or whether it was \nsmaller events, such as a flood somewhere or hurricanes or tornadoes. \nWe take care of them when we know what the cost is. We don't set up \nbasically a slush fund for emergencies so that the next time a post \noffice box blows over in some community, it is declared an emergency \nand they can go get this money. This is going to incentivize an \naggressive attempt to declare everything an emergency to get at the \nmoney that exists.\n  The irony is--to show how totally inconsistent this language is--they \ndon't even use the emergency money they have set aside in this bill for \nan emergency they identify in the bill, which is the Kansas tornadoes, \nwhich they funded in the amount of $60 million, I believe it is. It \nshows this money is just going to be used for something else. If they \nare going to fund a $60 million emergency in the bill, they ought to at \nleast have the credibility to take it out of the new slush fund. I \nmean, how absurd is that? This is walking around money. That is what it \namounts to--$3.8 billion, which is real money, by the way. It would run \nthe State of New Hampshire for 2 years.\n  There is a representation that there is a major reform effort in the \narea of payment to wealthy farmers. They reduce the payment level so \nyou don't get any payments if you have more than $750,000 of farm \nincome. What isn't discussed today is the $2.5 million. The fact is, \nyou can also have $500,000 of outside income, plus the $750,000, so \nthat gets you up to $1.2 million. Then, if you are married, you can \ncouple that up with your spouse so that she or he can have the same \namount. If it is a married farmer, and they are making $2.5 million of \nincome, they still qualify under this bill. So it is sort of a sleight \nof hand exercise to claim there is significant reform.\n  In fact, this reform is insignificant compared to what is suggested. \nThe President's reform would have saved $1.6 billion. He suggested that \npeople with an adjusted gross income of over $200,000 not get these \npayments.\n  How much does this bill save in that area, because it allows the \nspouse to qualify also and it allows the extra income outside farming \nto qualify? Mr. President, $286 million. That is not a lot of money \nwhen you spread it--that is a lot of money, but when you put it over \nthe period of this bill, it is not a significant amount of money, and \nit reflects the fact that it is not a significant reform. It simply is \nnot.\n  The bill also does nothing to limit the practice of farmers locking \nin subsidy payment rates at the lowest market prices, yet retaining \ntheir crops to sell later when the prices are much higher. As a result, \nfarmers are paid subsidies for losses they never had. This is what is \nknown as commissar politics. This is where the guys from Russia and the \nSoviet Union gather and say: This worked in the Soviet Union, let's do \nit here.\n  The concept that you pay people for losses that don't exist for a \nproduct that is being sold that the guy gets to keep and gets to sell--\nlet's be reasonable about this. This is not logical, and it certainly \nis not market politics. It has very little relationship to Adam Smith.\n  It also, ironically, at a time when we should be encouraging people \nto use ethanol, continues a major discouragement for those of us who \nlive in the Northeast from using ethanol by extending the tariff for 2 \nmore years, to 2010. This tariff makes no sense at all because you \ncannot ship to the Northeast the ethanol that is being produced in the \nMidwest, and we don't have the production capabilities in the \nNortheast. We don't have the product, although the switchgrass \ninitiative, which I respect and say is a good initiative, hopefully can \ngive us that option.\n  The simple fact is, to maintain this tariff is to penalize uniquely \nthe Northeast--Pennsylvania, New England, New York, New Jersey, \neverything basically in the East, not even the Northeast--in order to \nprotect the subsidies of product corn in the Midwest. Corn is doing \npretty darn well. It does not need the protection. In fact, if \nanything, we need to figure out a way to produce other products to make \nethanol. The folks in Brazil have figured it out, so why not let us b \nuy that ethanol? Why penalize us in a way that is really punitive--\npunitive--for the purposes of basically protecting production which is \nalready at a record price? It makes no sense at all.\n  And then the one that really is the worst or, in my humble opinion, \nthe most egregious. The most egregious is the Sugar Program. The Sugar \nProgram was pretty bad before this bill. In\n\n[[Page S4159]]\n\nan act of avarice that can only be called a sugar high, they managed to \nmake it significantly worse. I mean, how can they do that? It is very \nhard to do, but they essentially locked in a price for sugar in the \nUnited States that is double the world price. On top of that, they are \nmaking the Federal Government buy sugar at that inflated price and then \nresell it for the production of ethanol at a significant loss.\n  The Sugar Program makes no sense to begin with. It never made any \nsense other than the fact this was a commodity that had influence in \nthe process of developing this bill; obviously, a disproportionate \namount of influence. To take this program, which was bad to begin with, \nand make it so egregious by forcing the Federal Government and Federal \ntaxpayers first to have to pay twice what the world market price is for \nsugar and then to have to resell it to ethanol producers at a huge \nloss--how many times can you hit the taxpayers for the purpose of the \nsugar production industry? It is not right.\n  Then, of course, there are the new programs, the asparagus payments. \nI like asparagus. When we did the farm bill, I talked about the fact \nthat I used to grow asparagus. I love it. I did rototill my asparagus \nbed, I admit to that. I destroyed our asparagus crop. I didn't get a \nsubsidy payment. I didn't get a disaster payment. Under this bill, I \nmight because there is a new asparagus program.\n  There is a new large chickpea program and a camelina program. I don't \neven know what that is. That is, obviously, some product made somewhere \nfor which somebody wanted to get a subsidy.\n  There is the National Sheep and Goat Industry Improvement Center for \n$1 million.\n  There is the Desert Terminal Lakes Program, which is $175 million to \nlease or purchase water rights.\n  There is a variety of earmarks, and one I find to be most \nrepresentative of the failure of this bill as being outrageous is one \nthat sets up a program for farm and ranch stress assistance networks. \nDo we have a stress assistance network for the family who is running a \ngas station or maybe the family who opened a restaurant and they are \nnot doing so well or the folks who start a small shoe store somewhere? \nDo we have a stress program, a farm and ranch stress program? What \nqualifies farmers and ranchers for a special program dealing with \nstress? The only thing that qualifies is somebody somewhere came up \nwith this program, got somebody's ear, and decided to stick it in this \nbill because this bill was leaving the station. It does not make sense, \nand it is certainly something on which tax dollars should not be spent.\n  We have items that arrived out of nowhere in this bill: fisheries \ndisaster assistance of $170 million for California, Washington, and \nOregon; forest conservation bonds. As I mentioned, I find it reasonable \nthat there should be relief for the tornado in Kansas, but why wouldn't \nit come out of the money we just set aside in this bill for disasters, \n$3.8 billion? Why wouldn't the fishery assistance, if that is an \nemergency, come out of that money?\n  The budget gimmicks. This bill is just replete with gamesmanship to \ntry to get around pay-go. I refer to pay-go as ``swiss cheese-go,'' \nwhich is very appropriate in a farm bill. I assume it is subsidized.\n  The fact is, there is $18 billion of gimmicks in this bill. There are \nsunsets of programs after 5 years that they know are not going to \nsunset, so they won't be scored. There is the nonscoring still of the \nmilk income loss compensation issue. There is the classic shift of the \ncorporate tax one day so that you collect it a day earlier or a day \nlater, and that gives you a different score, which allows you to avoid \nthe pay-go rules.\n  If you look at this budget, it had to have pay-go waived in the \nHouse, with $7.4 billion out of whack for pay-go in the House.\n  Equally ironic, tomorrow we are going to take up the conference \nreport on our budget, on the unified budget. If the budget that passed \nthe Senate earlier this year were in place now, a pay-go point of order \nwould lie against this bill because it violates the very budget that \nwas produced by the majority party and passed with some fanfare earlier \nthis year. The only reason we cannot make the pay-go point of order is \nbecause the budget has not fully passed and therefore is not in effect. \nBut I think it is very hard to, with a straight face, say this bill \ndoes not violate pay-go when you know that right around the corner is a \nbudget which was passed by the majority which, if it were in place and \nwhich I presume it will be in place fairly soon, a pay-go point of \norder would lie against this bill.\n  I think we can stop talking about pay-go around here as an \nenforcement mechanism because it clearly does not exist, and this bill \nis just another example of where it has been gamed and manipulated. We \ncount 15 to 20 different examples, adding up to something around $143 \nbillion of instances where pay-go has been gamed around here. And this \nbill just takes that total up a little further--not a little further, a \nlot further, $18 billion further. So as a result, enforcing pay-go \nbecomes very--well, it is just a very fraudulent exercise. It is only \nused on very rare occasions when it is politically acceptable for the \nmajority to use it. On other occasions, where it might lie, it is \ngamed.\n  This bill is one of the extraordinary examples of that gamesmanship.\n  And, of course, I mentioned customs fees. I believe the last count is \nwe have used customs fees to fund 55 different programs around here in \n55 different instances. The same fees. No, they are not different fees. \nThey are the exact same fees that have been used, I believe, 55 times \nto fund different programs so the programs can claim they met the \nbudget rules, and this bill--maybe it is 56 or 54, but it is $10 \nbillion of gamesmanship.\n  The bill has, in my opinion, decoupled economic common sense from the \nfarm production and especially from farm payments. If we want a farm \nsystem that works, why don't we go to the market? A lot of these \ncommodities today are doing pretty doggone well, extremely well. It is \ngood times in farm country for most people. Why don't we let the market \ncontinue to work? Why do we have to set up these massive subsidy \nprograms? Why do we have to have a sugar program that charges American \nconsumers twice the world rate for sugar? It makes no sense. Why do we \nhave to have a slush fund for emergencies when nobody else has that \nsort of slush fund? Why do we have to have a new program for asparagus? \nI think asparagus growers are probably pretty competitive. I don't know \nwho their competition is. Maybe the Chinese grow asparagus. I suspect \nmost asparagus growers can compete with the Chinese. I prefer American \nasparagus, by the way.\n\n  Let's let the markets do this rather than create this bill which is \nsuch a mutation of every idea that Adam Smith put forward which has \nmade, quite honestly, our country strong, the basis of which basically \nwon the Cold War, which was that free markets work, capitalism works, \ncompetition works, the rules of supply and demand work, that you let \npeople produce the product that has a comparative advantage, and they \nproduce it better and more efficiently, especially Americans, and you \nget it at a better price for the consumer, and the taxpayers don't end \nup with the bill.\n  I know I am not going to win this battle. The way this bill is \nstructured, it is the classic log-rolling exercise. You pick this group \nthat has this interest and you give them a subsidy and they give you a \nvote. Then you go over here, pick this group, they have an interest, \nthey get a subsidy, and you get their vote. You pick this group that \nhas an interest, give them a dramatic increase in their program--it all \nadds up to 80 votes around here. The only problem is, the people who \npay are our kids and our consumers. This is taking a lamb chop to the \nhead of the American consumer and just pounding him with it. I just \nthought of that.\n  In any event, I have a point of order which lies against this bill \nwhich I wish to make at this time because this bill violates \ninnumerable points of order in spirit, and were the budget the Senator \nfrom North Dakota brought to the floor in law at this time, passed as a \nresolution at this time, it would violate them in reality also. But \nthere is at least one budget point of order which is a holdover from a \nprior chairman which makes considerable sense, which is that you should \nnot run up the\n\n[[Page S4160]]\n\ndebt on the next generation by adding spending in outyears without \npaying for it that this bill still violates.\n  Mr. President, section 203 of the 2008 budget resolution makes it out \nof order to consider legislation that increases the deficit by more \nthan $5 billion in the Senate for any of the four 10-year periods, \nstarting in fiscal year 2018. The pending bill would increase the long-\nterm net deficit in excess of $5 billion. Therefore, I raise a point of \norder under section 203 of S. Con. Res. 21 against the pending bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, pursuant to section 203 of the Concurrent \nResolution 21, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year \n2008, I move to waive section 203 of that concurrent resolution for \npurposes of the pending conference report, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays at the appropriate time.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the leaders on this bill for their courtesy on the \nfloor, the chairman and the ranking member. They have given me more \nthan a reasonable amount of time to express my thoughts. I understand I \nhave totally swayed them to my view and they will be joining me in my \nposition. I also very much appreciate the courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have enjoyed immensely listening to the \ndescription of this bill of the Senator from New Hampshire who is the \nranking member of the Budget Committee, which I chair. I have great \nrespect for Senator Gregg and affection for him.\n  The description he has given of this bill has almost no relationship \nto the legislation that is before us. It is enormously entertaining but \nit is largely a fiction. It is a fiction that is interesting to listen \nto, but again it bears almost no relationship to the legislation before \nus.\n  The Senator made reference to Soviet economists. Let's make clear, \nthe American system of food production is the most efficient, the \ncheapest, the most plentiful, the most stable, the safest in the world. \nAmericans have less of their disposable income going for food at this \ntime than consumers at any time in the history of the world.\n  Let me repeat that. The American consumer today enjoys the lowest \ncost of food in relationship to our income of any consumer in the \nhistory of the world. That is a fact.\n  In fact, the Wall Street Journal published, last year, an article in \nwhich they said--and I want to read this. I hope people will pay \nattention. People need to understand how remarkable the American \nagriculture system has been and is. This is what they said:\n\n       The prospect for a long boom is riveting economists because \n     the declining real price of grain has long been one of the \n     unsung forces behind the development of the global economy. \n     Thanks to steadily improving seeds, synthetic fertilizers and \n     more powerful farm equipment, the productivity of farmers in \n     the West and Asia has stayed so far ahead of population \n     growth that prices of corn and wheat, adjusted for inflation, \n     have dropped 75 percent and 69 percent, respectively, since \n     1974. Among other things, falling grain prices made food more \n     affordable for the world's poor, helping shrink the \n     percentage of the world's population that is malnourished.\n\n  That is a result of the genius of American farm policy and the \nextraordinary productivity of American farmers and ranchers working \nwithin that system.\n  When the Senator says this counters market economics and leads to \npayments when prices are high, he obviously does not know how the farm \nprogram works. It is the opposite of what the Senator suggested. The \nway the system works is there is support from the Government when \nprices are low to prevent a collapse of the productive system. When \nprices are high, the support fades away. That is the way the system \nworks. It does not increase support at times of high prices. It is \nprecisely the opposite.\n  The Senator said the reform provisions in this bill only save less \nthan $300 million. Wrong. The reform provisions in this bill save close \nto $3 billion, and I will specify that momentarily.\n  The Senator says the disaster program is a slush fund. Really? A \nslush fund? Let's review the facts. In the last 3 years, every State in \nthe Nation has received disaster payments--none of it budgeted for, \nnone of it paid for. In this bill disaster assistance is budgeted for \nand paid for. That is a reform and that is a fact.\n  One of the things I am most interested in is the Senator suggested \nmillionaires could still get farm program support under this bill. Yes, \nand lightning strikes once in a while, too. Because that is what it \nwould take for a millionaire to get support under this program. I have \njust gotten results from the IRS moments ago because I wanted to know, \nwith the new limits put in place--which, by the way, are very dramatic \nreform. It used to be, under current law on nonfarmers, they had a \nlimit of $2.5 million of adjusted gross income before they would start \nto lose farm program payments. We have reduced that for nonfarm income \nto $500,000.\n  There is another limit for farm income. Farm income, that had no \nlimit in the past, now begins a limit at $750,000, at which, of that \nadjusted gross income, farm income of that amount, you lose all of your \ndirect payments. But the two could go together. In other words, you \ncould have somebody with $750,000 of farm income and $500,000 of \nnonfarm income, and still be under the limits. So I thought, wouldn't \nit be interesting to find out how many farmers in the country would be \nin that category--$750,000 of farm income and $500,000 of nonfarm \nincome--because that is what the press is all talking about. They add \nthe two together and then they double it because of a spouse. Do you \nknow how many are in that category in the whole United States? How many \nwould have $500,000 of nonfarm income and $750,000 of farm income?\n  Do you know how many the IRS has reported to me there are in the \nentire United States? Zero. None. So much for the argument from the \nSenator from New Hampshire. Facts are stubborn things.\n  Let's go to the essence of this bill. Why do we need support for \nfarmers at all? It is a legitimate question. The Senator asked why \ndon't we do it for the guy who has a shoe store? Why don't we do it for \nthe guy who has some other small business? Here is the reason. Because \nwe are in a world economy in which our major competitors have made a \ndecision to strongly support their producers--far more strongly than we \nsupport ours.\n  Our major competitors in world agriculture are the Europeans. This is \nhow much they spend to support their producers: $134 billion. This is \nafter the so-called cap reform in Europe that dramatically reduced what \nthey do. This is where they wound up: $134 billion.\n  Here is where we are: $43 billion. So they are outgunning us over 3 \nto 1 on support to their producers over what we do for ours.\n  OK, I had an interviewer say to me: That is wrong. Maybe it is wrong \nbut it is reality. What would happen if we yanked this support out from \nunder our producers when our major competitors are providing three \ntimes as much support to theirs? We did an analysis. Do you know what \nwe found? Here would be the result. Two words: Mass bankruptcy. Because \nif your major competitors are providing three times as much support to \ntheir producers as we provide to ours and we yank the rug out from \nunder ours, guess what happens: The Europeans take over world \nagriculture.\n  Wouldn't that be great, if we became dependent on foreign food the \nway we are dependent on foreign oil? That is what the critics of this \nagriculture policy apparently would prefer. But those of us who have \nstudied it and those of us who have fought to ensure that we retain a \nstrong agriculture component in this country have concluded that would \nbe a disaster for the American economy, for American consumers, and \nthat would be a disaster for our farmers and ranchers.\n  Where does the money go in this bill? We have looked at, and just \nreceived, a final analysis. Two-thirds of the spending in this bill \ngoes for nutrition--two-thirds of the money in this bill. This is the \nabsolute low-ball estimate of what goes for nutrition. You could do an \nanalysis that would take it up to as much as 73 or 74 percent. It \ndepends on what you include and exclude. We have\n\n[[Page S4161]]\n\ntried to do this based on CBO analysis of the final scoring of this \nbill.\n  Nine percent goes for conservation. Only 13.9 percent goes for \ncommodities, that is the support for farmers and ranchers, and about 8 \npercent for crop insurance. That is where the money goes.\n  When the other side asserts that this increases the deficit and it is \nnot paid for, they are making things up. They are making things up. \nBecause this is the score by the Congressional Budget Office. Here it \nis. This is not Kent Conrad's numbers. This is not the Agriculture \nCommittee's numbers. These are the numbers of the Congressional Budget \nOffice and the Joint Committee on Taxation. They are independent. They \nare professional. They are nonpartisan. They are responsible for the \nscoring of all legislation before the Congress of the United States, \nand here is their conclusion. Over 5 years, this bill saves $67 \nmillion. Over 10 years, it saves $110 million. So all the spending has \nbeen offset, has been paid for. In fact, we have done a little bit \nmore. So the net result is to actually reduce the deficit over 5 years \nby a modest amount--$67 million; over 10 years by $110 million.\n  But these are facts. This is not make believe. This is not make \nthings up. This isn't the administration saying there is $20 billion \nhere above the baseline--that is all made up. We are dealing with \nfacts. We are dealing with reality.\n  When I hear them make these claims that we did not address the \nadministration's concerns--we spent hour after hour after hour in this \nconference committee, attempting to address administration concerns. I \nthink we did a pretty good job. The reality is the administration \nchanged their stated concerns so often it was hard to keep track of \nwhat their priority was. In fact, at the end they came to us and said \nthey had no priority, that all of their demands were nonnegotiable, \nthat all of them should be treated with equal importance.\n  I have never negotiated with any administration on anything that came \nin with a list of nonnegotiable demands and said everything had the \nhighest priority, but here is what we tried to do. They said we had to \nlimit any additional resources to $10 billion. We agreed to that. They \nsaid it had to be offset with spending cuts. We agreed to that. They \nsaid that the adjusted gross income limits for farmers and nonfarmers \nhad to be reduced significantly. We did that. They said there had to be \nbeneficial interest reform to avoid the kind of scandal you saw in \nKatrina. We did that.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire said we did not, that a farmer could \nsimply pick the right time to market his crop and avoid the \nconsequences of any kind of reasonable restraint. That is not--they \nhave not read the bill. In the bill we give the administration special \nauthority in a disaster to prevent the Katrina abuse we all saw. In \naddition, we added an additional reform requiring a 30-day moving \naverage for prices before somebody could fix their marketing loan. That \nis a very significant reform. Yet it is very clear, the critics have \nnever bothered to read the bill.\n  We also were asked by the administration to provide a revenue \ncountercyclical program, and we did.\n  They asked us to provide planting flexibility. And we did. They asked \nus to provide food aid flexibility. And we did. They have a series of \nmiscellaneous provisions we tried to honor, including limitations on \nprivatizing food stamps; Cuba trade provisions; out-of-lease fees. We \nanswered each one of those objections.\n  It does not stop there. Because we have heard the critics say there \nis no reform, no reform in this bill. I will tell you, that is the \nbiggest fiction of all. That is the biggest fiction of all. Let's talk \nabout the reform that is in this bill.\n  First, significant adjusted gross income limit adjustments to \nprohibit payments to Manhattan millionaires. That is in this bill. We \nrequired payments to be attributed to living, breathing human beings \ninstead of paper entities. We eliminated the three-entity rule that \nallowed paper entities to evade payment limits.\n  We cut direct payments by $300 million. We produced schedule F reform \nthat will save $479 million. We reformed crop insurance, saving $5.6 \nbillion. We decreased support for corn-based ethanol, saving $1.2 \nbillion. We prohibited payments to cowboy starter kits and ranchettes.\n  We reformed disaster assistance so that it is budgeted and paid for. \nI might also add, we reformed disaster assistance so we would prevent \nwhat happened in the bad old days where somebody could have a loss on \none part of their operation and gains on another part and still get a \ndisaster payment. That is all over. If you do not have, on your whole \nfarm, disaster losses, you will not get a disaster payment in the \nfuture. That is reform.\n  Facts are stubborn things. In short, we have gone the extra mile to \naddress the administration's legitimate requests and provided reform in \nthis bill.\n  I wish to take a few minutes to address three other claims the \nadministration has made, because they are especially egregious and \nfalse.\n  The administration's spokesman said:\n\n       At a time of record farm income, Congress decides to \n     further increase farm subsidy rates.\n\n  More fiction. Here is the fact. The conference proposal does not \nincrease subsidies at times of record farm income. To the contrary, the \nconference proposal: cuts direct payments by $300 million, reduces \ncommodity spending by $3.5 billion, reduces the ethanol tax credit by \n$1.2 billion.\n  The conference proposal only pays producers if prices collapse or \nwhen there is a loss of production. I am talking now about marketing \nloans. I am talking about the countercyclical program. Let me give you \nan example of what they are talking about.\n  They say we have increased farm subsidy rates at a time of record \nfarm income. Let me give this example to show you how truly absurd that \nstatement is. Wheat prices now average about $8 a bushel. Okay. That is \nwhat you get when you go to market. You go to sell, you get about $8 a \nbushel for wheat. We increased the loan rate from $2.75 to $2.94. We \nincreased the loan rate from $2.75 to $2.94. We increased the target \nprice from $3.92 to $4.17.\n  Obviously, neither one of those has any application when prices are \nhigh. The only way you would get the benefit of these safety net \nproposals is if prices were to collapse. We have not increased the \nsupport when prices are high; we have strengthened the safety net in \ncase prices collapse. Facts are stubborn things.\n  In fact, the only one--the only one--who is a party to these \nnegotiations who talked about increasing support when prices are high \nwas the administration. They proposed increasing direct payments by \n$5.5 billion. Those are payments that would go out to farmers at a time \nof high prices. Facts are stubborn things.\n  When they say there has been no reform in this bill, here is the \ntotal spending under the farm bill compared to total Federal spending: \nless than 2 percent of Federal spending, and the support for commodity \nprograms is one-quarter of 1 percent of the entire Federal budget; one-\nquarter of 1 percent.\n  When we wrote the farm bill in 2002, the estimates were that \ncommodity programs would take three-quarters of 1 percent of all \nFederal spending. So support for commodity programs has been cut by \ntwo-thirds. That is a dramatic reform. Where did the money go? All of \nthe new money, the $10 billion we are above baseline here, has been \npaid for by other spending cuts. All of it went to nutrition.\n  Now, on the disaster program--I want to end on this note--here are \nthe States that got disaster payments over the last 3 years. Texas \nqualifies too, because it got payments. So every single State, and \nGuam, plus Puerto Rico, got support under the disaster program. None of \nit budgeted for, none of it paid for. In this disaster proposal, we \nbudget for it and we pay for it. And to have the former chairman of the \nBudget Committee suggest this is a slush fund--no, no, no. What this is \nis being responsible. That is what this is called, because we know \nthere are going to be disasters. We do not know what they are, we do \nnot know where they are going to occur, but we know they will occur. \nInstead of leaving it out, putting it on the charge card, we budgeted \nfor it and paid for it. This disaster program is not only budgeted for \nand paid for, it also will only go to people who\n\n[[Page S4162]]\n\nactually have disaster losses. It also requires them to have crop \ninsurance.\n  The CBO scoring proves this will increase the use of crop insurance, \nwhich is good for taxpayers as well as farmers.\n  One other thing that is very important to understand. This will \nprotect against cuts in conservation. Because the one time they did pay \nfor disaster programs, where did they take the money? They took it out \nof conservation. What a shortsighted approach that was. We have \nhopefully prevented that from happening again.\n  I am extremely proud of the product that has been produced by this \ngroup of Senators and Congressmen on a bipartisan basis. I thank our \nchairman, Chairman Harkin, for bringing a vision of change to this farm \nbill. Without that vision, without his passion for it, without his \npushing for it, moving in the direction of a greater emphasis on \nconservation, it would never have happened; and to our ranking member, \nSenator Chambliss, who has been a strong guiding voice throughout these \ndeliberations. He is somebody I formed a very close working \nrelationship with as we wrote this bill. He has had the best interests \nnot only of farmers and ranchers, he has had the best interests of this \ncountry foremost in his mind every step of the way. This country and \ncertainly his State owes him an enormous debt of gratitude. We thank \nSenator Chambliss for the extraordinary time and effort he has put into \nthis bill.\n\n  To Chairman Baucus, the chairman of the Finance Committee, who has \nbeen such a rock throughout this process, who provided strong \nleadership at every step of the way, and helped provide the financing, \nalong with the ranking member of the Finance Committee, Senator \nGrassley, who also participated in hour after hour, day after day, week \nafter week, of deliberations to form a bill that was responsible, and \nwho provided much of the push to get these reforms adopted.\n  Now, I recognize this does not have all of the reforms certainly the \nSenator from Iowa would have liked, but we would never have gotten this \nmuch without his pushing. Chairman Peterson, on the House side, no one \nworked harder to get this result. I applaud him for the remarkable vote \nin the House today. The legislation passed there 318 to 106. That is in \nthe face of a Presidential veto threat.\n  The ranking member, Congressman Goodlatte, whom I came to have great \nrespect for in these discussions; thoughtful, responsible, rational. \nChairman Rangel, who helped us with the funding so we could pay for \nthis bill without any tax increase.\n  Congressman Pomeroy, the only Member of the House to serve on both \nWays and Means and the House Agriculture Committee, who played such an \nimportant role.\n  In the Senate we cannot forget those other Members who played such \nkey roles: Senator Leahy with the dairy provisions, former chairman of \nthe committee; Senator Stabenow, who is, in large part, responsible for \nthe dramatic improvement in the treatment of specialty crops that are \nsuch an important and growing part of American agriculture; and Senator \nLincoln, Blanche Lambert Lincoln. I tell you, her constituents have got \na fighter in their corner every day. Nobody is a more aggressive \nfighter for her folks than the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Before I end, I wanted to say a few thanks to staff as well, because \nthis has been an effort that has gone on well more than a year. I want \nto thank my own legislative director, Tom Mahr, who played such an \nimportant role in making this all work financially. Jim Miller, my lead \nnegotiator. Jim Miller has given body and soul to this effort. I am so \nproud of him. He is an encyclopedia on agriculture. He is also \nextremely adept with the numbers. I estimate Jim Miller has spent 3,000 \nhours on this effort.\n  I also want to recognize Scott Stofferahn, who is my other lead \nnegotiator, who is the father of these disaster provisions, worked with \nthe agriculture commissioners around the country to come up with the \nprovisions for this reform.\n  John Fuher of my staff who is a young man who came on this team and \nbrought his ``A'' game. Joe McGarvey, who does the energy work on my \nstaff. Miles Patrie, who worked on the nutrition provisions. My deepest \nappreciation for their extraordinary effort. Day after day, night after \nnight, weekend after weekend sacrificed.\n  To the chairman's staff, Mark Halverson and Susan Keith, who have \nspent--I would not even know how to calculate the time and effort. I do \nknow Mark Halverson has gone gray in the effort.\n  The Finance Committee staff, as well. Before I mention them, I wish \nto single out the extraordinary staff of Senator Chambliss: Martha \nScott Poindexter, Vernie Hubert, Hayden Milberg. What first-class \npeople. These are the kinds of public servants who deserve everyone's \nrespect.\n  On the Finance Committee staff, Russ Sullivan, Cathy Koch, Rebecca \nBaxter, Jon Selib, Senator Baucus's legislative director.\n  Senator Grassley's staff, who are outstanding as well, absolutely \noutstanding: Elizabeth Paris, Kolan Davis, Mark Prater, first-rate \npeople who did their level best for the American people.\n  I can tell you, I have never been more proud to be part of an effort \nthan I was to be involved in this one.\n  I see somebody else on the floor, the former chairman of the House \nAgriculture Committee, the Senator from Texas--the Senator from Kansas; \nI was seeing if I could get a rise out of him--Mr. Roberts, who has \nbeen of so much importance to this conference effort and to the effort \nin the Senate Agriculture Committee as well.\n  I tell you, I am proud of this product. This is a bipartisan product. \nThis is a bipartisan effort. It is good policy and it deserves our \ncolleagues' support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this farm bill has been a very long \nprocess. Last fall the Senate Agriculture Committee asked the Senate \nFinance Committee to help make up a budget shortfall we faced, and the \nFinance Committee on which I serve stepped up to the plate. With eight \nmembers of the Finance Committee also being members of the Agriculture \nCommittee, we had a real desire to make sure rural America had the best \nfarm bill possible. So following on what Senator Conrad said about \nfellow Senators deserving compliments for their hard work, I am only \ngoing to single out my colleague from Iowa Senator Harkin and my \ncolleague from Georgia Senator Chambliss, the top two members of the \ncommittee, thanking them for the countless hours and weekends they put \ninto this bill for a long period of time; for some, over a period of a \nyear.\n  This was as difficult a farm bill to write and conference as I have \never seen. My colleagues so far have given a good overview of what this \nbill contains and what it does for those who are hungry, those who are \nliving in rural America, and those who are still involved in family \nfarm operations. But I wanted to take a minute to highlight a few of \nthe items that were most important to me and, obviously, to my home \nState of Iowa. I think I have some experience to talk about because I \nstill sharecrop with my son Robin.\n  This isn't a blanket approval of the bill. I did have some \nreservations about the bill because I didn't think it went far enough \nin two true farm bill areas--payment limits and competition reform.\n  First, the ban on packer ownership that had been a part of the Senate \nbill when it passed the Senate failed in an amendment I offered in \nconference committee. This is unfortunate because the livestock \nindustry continues to become more vertically integrated and \nconsolidated. I think that is bad for the independent producer. The \nrecent announcement, for instance, that JBS Swift plans to acquire \nSmithfield Beef Group, National Beef, and Five Rivers Feedlot should be \nalarming to us as legislators. I continually have to wonder if when we \nget down to just one single slaughterhouse, one single packinghouse, \nwill the Department of Justice and Congress begin to raise questions \nabout the trend we have had for consolidation? This is a trend that \ncontinues to make it more difficult for independent producers to have \nchoice in to whom they sell their livestock and making it more \ndifficult to get a fair price for their livestock as the cash market \ncontinues to shrink. We were able to include some reforms in the \nlivestock title, regardless of not\n\n[[Page S4163]]\n\ndoing what I think should have been done.\n  The Senate version of the farm bill included my language which banned \nmandatory arbitration clauses in production contracts. I drafted this \nbill after hearing about problems where producers were being forced to \nenter into expensive arbitration proceedings, thus giving up all their \nrights to have disputes finally resolved through the independent \njudiciary. While we weren't able to have the arbitration language from \nmy bill included, we did reform production contracts to give growers a \ntrue choice in selecting dispute resolution, ending the practice of \nforced mandatory arbitration in binding contracts. The farm bill \nconference report requires that contracts provide a clear statement of \nchoice to producers upfront as to which track of dispute resolution \nthey might want to use--arbitration or the court process. It also \nprohibits the integrators from pressuring growers to make one choice or \nthe other. Any interference with the choice would constitute a \nviolation of the Packers and Stockyards Act. Further, the language \nstates that if a grower declines arbitration upfront, that grower can \nstill choose arbitration at the time the dispute arises, if both \nparties consent to the use of arbitration. Together these provisions \nconstitute significant reforms and will help level the playing field \nfor our growers.\n  Secondly, I don't think the payment limitation reform goes far \nenough, and Senator Conrad recognized that in the final part of his \nremarks, that that is a concern I had. He did give me credit for \npushing and pushing and pushing and bringing it to the point where it \nis. I believe it doesn't go far enough. Because on this Senate floor, \nwe had 57 votes to reduce the cap on all three forms of commodity \npayments--direct payments, countercyclical and market loan benefits, \nand loan deficiency payments. But we ended up having a fight in \nconference just to keep those levels of current law. That is the good \nnews. The bad news is we didn't go as far as what those 57 votes on the \nfloor of the Senate thought we should do, a hard cap of $250,000.\n  So what did we do in its place? Senator Conrad explained some of \nthis, but I wish to emphasize it because it is a lot better than if we \ndid what the President asked us to do today, that we not pass this \nbill. There is indication it will be vetoed and that we ought to extend \nthe existing farm bill for 1 year or 2 years. Well, when it comes to \nlimitations on farm income and who can participate in the farm program \nand who cannot, those limitations in present law at $2.5 million are \nlaughable and, quite frankly, aren't even being enforced at that level \npresently. So I come to the conclusion that what we have is better than \npresent law, not as good as what I want but, for the first time, having \nsomething that is fairly meaningful toward reform and limits on high-\nincome people benefiting from the farm program.\n  The adjusted gross income limit did come down substantially, so that \nis a step in the right direction. For the first time, we have a cap on \nfarm income of $750,000. Previously, there was no cap on farm income. \nIt will bring a $2.5 million adjusted gross income cap on nonfarm \nincome down from that $2.5 million that I said is laughable and \nprobably not enforced, down to a $500,000 cap on nonfarm income. But \nthese adjusted gross income limits are still too high, frankly, as far \nas I am concerned. In some parts of the country, they may not be. I \nhave to admit that even though I am a farmer, I may not understand \nagriculture in California, Texas, and the Southeast. But I sure \nunderstand agriculture in the States of the Plains and the Midwest. You \ngo to almost any farmer and tell them that we put this limit of \n$500,000 in for nonfarm income or that we put in a $750,000 cap on farm \nincome, they are going to kind of laugh at us and wonder if we haven't \nbeen in Washington too long.\n  On the other hand, negotiation around here is the art of compromise, \nand so I am going to vote for this bill with these caps in it. I am \ngoing to thank my colleagues who negotiated for going a lot further the \nlast few days than I ever thought they would go. Hopefully, this keeps \nsome people who have the ability to withstand natural disaster, to \nwithstand sometimes politics affecting farm income, sometimes war, \nsometimes international trade issues affecting farm income, people at \nthis level have the ability to withstand that. Smaller and medium-size \nfarmers don't have that ability. That is why we have a farm program. So \nthere is some level of income where people ought to be able to \nwithstand things that are beyond their control and still be in the \nbusiness of farming.\n  I am asking the people in the State of Iowa to look at these caps as \nbeing a step in the right direction, not satisfying me but still better \nthan present law. That is why I think it is very necessary that we get \nthis into law. Hopefully, down the road we can make things even better.\n  I happened to have the Government Accountability Office pull data for \nme on how many folks are actually getting payments over these new \nincome limits. Honestly, there aren't a lot. The conference committee \ntook steps, though, in other areas of reform; for instance, in the \nright direction by eliminating the three-entity rule and going to a \nsystem of direct attribution. In this particular instance, we do away \nwith the legal subterfuge of where there are limits in existing law, \nthat people could split up into three different units and each unit get \nthe limits that are presently allowed. So that legal subterfuge is done \naway with. Also, in the commodity title, the administration, the House, \nand the Senate all recognize the importance of including revenue \nprotection programs for farmers. All three groups, however, took \ndifferent approaches. I am pleased that an average crop revenue program \nwas included in the final bill as an option for farmers and \nparticularly because the hard work from this comes from a lot of corn \nproducers in my State.\n  Not only that, we were able to make the program a more viable option \nfor producers and make it available to them in the next crop year, \n2009. I am excited to see what type of participation we get in the \nprogram and the outcome of it, so that in the next farm bill debate, we \ncan decide whether revenue protection works. The people who thought \nthis up, those of us on the committee who went with the \nrecommendations, have confidence in the people who thought it up. But \nthere is nothing like the real world of seeing whether it works. So we \nhave a few years to make that determination. I hope it does work.\n  In addition, the White House has continued to say Congress can't use \ntiming shifts to save money and somehow they didn't count. Well, they \ndo count because farmers are going to have to make a judgment in the \nway they do things to accommodate. Farm program payments will come \nlater in the year, but they will be expected to make crop insurance \npayments earlier. So in fact, these do count and will pinch the \ncashflow of a lot of independent producers, whether the White House \nwants to believe it or not.\n  All that being said, I am pleased this farm bill is making \nsignificant investments in rural America. I would like to point out a \nprogram that I have named the Value-Added Producer Grant Program as one \nof those. It has had a bit of a facelift since I first worked on this. \nI bet it has been 6 or 7 years ago. But it is targeting funds directly \nto beginning farmers and to ranchers, which is critical to getting \nyoung farmers into business. I continue to hear good things about these \ndollars being invested right into rural communities, and so I am \npleased we could get some mandatory money into the program, even though \nthe farm bill dollars were very tight.\n  I have also worked to give Black farmers, African-American farmers, \napplying for Farm Service Agency loans who were involved in the Pigford \nv. USDA discrimination lawsuit a chance to have their claims heard. \nThat is why I introduced earlier in 2007 the Pigford Claims Remedy Act. \nThere were circumstances out of these farmers' control, and they \nweren't able to get their claims filed timely. The conference report \nprovides that these claimants who have not had their cases determined \non the merits may, in civil action, obtain that determination. In other \nwords, they are going to have their day in court that they feel they \ndid not get with the administrative process. It is time justice was \ndone for these African-American farmers. Civil rights at\n\n[[Page S4164]]\n\nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture has management problems that still \nneed to be addressed, so I want that department to know I will be \nwatching over the administration of this Pigford program very \ncarefully.\n  Last year, I called for a Government Accountability Office report on \nfarm payments going to farmers who had already died. We even held a \nhearing on this issue before the Senate Finance Committee. The Farm \nService Agency paying dead farmers was a classic example of waste, \nfraud, and abuse. It is a classic example of a department not doing its \njob.\n  Now, I am not saying there might not be legitimate reasons to keep \nestates of dead people open for a few years. But there was something \nwrong with people who did not report that the structure of the farming \noperation had changed, that somebody had died, and continued to get \nfarm program payments in a dead person's name.\n  So the farm bill is proactive in requiring the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture to check payments against taxpayers' ID numbers at the \nInternal Revenue Service. I am cautiously optimistic, however. I \nrequested a new Government Accountability Office report, and in \npreliminary briefings I have learned that the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture does not even enforce the current $2.5 million AGI limits. \nIt makes me wonder how they are ever going to enforce the more \ncomplicated AGI limits we have put in place.\n  I should also add that based on the two Government Accountability \nOffice reports already released, we closed a fraudulent farm loss \nloophole that allows operations to evade payment limits. We also were \nable to shut down the generic certificate abuse with new Commodity \nCredit Corporation 1099 reporting that I had asked the Treasury \nDepartment to do something about way back in 2001, and, quite frankly, \nthey have done nothing.\n  Another issue I often hear from constituents about is the abuse of \nthe rural broadband loans going into areas where service is either \nalready provided by other capable entities or a high percentage of \nhouseholds already have service. I do not believe the Government should \nbe in the business of subsidizing competition. We ought to be in the \nbusiness of helping people who do not even have the service.\n  Thus, we were able to include in the new farm bill a requirement that \nin order to be eligible for a loan, the provider needs to be applying \nfor an area where 25 percent of the people do not have service and \nwhere not more than three incumbent service providers are already \nlocated.\n  I want to shift gears a bit now from the Agriculture Committee's role \nto my role as a member of the Senate Finance Committee. Through that \nrole, I was able to secure even more reforms to agricultural policy \nwhile protecting the interests of farmers and ranchers.\n  When the House passed this bill with a revenue offset for the extra \nagricultural spending, I raised a concern to the tax-writing \ncommittees. By yielding several billion dollars in new revenue for new \nspending, the Ways and Means Committee established, in my judgment, a \nvery dangerous precedent.\n  There is always great temptation for any committees in the Congress \nthat have a veracious appetite for new spending to view the Ways and \nMeans Committee on the other side of the Hill or the Finance Committee \nin the Senate--the tax-writing committees, in other words--as some sort \nof a cash register. From a fiscal disciplinary standpoint, this \npressure, if unchecked, will lead to larger and larger government and \nhigher and higher taxes.\n  The hard-working American taxpayer is the loser because revenue \noffsets are diverted from the highest and best uses: tax policy and \ndeficit reduction. The proliferation of reserve funds in budget \nresolutions under both parties--I want to say both parties; so my party \nis guilty of this as well--is very clear evidence of this pressure as \nwell. Those reserve funds might as well be labeled as tax-and-spend \nfunds because the committees that request them are not likely to cut \nany spending.\n  So I raised concerns early in the farm bill deliberation about a very \ndangerous slippery slope that Congress or the tax-writing committees \nmight be heading for.\n  So I am pleased to say in the Senate process, Chairman Baucus \nlistened to my concerns and agreed. We made it clear that we would hold \nthe line, and we did hold the line. The Finance Committee marked up a \nbill that took care of agricultural priorities. But where we use \nFinance Committee resources, we kept the benefits and authority within \nthe Finance Committee.\n  Everyone knows the Finance Committee action made it possible for the \nAgriculture Committee to move forward to spend more money than was in \nthe baseline. We took some of the policy pressure, then, off of the \nAgriculture Committee.\n  The schedule and press stories bear out that basic point. We held the \nline between agricultural policy in the Agriculture Committee and \nagricultural policy in the Finance Committee when the farm bill was \nprocessed on the Senate floor. Remember, that passed, I think, with 77 \nvotes.\n  Now, the conference was quite a different matter. In the end, we kept \na decent but much smaller package of agricultural tax relief offsets \nwith agricultural tax reforms. We also split the baby, from the \njurisdictional point of view.\n  An extension of the Customs user fees, which is a tax-writing \ncommittee offset, was used to offset the $10 billion in new \nagricultural spending; in other words, meaning the $10 billion above \nbaseline. About half of that, the part dealing with the new \nagricultural disaster relief trust fund, is in Finance Committee \njurisdiction. The balance is going to pay for new agricultural spending \nabove the budget baseline.\n  In my view, this was an unfortunate and troubling compromise for the \ntax-writing committees. We mitigated some of the damage to the \ninstitutional structure of the tax-writing committees, but we also at \nthe same time opened the door. It is a door I was glad to keep slammed \nshut during the years I chaired the Finance Committee. I worry greatly \nabout the precedent that has been set here. Pressure will be brought to \nbear in the future for more nontax-writing committee spending to be \noffset with Finance Committee resources.\n  I sincerely worry about the effect of this precedent on the power and \nresources of the two chairmen, my friends, Mr. Rangel, the chairman of \nthe House Ways and Means Committee, and Senator Baucus, the chairman of \nthe Senate Finance Committee. Other committees are loathe to cut their \nspending and to reform large programs in their jurisdictions.\n  So the easy street for other committees is to assign their funding \nproblems to the tax-writing committees and to blame the tax-writing \ncommittees for any funding problems. As my friends, the two chairmen, \nknow better than anyone else, the demands within the tax-writing \ncommittees for offsets are a big challenge just to do the work the tax-\nwriting committees have to do.\n  I hope we all have learned a lesson. We should not use the tax-\nwriting committees' resources as an easy way out for other committees \nthat are reluctant to make the tough choices in the oversight and \ndevelopment of programs in their jurisdiction.\n  There have been also some significant benefits, though, from the \nSenate Finance Committee's involvement in this bill.\n  The farm bill also includes some customs and trade provisions that I \nwant to address. First, it includes a compromise on expanding our \nexisting trade preference program for Haiti.\n  This was a priority for the chairman of the House Ways and Means \nCommittee. In addition to expanding Haiti's trade preferences, the \ncompromise calls upon the President to identify any textile or apparel \nproducers in Haiti that fail to comply with core labor standards, as \ndefined in the legislation, or the labor laws of Haiti that relate to \nthe core labor standards.\n  The statement of managers accompanying the conference report states \nvery clearly that the Conferees recognize that the core labor standards \ndefined in the legislation refer to the rights as listed in the 1998 \nInternational Labor Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles \nand Rights at Work and its Follow Up.\n  We voted for the 1998 ILO Declaration. We respect, promote, and \nrealize the labor standards stated in the 1998 ILO Declaration. \nMoreover, the legislation applies only with respect to labor practices \nin Haiti. It does not address and cannot impact our domestic labor \npractices in any way.\n\n[[Page S4165]]\n\n  Now, the legislation further calls upon the International Labor \nOrganization to report periodically on the compliance of individual \nproducers in Haiti with the core labor standards and the labor laws of \nHaiti.\n  And the legislation directs that in identifying producers that fail \nto comply with core labor standards, the President shall consider these \nILO reports. The President is free to consider any other information, \nand the final decision rests entirely with the President.\n  Nothing in the legislation forces the President to make any \nparticular determination. It just says that the President shall \nconsider these reports.\n  And if the President determines that a producer in Haiti is not in \ncompliance and refuses to comply, the legislation directs the President \nto withdraw, suspend, or limit benefits to that producer under the \ntrade preference program until the producer comes into compliance.\n  As I said at the outset of my remarks, I am not making a blanket \nendorsement of the farm bill. I have my reservations. Had I written the \nHaiti provisions from scratch, they would have looked very different. \nBut this issue was part of a broader negotiation, and compromises were \nnecessary if we were going to produce a final product.\n  The proponents compromised too. Originally they proposed requiring \nthe President to withdraw trade benefits solely as a consequence of the \nILO reports. That was never something I could accept. Ultimately, they \ndropped that demand and agreed to defer to the President's discretion.\n  The compromise language that is in the bill is specific to Haiti and \nresponds to the unique economic and political situation in that \ncountry. I accepted it based on that narrow context as part of an \noverall compromise to conclude these negotiations.\n  Another issue that we addressed in the farm bill is a recent proposal \nby the Customs and Border Protection agency to change the way certain \nimports are valued for purposes of assessing duties.\n  The agency proposed eliminating its current practice of allowing \nimporters to base customs value on the first price paid in a series of \ntransactions that culminate in the importation of a product into the \nUnited States. Customs has instead proposed a mandate that importers \nmust use the last transaction price.\n  This proposal has drawn significant concern from the business \ncommunity and in Congress, for a number of reasons. First, it appears \nto counter an established practice that has been around since at least \n1988. And some argue that it would lead to tariff increases of 8 to 15 \npercent.\n  Moreover, Customs doesn't collect data on the extent to which the so-\ncalled first-sale option is used. Nor does the agency have a clear \nsense of the economic impact of the proposed change. Yet the agency did \nnot consult Congress or the business community before proposing this \nchange in administrative practice.\n  Consequently, we included a provision that directs Customs to collect \nadditional data for 1 year on the usage of the first-sale option. We \nfurther directed the International Trade Commission to submit a report \nto Congress analyzing the data to be collected by Customs.\n  Finally, we included a sense of Congress that Customs shall not \nimplement any change to disallow the first-sale option prior to January \n1, 2011. After that date, Customs can implement a change but only if \nthe agency consults with the committees of jurisdiction in Congress and \nthe business community, and also receives approval for such a change \nfrom the Treasury Department.\n  That is because the Treasury Department retains rulemaking authority \nover Customs regulations, though a portion of that authority has been \ndelegated to the Department of Homeland Security.\n  I do want to say some other things the Senate Finance Committee has \ndone. We create a new, temporary cellulosic biofuels production tax \ncredit. This provision will encourage the development of a new cutting \nedge alternative biofuel industry.\n  Cellulosic biofuels can be produced from agricultural waste, wood \nchips, switchgrass, and other nonfood feedstocks. With an abundant and \ndiverse source of feedstocks available, cellulosic biofuels hold \ntremendous promise as a home-grown alternative to fossil-based fuels.\n  With cellulosic ethanol, and with the additional feedstocks from corn \nstover, from wood chips, from switchgrass, and other things that have \ncellulose in them, we are going to be able to move beyond just grain \nbeing used to make ethanol.\n  Now, that is going to solve some problems. But one of the problems \nthat it is going to solve, if people will be patient, are these \ndemagogic statements that are going on now about the production of \nethanol bringing up the high price of food.\n  Ethanol is being blamed for everything right now. Ethanol is being \nblamed for rice going up. We do not make ethanol out of rice. Bread \ngoes up. They have riots in Cairo, and corn ethanol is being blamed for \nit. There is a whole conspiracy on the part of the grocery \nmanufacturers of America, hiring a public relations firm to put on a 6-\nmonth crusade against ethanol. It is a scapegoat. It is intellectually \ndishonest.\n  In 1980, the people of this country asked Congress to put some \nincentives in because we ought to have renewable fuels, and ethanol was \nthe direction to go. The farmers of America responded by growing more \ncorn. Farmers invested, setting up ethanol plants. For 25 years, there \nhave been incentives for ethanol production. Ethanol is becoming a \nmajor component now through renewable fuels and less dependence upon \nforeign sources of oil. For 25 years, everything about ethanol has been \ngood, good, good, good--whether it was good for the farmers, good for \nthe environment, good for jobs in rural America, or good for less \ndependence on foreign sources of energy.\n  Then, all of a sudden, corn goes up to $4 a bushel a year ago, and \nthen everybody gets on ethanol. It is an intellectually dishonest \nattack that irritates the heck out of me, and I think we ought to band \ntogether as we always have done. The farmers of this country responded \nwhen the country wanted renewable fuels, and for 25 years nothing bad \nwas said about ethanol. Then, all of a sudden, the price of food goes \nup, and ethanol gets blamed for it.\n  Ninety-five percent of the grain in the world is eaten; 95 percent of \nthe grain is eaten. Last year the farmers of America planted more acres \nto corn than any year since 1944. The farmers of America produced 2.3 \nbillion more bushels of corn last year. Only 600 million bushels of \nthat 2.3 billion bushels of corn went into ethanol.\n  The other 1.7 billion bushels are available for everything else \nanybody wants to use them for, including if they want to eat the same \ncorn animals eat. Yet I am hearing people complain about ethanol being \nthe reason that rice and wheat are high priced and somehow scarce. We \nhave to wake up the people of this country to the fact that the farmers \nof America responded when they wanted alternative energy, and that \nalternative energy is not at fault.\n  In fact, Iowa State University has studies showing that the price of \ngasoline would be 30 or 40 cents higher today if it had not been for \nwhat ethanol is producing. We have to get over it. Maybe this new \nprogram on biofuels from things other than grain will help calm that, I \nhope, because cellulosic biofuels is still science in the making, and \nscientists are telling us in 3 to 5 years it is going to be \ncommercially viable.\n  This bill, then, includes a new, temporary cellulosic biofuels \nproduction tax credit for up to $1 per gallon, available through \nDecember 31, 2012, as an incentive toward cellulosic ethanol, the same \nway we have since 1980 on a tax incentive for ethanol from grain.\n  This provision is estimated to cost about $403 million over a 10-year \nperiod of years that the tax credit is available to American investors \nwho are willing to take the risk of producing cellulosic ethanol.\n  The new cellulosic biofuels production tax credit will be funded in \npart by a 2-year extension of the tariff on ethanol and reform in the \ncurrent ethanol blenders' credit, which will be reduced from 51 cents \nper gallon to 45 cents per gallon on January 1, 2009, the first day the \ncellulosic producers' credit will be available. One other thought that \ncame\n\n[[Page S4166]]\n\nto my mind just now about an attack on ethanol. We have people who have \nvoted for ethanol in this Senate. Twenty-two of them have sent a letter \nto the EPA saying that the mandate on ethanol ought to be lifted--the \nvery same Senators who have complained because we aren't doing enough \nfor renewable energy.\n\n  The last tax title I wish to refer to--and then, for my colleagues, I \nam just about done--is the Conservation Reserve Program payments. We \nhave had this situation where the IRS has been taxing cash payments \nthat farmers receive from Conservation Reserve Program payments--CRP \npayments--with the Social Security tax, the payroll tax. If you are a \nfarmer receiving cash payments, if you rent your land and you receive \ncash payments, you obviously don't pay Social Security tax on that \nmoney. But the IRS ruled that if you were getting cash payments on CRP, \nyou had to pay Social Security on it. So we take care of that problem \nin this bill as well. That is something we have been working on since \n1999, and I am glad to have the opportunity to correct something the \nIRS has done that is an injustice to landowners who receive cash \npayments.\n  I understand that some of my colleagues have concerns over the \nextension of the ethanol tariff in the farm bill.\n  I would like to point out that the United States already provides \nsignificant opportunities for countries to ship ethanol into our market \nduty-free.\n  Numerous countries don't pay the U.S. ethanol tariff at all. Through \nour free trade agreements and trade preference programs, some 73 \ncountries currently have duty-free access to the U.S. market for \nethanol fully produced in those countries.\n  For all other countries, including Brazil--the world's major exporter \nof ethanol--the United States provides duty-free access through a \ncarve-out in the Caribbean Basin Initiative.\n  So Brazilian ethanol exporters currently don't have to pay the U.S. \ntariff.\n  Under the Caribbean Basin Initiative, ethanol produced in Brazil and \nother countries that is merely dehydrated in a Caribbean country can \nenter the United States duty-free up to 7 percent of the U.S. ethanol \nmarket. That is very generous access.\n  Moreover, this duty-free access--as it captures 7 percent of U.S. \nethanol consumption--grows every year.\n  Yet Brazil and other countries have never come close to hitting this \n7 percent cap. In fact, as of Monday, the 7 percent cap was filled only \n23 percent for the year. So we are almost halfway into 2008, and \nforeign ethanol exporters haven't even filled by one-quarter the \ngenerous duty-free access that we give them.\n  And it isn't that the Caribbean Basin Initiative countries don't have \nthe capacity to dehydrate more Brazilian ethanol. They do. Current \ndehydration capacity in the Caribbean Basin Initiative countries is 580 \nmillion gallons, well above the over 452 million gallon duty-free \nallotment for 2008.\n  Brazil isn't taking full advantage of the duty-free treatment \ncurrently available to it. I don't know why we should bend over \nbackwards to provide yet more duty-free access for Brazil.\n  This is especially the case given Brazil's stance in the Doha Round \nnegotiations of the World Trade Organization. Brazil is resisting \nefforts to further open its market to imports of U.S. industrial goods \nand services.\n  We shouldn't even discuss reducing or lifting the tariff until Brazil \ntakes full advantage of its current ability to ship ethanol duty-free \nto the U.S. market.\n  Finally, the ethanol tariff is a revenue-raiser for the farm bill. \nThe cost of the new cellulosic biofuels production tax credit will be \noffset, in part, by an extension of this tariff. In this way, the \nethanol tariff will help us move toward the development of a new \ncutting edge alternative biofuel industry that will produce fuels from \nagricultural waste, woodchips, switchgrass, and other nonfood \nfeedstocks.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Arkansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to add my support as well \nto the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008. It has been a very \nlong and arduous process, but I think those of us who have been \nextremely engaged in this process are proud. We are proud of the hard, \nbipartisan work that has gone into this bill, and we are proud of the \nproduct. Although many of us know that none of us could get everything \nwe wanted in this bill, we worked hard in a bipartisan way and in a way \nthat was respectful to the diversity of this country to come up with a \nproduct we could all rally around and be supportive of on behalf of \nthis country and the hard-working farmers out there who support this \ncountry as well as those of us who enjoy their bounty, not to mention \nthe many other good components of this bill we worked hard together on, \nagain, in a bipartisan way to come up with a good result.\n  However, the finish line being in sight, it is still not quite over \nyet. That is why I wish to first of all encourage my colleagues to send \na strong message to President Bush to sign this bill that supports \nrural America and sets a long-term strategy for investing in those \ncommunities across this land that provide us with the unbelievable \nbounty this great Nation affords us.\n  This is only my third farm bill, so I have not been engaged in this \nprocess quite as long as many of my colleagues who have already spoken. \nBut I have to tell my colleagues, as Senator Conrad mentioned, I feel \nquite passionate about this bill because I feel quite passionate about \nthe farm families in this country.\n  I myself come from a seventh-generation Arkansas farm family, and I \nhave watched, as I have grown up--not just in my own family but in \nfamilies across our State--the hard-working communities that take such \na sense of pride in being Americans but, more importantly, providing \nfor this country and the world the safest, most abundant and affordable \nsupply of food and fiber anybody could.\n  Yes, I am sure my colleagues will be delighted when I sit down and \nquiet up because I have been extremely passionate about this bill \nbecause I believe in those people of my State. I believe in the passion \nand the pride they have in who they are as Arkansans and, more \nimportantly, who they are as Americans.\n  I am proud of the work we have done, and I am proud to have fought \nhard for their needs and their concerns, for the diversity they \nrepresent in the infinite number of business operations and farm \noperations that exist in this great country, enabling us as a nation to \nbe able to say that we can provide the most efficient and effective \nproduction of food and fiber for the world, particularly at a time \nwhen, as my colleague from Iowa mentioned, in places across the globe \npeople are fighting over food and the need for food. We have the hard-\nworking farm families of this country to thank for the incredible \neffort of making sure we don't go through that, that we don't \nexperience those things.\n  I wish to first start by thanking the chairman of our Agriculture \nCommittee, Chairman Harkin, and his hard-working staff. I wish to thank \nthe chairman for his leadership throughout this process and, again, \nalthough none of us got everything we wanted in this bill, his \nwillingness and the willingness of his staff to be consistently there \nfor us and to listen to the concerns we have expressed. I appreciate \nall of the hard work and the many hours they have put into this.\n  I wish to thank not just his staff but the staff of all of the other \nMembers who have worked so diligently with me and my staff through this \nprocess. We do have many perspectives in this bill from many different \nregions of this country, but we do know at the end of the day how to be \nrespectful of one another.\n  I especially wish to thank the ranking member, Senator Chambliss, and \nwithout a doubt his incredible staff, Martha Scott Poindexter and \nVernie Hubert, who have been tremendous and have put incredibly hard \nwork into this bill. They have been not only a great asset in the \nputting together of this bill, but they have been good friends, and I \nam enormously grateful.\n  I wish to thank Chairman Baucus for his work and the excellent work \nof his staff on this very important tax title, along with his ranking \nmember Senator Grassley and his staff. Their efforts to secure funding \nfor this bill have been tremendous.\n  I also wish to say a special thanks to Senator Conrad and his staff. \nThey\n\n[[Page S4167]]\n\nhave sought to find the common ground and to bring people to the table. \nThey have been thoughtful. They have been understanding. They have been \ntireless at making sure there was a reasonableness about our \ndiscussions and that the facts and the figures were clear as we debated \nall of these issues.\n  So many of the other members of the committee as well as Members of \nthe body who have engaged in all of these discussions have done a \ntremendous job in bringing this all together.\n  Of course, on the House side, Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member \nGoodlatte as well as Chairman Rangel have done an incredible job in \nworking with us, and we appreciate so much their hard work.\n  I would also like to add my special thanks to my own staff, Ted \nSerafini and Anna Taylor, who have been an incredible support for me \nand made a tremendous effort in making sure our voice from Arkansas and \nthe voices of the people we represent were so passionately heard with \nsuch great expertise, as well as my former staffer Robert Holifield, \nwho worked very hard on this bill before he left our staff.\n  Those of us on the conference committee have worked hard to come up \nwith this bill, and we wanted it to be practical. We wanted it to be \nrealistic and exhibit the reforms that so many people have been asking \nfor. A lot of time and energy was put into the final bill, and it is a \ngood compromise. While it doesn't contain everything, as I said, that I \nwant to see or anybody else on the committee wanted to see, it does \nensure that we maintain the blessings we have here in this great \ncountry of American agriculture.\n  I often say to people at home that what we should be doing up here is \nnot looking for legislation to be a work of art but to be a work in \nprogress. As many of us who have worked on many farm bills know, it is \na work in progress and continues to be--not just in what we do with \nthis farm bill, but, as the Senator from Iowa mentioned, we look for \nmaking sure that the actions we have taken do not have unintended \nconsequences and that we pay close attention to ensure that the things \nwe have done do not disproportionately harm our great efforts of \nproduction agriculture.\n  From day one, there was a lot of give-and-take. In the end, I think \nMembers and their staffs have produced a good compromise and a \ncompromise that respects and appreciates the diversity of our country \nand certainly the great wealth and bounty of what our Nation has.\n  There are so many good things in this bill to be proud of, and I am. \nSeveral of my colleagues have already touched on the increased \ninvestment in nutrition, renewable energy, conservation, and rural \ndevelopment. All of these will benefit our country greatly.\n  As one of the cochairs and cofounders of the Senate Hunger Caucus, I \nam very proud that nutrition was a priority in this bill. This bill \ncommits $10.36 billion--nearly 73 percent of the bill--for nutrition to \ncontinue the fight against hunger. Hunger is a disease we can cure. We \nknow how to cure it. We simply have to set it as a priority, and this \nbill does.\n  It represents the largest amount of funding for nutrition programs in \nour Nation's history. At a time when 20 million Americans are living in \npoverty, it should represent certainly no less. One billion of that is \nallocated for the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program which provides free \nfresh fruits and vegetables to low-income children in our schools \nnationwide. It also expands the Senior Farmers Market Program by $50 \nmillion to help them purchase fresh fruits at places like farmers \nmarkets and roadside stands throughout the country. I am proud that the \nbill aims to reduce food insecurity among our children and our elderly, \namong our low income and those who are in need. This is a good part of \nour bill.\n  This bill also provides farm families, ranchers, and small businesses \nthroughout the greater part of rural America with the opportunities and \nthe incentives to develop renewable energy sources and continue the \ndrive toward greater energy efficiency in this country. As we have seen \nwith the huge rise in gas prices this year, reducing our dependence on \nforeign oil is an absolute necessity for our Nation's future security. \nI see the passion in my Arkansas farmers and entrepreneurs in rural \nArkansas and across this great country for producing alternative and \nrenewable energy sources. They stand ready. They stand ready to take \nadvantage of the incentives and the call we have in this bill to lessen \nour dependence on foreign oil and empower our own selves, our own \ncountry with renewable fuels that will not only create jobs but provide \na better environment for future generations. In this bill, we have the \nbeginnings particularly of making sure we not only lessen our \ndependence on foreign oil but we do so in a way that is good for our \nenvironment.\n  I am also grateful that an important provision in this bill that I \nsupported will bring tax parity to the timber industry which is so \nimportant to my State. This change will help our timber farmers and \nmillers remain competitive globally during tough economic times. Last \nyear, the downturn in the forestry industry resulted in the loss of \nmore than 3,000 jobs and nearly $14 million in State and local revenues \nin my State of Arkansas.\n  Conservation is also a big part of this package. It does a tremendous \namount. As a farmer's daughter, I saw no greater conservationist than \nmy own father, as a farmer who took great pride in not only the land of \nour farm and the future generations who would get to use that land but \nalso in the conservation that surrounded our farm and in our county, \nbecause not only was it important to his livelihood and for future \ngenerations of our family, for the expertise and his productivity on \nour farm, but it also was an enhancement and an unbelievable endowment \nto future generations for the wonderful pastime that so many Arkansans \nenjoy. Whether it is fishing in our rivers and streams, whether it is \nhunting in our forests, all of the many things we see in our State that \nmy children and other Arkansans enjoy, it is a true blessing to see \nthat conservation, and certainly it is important to our agriculture \nproducers and others.\n  The chairman, Chairman Harkin, has been a tireless advocate for \nconservation programs, and we appreciate that. I am pleased that once \nagain he has produced a bill that is progressive in this area.\n  It includes a $4 billion increase in conservation programs, including \na $1.3 billion investment in the Wetlands Reserve Program, which is \nvery popular and productive in my State. We have the largest timber \nwetlands in North America, with the White River Waterfowl Refuge, along \nwith the incredible lands--mostly nonproductive farmlands--that have \nbeen put into the wetlands reserve and the wetlands program and have \ncontributed greatly to the environment. We have not only spotted the \nivory-billed woodpecker, but we have tremendous migratory birds--not \nonly the waterfowl but some of the largest areas for neotropical \nmigratory birds, songbirds. It is a wonderful asset for this country \nand for future generations.\n  It ensures we are the best stewards of the land that we possibly can \nbe and, above all, it helps us to leave our children with the \nenvironment they deserve.\n  It also includes a tax deduction to reduce the costs of implementing \nrecovery plans under the Endangered Species Act. I see Senator Crapo, \nwhom I have worked a lot with on this issue.\n  The current Endangered Species Act plays a crucial role in protecting \nthreatened endangered species and habitats and in promoting species \nrecovery. However, on private lands, which are relied upon by the \nmajority of threatened species for their survival and recovery, the \ncurrent law doesn't provide all the necessary tools we need.\n  This provision in the farm bill ensures that our private landowners \nare given the incentives they need to protect our endangered and \nthreatened species and engage with State governments and the Federal \nGovernment to protect them by making sure they can work on their land \nand give the needed protections that are needed in order to protect the \nhabitats so we never even see these species going on the endangered \nspecies list to begin with.\n  This bill also provides an additional $150 million to promote \neconomic growth, improve infrastructure, and create jobs in rural \nAmerica through the rural development title.\n  This investment will help improve access to broadband in rural \nAmerica,\n\n[[Page S4168]]\n\nas well as provide loans for rural hospitals, so they can provide the \nbest care for patients living in those rural areas.\n  Oftentimes, I think many of us who grow up in rural America, and who \ngo home regularly to rural America, wonder if inside the beltway there \nare enough people still here who understand the importance of \ninfrastructure needs and investing in rural America--whether it is \nbroadband and making sure folks in rural America have an on-ramp to the \ninformation highway that exists or whether it is just that they have \nclean drinking water in those communities. It is something we can never \nforget because those precious rural areas of this country will remain \nout there and those people will remain out there and we have to stand \nup for them.\n  The bill also provides serious reform while maintaining the safety \nnet for our family farmers so they can compete in the global \nmarketplace.\n  Throughout this process, we have heard time and time again that there \nmust be reform. So many of us started early in this process to see \nwhere we could bring about the kind of reforms that were being \ndemanded. We have provided in this bill the most significant reform in \nour Nation's history in this farm bill. The bill lowers the overall cap \non program payments from $360,000 to $105,000.\n  We have seen the need to address the loopholes that allow producers \nto avoid the caps. So we have eliminated those loopholes most \nfrequently--the three-entity rule and generic certificates.\n  I also heard of the need for transparency, so the committee bill \nadded direct attribution, which will track payments directly to a \nliving, breathing individual producer, a farmer out there who is \nputting their hard-earned time, energy, blood, sweat, and tears into \nproducing these agricultural products.\n  I advocated for reform and transparency from the very beginning \nbecause I knew it was something people wanted to see. But I also think \nwe must be careful that we understand what the possible consequences of \nthese reforms might be.\n  The 2002 farm bill established a solid safety net program when yields \nand prices were low.\n  While we have maintained the integrity of that program, the $2.5 \nmillion means testing on income limits established in that bill in 2002 \nwere never fully enforced by this administration. The Senator from Iowa \nbrought up that point. It is hard to know where to go from those caps \nin the 2002 bill and today's bill to increase that transparency and \nincrease those reforms, if we don't even know what the first limit \nactually did.\n  That is why it does create some concern in me to hear that the \nadministration is saying this bill doesn't go far enough in regard to \nthese reforms. How do we know if it doesn't go far enough if we have \nnever enforced what has been on the books to begin with?\n  Prior to the 2002 farm bill, no means test existed for farm programs. \nNow, I have to say I have concerns that all of a sudden we are going to \nbegin means testing farmers and producers across this country, but we \nshy away and shiver in this body when means testing is talked about for \nanything else.\n  We knew it was important to eliminate loopholes that nonfarmers used \nto receive program payments, and during the 2002 farm debate, we \ninstituted the $2.5 million test.\n  In the bill that passed the Senate in December, we lowered the means-\ntesting cap to $750,000, which respected our regional differences and \navoided the unintended consequences that might arise in this \ncompromise.\n  Let's not forget that we also significantly reformed individual \nprogram pay limits on top of that, which should sharply reduce benefits \nto producers who remain eligible, as long as they are below that means-\ntesting level we have imposed. I thought the Senate bill did a good job \non that compromise and have remained hopeful that those limits, and \ncertainly something close to those limits, is where we can be.\n  During conference, we agreed to add an additional component that \nfactors in nonfarm income.\n  However, it is not enough for this administration, and they continue \nto threaten a veto of this incredibly hard-fought, bipartisan \ncompromise. As I mentioned, I do have some concerns about means testing \nbecause we are means testing the most efficient and effective producers \nof agricultural products in the world, at a time when we are \nexperiencing a world food crisis, and we want to ensure that not only \nwill we maintain the kind of production that we have consistently but \nalso that we do it by setting an example in respect to clean water and \nclean air and, certainly, in respect to all the other unbelievable \ndemands and restrictions that are placed on our farmers with respect to \nthe environment.\n\n  We don't know what those consequences might be, and I hope we will \nkeep in mind--as the Senator from Iowa mentioned--that as we move \nforward in looking at this bill, thinking about how those effects may \nhave unbelievably unintended consequences. Again, there have been an \nawful lot of fights for the means testing on our agricultural \nproducers, while there are so many other benefits in this country that \nare not means tested. I noticed my colleagues earlier mentioning the \nfact that farm income is up. But I also noticed that nobody hardly \nmentioned the fact that reflects the reality of what farmers in this \ncountry are going through in terms of the environment of skyrocketing \nproduction costs and restrictive trade laws, which in our region of the \ncountry are much more restrictive. Trade laws are much more restrictive \nto the commodities we grow, and certainly production costs that are \nmuch higher for capital-intensive crops.\n  I hope the unintended consequences of establishing payment limits and \nmeans testing would not shift the landlord-tenant relations to cash \nrent and place producers, who are working hard each day to shoulder \nthat risk solely of restrictive trade rules, bad weather, and \nunbelievably skyrocketing input costs--I hope that is not one of the \nunintended consequences that we see.\n  In the end, this bill is about ensuring that our family farmers can \ncontinue to produce the world's safest, most abundant supply of food \nand fiber.\n  Our farmers also produce their commodities the most efficiently and \neffectively in the world, and they do it by keeping the cost of our \nfood and fiber per capita the lowest of any developed country, as \nSenator Conrad mentioned.\n  Moreover, they do it with respect to our environment, so our children \nand future generations can enjoy this unbelievable country of bounty \nand beauty. They do it by following the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, \nand so many other restrictions that we place on them in order to ensure \nthey are setting the example and doing the best job possible regarding \nour environment.\n  They are excellent conservationists and stewards of the land because \nthey understand that if they care for the land, it will take care of \nthem. It is something we should never lose sight of.\n  I am proud of the work we have done on this bill, and I encourage my \ncolleagues to support the final version. No bill is ever perfect. This \none gives our family farmers the certainty they need to continue to \ncompete effectively in the global marketplace. It focuses on the \nunbelievable needs throughout this country in nutrition, energy, \nconservation, and rural development.\n  Again, I am proud to have worked in a bipartisan way with so many \ncolleagues on the Senate Ag Committee, as well as others in this body \nand in the other body across the Capitol dome.\n  My last plea before I yield the floor is to my colleagues. It is that \nwe will never allow ourselves or the people of this country to take for \ngranted what we have been blessed with in this country. This is a great \ncountry, and we have a lot of incredibly hard-working people. Many of \nthem are spread out over the rural areas. I hope we will never allow \nthe American people to take for granted what this bounty means to them \nand, more importantly, that we in this body will never take for granted \nthe hard work that goes on beyond this beltway to make us the richest \ncountry in the whole world. I hope we can continue in that same \nbipartisan fashion, recognizing and respecting the incredible diversity \nacross this country that has blessed us for so many years.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the great bipartisan product we \nbrought to the floor.\n\n[[Page S4169]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I also rise today in support of the farm \nbill conference report. Before my colleague, Senator Lincoln, leaves \nthe floor, I wish to take a few minutes to thank her for the tremendous \nwork she has been willing to do with me. She and I were both elected to \nthe House of Representatives in the same year, and we were elected to \nthe Senate in the same year. We have served on a lot of the same \ncommittees, not the least of which has been the Agriculture Committee \nand the Finance Committee, both of which have important parts of this \nlegislation.\n  We have had a tremendously good relationship over the years. We come \nfrom different sides of the aisle, but we work closely together in a \nbipartisan way on issue after issue. One of those very important \nissues, which Senator Lincoln already mentioned, is the Endangered \nSpecies Reform Act. I will talk about that later in my remarks.\n  Before she left the floor, I wished to thank her for being the lead \ncosponsor on that legislation that we have worked on literally for 6 or \n7 years, to make sure we build a consensus-based solution to issues in \nthis country that will make a difference. Again, I thank the Senator \nfor that. I truly appreciate the working relationship we have, and I \ncould not agree more with the comments she has made overall about the \nfarm bill and the tremendous blessing we have in this Nation to have \nliterally the lowest per capita cost in the world in our budgets for \nthe American families with regard to the dollars they must put forward \nfor food and fiber. At a time when people around the world are \nstruggling to deal with recent natural disasters and to ensure that \ntheir families have the food they need, we need swift enactment of this \nfarm bill that will provide long-term certainty for farm families as \nthey continue to feed the world's hungry.\n  This is the third farm bill that I have worked on since I have been \nelected to Congress. I have to say that although each bill, as we moved \nthrough the issues of the day, presented their unique problems, this \nhas been the most difficult to bring together in a conference where we \ncould literally come together--House and Senate, Republicans and \nDemocrats--and propose good, solid policy for our Nation's food and \nfiber. I think we have to give credit to those who have been leaders in \nthe Senate in making that happen: our chairman, Senator Harkin; our \nranking member, Senator Chambliss; and on the Finance Committee, which, \nas I said, also has a significant piece of this legislation, our \nchairman, Max Baucus; and the ranking member, Charles Grassley. There \nare many others.\n\n  Now that I started mentioning Senators, I could literally go through \nthe members of the Agriculture Committee, both sides of the aisle, the \nmembers of the Finance Committee, both sides of the aisle, and list \nMember after Member who has worked tirelessly to make sure this policy \ncomes together in a farm bill we can be proud of and which will \nstrengthen America globally.\n  It is not limited to just the members of the Agriculture or Finance \nCommittees. This Senate is committed to making sure we develop the \nkinds of policies that will keep our Nation strong and globally \ncompetitive, and many of those policies are included in this \nlegislation.\n  In preparation for this farm bill, I held 23 farm bill listening \nsessions in my State, all across Idaho, to get input from Idahoans \nabout what they need and what they saw important in a new farm bill. I \nappreciated the input I got from my constituents and, frankly, utilized \nthat input in working with my fellow members on the Agriculture \nCommittee and Finance Committee as we crafted this legislation.\n  There are a number of provisions I wish to highlight tonight.\n  The first, which I have already mentioned, is a part of the bill that \ncomes in the conservation piece the Finance Committee worked so hard to \nbring forward. As I think most people who followed the debate in the \nbattles over the farm bill over the last few months have realized, one \nof the battlegrounds--in fact, the major battleground--was the effort \nby the Finance Committee in the Senate to bring forward a significant \nnew addition to the conservation efforts in our country as we deal with \nconservation policy.\n  One of the more important pieces of that battleground, if you will, \nwas the Endangered Species Reform Act. The battle was not really over \nthe policies; it was over the dollars because we wanted to make sure we \npaid for the increased costs of what we were doing. But it was \nnevertheless a very difficult time as we tried to find a path forward.\n  Most people who are involved in land management issues, whether they \nbe farmers, consumers, or people who are involved in development or \nsimply homeowners, realize that we have had a significant area of \nconflict in this country for decades over the implementation of the \nEndangered Species Act.\n  There is very little disagreement that we want to protect and \npreserve the beautiful environmental heritage we have and the species \nwe have that are so rich and abundant in our country. At the same time, \nwe wanted to try to find a way to avoid conflict with private property \nowners and with the economic activities of people in our country who \nare trying to develop jobs and opportunities in the economy to provide \nfor themselves and their families. It is that conflict which we have \nworked on in the context of the Endangered Species Act now for about, \nas I say, 6 or 7 years, to try to build a solution that could be \nbroadly supported but which would help both species and people, the \neconomy, and help private property owners and those who are interested \nin protecting and preserving our rich environmental heritage.\n  We have succeeded in the Endangered Species Reform Act. This act is \nbroadly supported by the environmental community because over 80 \npercent of the threatened or endangered species in our Nation is \nlocated on private property. The act does not give us the ability to \nreach into the private property as effectively as we need to help \nimplement recovery plans for species that are threatened or endangered. \nThis legislation does so.\n  At the same time, as I indicated earlier, our private property owners \nhave been concerned about the reach of the Endangered Species Act and \nwhat it would do to them if an endangered species were found on their \nproperty. This act makes it so they can actually find economic \ncompensation if that happens.\n  The core of the act is that it focuses on helping landowners on a \nvoluntary basis have a tax deduction for actions they undertake on \ntheir property to help implement recovery plans, to help facilitate and \nstrengthen species.\n  This is a tremendous incentive, with the backing of the Federal \nGovernment, for these tax deductions to encourage private property \nowners to undertake activities that will tremendously benefit species \non their property. The private property owners are compensated for the \nimpacts on their property, the species are benefited, and everyone in \nthe country is a winner in terms of the improvement of the \nopportunities to strengthen our endangered species protection.\n  This has the broad support of sportsmen organizations across this \ncountry, of environmental organizations across the country, and of \nprivate property groups across the country.\n  I am glad we were able to work our way through literally the \nbattlegrounds we faced in order to make sure we got this legislation \nincluded in the final piece of the farm bill.\n  There is more to do. We had to work it through and adjust pieces of \nit that we would rather have kept in, but we got the core of the bill \nin place. And now we look forward to strengthening and improving this \nimportant protection of the Endangered Species Act.\n  While she is on the floor, I thank Senator Stabenow for her \ntremendous efforts in the conference to make sure we were successful in \ngetting this critical legislation for the endangered species and \nprivate property owners included in the final conference report.\n  Specialty crop producers were also very significantly benefited by \nthis legislation. Speciality crop producers in Idaho and nationwide \nwill receive more than a $2 billion investment in programs important to \nthem, including $456 million for speciality crop block grants that \nassist with marketing, research promotion, and other efforts to \nincrease the competitiveness of speciality crops.\n\n[[Page S4170]]\n\n  Again, Senator Stabenow should be given great credit for fighting to \nwork with me and many others to make sure this happened.\n  The legislation also contains significant assistance for producers \nimpacted by disaster, including new assistance for aquaculture \nproducers who are impacted by drought or assistance for ranchers \nutilizing the Federal grazing permits who are impacted by a loss of \ngrazing due to fire.\n  In addition, more than $4 billion in new spending is going to be \nprovided for conservation programs which enable landowners to meet the \nenvironmental needs and goals and, frankly, in many cases mandates that \nwe put on them to make sure our environment is protected and preserve.\n  I have often said, as we talked about different farm bills, and this \none is no different--in fact, this one is probably a better example \nthan any we have done so far--that one of the most, I will say the most \nimportant pieces of legislation this Congress ever works on with regard \nto truly making a difference in protecting, preserving, and \nstrengthening our incredible environmental heritage in this country is \nthe farm bill because of the powerful provisions we have in the \nconservation title.\n  This farm bill moves forward with significant strides to strengthen \nand enhance the environmental and conservation goals of our country \nthrough farm policy and private property policies.\n  This investment is an important step we must not forget. Farm bill \nconservation programs are an example of the Federal Government \nassisting with the environment in the right way with a carrot rather \nthan a stick. Our conservation programs have contributed significantly \nto improving water and air quality and preserving and enhancing habitat \nfor species.\n  An estimated 95 percent of the world's consumers live beyond our \nborders. The bill also will assist in reaching those consumers by \nexpanding market opportunities through the inclusion of $200 million \nannually for the Market Access Program.\n  In addition, the bill seeks to better ensure adherence to the \nsoftwood lumber trade commitments through inclusion of a softwood \nlumber importer declaration program. I appreciate the tremendous work \nthat was done to include this important provision.\n  The legislation also continues and expands support for the Idaho \ncommodity producers, including our barley, dairy, pulse crop, sugar, \nwheat, and wool producers. Idaho's agricultural industry is more than a \n$5 billion industry and is a critical part of Idaho's economy.\n\n  The commodity title in this bill will continue to allow those farmers \nto be protected and strengthened as they face incredible global \npressures and, frankly, what I consider to be anticompetitive actions \nby other nations as we deal in a global agriculture market.\n  The legislation benefits rural America in a number of important ways. \nAcross the United States, rural communities struggle to access funds \nnecessary to comply with Federal, State, and local environmental \nregulations. Through changes to SEARCH grants, small rural communities \nwith populations of 2,500 or less will have greater and more \nstreamlined access to funding to assist with water and wastewater \ninfrastructure projects. Let me explain what this means.\n  Across this country, we have requirements that our wastewater and our \ndrinking water be protected. In fact, often in America we talk about \nthe fact that we have the safest, cleanest water in the world. When you \ncome to America to visit, you don't have to worry about drinking the \nwater. When you live here, you don't have to worry about drinking the \nwater. The reason is because of our very strong environmental \nstandards.\n  We are proud of that, and we need to protect our water quality. But \nthe protection comes at a price, and often the mandates we put on \ncommunities to assure that water quality are not able to be met by the \nsmaller communities because they simply don't have the economies of \nscale to be able to implement the wastewater and other treatment \nfacilities that are necessary to enable them to comply with the \nenvironmental mandates and keep the water quality so clear and clean.\n  We need to provide ways to assist these strapped rural communities as \nthey try to do what we all want to do, and that is make sure America \nhas clean, safe water. That is what these projects will do in the \nSEARCH legislation.\n  The bill also provides $120 million in mandatory spending to be \ndirected at pending applications for water and wastewater disposal \ngrants and loans--Again, to help with the same problem.\n  As well in the rural areas, broadband access is a key to growth and \neconomic development. This farm bill simplifies the application process \nfor broadband assistance and ensures that broadband assistance is \ntargeted at communities with the least amount of access.\n  Improving the economic position of rural areas by stimulating the \ngrowth of rural businesses is accomplished through reauthorization of \nimportant programs such as the rural business opportunity grants and \nthe rural cooperative development grants, which will ensure the \ncontinuation and technical assistance and training to our Nation's \nrural businesses and cooperatives.\n  In addition, value-added producer grants are going to continue to \nprovide producers with the means to improve on the value of their \nproducts through planning activities and marketing and the \nreauthorization of the national rural development partnerships which \nwill enable individual State partnerships, such as the Idaho Rural \nPartnership, to continue working to strengthen and improve life in \nrural America.\n  The farm bill also incorporates language from the Biodiesel Education \nand Expansion Act of 2007. That is S. 1791 which I introduced with \nSenator Klobuchar to reauthorize the Biodiesel Education Program. This \nprogram has been very important to the biodiesel effort in Idaho. The \nUniversity of Idaho has received about 20 percent of those funds \nthrough a competitive grants process to help educate Government and \nprivate owners of vehicle fleets about the benefits and technical \naspects of biodiesel fuel.\n  In addition, the bill includes a new temporary cellulosic biofuels \nproduction tax credit for up to $1.01 per gallon available through \nDecember 31, 2012.\n  The conference report also provides $300 million for the Bioenergy \nProgram which provides incentives for expanding production of advanced \nbiofuels made from agricultural and forestry crops and associated waste \nmaterials, including animal manure and livestock food processing waste.\n  The importance of this is that we in the United States have a serious \nproblem in our energy policy. We can debate the many aspects of it in \nother contexts. The bottom line is we are far too dependent on \npetroleum in this country as a source of energy. And in the context of \npetroleum, we are far too dependent on foreign sources of petroleum.\n  I often analogize our core need in terms of energy policy of being \none of trying to diversify our energy portfolio. We need to move into \nalternative and renewable fuels, and we need to provide the support to \nenable us to do the research and development to expand energy \nopportunities.\n  One of the things this bill does in areas I already mentioned, such \nas cellulosic biofuels and other efforts in that context, is to help us \ndo the research and to do then the thinking that goes into making sure \nwe move into these other types of alternative and renewable fuels.\n  Another important part of this legislation in that context is that we \nestablish a sugar-to-ethanol program which will better enable the sugar \nindustry to contribute to our energy independence.\n  There are many things we could be doing and we ought to be doing--all \nof them to find the ones that will best work and will best help us to \ndiversify our energy economy.\n  The legislation also provides expanded fresh fruit and vegetable \nprograms, which provides domestically grown fresh fruit and vegetables \nto students as healthy snacks and educates our students in every State \non the importance of eating healthy foods.\n  This program has already been well received as a pilot program in a \nnumber of States, including Idaho. I am proud to continue this program \nnot only in Idaho but to help expand it to all States across the \ncountry.\n  The bill strengthens assistance for America's food banks by providing \nmore than $1 billion for the next 10\n\n[[Page S4171]]\n\nyears for commodity purchasing, nearly doubling the current funding \nlevel. Access to food banks is particularly important given the \neconomic hard times that we are facing with regard to high gas prices.\n  Also, I would like to talk a little bit more about the global \ncompetition we face. As I indicated earlier, one of the pressures that \nour producers face is anticompetitive conduct from other nations. These \nare subsidies, tariffs, or nontariff barriers which are erected against \nour producers.\n  Yes, we support our agricultural producers and, yes, we have tariffs. \nI am not sure what the numbers are today, but within the last couple of \nyears the imbalance in those tariffs shows what I am talking about. The \naverage I am recalling that we have discussed over the last few years \nis that the average tariff against our producers as we try to export \ninto other countries is around 60 percent, whereas the average that we \nimpose on those bringing their products into our country is more in the \nneighborhood of 10 or 12 percent.\n  Those kinds of disparities create tremendous trade barriers to our \nproducers. The same is true with the level of subsidies provided to \nproducers in other countries that compete with our producers. One of \nthe critical parts of this bill is to provide that safety net or that \nprotection to our producers in the international contest as we seek to \nmake sure the trade arena globally is balanced fairly.\n  I know some have criticized this bill by saying it spends too much \nlimited Federal funding on agriculture. Let me make an important note \nthere. This bill has a number of titles. Agriculture commodity programs \nare one of those titles. About 70 percent of the spending in this bill \ngoes to our nutrition programs, such as the Food Stamp Program.\n  Most people in America don't realize that because we often call this \nthe farm bill. Yet 70 percent of it goes into our nutrition programs. \nWhat percent goes to the commodity programs? A little less than 14 \npercent. And those important conservation programs I talked about? They \nget around 7 percent of the funding in the bill. The rest, the 8 or 9 \npercent that is left over, goes into the rural development part, the \ntitles--the energy titles and other portions of the bill that are \ncritically important to our national concerns, such as rural \ndevelopment and energy.\n  When you look at this bill, it is not an ag bill or a farm bill. It \nis a food and fiber bill. It is much more than that. It is a bill that \nis very important, as I have said, to everything from energy policy to \nrural development to our conservation efforts in this country to our \nagriculture commodity programs and to our nutrition programs for those \nwho face hunger in this Nation. It is important to recognize that.\n  Also, I think it is important for us to note that some criticize this \nbill for not being reform minded enough and not being strict enough on \npayment limitations for the extremely wealthy who, it is claimed, get \nall of the resources of the bill in that 14-percent commodity title. \nHowever, the conference report has taken major steps forward in terms \nof reform. I think those steps need to be recognized and noted.\n  The conference report would eliminate the triple entity rule, which \nhas already been talked about extensively on the Senate floor tonight, \nand changes the current adjusted gross income limit from $2.5 million \nto $500,000 for nonfarm and $750,000 for farm income. These are \nconsiderable reforms that should be acknowledged and recognized.\n  This is a broad and diverse country, and no bill is a perfect bill \nfrom the perspective of any individual Senator, I am sure. We have 50 \nStates and 435 Congressional Districts and we have tremendous debates \nabout how we should implement policy. But this bill worked its way \nthrough that process to develop policy and reforms that are meaningful \nand significant and should not be undermined.\n  In conclusion, this legislation with its 15 titles covers a wide \nrange of important policy matters that go far beyond our traditional \nfarm support, as I have said. These titles include things, as I have \nindicated, such as conservation, trade and food aid, nutrition, farm \ncredit, research, energy opportunities, crop insurance, and disaster \nassistance and many more. The breadth and depth of this legislation \nreaches into so many people's lives--everyone in America, not just \nthose in farm country--everyone in America should be paying attention \nto this legislation and should be glad that we have been able to find \nthat agreement that has enabled us to get a conference report between \nthe House and Senate.\n  Again, I thank all my colleagues for their tremendous work in this \nvery difficult and lengthy process we have been going through, to make \nsure we develop the right policies for our food and fiber in this \nNation, and we continue to keep America strong and on the competitive \nedge in the production of food and fiber for the world.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to \nthe Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, referred to as the 2008 \nfarm bill. The 2008 farm bill contains many worthwhile polices, \nincluding valuable investments in conservation and nutrition programs. \nHowever, it fails to provide meaningful crop subsidy program reforms \nthat most Americans would support.\n  This farm bill continues a set of antiquated programs that send a \nmajority of payments only to farmers earning over $200,000 a year. It \nexceeds the budget allocation by $10-$20 billion through the use of tax \npolicies and budgetary sleights of hand. The perception of being within \nthe budget limit is not reality.\n  While it is true that subsidies are only part of the overall bill, \nCongress should not accept these outmoded policies in order to move \nalong other priorities. The fiscal, food and trade policy costs are too \ngreat and too damaging.\n  This farm bill continues the ``three-legged stool'' of a ``farm \nsafety net'' that targets mostly corn, soybean, wheat, rice, and cotton \nfarmers. The first leg is the practice of sending $20 billion in direct \npayments to only 43 percent of U.S. farms. Of those, only 8 percent \nreceive 58 percent of the payments. These payments have nothing to do \nwith markets, disasters, or need, and they have been ruled to violate \ntrade agreements. This farm bill reduces these payments by a miniscule \n2 percent. Farmers, who had received an average $94 per acre for a \nhistory of growing rice, would still receive $92.40 under this farm \nbill.\n  Second, the farm bill continues counter-cyclical payments that are \nmade when prices go down. Third, these targeted farmers may also \nreceive unlimited marketing loan payments--farmers do not need to repay \ngovernment loans if prices fall below a targeted rate. Additionally, \nthis farm bill retains a government administered supply and demand \nprogram that keeps sugar prices for consumers well above world market \nprices.\n  Farm bill conferees added yet a fourth leg to the farm subsidy stool \nby creating a new $4 billion standing disaster program to cover losses \ndue to droughts and floods. The idea of a permanent disaster program \nmay have merit, especially when you consider that Congress has passed \nlegislation to fund ad hoc disaster payment assistance nearly every \nyear for the last 20 years. But we should ask ourselves, if the current \nexpensive farm bill is failing to provide a safety net to farmers when \nthese devastating events do happen, then what is the purpose of the \nfarm bill? Why do we need a new program administered by a separate \nFederal agency to fulfill what most Americans believe is the core \npurpose of the legislation before us? We should fix the root problem, \nnamely that the current subsidy system does not work and wastes \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  Trade distortion is yet another major problem with the bill. In 2004, \nBrazil won a World Trade Organization, WTO, case against U.S. cotton \nprograms based on the trade distorting nature of direct payments, \ncountercyclical payments, and marketing loan payments. Similar cases \nagainst other commodities are now being deliberated. Surprisingly, \ninstead of fixing the programs to shield U.S. farmers from these \nchallenges, this farm bill continues these programs and provocatively \nincreases the subsidy rates.\n\n   How, in good faith, can we ask other governments to join us in \ntrading partnerships, or to abide by fair trade agreements, when this \nCongress blatantly ignores our own commitments? Some Senators may \nwonder why we\n\n[[Page S4172]]\n\nshould be concerned about violating WTO commitments. They might think \nthat this is simply limited to agriculture or specific crops with \nlittle impact on our overall economy. Others might even suggest that we \nare better off building up more barriers to trade; that this farm bill \nis about American farmers not farmers in Brazil or elsewhere. However, \nif Senators look further down the line they will see that our WTO \nviolations could cost the United States billions in revenue, \nintellectual property, and lost trade opportunities. Failure to move \ntoward compliance will invite retaliatory tariffs that legally can be \ndirected at any U.S. industry.\n   It could be argued that flaunting these commitments would be \njustified in order to save the U.S. farming sector from sure ruin. \nHowever, that would ignore the realities of our current farm economy \nand the actual structure of these farm programs. Thanks to strong \nforeign and domestic demand, net farm income for 2007 was nearly $89 \nbillion, up $30 billion from 2006 and $30 billion above the average for \nthe previous 10 years, setting a new farm income record. Estimates for \n2008 project net farm income to top $92 billion. As a result, average \nfarm household income is projected to be almost $89,000 in 2008, up 9 \npercent from 2006, and well above average U.S. household income of \n$67,000.\n  We need a new farm bill that ensures a stable farm economy and a \nhealthy food supply. I do not believe our Nation is best served by this \nfarm bill that continues to make payments that defy common sense, snubs \nour trading partners, and balloons taxpayer spending. Last year I \njoined Senator Frank Lautenberg and others in offering a farm bill \nalternative that received 37 votes on the Senate floor. It would have \nprovided all farmers with a more equitable ``safety net,'' as well as \ngreater investment in conservation, rural energy projects, and \nnutrition.\n  Under the proposal, farmers, for the first time, would receive--at no \ncost to them--either expanded county-based crop insurance policies that \nwould cover 85 percent of expected crop revenue, or 80 percent of a \nfarm's five year average adjusted gross revenue. These subsidized \ninsurance tools already exist, but our reforms would have made them \nmore effective and universally used, while controlling administrative \ncosts. Farmers would also be able to purchase insurance to cover the \nremainder of their revenue and yields. In addition, the amendment would \nhave created optional risk management accounts that would be available \nto every farmer and rancher and provide incentives for them to put away \nmoney in good years to cover lean years. Our program would be available \nto all farmers in the country--regardless of products--and not just a \nselect few corn, soybean, wheat, rice, and cotton farmers.\n  Using the savings from this approach could fund important expansion \nin conservation, nutrition, energy, and research programs. In fact, the \napproach made more significant investments within the Federal budget in \nthese areas than the farm bill before us and even found savings to help \npay down our Nation's budget deficit, which this year is approaching \n$400 billion.\n  I will vote against the farm bill conference report and support a \npresidential veto of the bill. I further suggest that the Lugar-\nLautenberg FRESH Act remains a reform option, a constructive \nalternative that will save taxpayers billions, provide a generous \nsafety net, and allow for funding of farm, nutrition, bioenergy, \nconservation, and rural development programs without budget-breaking \ngimmicks.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, every morning thousands of Americans \nwake up to a bowl of Wheaties, the vast majority of whom have never \nasked where their Wheaties come from. I submit to you that the farm \nbill is the primary factor responsible for providing America with safe, \nhealthy, and affordable food and fiber, including Wheaties. What we are \ndebating today is of paramount importance to each and every American.\n  If you look at the title of this bill, the Food, Conservation, and \nEnergy Act of 2008, you will not see the word agriculture. This begs \nthe question, What does this bill really mean to agriculture and the \nAmerican farmer and rancher?\n  By way of example, I have been contacted by the Dairy Producers of \nNew Mexico which told me that the farm bill does not, on the whole, \nhelp rural New Mexico. Rather its policies have short-term and long-\nterm implications that can harm my State. The primary source of \neconomic activity in rural New Mexico today is dairy farming. There are \napproximately 172 dairy farms with approximately 4,221 direct employees \nand 17,150 indirect employees. These local operations contribute $1.02 \nbillion direct dollars to the economy and $2.6 billion indirect dollars \nto the economy. The farm bill undermines the economic stability that \nthe dairy industry plays a large role in creating.\n  The dairy title subsidizes dairy farmers who compete with New Mexico \ndairymen. Under the farm bill, the ``MILC'' program not only funds milk \nproduced in other regions of the country, at rates higher than New \nMexico, it increases those payments. The new bill ensures that the \namount of those payments will rise when feed prices go up. This is \ndespite the fact that virtually all of the grain used by producers \noutside New Mexico is raised by them and they are insulated from much \nof that price inflation. New Mexico's farmers purchase their feed but \nreceive only partial payments. In short, the Dairy Price Support \nProgram provides no support at all.\n  I applaud the efforts that were made in this bill to address \nnutrition concerns, provide for broader flexibility for specialty crop \ngrowers, and assist rural communities. However, it does not appear to \nme that enough progress has been made toward conservation programs and \nother reform initiatives. Moreover, while the bill does continue the \npeanut handling benefits it does not continue the peanut storage \nprovisions contained in the 2002 farm bill. This alone will cost New \nMexico peanut growers up to an additional $50 to $60 per ton, which \nrepresents at least $74 million to peanut producers in my State. I am \nnot convinced that this is the best we can do for the people who feed \nour Nation and I am left wondering if this farm bill is already out of \ndate before it is even law.\n  The Congressional Budget Office tells us that this bill will cost \n$307 billion over the next 5 years and almost double that figure over \n10 years, which is cause for concern in and of itself.\n  Ultimately, I am unwilling to support a measure that is \ncounterproductive to the most important agriculture component in New \nMexico, our dairy industry. Instead of enacting policies that will \nencourage stability and continued growth of dairies in States like New \nMexico, the conference report before us today says our farm policy \nshould be to erect unreasonable hurdles and obstacles for many dairies. \nI intend to vote against this bill and I urge my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I certify that the information required by \nSenate rule XLIV, related to congressionally directed spending, has \nbeen identified in the conference report to accompany the Food \nConservation and Energy Act of 2008, numbered H.R. 2419, filed on May \n12, 2008, and that the required information has been available on a \npublicly accessible congressional Web site at least 48 hours before a \nvote on the pending conference report.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/14/senate-section/article/S4172-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4172-S4173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FURTHER CHANGES TO S. CON. RES. 21\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, section 307 of S. Con. Res. 21, the 2008 \nbudget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee \nto revise the allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate levels for \nlegislation, including one or more bills and amendments, that \nreauthorizes the 2002 farm bill or similar or related programs, \nprovides for revenue changes, or any combination thereof. Section 307 \nauthorizes the revisions provided that certain conditions are met, \nincluding that amounts provided in the legislation for the above \npurposes not exceed $20 billion over the period of fiscal years 2007 \nthrough 2012 and that the legislation not worsen the deficit over the \nperiod of the total of fiscal years 2007 through 2012 or the period of \nthe total of fiscal years 2007 through 2017.\n  On November 5, 2007, I filed a reserve fund adjustment pursuant to \nsection 307 for an amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. \n2419. That legislation passed the Senate on December 14, 2007. The \nSenate is considering the conference report to accompany H.R. 2419,\n\n[[Page S4173]]\n\nthe Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008. I find that the \nconference report also satisfies the conditions of the deficit-neutral \nreserve fund for the farm bill, including being fully paid for over \nboth the five and 10-year time periods. Therefore, pursuant to section \n307, I am amending the reserve fund adjustment made on November 5, \n2007, and further revising the aggregates in the 2008 budget \nresolution, as well as the allocation provided to the Senate Committee \non Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, to reflect the final estimate \nfor the completed farm bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following revisions to S.

Mr. President, over the past week, the Jewish people and \ntheir friends around the world have celebrated the historic and proud \noccasion of the 60th anniversary of the founding of the modern State of \nIsrael. I rise to join my colleagues in again congratulating and \nhonoring the Israeli people in reaching this monumental milestone, and \nto recognize the enduring and unwavering relationship between our two \ncountries.\n  During my tenure in public service, it has truly been an honor to \nconsistently stand with Israel. Throughout my 29 years in Congress--\nbegun the same year, 1979, when I attended the signing of the Israeli-\nEgyptian peace treaty at the White House--I have fought for Israel's \nabsolute right to exist in peace, and I have understood Israel's \nenduring value as a strategic ally to America. And for twice as long as \nI have been privileged to help enhance this relationship in Congress, \nIsrael has proven itself time and again not only to be a true ally of \nthe United States in terms of our shared security interests, but also \nin terms of upholding democratic ideals.\n  In its first 60 years, the modern State of Israel has proven itself \nto be a bastion of democracy in a region rife with authoritarianism. \nIsrael is the only country in the Middle East whose citizens enjoy the \nright to vote, speak, and pray freely. As notable as it is that Israel \nhas successfully brought these critical elements of western-style \ndemocracy to the region, it is even more remarkable that it has been \nable to guarantee these freedoms while under constant threat from \nterrorists and countries along its borders. In this way, Israel has \nproven itself to be a true democracy--a paragon of political openness \nand liberty.\n  As the first woman to serve in both houses of a State legislature and \nboth Houses of the U.S. Congress, I regard Israel's inclusion and \nempowerment of women in politics as an especially inspiring feature of \nits democratic triumph. Highlighted by the election of Golda Meir as \nPrime Minister in 1969, Israeli women played as central a role in the \nfounding and flourishing of the State of Israel as their male \ncounterparts. Meir's legacy is proudly continued today by countless \nIsraeli women in top government positions in Israel, including Foreign \nMinister Tzipi Livni, Speaker of the Knesset Dalia Itzik, and Justice \nDorit Beinish, who serves as the President, or Chief Justice, of the \nSupreme Court.\n  Again, Israel's proud record of outstanding participation by women in \nthe governance of their country stands in stark contrast to the \ndisenfranchising of women from public life elsewhere in the Middle \nEast. And while many of its neighbors suffer from a high illiteracy \nrate among women, Israel has achieved educational parity for men and \nwomen, with 57 percent of all academic degrees in the country being \nearned by women.\n  By advancing the causes of political inclusiveness and freedom, the \nState of Israel has done more than provide a vibrant homeland for the \nJewish people, it has emerged a beacon of modernity and hope in an \nancient and still troubled region. And there should be no doubt that \nthe people and Government of United States continue to stand alongside \nIsrael as it seeks peace even as it endures daily rocket attacks \nagainst its citizens and vile, hate-filled rhetoric from radical and \ndangerous strongmen who speak of its destruction. In supporting Israel \nagainst these threats, we support the dignity of all peoples against \nthose who would prefer the oppressions of humanity's past to the \npromise of its future.\n  And so, on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, I rise not only to \ncommend the State of Israel and its people, but also to thank them, for \ntheir friendship, for their bravery, and for their defense of that \nwhich is righteous in the world.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to commemorate \nthe 60th anniversary of Israel's founding.\n  On May 14, 1948, members of the Jewish People's Council gathered at \nthe Tel Aviv Museum to approve the Declaration of the Establishment of \nthe State of Israel. The declaration stated, in part, ``The State of \nIsrael will be open for Jewish immigration and for the Ingathering of \nthe Exiles; it will foster the development of the country for the \nbenefit of all its inhabitants; it will be based on freedom, justice \nand peace as envisaged by the prophets of Israel; it will ensure \ncomplete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants \nirrespective of religion, race or sex; it will guarantee freedom of \nreligion, conscience, language, education and culture; it will \nsafeguard the Holy Places of all religions; and it will be faithful to \nthe principles of the Charter of the United Nations.'' These were the \nprinciples Israel was founded on, and these same principles guide it \ntoday.\n  I have visited Israel 25 times since taking office in 1981. Under the \nable leadership of the numerous Israeli leaders whom I have come to \nknow over that period, Israel has remained a bastion of democracy in \nthe Middle East.\n  According to the Freedom House's ``Freedom in the World 2008'' \nreport, Israel is the only free country in the Middle East. Evidence of \nIsrael's strong democratic traditions is seen in the inquisitiveness of \nits press: the Freedom\n\n[[Page S4174]]\n\nHouse considers the Israeli press to be the only free press in the \nregion.\n  Israel's economy has also prospered under democratic rule. According \nto the Economist Intelligence Unit, ``Israel's economy is far more \ndiversified and sophisticated than its neighbors.'' ``Israel has the \nhighest proportion of engineers in the workforce [worldwide], and \nnearly double the share of second-place US and Japan.'' Its well-\neducated populace has enabled its high-tech industry to make advances \nin research and development, enabling Israeli firms ``to achieve global \nleadership in a number of fields, including various segments of the \nsoftware industry, anti-virus protection and computer security systems, \nas well as in the areas of fiber optics and electro-optics, medical \ninstruments and medical imaging systems.''\n  During my time in the Senate, I have worked to ensure Israel's \nsecurity. One aspect of this has been securing economic and military \nassistance for Israel. During my most recent trip to Israel, in \nDecember 2007, I met with President Shimon Peres and Prime Minister \nEhud Olmert. We discussed, among other things, the Israeli-Palestinian \npeace process, Iran's role in the region, and the U.S.-Israeli \nbilateral relationship. In each instance, it was clear to me that both \nthe United States and Israel benefit greatly from our strong ties and \nshared ideals.\n  At the core of the United States-Israeli relationship is the Middle \nEast peace process. There have been so many developments since Israel \nemerged as a state. The enmity which has existed for decades has meant \nsenseless killing, terrorism in Israel, and Hezbollah and Hamas firing \nrockets into Israel, prompting the justified retaliation by Israel as a \nmatter of self defense.\n  It is crucial that Israel's neighbors understand the importance of \nwords and perceptions in the peace process, bringing the region closer \nto the goals set forth in the November 27, 2007 Joint Israeli-\nPalestinian Declaration at Annapolis: ``We express our determination to \nbring an end to bloodshed, suffering and decades of conflict between \nour peoples; to usher in a new era of peace, based on freedom, \nsecurity, justice, dignity, respect and mutual recognition; to \npropagate a culture of peace and nonviolence; to confront terrorism and \nincitement, whether committed by Palestinians or Israelis.''\n  The democratic principles set forth in the Declaration of the \nEstablishment of the State of Israel have enabled Israel to thrive for \nthe past 60 years and will continue to guide it into the future.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the 60th \nanniversary of the founding of the modern State of Israel.\n  On May 14, 1948, the people of Israel proclaimed the establishment of \nthe sovereign and independent State of Israel, and the Government \nestablished full diplomatic relations.\n  The United States and Israel share a deep friendship and alliance. \nOur alliance is based on the belief of the United States in Israel's \nright to exist and our countries' shared values of democracy.\n  Both Israel and the United States understand the values of life, \nliberty, opportunity, security, and freedom. Additionally, we both seek \nto address the common threat of terrorism. We recognize that terrorist \norganizations have denounced the values of freedom, and we are \ndedicated to ensuring that terrorism does not prevail.\n  Throughout Israel's history, the country has strived to build a \ndemocratic nation despite severe obstacles. Yet the people of Israel \ncontinue to show great strength and perseverance as they seek peace \nwith their neighbors.\n  I extend my congratulations to our friends, the people of Israel, and \nI join them in celebrating this occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/14/senate-section/article/S4174-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would strengthen and add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the \nfloor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our \ncountry.\n  In the early morning hours of Saturday, May 10, 2008, in Muncie, IN, \nKyle Flood was attacked for being gay in what he believes was a hate \ncrime. Flood, a 21-year-old college student at Ball State University, \nsays he was leaving a bar at about 3 a.m. when two college-aged men \napproached him and his friends using anti-gay epithets. When the two \ngroups crossed paths, a fight erupted. Flood was shoved to the ground \nand punched in the face. He was later treated at the local hospital for \na scratched cornea, swollen eye, cuts and bruises. The Ball State \ncommunity has reacted to the beating, and students have been informed \nto stay calm and try to travel to and from social events in groups. \nPolice Chief Gene Burton has said that bias-motivated attacks are rare \namong students, but that they have happened before. No arrests have \nbeen made in connection with the assault.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. Federal laws \nintended to protect individuals from heinous and violent crimes \nmotivated by hate are woefully inadequate. This legislation would \nbetter equip the Government to fulfill its most important obligation by \nprotecting new groups of people as well as better protecting citizens \nalready covered under deficient laws. I believe that by passing this \nlegislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/14/senate-section/article/S4174-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4174-S4175]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL FOSTER CARE MONTH\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize National Foster \nCare Month, an effort to raise awareness about our responsibility to \nsupport the more than half a million children across the Nation who are \nliving in foster care. I would also like to take this opportunity to \npay tribute to the dedicated adoptive parents who provide these \nvulnerable youth with the permanent families they deserve.\n  Having a family is vitally important to foster youth like JoJo \nCarbonell, from my home State of California. When she was in school, \nJoJo had to ask her teacher to excuse her from the assignment to make a \nfamily tree because she didn't know any of her relatives except her \nbirth mother and her sisters. For JoJo, one of the most important \nreasons that she is now successful and stable is her foster parent, Sue \nCrowley. From Sue, JoJo learned the importance of family and began to \ndevelop heartfelt traditions she will carry with her forever. As JoJo \ngrew older, she and Sue decided to become a permanent family through \nadoption.\n  I am proud of California's success in finalizing more than 66,500 \nadoptions of children from foster care between 2000 and 2006, but sadly \nmany foster youth are never united with a permanent, stable family.\n  For Priscilla Davis, who ``aged out'' after spending 3 years at nine \ndifferent placements in California's foster care system, having a \nfamily would mean having someone she could call if she is having a \nproblem; having a family would mean there is someone to catch her if \nshe makes a mistake; having a family would mean someone to call if \nsomething wonderful happens.\n  Unfortunately, Priscilla is one of about 4,000 foster youth in \nCalifornia, and more than 20,000 youth nationwide who emancipate, or \n``age out'' of foster care every year without ever finding a permanent \nfamily or establishing a relationship with an adult who will love, \nsupport, and guide them.\n  A recent report by Kids Are Waiting and the Jim Casey Youth \nOpportunities Initiative found that while the total number of children \nin foster care has declined, the number of young people aging out of \nfoster care has increased 41 percent since 1998.\n  Last year, I introduced the Foster Care Continuing Opportunities Act, \nS. 1512, which would extend Federal funding to those States that try to \nprovide services that help foster youth transition to adulthood. Right \nnow, the future for foster youth when they are emancipated is often \nbleak. In California, about 65 percent of emancipated youth face \nhomelessness, less than 3 percent go to college, and 51 percent are \nunemployed.\n  While extending support for these services at a Federal level could \nmake\n\n[[Page S4175]]\n\nan extraordinary difference in the success of these youth in \ntransitioning to adulthood, the best way for us to ensure these youth \nfind the families they deserve is to reauthorize the Federal Adoption \nIncentive Program.\n  The Adoption Incentive Program encourages States to find foster \nchildren like JoJo and Priscilla permanent homes through adoption, with \nan emphasis on finding adoptive homes for special needs children and \nfoster children over the age of 9. This important program must be \nrenewed before it expires on September 30 this year.\n  I urge my colleagues to celebrate National Foster Care Month by \nsupporting these important efforts to ensure that the Federal \nGovernment meets its responsibility to care for these youth--not just \ntheir future, but the future of our Nation depends on it.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, in recognition of May as National Foster \nCare Month, I want to extend my personal thanks to all of the families \nin Washington State and throughout our country who have adopted \nchildren from the Nation's foster care system. Foster children, through \nno fault of their own, face unique challenges in attaining permanent, \nloving homes. We can all agree that, regardless of background, all \nchildren in our country deserve to have a safe, loving home and the \nopportunity to pursue their dreams.\n  In 2005, almost 1,200 of Washington's children left foster care to \njoin adoptive families--but that same year more than 2000 foster \nchildren in Washington were still waiting to be adopted. They had to \nwait an average of over 3 years to find adoptive families. Vulnerable \nchildren should not have to wait so long for the safe, permanent \nfamilies that all children need.\n  The Federal Adoption Incentive Program, a program first enacted by \nCongress in 1997, plays an important role in encouraging adoption. The \nprogram provides States like Washington with incentive payments for \nadoptions that exceed an established baseline and includes additional \nincentives for adoptions of older foster children and children with \nspecial needs. Between 2000 and 2006, the Adoption Incentive Program \nhelped 5,700 children in Washington's foster care system join adoptive \nfamilies.\n  I am also pleased to support the Kinship Caregiver Act, introduced by \nSenator Clinton in February 2007. The Kinship Caregiver Support Act is \nintended to assist the millions of children who are being raised by \ntheir grandparents and other relatives because their parents are not \nable to care for them. Among other things, this important legislation \nwould establish a Kinship Navigator Program to help link relative \ncaregivers to a broad range of services and supports that they need for \ntheir children and themselves.\n  I join my colleagues in the Senate in paying tribute to the many \nprospective and veteran adoptive families, and I look forward to \npursuing reforms that support children in foster care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/14/senate-section/article/S4175-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4175-S4177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS VIDEOTAPING\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Patriots engaged in extensive \nvideotaping of opponents' offensive and defensive signals starting on \nAugust 20, 2000, and extending to September 9, 2007, when they were \npublicly caught videotaping the Jets.\n  The extent of the taping was not disclosed until the NFL was \npressured to do so. Originally, Commissioner Goodell said the taping \nwas limited to late in the 2006 season and early in the 2007 season. In \nhis meeting with me on February 13, 2008, Goodell admitted the taping \nwent back to 2000. Until my meeting with Matt Walsh on May 13, 2008, \nthe only taping we knew about took place from 2000 until 2002 and \nduring the 2006 and 2007 seasons.\n  That left an obvious gap between 2003 and 2005. In response to my \nquestions, Matt Walsh stated he had season tickets in 2003, 2004 and \n2005 and saw Steve Scarnecchia, his successor, videotape games during \nthose seasons including:\n  The Patriots' September 9, 2002, game against the Steelers.\n  The Patriots' November 16, 2003, game against the Cowboys.\n  The Patriots' September 25, 2005, game against the Steelers, which \nthe Steelers resoundingly won 34-20.\n  Walsh stated he observed Scarnecchia filming additional Patriots home \ngames, though he could not recall the specific games.\n  Walsh said he did not tell Goodell about the taping during 2003, 2004 \nand 2005 because he was not asked.\n  The NFL confiscated the Jets tape on September 9, 2007; imposed the \npenalties on September 13, 2007; on September 17, 2007, viewed the \ntapes for the first time; and then announced they had destroyed those \ntapes on September 20, 2007. Commissioner Goodell made his judgment on \nthe punishment to be levied before he had viewed the key evidence.\n  Matt Walsh and other Patriots employees, Steve Scarnecchia, Jimmy \nDee, Fernando Neto and possibly Ed Bailey were present to observe most \nif not all of the St. Louis Rams walk-through practice in advance of \nthe 2002 Super Bowl, including Marshall Faulk's unusual positioning as \na punt returner.\n  David Halberstam's book, ``The Education of a Coach,'' documents the \nway Belichick spent the week before the Super Bowl obsessing about \nwhere the Rams would line up Faulk.\n  Walsh was asked and told Assistant Coach, Brian Daboll, about the \nwalkthrough. Walsh said Daboll asked him specific questions about the \nRams offense and Walsh told Daboll about Faulk's lining up as a kick \nreturner. Walsh also told Daboll about Rams running backs ``lining up \nin the flat.'' Walsh said Daboll then drew diagrams of the formations \nWalsh had described. According to media reports, Daboll denied talking \nto Walsh about Faulk. We do not know what Scarnecchia, Dee, Neto or \nBailey did or even if they were interviewed.\n  The Patriots took elaborate steps to conceal their filming of \nopponents' signals. Patriots personnel instructed Walsh to use a \n``cover story'' if anyone questioned him about the filming.\n  For example, if asked why the Patriots had an extra camera filming, \nhe was instructed to say that he was filming ``tight shots'' of a \nparticular player or players or that he was filming highlights. If \nasked why he was not filming the play on the field, he was instructed \nto say that he was filming the down marker.\n  The red light indicating when his camera was rolling was broken.\n  During at least one game, the January 27, 2002, AFC Championship \ngame, Walsh was specifically instructed not to wear anything displaying \na Patriots logo. Walsh indicated he turned the Patriots sweatshirt he \nwas wearing at the time inside-out. Walsh was also given a generic \ncredential instead of one that identified him as team personnel.\n  These efforts to conceal the filming demonstrate the Patriots knew \nthey were violating NFL rules.\n  The filming enabled the Patriots coaching staff to anticipate the \ndefensive plays called by the opposing team. According to Walsh, he \nfirst filmed an opponents' signals during the August 20, 2000, \npreseason game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. After Walsh filmed a \ngame, he would provide the tape for Ernie Adams, a coaching assistant \nfor the Patriots, who would match the signals with the plays.\n  Walsh was told by a former offensive player that a few days before \nthe September 3, 2000, regular season game against Tampa Bay, he--the \noffensive player--was called into a meeting with Adams, Bill Belichick \nand Charlie Weis, then the offensive coordinator for the Patriots, \nduring which it was explained how the Patriots would make use of the \ntapes. The offensive player would memorize the signals and then watch \nfor Tampa Bay's defensive calls during the game. He would then pass the \nplays along to Weis, who would give instructions to the quarterback on \nthe field. This process enabled the Patriots to go to a ``no-huddle'' \noffensive, which would lock in the defense the opposing team had called \nfrom the sideline, preventing the defense from making any adjustments. \nWhen Walsh asked whether the tape he had filmed was helpful, the \noffensive player said it had enabled the team to anticipate 75 percent \nof the plays being called by the opposing team.\n  Among the tapes Walsh turned over to the NFL is one of the AFC \nChampionship game on January 27, 2002, in which the Patriots defeated \nthe Steelers by a score of 24-17. When the Patriots played the Steelers \nagain during\n\n[[Page S4176]]\n\ntheir season-opener on September 9, 2002, the Patriots again won, this \ntime by a score of 30-14.\n  On October 31, 2004, the Steelers beat the Patriots 34-20, forced \nfour turnovers, including two interceptions, and sacked the quarterback \nfour times. In the AFC Championship game on January 23, 2005, the \nPatriots won 41-27 and intercepted Ben Roethlisberger three times. The \nSteelers had no sacks that game.\n  With respect to the 2002 AFC Championship game, it was reported in \nFebruary of this year that Hines Ward, Steelers wide receiver, said: \n``Oh, they know. They were calling our stuff out. They knew, especially \nthat first championship game here at Heinz Field. They knew a lot of \nour calls. There's no question some of their players were calling out \nsome of our stuff.''\n  In addition, Eagles cornerback, Sheldon Brown, reportedly said \nearlier this year that he noticed a difference in New England's play \ncalling in the second quarter of the February 6, 2005, Super Bowl game.\n  Tampa Bay won the August 20, 2000, preseason game by a score of 31-\n21. According to the information provided by Matt Walsh, the Patriots \nused the film to their advantage when they played Tampa Bay in their \nfirst regular season game on September 3, 2000. The Patriots narrowed \nthe spread, losing by a score of 21-16. After the game, Charlie Weis, \nthe Patriots' offensive coordinator, was reportedly overheard telling \nTampa Bay's defensive coordinator, Monte Kiffin, ``We knew all your \ncalls, and you still stopped us.'' The tapes Walsh turned over to the \nNFL indicate the Patriots filmed the Dolphins during their game on \nSeptember 24, 2000, a game the Patriots lost by 10-3.\n\n  According to Walsh, when the Patriots first began filming opponents, \nthey filmed opponents they would play again during that same season. \nThe Patriots played the Dolphins again that season on December 24, \n2000; they again narrowed the spread, losing by a score of 27-24.\n  According to Walsh, he filmed the Patriots' game against Buffalo on \nNovember 5, 2000, a game the Patriots lost 16-13. When the Patriots \nplayed the Bills again that season on December 17, 2000, the Patriots \nwon by a score of 13-10.\n  During the following season, Walsh filmed the Patriots' game against \nthe Jets on September 23, 2001, a game the Patriots lost by a score of \n10-3. When the Patriots played the Jets again that season on December \n2, 2001, the Patriots won by a score of 17-16.\n  The tapes Walsh turned over to the NFL indicate the Patriots filmed \nthe Dolphins during their game on October 7, 2001, a game the Patriots \nlost by 30-10. When the Patriots played the Dolphins again that season \non December 22, 2001, the Patriots won by a score of 20-13.\n  The Patriots filmed opponents offensive signals in addition to \ndefensive signals. On April 23, 2008, the NFL issued a statement \nindicating that ``Commissioner Goodell determined last September that \nthe Patriots had violated league rules by videotaping opposing coaches' \ndefensive signals during Patriots games throughout Bill Belichick's \ntenure as head coach.'' However, the tapes turned over by Matt Walsh \ncontain footage of offensive signals. The tapes turned over to the NFL \nand the information provided by Walsh proves that the Patriots also \nroutinely filmed opponents' offensive signals.\n  Why the Patriots videotaped signals during games when they were not \nscheduled to play that opponent during the balance of the season unless \nthey were able to utilize the videotape during the latter portion of \nthe same game. The NFL has not addressed the question as to whether the \nPatriots decoded signals during the game for later use in that game.\n  Mark Schlereth, a former NFL offensive lineman and an ESPN football \nanalyst, is quoted in the New York Time on May 14:\n\n       Then why are you doing it against teams you aren't going to \n     play again that season?''\n       Schlereth said that ``the breadth of information on the \n     tapes mainly, the coaches' signals and the subsequent play \n     would be simple for someone to analyze during a game. There \n     are enough plays in the first quarter, he said, to glean any \n     team's ``staples,'' and a quick review of them could prove \n     immediately helpful. I don't see them wasting time if they \n     weren't using it in that game.\n\n  Walsh said that Dan Goldberg, an attorney for the Patriots, was \npresent at his interview and asked questions. With some experience in \ninvestigations, I have never heard of a situation where the subject of \nan investigation or his/her/its representative was permitted to be \npresent during the investigation. It strains credulity that any \nobjective investigator would countenance such a practice. During a \nhearing or trial, parties will be present with the right of cross-\nexamination and confrontation but certainly not in the investigative \nstage.\n  Commissioner Goodell misrepresented the extent of the taping when he \nsaid at the Super Bowl press conference on February 1, 2008:\n\n       I believe there were six tapes, and I believe some were \n     from the pre-season in 2007, and the rest were primarily in \n     the late 2006 season. In addition, there were notes that had \n     been collected, that I would imagine many teams have from \n     when they scout a team in advance, that we took, that may \n     have been collected by using an illegal activity, according \n     to our rules. Later, Goodell said of the taping [W]e think it \n     was quite limited. It was not something that was done on a \n     widespread basis.\n\n  Commissioner Goodell materially changed his story in his meeting with \nme on February 13, 2008, when he said there has been taping since 2000.\n  There has been no plausible explanation as to why Commissioner \nGoodell imposed the penalty on September 13, 2007, before the NFL \nexamined the tapes on September 17, 2007.\n  There has been no plausible explanation as to why the NFL destroyed \nthe tapes. Commissioner Goodell sought to explain his reason by saying \nduring his February 1, 2008 press conference that:\n\n       We didn't want there to be any question about whether this \n     existed. If it shows up again, it would have to be something \n     that came outside of our investigation and what I was told \n     existed.\n\n  On April 23, 2008, the NFL issued a statement that the penalties \nimposed on the Patriots last fall were solely for filming defensive \nsignals. ``Commissioner Goodell determined last September that the \nPatriots had violated league rules by videotaping opposing coaches' \ndefensive signals during Patriots games throughout Bill Belichick's \ntenure as head coach.'' The tapes turned over by Matt Walsh also \ncontain footage of offensive signals.\n  The overwhelming evidence flatly contradicts Commissioner Goodell's \nassertion that there was little or no effect on the outcome of the \ngame: during his February 1, 2008, press conference, Commissioner \nGoodell stated ``I think it probably had a limited effect, if any \neffect, on the outcome on any game.'' Later during the press \nconference, Goodell stated again ``I don't believe it affected the \noutcome of any games.'' Commissioner Goodell's effort to minimize the \neffect of the videotaping is categorically refuted by the persistent \nuse of the sophisticated scheme which required a great deal of effort \nand produced remarkable results.\n  In the absence of the notes, which the NFL destroyed, of the \nSteelers' three regular season games and two postseason games, \nincluding the championship game on January 23, 2005, we do not know \nwhat effect the videotaping of the earlier games, especially the \nOctober 31, 2004, game, had on enabling the Patriots to win the AFC \nChampionship. It is especially critical that key witnesses--coaches, \nplayers--be questioned to determine those issues.\n  Failure to question--or at least publicly disclose the results of--\nkey witnesses to other matters identified herein on what we do not \nknow.\n  On the totality of the available evidence and the potential unknown \nevidence, the Commissioner's investigation has been fatally flawed. The \nlack of candor, the piecemeal disclosures, the changes in position on \nmaterial matters, the failure to be proactive in seeking out other key \nwitnesses, and responding only when unavoidable when evidence is thrust \nupon the NFL leads to the judgment that an impartial investigation is \nmandatory.\n  There is an unmistakable atmosphere of conflict of interest or \npotential conflict of interest between what is in the public's interest \nand what is in the NFL's interest. The NFL has good reason to disclose \nas little as possible in its effort to convince the public that what \nwas done wasn't so bad, had no significant effect on the games and, in\n\n[[Page S4177]]\n\nany event, has all been cleaned up. Enormous financial interests are \ninvolved and the owners have a mutual self-interest in sticking \ntogether. Evidence of winning by cheating would have the inevitable \neffect of undercutting public confidence in the game and reducing, \nperhaps drastically, attendance and TV revenues.\n  The public interest is enormous. Sports personalities are role models \nfor all of us, especially youngsters. If the Patriots can cheat, so can \nthe college teams, so can the high school teams, so can the 6th grader \ntaking a math examination. The Congress has granted the NFL a most \nsignificant business advantage, an antitrust exemption, highly unusual \nin the commercial world. That largesse can continue only if the NFL can \nprove itself worthy. Beyond the issues of role models and antitrust, \nAmerica has a love affair with sports. Professional football has topped \nall other sporting events in fan interest. Americans have a right to be \nguaranteed that their favorite sport is honestly competitive.\n  In an extraordinary time, baseball took extraordinary action in \nturning to a man of unimpeachable integrity--Federal Judge Kenesaw \nMountain Landis--to act forcefully and decisively to save professional \nbaseball from the Black Sox scandal in 1919.\n  On this state of the record, an objective, thorough, transparent \ninvestigation is necessary. If the NFL does not initiate an inquiry \nlike the investigation conducted by former Senator George Mitchell for \nbaseball, it will be up to Congress to get the facts and take \ncorrective action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/14/senate-section/article/S4177-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  HONORING MILDRED AND RICHARD LOVING\n\n Mr. CARDIN. For many young Americans, it is hard to believe \nthat only 40 years ago, citizens of the United States were subject to \nprosecution and imprisonment for marrying someone of a different race. \nBut in 1967 that was indeed the situation in 16 States where \ninterracial marriage was illegal.\n  In 1958, Mildred Jeter, a black Native American, traveled with \nRichard Loving, a Caucasian, from Virginia's Caroline County to the \nDistrict of Columbia to be married. They came here because their home \nState of Virginia's anti-miscegenation laws prohibited interracial \nmarriage. Shortly after returning to Virginia, Mr. and Mrs. Loving were \narrested in their home. They pled guilty to violating section 20-58 of \nthe Virginia Code: ``Leaving State to evade law--If any white person \nand colored person shall go out of this State, for the purpose of being \nmarried, and with the intention of returning, and be married out of it, \nand afterwards return and reside in it, cohabiting as man and wife, \nthey shall be punished as provided in Section 20-59, and the marriage \nshall be governed by the same law as if it had been solemnized in this \nState. The fact of their cohabitation here as man and wife shall be \nevidence of their marriage.'' Section 20-59 of the code provided for \nconfinement for between 1 and 5 years. The Lovings were sentenced to 1 \nyear in jail, but the trial judge suspended the sentence for a period \nof 25 years on the condition that the couple leave the State and agree \nnot to return simultaneously for the next 25 years.\n  But after some time away, the couple began to miss Virginia and \ndecided to pursue justice. They hired lawyers and challenged the \nVirginia law through years of court cases leading up to the United \nStates Supreme Court. The Supreme Court heard the case of Richard Perry \nLoving et ux, v. Virginia on April 10 and decided the case unanimously \non June 12, 1967, noting that ``the clear and central purpose of the \nFourteenth Amendment was to eliminate all official sources of invidious \nracial discrimination in the States. . . . We have consistently denied \nthe constitutionality of measures which restrict the rights of citizens \non account of race. There can be no doubt that restricting the freedom \nto marry violates the central meaning of the Equal Protection Clause . \n. . Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a \nperson of another race resides with the individual and cannot be \ninfringed by the State. These convictions must be reversed. It is so \nordered.''\n  Due to their unyielding belief in equality and the work of dedicated \nattorneys, the Lovings prevailed. They made their home in Virginia and \nraised three children. According to published accounts of their life \ntogether, times were hard for the family. Hit by a drunk driver in \n1975, Richard Loving died and Mildred Loving was injured. Mrs. Loving \nlived her remaining years in Virginia until Friday, May 2, 2008, when \nshe died at age 68.\n  Mildred Loving's name lacks the prominence shared by other heroes of \nthe civil rights movement. In fact, she eschewed the limelight and \nviewed her case differently than what many might expect.\n  On the 40th anniversary of the decision, Mildred Loving stated:\n\n       (W)hen my late husband, Richard, and I got married in \n     Washington, DC in 1958, it wasn't to make a political \n     statement or start a fight. We were in love, and we wanted to \n     be married. . . . We didn't get married in Washington because \n     we wanted to marry there. We did it there because the \n     government wouldn't allow us to marry back home in Virginia \n     where we grew up, where we met, where we fell in love, and \n     where we wanted to be together and build our family. You see, \n     I am a woman of color and Richard was white, and at that time \n     people believed it was okay to keep us from marrying because \n     of their ideas of who should marry whom . . . Not long after \n     our wedding, we were awakened in the middle of the night in \n     our own bedroom by deputy sheriffs and actually arrested for \n     the ``crime'' of marrying the wrong kind of person. Our \n     marriage certificate was hanging on the wall above the bed. \n     The state prosecuted Richard and me, and after we were found \n     guilty, the judge declared: ``Almighty God created the races \n     white, black, yellow, malay and red, and he placed them on \n     separate continents. And but for the interference with his \n     arrangement there would be no cause for such marriages. The \n     fact that he separated the races shows that he did not intend \n     for the races to mix.'' He sentenced us to a year in prison, \n     but offered to suspend the sentence if we left our home in \n     Virginia for 25 years exile. We left, and got a lawyer. \n     Richard and I had to fight, but still were not fighting for a \n     cause. We were fighting for our love. Though it turned out we \n     had to fight, happily Richard and I didn't have to fight \n     alone. Thanks to groups like the ACLU and the NAACP Legal \n     Defense & Education Fund, and so many good people around the \n     country willing to speak up, we took our case for the freedom \n     to marry all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. And on June \n     12, 1967, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that, ``The \n     freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the vital \n     personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness \n     by free men,'' a basic civil right.\n\n  Mrs. Loving's words express more poignantly than any others the \nimportance of this case. Although she did not embrace the role of a \ncivil rights hero, because of her forthright bravery, history will \nremember her as such. Last June, the House of Representatives passed \nunanimously H. Res 431, commemorating the 40th anniversary of the \nlandmark Supreme Court decision legalizing interracial marriage within \nthe United States. In addition, June 12 has informally come to be known \nas ``Loving Day'' in the United States in their honor.\n  Next month, when we acknowledge the 41st anniversary of that historic \ndecision, Mrs. Loving will not be with us, but her spirit will remain. \nToday, I pay tribute to Mildred and Richard Loving and to their \nremarkable courage. I offer my sincere condolences to their children \nand grandchildren, and I ask my colleagues to join me in remembering \nthem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/14/senate-section/article/S4177-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4177-S4178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN MEMORY OF LOUISE SHADDUCK\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, on May 4, Idaho lost a pioneer and \none of her strongest champions. The legacy of Louise Shadduck will live \nin the hearts of many Idahoans, particularly for Idaho women now \ninvolved in politics or journalism. She blazed trails and inspired \naction and involvement in the governance of and commentary on our \nsociety.\n  Louise lived an incredible and full life, working as a journalist in \nthe 1930s and 1940s and then shifting to politics where she served on \nthe staffs of historical figures such as Governors Len Jordan and \nCharles Robins, Senator Henry Dworshak and U.S. Representative Orval \nHansen. She was a staunch supporter of Idaho Republicans over the \nyears, but did so with discernment, always making sure to remind those \nin office in her own way that it was Idahoans who they served, not \nthemselves.\n  Louise enjoyed people, and they enjoyed her in return. In high school \nin\n\n[[Page S4178]]\n\nCoeur d'Alene in the early 1930s, Louise wrote an article for a \njournalism contest to win a trip to Alaska. According to an old friend, \nthe entire school got together and voted for her article; she won the \ntrip. Louise was a hard worker. Also in high school, Louise and her six \nbrothers took turns driving the Shadduck family dairy milk truck on its \nroute in the mornings before school started. Some afternoons, Louise \nwould invite her friends to pile on to the empty milk crates on the bed \nof the truck to go to Spokane to catch a movie. She was a pioneer in \nwomen's rights, serving as Idaho State Secretary of Commerce and \nDevelopment in 1958 the first woman in the country in that position. \nLouise also ran unsuccessfully against Gracie Pfost for Congress in \n1956. It was an historic campaign, not only because it was the first \ntime two Idaho women ran against each other in a general election for a \nnational legislative office, but Pfost, the Democrat incumbent, was the \nfirst woman to represent Idaho in Congress.\n  Louise served as executive director of the Idaho Forest Industry \nCouncil and received an honorary law degree from the University of \nIdaho in 1969. She was president of Idaho Press Women in 1966 and was \npresident of the National Federation of Press Women from 1971 to 1973. \nLouise was an avid consumer of history, news and the world, traveling \noften and writing. She authored four books about Idaho and was working \non a fifth when she became ill. Her mind was always sharp, as was her \nwit. People could count on her to be honest, forthright and inclusive, \neven of strangers. Many felt as if they had a second mom in Louise. She \nwas a lover of knowledge and history, arranging family trips to show \nyounger generations where their Shadduck pioneer roots lay. She \nremembered your name after the first introduction. People were vitally \nimportant to Louise, and her thirst for knowledge made her the go-to \nperson for many people when they were researching information about \nIdaho. She was artistically gifted, and was known for her impromptu \nillustrations, sometimes hastily sketched in the front of a copy of one \nof her books and given to a friend.\n  Much of Idaho is rural. Louise internalized the importance of small-\ntown life and the intrinsic value of people. In a small-town, you get \nto know just about everyone. You learn to appreciate the fact that \npeople are much more than just faces in a crowd. In today's hurried, \npopulated world, Louise reminded many of us what was truly important--\nmorals, faith, mutual respect, honesty, individuality, and \ntrustworthiness. Louise once told a reporter that people who leave this \nworld without writing their story down means that we have lost a story. \nWhile Louise wrote many stories, we have lost an epic with her passing.\n  I offer my condolences to Louise's family and friends at this sad \ntime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/14/senate-section/article/S4178-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING JOHN H. McCONNELL\n\n Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I wish to honor John H. \nMcConnell. On April 25, Ohio lost a dear friend and true statesman. \nVery few people cared as much about Ohio as John did, and his legacy \nwill live on through his tremendous contributions in the state.\n  Though he found great professional success in his life, John never \nswayed from his deep-rooted commitment to honesty and integrity in \nevery facet of his life. With just a single load of steel, John founded \nWorthington Industries in 1955 out of his basement home in Columbus, \nOH. Since then, Worthington Industries has reached 10 countries, with \n63 locations and 8,000 employees. With its main divisions in steel \nprocessing, metal framing and pressure cylinders, it generates \napproximately $3 billion of sales annually.\n  Above all else, the Worthington philosophy has always been about \npracticing the Golden Rule. The commitment to good citizenship, civic \ninvolvement, and philanthropy is nowhere better represented within the \nWorthington organization than at the very top level--and that \ncommitment lives on with John's legacy.\n  Worthington Industries has also been recognized for its unfailing \ndedication to its employees and their families. In fact, it has been \nnamed one of the top 100 best places to work in America. John truly \ncared about his employees, and that attitude was reflected throughout \nthe entire company.\n  I worked closely with John when Worthington Industries opened a steel \nplant in Delta, OH. Honestly, I never worked with anyone more candid \nand fair than John. When he made a commitment, it was sure--you didn't \nneed a contract with him. He championed public and private \npartnerships, and as former Governor of Ohio and now U.S. Senator, I \nfound great comfort knowing John was at the head of one of the largest \ncompanies in Ohio.\n  In 2000, Columbus got its first professional athletic team--the \nColumbus Blue Jackets hockey team. John led the group of investors that \nbrought the team to Columbus, where he served as the team's majority \nowner. He also established the Columbus Blue Jackets Foundation, which \nuses the resources of its professional athletes, coaches, and staff to \nimprove the quality of life throughout central Ohio.\n  John and his wife Peggy were also committed to advancing the care and \nprevention of heart disease, contributing $7.5 million to develop the \nMcConnell Heart Hospital at Riverside Hospital in Columbus. The \nhospital still provides exceptional care to those in need and is the \nleading heart care provider in the Midwest.\n  John's outstanding leadership has certainly not gone unnoticed. He \nhas been honored with Financial World Magazine's Outstanding Chief \nExecutive Officer of the Year Award, the Horatio Alger Award, the Ohio \nGovernor's Award, the National Football Foundation Gold Medal, the \nIndustry Week award for Excellence in Management, and with a place in \nthe National Junior Achievement Business Hall of Fame.\n  John was married to his wife Peggy for 59 years, and sadly, they were \nseparated when she passed away in 2005. Perhaps the greatest comfort \nJohn's loved ones can take is in knowing that John has been reunited in \nheaven with his beloved wife. Their enduring love is a model for us \nall.

A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 18 S. G Street, Lakeview, Oregon, as the ``Dr. \nBernard Daly Post Office Building''; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to rename \nthe Lakeview Post Office after Dr. Bernard Daly. I am pleased to have \nmy colleague Senator Wyden join me in this effort by serving as \noriginal cosponsor of this bill.\n  Dr. Bernard Daly was an American country doctor, businessman, banker, \nrancher, state representative, state senator, county judge, and regent \nof Oregon State Agricultural College, today's Oregon State University. \nAs early as 1888, Dr. Bernard Daly began actively encouraging young \npeople to apply for college. When families could not afford the \ntuition, Daly quietly paid the bill.\n  During a Christmas Eve party in 1894, an oil lamp started a fire in a \ncrowed community hall in the small town of Silver Lake, Oregon. Forty-\nthree people were killed in the blaze, and many more were badly \ninjured. Dr. Daly traveled by buggy from Lakeview to Silver Lake, a \ndistance of 95 miles, over bad, snow covered roads to help victims of \nthe tragedy. It took 24 hours of continuous travel for him to reach \nSilver Lake. Despite the long journey, he began treating burn victims \nas soon as he arrived, and continued without rest until everyone had \nbeen seen. Dr. Daly saved all but three of the badly burned persons, \nand his methods of healing were later published in detail in a medical \njournal. The fire was widely reported and written about in The Oregon \nDesert. Dr. Daly's efforts to reach and treat the victims earned state-\nwide recognition and many admirers.\n  When Dr. Daly died, he gave his fortune to the people of Lake County \nin the form of the Bernard Daly Educational Fund. Dr. Daly wrote in his \nwill: ``It is my earnest desire to help, aid and assist worthy and \nambitious young men and women of my beloved county of Lake, to acquire \na good education, so that they may be better fitted and qualified to \nappreciate and help to preserve the laws and constitution of this free \ncountry, defend its flag, and by their conduct as good citizens reflect \nhonor on Lake county and the state of Oregon.'' The fact that his will \nspecifically directed that Daly scholarships be granted to women as \nwell as men was very progressive for that era.\n  Each year, approximately 40 graduates of Lake County high schools \nreceive Daly scholarships. To date, well over two thousand students \nfrom Lakeview and other Lake County communities have used Bernard \nDaly's generous scholarships to attend college. Dr. Daly's educational \ntrust fund has financed college educations for generations of Lake \nCounty, Oregon students, a legacy that continues to this day.\n  I have received several messages from across the country and even one \nfrom Australia supporting the renaming of the Lakeview Post Office \nafter Dr. Bernard Daly. Each one told a story of sincere appreciation \nfor Dr. Daly's generosity.\n  We urge our colleagues to support this important piece of \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself and Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 3017. A bill to designate the Beaver Basin Wilderness at Pictured \nRocks National Lakeshore in the State of Michigan; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing with Senator \nStabenow the Beaver Basin Wilderness Act, which would permanently \nprotect 11,740 acres within the Pictured Rocks National Park located in \nMichigan's Upper Peninsula along the south shore of Lake Superior. Also \nknown as the Beaver Basin area, this area comprises about 16 percent of \nthe national lakeshore. The Wilderness designation would ensure that \nopportunities to appreciate and enjoy nature in a relatively \nundisturbed state at this national lakeshore are preserved for future \ngenerations.\n  The bill responds to many of the concerns expressed during the 5-year \ndevelopment of the General Management Plan for Pictured Rocks, which \nincluded a wilderness study, and involved extensive public involvement. \nBoats powered by electric motors would be allowed on Little Beaver and \nBeaver Lakes within the Wilderness area. All motor boats would be \nallowed to access the miles of the Lake Superior shoreline, as the \nwilderness area does not include the Lake Superior surface water.\n\n[[Page S4184]]\n\nAlso, the access road to Beaver Lakes and Little Beaver campground is \nnot included in the wilderness area, so vehicles would still have \naccess to this popular area. Importantly, the Wilderness designation \nwould not change the fundamental way this land has been managed since \n1981, ensuring continued public access, use, and enjoyment of this \nland.\n  It is critical that the highly valued, pristine natural features of \nthe Beaver Basin area remain the treasure they are today. This area \nprovides a unique and distinct landscape that highlights one of the \nmost beautiful backdrops of the Great Lakes, and it is vital that we do \nall we can to protect it. Significantly, several miles of the North \nCountry National Scenic Trail, also known as the Lakeshore Trail, run \nthrough this wilderness area. This bill would help preserve the serene \nquality of this segment of the trail, and protect the outstanding \nscenery along the shoreline. The wilderness designation will benefit \ncurrent and future generations by protecting this natural and \nundisturbed landscape for the enjoyment of thousands of people in \nMichigan and across the Nation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3017\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 564\n\n       Whereas, more than 35 years ago, the Federal Government \n     began funding research necessary to develop packet-switching \n     technology and communications networks, starting with the \n     ``ARPANET'' network established by the Department of \n     Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in the \n     1960s;\n       Whereas, during the 1970s, DARPA also funded the \n     development of a ``network of networks'', which became known \n     as the Internet;\n       Whereas the National Science Foundation (NSF) in 1987 \n     awarded a contract to the International Business Machines \n     Corporation (IBM), MCI Incorporated, and Merit Network, \n     Incorporated, to develop ``NSFNET'', a national high-speed \n     network based on Internet protocols, that provided a \n     ``backbone'' to connect other networks serving more than \n     4,000 research and educational institutions throughout the \n     country;\n       Whereas Congress knew of the vast impact the Internet could \n     have and the requirement of private sector investment, \n     development, technical management, and coordination to \n     achieve that potential, so in 1992 Congress gave NSF \n     statutory authority to allow commercial activity on the \n     NSFNET;\n       Whereas today the industry, through private sector \n     investment, management, and coordination, has become a global \n     communications network of infinite value;\n       Whereas part of the ARPANET development process was to \n     create and maintain a list of network host names and \n     addresses, which was initially done by Dr. Jonathan Postel at \n     the University of Southern California (USC), and eventually \n     these functions became known as the Internet Assigned Numbers \n     Authority (IANA);\n       Whereas Dr. Postel's performance of these functions was \n     initially funded by the Federal Government under a contract \n     between the DARPA and USC's Information Sciences Institute \n     (ISI), however, responsibility for these functions was \n     subsequently transferred to the Internet Corporation for \n     Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN);\n       Whereas ICANN performs the IANA functions, which include \n     Internet Protocol (IP) address allocation, Domain Name System \n     (DNS) root zone coordination, and the coordination of \n     technical protocol parameters, through a contract with the \n     Department of Commerce;\n       Whereas, since its inception, the performance of the IANA \n     functions contract has been physically located in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas the DNS root zone file contains records of the \n     operators of more than 280 top-level domains (TLDs);\n       Whereas, as of December 31, 2007, more than 153,000,000 \n     domain names have been registered worldwide across all of the \n     Top Level Domain Names;\n       Whereas, since 2000, the Internet community has worked \n     toward providing non-\n\n[[Page S4185]]\n\n     English speakers a way to navigate the Internet in their own \n     language through the use of Internationalized Domain Names \n     (IDNs);\n       Whereas, according to ICANN, of the 905 ICANN-accredited \n     domain name registrars, 571 of them (63 percent) are based in \n     the United States;\n       Whereas ICANN intends to introduce approximately 900 new \n     Top Level Domains over the next several years;\n       Whereas, in January 2007, approximately 51,000,000 domain \n     names were registered, but only 3,000,000 were eventually \n     paid for, and more than 48,000,000 were left to expire after \n     the 5 day registration grace period;\n       Whereas the World Intellectual Property Organization \n     reported in April 2007 that the number of Internet domain \n     name cybersquatting disputes increased 25 percent in 2006;\n       Whereas a 2006 Zogby Interactive poll of small business \n     owners found that 78 percent of those polled stated that a \n     less reliable Internet would damage their business;\n       Whereas, understanding that the Internet was rapidly \n     becoming an international medium for commerce, education, and \n     communication, and that the initial means of organizing its \n     technical functions needed to evolve, the United States \n     issued the ``White Paper'' in 1998, stating its support for \n     transitioning the management of Internet names and addresses \n     to the private sector in a manner that allows for the \n     development of robust competition and facilitate global \n     participation in Internet management;\n       Whereas the Federal Government is committed to working with \n     the international community to address its concerns, bearing \n     in mind the need for stability and security of the Internet's \n     domain name and addressing system;\n       Whereas the United States has been committed to the \n     principles of freedom of expression and the free flow of \n     information, as expressed in Article 19 of the Universal \n     Declaration of Human Rights, done at Paris December 10, 1948, \n     and reaffirmed in the Geneva Declaration of Principles \n     adopted at the first phase of the World Summit on the \n     Information Society, December 12, 2003;\n       Whereas the United States Principles on the Internet's \n     Domain Name and Addressing System, issued on June 30, 2005, \n     stated that the United States government intends to preserve \n     the security and stability of the Internet's Domain Name and \n     Addressing System (DNS), that governments have legitimate \n     interest in the management of their country code top level \n     domains (ccTLDs), and that ICANN is the appropriate manager \n     of the Internet DNS;\n       Whereas all stakeholders from around the world, including \n     governments, are encouraged to advise ICANN in its decision-\n     making;\n       Whereas ICANN has made progress in its efforts to ensure \n     that the views of governments and all Internet stakeholders \n     are reflected in its activities;\n       Whereas the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \n     Development has issued consumer policy guidelines calling for \n     online businesses to ``provide accurate, clear and easily \n     accessible information about themselves sufficient to allow, \n     at a minimum . . . prompt easy and effective consumer \n     communication with the business'', and ``businesses that \n     provide false contact information can undermine the online \n     experience of a consumer that decides to conduct a WHOIS \n     search about the business'';\n       Whereas the WHOIS databases provide a crucial tool for law \n     enforcement to track down online fraud, identity theft, and \n     other online illegal activity, but law enforcement is often \n     hindered in the pursuit of perpetrators because the \n     perpetrators are hiding behind the anonymity of proxy or \n     false registration information: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) while the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and \n     Numbers (ICANN) has made progress in the areas of \n     transparency and accountability as directed by the Joint \n     Project Agreement (JPA), the unique role ICANN has in the \n     coordination of the technical management functions related to \n     the domain name and addressing system, and the direct effects \n     of the decisions ICANN makes on thousands of businesses with \n     an online presence and millions of Internet users, make it \n     critical that more progress be made by ICANN in areas of \n     transparency, accountability, and security for improved \n     stability of the Domain Name and Addressing System (DNS) and \n     the Internet;\n       (2) the private sector's ongoing success in investing, \n     building, and developing the Internet is unparalleled and \n     industry self-regulation must be assured through more \n     effective contract compliance efforts by ICANN;\n       (3) WHOIS databases provide a vital tool for businesses, \n     the Federal Trade Commission, and other law enforcement \n     agencies to track down brand infringement, online fraud, \n     identity theft, and other online illegal activity, as well as \n     for consumers to determine the availability of domain names \n     and to easily and effectively communicate with online \n     businesses;\n       (4) increased involvement and participation in various \n     ICANN processes by international private sector organizations \n     should be encouraged;\n       (5) the United States and other countries should continue \n     to allow the marketplace to work and allow private industries \n     to lead in the management and coordination of the DNS;\n       (6) the performance of the Internet Assigned Numbers \n     Authority (IANA) functions contract, including updates of the \n     root zone file, should remain physically located within the \n     United States, and the Secretary of Commerce should maintain \n     oversight of this contract; and\n       (7) ICANN should continue to manage the day-to-day \n     operation of the Internet's Domain Name and Addressing System \n     well, to remain responsive to all Internet stakeholders \n     worldwide, and to otherwise fulfill its core technical \n     mission.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution on \nthe oversight of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and \nNumbers, ICANN. This resolution is the result of the National \nTelecommunications & Information Administration, NTIA, recently \nconcluding the mid-term review of its Joint Project Agreement, JPA, \nwith ICANN, which is a contract between them for the purpose of \ntransitioning the Internet domain name and addressing system, or Domain \nName System, DNS, to a private sector, multi-stakeholder model of \nleadership.\n  The JPA required NTIA to conduct this mid-term review to assess the \ntransition and ICANN's progress towards becoming a more stable \norganization with greater transparency and accountability in its \nprocedures and decision-making. While ICANN has made notable progress \nin meeting the responsibilities outlined in the JPA, additional \nimprovement and enhancement in specific areas can and should be made.\n  As a result, it is necessary for Congress to voice the importance of \ncontinued U.S. oversight of ICANN. This oversight has provided a strong \nfoundation for ICANN's development and is critical for greater progress \nin areas such as accountability, transparency, and contract compliance. \nAt the same time, it is imperative that the U.S. as well as other \ngovernments maintain a ``hands off'' approach to ICANN so the private \nsector can continue to lead in the management and coordination of the \nDNS.\n  While ICANN, for the mid-term review, detailed the progress it has \nmade in meeting its commitments under the JPA, it is somewhat premature \nfor the organization to suggest the JPA is ``no longer necessary'' and \nit should become independent of U.S. oversight.\n  In addition, numerous organizations submitted comments to NTIA \nexpressing serious concerns about risks that might develop if the JPA \nand U.S. oversight of ICANN were terminated. In particular, uncertainty \ncould arise with resolving legal or contract disputes if ICANN \nrelocated to an unknown legal jurisdiction. Also, ICANN could be unduly \ninfluenced by a country or group of countries that do not embrace \ninnovation or freedom of expression--basically usurping the private \nsector's leadership, which would deter critical investment and \njeopardize the openness of the Internet.\n  This resolution provides the required assurance to these concerned \norganizations and to all businesses around the world in regard to \nmaintaining the security, integrity, and stability of the DNS through \ncontinued oversight of ICANN's responsibilities. Specifically, this \nresolution details key points about the formation of the Internet and \ndomain names, ICANN's efforts, concerns about the growth of domain name \nabuses, and the United States' transitioning of the DNS to the \ninternational community. The resolution then calls for \nadditional improvement to be made by ICANN in areas of transparency, \naccountability, and security for improved stability of the DNS, as well \nas more effective contract compliance to ensure the private sector's \nongoing success with developing the Internet and industry self-\nregulation.\n\n  Additionally, the resolution voices how vital a tool WHOIS databases \nare for consumers, businesses, and law enforcement--these publicly \naccessible databases provide contact information and data on registered \ndomain names, which can assist in establishing trust, resolving \ndisputes, and pursuing online crimes. The resolution also calls for \nincreased participation in ICANN processes by international private \nsector organizations, and states that all governments should apply a \n``hands off'' approach to ICANN so the private sector's leadership with \nthe DNS can continue unabated.\n  The resolution concludes by stating the Internet Assigned Numbers \nAuthority, IANA, functions contract\n\n[[Page S4186]]\n\nshould physically remain in the U.S. and that NTIA should maintain \noversight of this contract. IANA is the entity responsible for \ncoordinating the Internet's number resources, domain names, and \nprotocol parameters--it is operated solely by ICANN. As well, the \nresolution states ICANN should continue to manage the operation of the \nDNS and remain responsive to all Internet stakeholders.\n  Without question, the Internet's vast impact on the world and this \nNation is profoundly indelible and undeniable--there are currently more \nthan 1.3 billion Internet users and more than 165 million websites \nworldwide. And the Internet is poised to have another remarkable \nchapter written about its future.\n  The private sector and ICANN have played an essential role in the \ndevelopment of the Internet and they will continue to do so. The \nprivate sector has and continues to make significant investments in the \nInternet infrastructure as well as with content and applications. \nAdditionally, ICANN may introduce hundreds of new Top Level Domains, \nTLDs, over the next several years--TLDs are basically domain name \nsuffixes such as .com, .net, .edu, .us, and .mobi that signify a \nparticular class of organizations or country. These possible new TLDs \ncoupled with the migration from Internet Protocol version 4 to version \n6, IPv6, which supplies an exponentially larger address space, provides \na large expanse for the Internet to grow and for the innovation that \nwill follow.\n  While the potential of the Internet and the benefits it will provide \nare infinite, if the stability, integrity, and security of the DNS are \ncompromised in any way, it could be detrimental to the future of the \nInternet and all its users. That is why it is paramount the U.S. \ncontinue to have a watchful eye with ICANN to ensure that those \ncritical areas are not hampered. Therefore, I hope my colleagues will \njoin Senators Thune, Hutchison, Bill Nelson, Coleman, Stevens, Smith, \nand me in supporting the critical resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/14/senate-section/article/S4186-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 565--DESIGNATING MAY 15, 2008 AS MILITARY KIDS DAY\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS (for himself, Mr. Bayh, Mr. allard, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \nBrown, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Craig, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Dole, Mr. \nDomenici, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Levin, \nMrs. McCaskill, Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Smith, Ms. Stabenow, \nMr. Stevens, and Mr. Sessions) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Enhancement of \n     Recruitment, Retention, and Readjustment Through Education \n     Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 102. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The World War II-era GI Bill assisted almost 8,000,000 \n     members of the Armed Forces in readjusting to civilian life \n     after completing their service to the nation. With the \n     support and assistance of America's colleges and \n     universities, the GI Bill provided incentives that \n     transformed American society, making a college degree a \n     realizable goal for millions of Americans.\n       (2) In the years following World War II, the GI Bill \n     continued to provide educational benefits for members of the \n     Armed Forces who had been drafted into or volunteered for \n     service.\n       (3) The establishment of the All Volunteer Force in 1973, \n     and its development since its inception, has produced highly \n     professional Armed Forces that are recognized as the most \n     effective fighting force the world has ever seen.\n       (4) The Sonny Montgomery GI Bill was enacted in 1984 to \n     sustain the All Volunteer Force by providing educational \n     benefits to aid in the recruitment and retention of highly \n     qualified personnel for the Armed Forces and to assist \n     veterans in readjusting to civilian life. Today, it remains a \n     cornerstone of military recruiting and retention planning for \n     the Armed Forces and continues to fulfill its original \n     purposes.\n       (5) The All Volunteer Force depends for its effectiveness \n     and vitality on successful recruiting of highly capable men \n     and women, and retention for careers of soldiers, sailors, \n     airmen, and marines, in both the active and reserve \n     components of the Armed Forces, who, with the support of \n     their families and loved ones, develop into professional, \n     dedicated, and experienced officers, noncommissioned \n     officers, and petty officers.\n       (6) The achievement of educational goals, including \n     obtaining the means to a college degree, has traditionally \n     been a key reason for volunteering for service in the Armed \n     Forces. For members who serve a career in the Armed Forces, \n     this goal extends to their spouses and children and has \n     resulted in requests for the option to transfer educational \n     benefits under the GI Bill to spouses and children.\n       (7) As in the aftermath of World War II, colleges and \n     universities throughout the United States should demonstrate \n     their and the Nation's appreciation to veterans by dedicated \n     programs providing financial aid.\n       (8) It is in that national interest for the United States--\n       (A) to express the gratitude of the American people by \n     assisting those who have honorably served in the Armed Forces \n     and returned to civilian life to achieve their educational \n     goals;\n       (B) to provide significant educational benefits to provide \n     incentives for successful recruiting;\n       (C) to motivate continued service in the All Volunteer \n     Force by those members with the potential for military \n     careers and their spouses and children; and\n       (D) to assist those who serve and their families in \n     achieving their personal goals, including higher education, \n     while progressing in a military career.\n\n     SEC. 103.

With the \n     support and assistance of America's colleges and \n     universities, the GI Bill provided incentives that \n     transformed American society, making a college degree a \n     realizable goal for millions of Americans.\n       (2) In the years following World War II, the GI Bill \n     continued to provide educational benefits for members of the \n     Armed Forces who had been drafted into or volunteered for \n     service.\n       (3) The establishment of the All Volunteer Force in 1973, \n     and its development since its inception, has produced highly \n     professional Armed Forces that are recognized as the most \n     effective fighting force the world has ever seen.\n       (4) The Sonny Montgomery GI Bill was enacted in 1984 to \n     sustain the All Volunteer Force by providing educational \n     benefits to aid in the recruitment and retention of highly \n     qualified personnel for the Armed Forces and to assist \n     veterans in readjusting to civilian life. Today, it remains a \n     cornerstone of military recruiting and retention planning for \n     the Armed Forces and continues to fulfill its original \n     purposes.\n       (5) The All Volunteer Force depends for its effectiveness \n     and vitality on successful recruiting of highly capable men \n     and women, and retention for careers of soldiers, sailors, \n     airmen, and marines, in both the active and reserve \n     components of the Armed Forces, who, with the support of \n     their families and loved ones, develop into professional, \n     dedicated, and experienced officers, noncommissioned \n     officers, and petty officers.\n       (6) The achievement of educational goals, including \n     obtaining the means to a college\n\n[[Page S4194]]\n\n     degree, has traditionally been a key reason for volunteering \n     for service in the Armed Forces. For members who serve a \n     career in the Armed Forces, this goal extends to their \n     spouses and children and has resulted in requests for the \n     option to transfer educational benefits under the GI Bill to \n     spouses and children.\n       (7) As in the aftermath of World War II, colleges and \n     universities throughout the United States should demonstrate \n     their and the Nation's appreciation to veterans by dedicated \n     programs providing financial aid.\n       (8) It is in that national interest for the United States--\n       (A) to express the gratitude of the American people by \n     assisting those who have honorably served in the Armed Forces \n     and returned to civilian life to achieve their educational \n     goals;\n       (B) to provide significant educational benefits to provide \n     incentives for successful recruiting;\n       (C) to motivate continued service in the All Volunteer \n     Force by those members with the potential for military \n     careers and their spouses and children; and\n       (D) to assist those who serve and their families in \n     achieving their personal goals, including higher education, \n     while progressing in a military career.\n\n     SEC. 103. PLAN ON COORDINATION OF CURRENT EDUCATIONAL \n                   ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS AND DEVELOPMENT OF \n                   ADDITIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS TO \n                   ENABLE CAREER-ORIENTED MEMBERS OF THE ARMED \n                   FORCES TO ATTAIN A BACHELOR'S DEGREE.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the outstanding men and women who volunteer for service \n     in the Armed Forces and demonstrate through their service the \n     ability, motivation, and commitment to serve as career \n     commissioned officers, noncommissioned officers, petty \n     officers, and warrant officers should be given the \n     opportunities and resources needed to obtain a bachelor's \n     degree before they complete active duty and retire from the \n     Armed Forces; and\n       (2) every effort should be made by the leaders of the Army, \n     Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Coast Guard to demonstrate \n     to members of the Armed Forces who are willing to serve and \n     study that the dual goals of attaining a bachelor's degree \n     and a distinguished military career are achievable and not \n     mutually exclusive.\n       (b) Plan To Coordinate and Develop Educational Assistance \n     Programs.--\n       (1) Plan required.--The Secretary of Defense shall, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, develop \n     a plan to make the attainment of a bachelor's degree an \n     achievable goal for members of the Armed Forces who are \n     motivated towards careers in the Armed Forces and who are \n     able and willing to accept the challenges of military duty \n     and pursuit of college level studies.\n       (2) Advice of the service chiefs.--The Secretary of Defense \n     shall develop the plan required by paragraph (1) with the \n     advice of the Chief of Staff of the Army, the Chief of Naval \n     Operations, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, and the \n     Commandant of the Marine Corps.\n       (3) Elements.--The plan required by paragraph (1) shall \n     include the following:\n       (A) Appropriate elements of current programs to assist \n     members of the Armed Forces in obtaining college-level \n     education, including tuition assistance programs, distance \n     learning programs, and technical training and education \n     provided by the military departments, including programs \n     currently administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n       (B) Appropriate elements of current programs to provide \n     members of the Armed Forces with assistance in obtaining \n     college-level credit for the technical training and \n     experience they undergo during their military career.\n       (C) One or more additional education programs to assist \n     members of the Armed Forces in obtaining a college-level \n     education, including mechanisms for the provision by the \n     military departments of guidance, mentoring, and resources to \n     assist members in achieving their professional military and \n     personal educational goals.\n       (D) Such additional programs or mechanisms, such as \n     sabbaticals from the Armed Forces or college-level education \n     provided or funded by the military departments, as the \n     Secretary of Defense considers appropriate to assist members \n     of the Armed Forces in making adequate progress towards a \n     bachelor's degree from an accredited institution of higher \n     education while continuing a successful military career.\n       (E) Such mechanisms for the application of the elements of \n     the plan to members of the National Guard and Reserves as the \n     Secretary of Defense considers appropriate to ensure that \n     such members receive appropriate assistance in achieving \n     their professional military and personal educational goals.\n       (F) Such elements of current programs of the military \n     departments for in-service education of members of the Armed \n     Forces as the Secretary of Defense considers appropriate to \n     maintain and enhance the recruitment and retention by the \n     Armed Forces of highly trained and experienced military \n     leaders.\n       (4) Submittal to congress.--The Secretary of Defense shall \n     submit to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and \n     the House of Representatives a report setting forth the plan \n     required by paragraph (1) not later than August 1, 2009.\n\n     SEC. 104.

The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. It is my great pleasure to join my colleagues today to \nspeak about a wonderful bipartisan effort that took a lot of time and \neffort, a lot of energy, but we all come to the floor tonight to \ncelebrate a very important food policy, conservation policy, energy \npolicy to the country. And certainly there are many people to thank.\n  It is wonderful to see a member of the Agriculture Committee as \nPresiding Officer this evening. Mr. President, we thank you for your \nefforts.\n  I certainly have to thank our chairman. We would not be here without \nour chairman and his passion and his patience in working through what \nhas been an extremely challenging effort but one that--pardon the pun--\nhas borne fruit and vegetables. So we are very pleased. It was great.\n  I know Senator Chambliss is not here, but what a wonderful partner in \nall of this as well. I know he is somewhere in the building.\n  I wish to say to Senator Crapo before he leaves that it has been \nwonderful to work with him on issues related to specialty crops and \nconservation, and also his wonderful leadership on the endangered \nspecies legislation.\n  There were 250 different organizations, from environmental \norganizations to businesses, that all came together. That alone is a \nfeat. So I congratulate the Senator.\n  Standing next to Senator Crapo, of course, is Senator Roberts, who \ncomes with such passion and experience himself, having led farm bills. \nDespite his razzing me about cherries all of the time, and asparagus, \nwe are going to get you healthy by giving you a lot more fruits and \nvegetables as a result of this wonderful bill.\n  So there are a lot of people to thank--Senators Baucus and Grassley \nfor their efforts on the Finance Committee, leading us. I am proud to \nserve on both committees, as is the distinguished Presiding Officer, \nwho has been in a spot on both Finance and Agriculture to help bring \nthis all together.\n  Also, we would not be here without Senator Conrad and the incredible \nknowledge he and his staff have in crunching the numbers and being able \nto bring us to this point in so many ways. So thank you to him as well \nand, of course, our House colleagues, Chairman Peterson and Ranking \nMember Goodlatte and Chairman Rangel.\n  I also wish to say a special thank-you to a gentleman I have come to \ncall a friend, Congressman Cardoza, who was my partner on the issue of \nspecialty crops in the House. I very much appreciate all of his efforts \nas well.\n  Of course, I have to say thank you to Senator Reid. We would not be \nhere if our leader had not focused on this and provided the kind of \nleadership at the right times to be able to bring people together and \nto once again provide us time on the floor, when time is a precious \ncommodity here as there is so much to be done. So I wish to thank \nSenator Reid for always getting the priorities right in terms of what \nis in front of us.\n  Then I finally, on a personal note, wish to thank two terrific, hard-\nworking members of my staff: Chris Adamo, who has worked every part of \nthis bill for months and months, and Oliver Kim, who did such terrific \nwork on the nutrition title for me. So I wish to thank both of them.\n  This was not, as I said before, an easy negotiation. But we are very \nproud. I am very proud--I know we all are--of the end result. We have \ncreated new opportunities for food and nutrition, significant new \nopportunities. We have new investments in renewable energies--certainly \nimportant to jobs in the great State of Michigan and around the country \nas well as creating energy independence. We strengthened our research \nefforts.\n  I am proud to have led an effort that began with our research \ninstitutions, our land grant colleges proposing something called \nCREATE-21. We used that structure to be able to put in place a research \nstructure to be able to focus more on the competitive research and \nother important changes in this bill as well.\n  We also put in permanent disaster assistance. Due to some weather \nvery recently in Michigan, unfortunately, we may be finding ourselves \nneeding some of the disaster assistance for some of our specialty \ncrops. I am hopeful we will not but, weather being what it is, having a \npermanent disaster assistance program is very important. I think it is \nimportant to have it paid for and have it part of our policy. So I am \npleased we have that as well.\n  There is also an incredible conservation title that is in this bill, \nas well as rural development and, of course, our support for our \nNation's farmers, while at the same time we achieve significant \nreforms.\n  When you put it all together, it is an incredible picture of many \npieces coming together to create the right kind of values and \npriorities and the right kind of policy. I hope we will pass this \nconference report as we passed the original Senate farm bill and as the \nHouse has passed the conference report with an overwhelming majority. \nWe will then send a very strong message to the White House that we have \nincredibly strong bipartisan support, and we are hopeful, in fact, that \nwe will see the same support in the end from the White House. Even \nthough we have certainly received comments to the contrary, we hope we \nwill send a very strong message and that they will come together and \njoin with us and the overwhelming number of Members who have worked so \nhard and supported this policy.\n  We have agreed on a monetary framework that has been talked about \nbefore that is $10 billion above the baseline, above the last farm \nbill. We actually started with fewer dollars, $58 billion less than \nlast time because of commodity prices and so on. So there has been a \nlot of work on the financial side to have a way for us to be able to \ncreate some new investments. And it is significant that those \ninvestments were done not by raising revenue or raising taxes but by \nmaking reforms, by making changes within farm policy. That is very \nsignificant.\n  I think it is also a credit to everyone involved that the $10 billion \nin new spending all goes to food and nutrition programs--all of it; in \nfact, a little bit more than that, $10.35 billion. That is extremely \nsignificant in terms of where our values and priorities are.\n  It is important as well to indicate, as colleagues have, that 73 \npercent of the farm bill goes to food and nutrition programs for \nAmerica's families, primarily through the Food Stamp Program but \nthrough other critical programs as well.\n  I can tell you, coming from Michigan, where we have been hard hit as \nit relates to the economy and what has happened in the global economy \nto manufacturing and so on, we have a lot of folks who never thought \nthey would need help, a lot of folks who have worked hard their whole \nlives and have lost their jobs and now find themselves in a situation \nthat, in order to feed their families, they need some help. They paid \ntaxes their whole lives, and now they are in a situation where they \nneed to have some assistance. In fact, we have one out of eight \npeople--one out of eight--in Michigan today who is eligible for food \nstamps because of the recession and the economy. I am proud we have \nrecognized the fact that we need to make sure in America that food \nassistance is available at times of hardship when families need it.\n  We have also talked about other programs. In the nutrition title, the \nschool snack program is also critical in terms of supporting our fruit \nand vegetables growers. We are talking about expanding a program so \nthat children in schools all across Michigan and all across the country \nwill have the ability, rather than going to the vending machines, to be \nable to have a fresh apple, fresh blueberries, fresh strawberries, \nplums, asparagus, celery, be able to eat fresh fruits and vegetables, \nwhich we know is so important for their own health and growth as well \nas a way to support our growers. With this program, 81,000 Michigan \nstudents will be able to receive fresh fruits and vegetables as a \nresult of the policies we have set up.\n  There are also emergency food programs, community food banks, \nseniors' farmers markets to be able to allow senior citizens to have \ncoupons to buy fresh fruit and vegetables. This is very significant.\n  I wish to also mention and say a special personal thank-you to a \nmember of my family who has advocated so strongly for these food \nprograms, my\n\n[[Page S4204]]\n\ndaughter Michelle, who works for the Capital Area Community Services \noffice in Lansing, MI. She works with low-income families and seniors \nevery day. On more than one occasion, I have been e-mailed while we \nwere working on the farm bill, with my daughter expressing great \nconcern about the small number of items available for senior citizens \nwhen they come in once a month for food. She is giving me lists of two \npotatoes, dried milk, rice, small little lists, and then she says, \n``Mom, these are seniors. Can't we do better than this?'' Well, I am \nproud to say that with what we are doing here now, we are going to be \nable to do better than that. I think personally there is something \nwrong when we have these senior programs and they can't get fresh milk \nor bread, which is not part of those programs. So I wish to thank \nMichelle for pushing and pushing me to remember what it is like for \npeople who are having to live under the funding and the policies we put \nforward.\n\n  There are many titles of the farm bill. Every title is significant. \nEvery title affects Michigan. I come from a State that everybody thinks \nof as automobiles. And we are proud of our auto heritage, our \nmanufacturing heritage, but our No. 2 industry is agriculture. We have \nmore diversity of crops than any other State but California, and we are \nvery proud of that as well. And while our specialty crops--our fruit \nand vegetable growers--are over half of what we grow, we also have corn \nand soybeans and sugar beets and livestock and milk as major components \nof Michigan agriculture.\n  I am proud to have helped author this bill, which maintains a strong \nsafety net and improves policies for all of our farmers and our \nranchers. Michigan is rural in many ways. Around Michigan, up north, \nthe Upper Peninsula, all of Michigan, we benefit greatly by the rural \ndevelopment title. I do not think there is a community in Michigan that \nhas not, in some way, benefited by the rural development title.\n  I am very excited about the energy title and what we have been able \nto do. The energy title really is not only about supporting growers but \nabout creating economic opportunities, jobs, and also addressing the \nissue of gas prices and dependence on foreign oil. With billions of \ndollars in new money for both titles, I know we can help grow jobs as \nwell as grow sources of energy--both incredibly important.\n  One of the most significant energy policies is the new cellulosic \nethanol tax credits. I know that our Presiding Officer has been a very \nstrong proponent of this as well. This tax incentive will build upon \ncorn ethanol, with new cellulosic-based fuels that can be made with a \nvariety of organic sources such as wood, with the great woods of the \nUpper Peninsula in Michigan, to switchgrass or agricultural waste. \nThese new sources of ethanol will also alleviate the burden on corn and \nfood prices, as we know.\n  Furthermore, in Michigan, this new tax credit will provide certainty \nand an incentive for investors like Mascoma, which is a partner with \nGeneral Motors on a cellulosic ethanol project; New Page, which is in \nthe Upper Peninsula and is partnering now to create commercially \nproduced cellulosic ethanol and, again, jobs in Michigan.\n  The farm bill also has one of our Federal Government's strongest \nenvironmental investments, something that I know, among many passions, \nhas been the passion of our chairman, and we would not have the \nconservation title we have if it were not for our chairman.\n  This is significant for natural resources across the Nation, but in \nMichigan it is really crucial, not only to our farmers who use the \nconservation title, but we have any number of ways, whether it is \npreserving wetlands or whether it is focusing on water quality or \nwildlife in the Great Lakes. This is extremely important to us, \nprotecting land and open spaces. Overall, the $4 billion in new \nspending for conservation is vital for us in wetlands, grasslands, \nforests, and maintaining some of our best stewards of the land, our \nfarmers and our ranchers.\n  I am extremely pleased to have included language that makes it clear \nthat we can use dollars from the conservation title to focus on soil \nerosion, runoff, and other issues that address the challenges of our \nGreat Lakes, a very important national resource.\n  Of course I am especially proud of the new farm bill specialty crop \ntitle. I think my colleagues have gotten tired of me talking about \nspecialty crops, but I am very grateful for the fact that half of the \ngrowers in the country, half of our cash receipts in the country come \nfrom what are called specialty crops, fruits and vegetable growers, \nother specialty items, and they have not had a place in other farm \nbills in our history. So I thank the chairman again for working with me \nto create the specialty crop title. These are growers who have not \nasked for direct payments, but they do ask that we recognize and \nsupport them to be successful in a number of areas.\n  They have unique and significant challenges with pests and disease, \nwith trade barriers, with marketing, disaster relief, the need for \nresearch. We know there are important things we can do to support fruit \nand vegetable growers. We have all together, counting disaster \nassistance, a little over $3 billion that will go toward the area of \nspecialty crops. I have to say that when we started this process, we \nput together a bipartisan letter with 36 Members of the Senate asking, \nin fact, that we invest $3.3 billion in specialty crops. We pretty much \nhit that number at the end of the process. I am very grateful to all \ncolleagues who joined together in that effort.\n  These new funds will help the Nation and Michigan. For example, \nMichigan orchards will benefit from competitive research grants that \nwill provide much needed support for efforts to research alternative \npesticides and solutions for new diseases. This is incredibly important \nbecause the FDA zero tolerance policy for insect and larva in fruit is \nsomething our growers have to address. Alternative pesticides have to \nbe found by 2012 to allow cherries and apples to continue to be \nmarketed in the United States. This is a very real challenge, and this \nbill will help them address that. The cherry industry has invested \nmillions of its own dollars in partnering with my alma mater, Michigan \nState University. This partnership will be in a very competitive \nposition to tap into these new dollars for specialty crop research.\n  USDA's ability to aid growers in times of surplus has been \nstrengthened significantly by this title. The addition of value-added \nproducts to section 32, our commodity purchase program, will be of \ngreat help to Michigan growers. Our cherry growers, for example, in \nfact had a surplus year and a promised $8.1 million purchase is coming \nsoon. It is helpful to know in the future this program will be stronger \nand even better.\n  Finally, let me stress the fruit and vegetable snack program. \nMichigan's dried cherries are the single most popular dried fruit \nserved in the program, according to the USDA's own 2004 evaluation. \nThis new market expanding the fresh fruits and vegetables program is \nsomething they are very excited about. There is no question this will \nfocus on and contribute to the health and welfare of our children. \nThere is much in this specialty crop package for both growers and \nconsumers. I am grateful for colleagues supporting this effort.\n  Again, this is a bill that has reforms. It speaks to the future. I \nwould say when we look at not only the safety net that is important for \nour growers, our ranchers, but when we look at new energy \nopportunities, food and nutrition support for our families, \nparticularly now in challenging times, a major effort in conservation \nto protect our land and water, and to provide the ability to protect \nforests and lands for the future, rural development research, on and \non, this is a bill that touches every family, not only those in rural \nAmerica.\n  We specifically included some items such as community gardens to help \nthose in cities who live in areas that unfortunately have been now \ndubbed food deserts, where the local store doesn't have fresh fruits \nand vegetables. It is not something they are able to get. But being \nable to support community groups to have community gardens so, again, \nfresh fruits and vegetables are available, is something that is part of \nthis bill.\n  In every way, this is a bill deserving of a strong bipartisan vote. \nIt is an example of a complicated process that people came together to \nwork very hard on. I am very proud of Senate colleagues. We stuck \ntogether. We pushed\n\n[[Page S4205]]\n\nvery hard for what we believed was the right set of values and \npriorities. We were able to achieve it. I encourage and urge colleagues \ntomorrow to join with us in support of this very important bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, the hour is late. Obviously, the \ngalleries are very nervous and full of people who wish to go home. The \naggie press covering this momentous event is tired, writing furiously, \nas I was. And the chairman of the committee, we are trying his patience \nas he has been sitting here all these hours listening to members of his \ncommittee discuss the farm bill. I thank the chairman for his \nperseverance. I thank the distinguished ranking member, Senator \nChambliss, who, I understand, like Elvis, has left the building, but \nhis presence is still here. So I shall try to be brief.\n  I rise today to speak on the farm bill conference agreement and, most \nimportantly, to stand up and support production agriculture. I want to \nassociate myself with the remarks of the Senator from Arkansas who gave \na very good speech on the value of production agriculture. Apparently \nour Nation enjoys, but too many times simply does not appreciate, \nwhether it be the national media or some in this Congress or whether it \nbe observers of agriculture program policy, the modern-day miracle \nknown as U.S. agriculture. That used to be a staple of all agriculture \nspeeches. I think we need to repeat it--the modern miracle that \nprovides the cheapest and highest quality food supply in the world.\n  We have heard claims throughout the debate that since commodity \nprices are high, we don't need farm programs. That has been in the \nprint of many a newspaper and the subject of several topics within the \nnational media, on television, radio. Those who would make these claims \ndo not understand agriculture or the challenges our farmers and \nranchers face. I doubt seriously if they have ever set foot on any farm \nground. Prices were high in the past and, as quickly as they rose, they \nfell. We could very well see history repeat itself. This is precisely \nwhy we need a farm bill to begin with, a farm bill that provides an \nadequate safety net so producers can compete in the global marketplace, \nproducers especially in high-risk States such as Kansas, who contribute \nso much, 350 million bushels of wheat a year, maybe 400 million, and \nmany other grain products, a big beef State.\n  These producers may barely scrape by for 2, 3, 4, and even 5 years \ndue to inclement weather. High-risk agriculture is what we call it. But \nthe benefits are great. Then 1 year they make it big. When they do, \nthey are able to pay down some debt and maybe upgrade the equipment \nthey have been using for 15 years or they can take their wife and kids \non the first vacation they have been able to afford in years to take \ntime to enjoy. Yet as soon as they get a little bit of breathing room, \nunfortunately, some in the media and other critics claim our producers \nare taking advantage of taxpayers, and they are getting rich, \nespecially farms that farm a lot of acres. It seems to me now that we \nhave a new criteria. If you are a large farmer, meaning if you farm a \nlarge number of acres, you are automatically rich, which is simply not \nthe case. What other business do you know of that can sustain such \nprolonged periods of loss only to hold out for 1 year of reprieve? That \nis why we need a safety net in our farm programs. That is it in a \nnutshell, to help producers weather the storms of instability in the \nmarketplace.\n  It is the deficiency in the safety net protections for wheat and \nsorghum, our producers of sorghum and wheat in this conference \nagreement, that does give me pause. That certainly doesn't come as any \nsurprise to any member of the committee who has taken the time to \nlisten to this member. As a Senator from a State with high-risk \nagriculture, many of our current farm programs simply don't work for my \nfarmers when they have no crop to harvest. This is especially true of \ntarget prices and loan rates. However, two programs have worked. In \nrecent years direct payments, which should be called safety net \npayments and crop insurance, have been a lifeline for Kansas farmers \nand their lenders. Yet title I of this agreement increases target \nprices and loan rates, the same programs that do not help producers \nwhen disaster strikes and they have no crop to harvest, while at the \nsame time cutting the safety net payments or what is called a direct \npayment and crop insurance.\n  Back in 2002, we discovered that the countercyclical program, when we \nwere considering that bill and I made the same speech on the floor at \nthat particular time, would not have provided assistance in 9 of the \nprevious 17 years in Kansas. That is over half the time. My question \nwas, why support a farm bill that does not help your State, one of the \nbiggest producing States in over half the number of years as we went \nback the 17 years? And those 9 years represented some of our toughest \nyears in regard to weather in that period. Since that time, because of \na prolonged drought and late-season freezes, the countercyclical and \nthe loan programs have simply failed to provide assistance to Kansas \nproducers, even when they didn't get a crop. Direct payments or safety \nnet payments and crop insurance did provide the support.\n  Unfortunately, these key programs are treated as a bank in the \nconference report. Even though both the House and Senate passed bills \nthat kept this direct payment completely intact, the conference report \nreduces this producer support in years 2009, 2010, and 2011. Some of my \ncolleagues here and in the House have stated publicly they would like \nto see the direct payment ended altogether and rely on the \ncountercyclical program. Again, it simply has not worked in most of the \nyears that it has been in effect on behalf of my State of Kansas. These \nstatements did create an atmosphere in which moving forward was \ndifficult and at times very frustrating. Thankfully, we were able to \nprotect salvage farmers who were getting ready to head into the fields \nand harvest their 2008 winter wheat crop.\n  I am pleased the conferees worked with me and with others to ensure \nthat our producers would not face cuts to these direct payments in \n2008. Long ago these producers signed operating notes with their \nlenders for this crop year. They should not have the rules of the game \nchanged now. I am pleased we prevented that from happening.\n  Historically we had kept the crop insurance legislation separate from \nthe farm bill, but that changed in 2002. Unfortunately, it does \ncontinue in this bill. I think it should be a separate bill. I remember \nall the hard work Senator Bob Kerrey and I worked on in regard to that \nbill. It was separate then. Perhaps we can do that down the road. Last \ntime around we took $2 billion out of crop insurance. I warned at that \ntime that that was a dangerous road to take. This time the crop \ninsurance program offers close to $6 billion for the benefit of other \nprograms in the bill. So we are taking from crop insurance, using it as \na bank for other programs. This is going to have an effect on producers \nand providers, and don't let anybody tell you differently. While these \ncuts may not unravel the program in low-risk States, they are \ndangerously close to doing so in high-risk States. You know very well I \nam talking about doing an excellent job of representing Colorado, the \nneighboring State, to the west.\n  I am also concerned our producers will have to pay their premiums \nearlier, beginning in 2011. This means they may have to secure credit \nto cover the payment. I am hopeful that since we have a few years \nbefore this takes effect, we can get it fixed before it does hit \nfarmers on their balance sheets.\n  Notwithstanding my concerns for the commodity and the crop insurance \nsections of this bill, let me emphasize that there are strong, positive \nprovisions in this conference report that will go a long way to benefit \nnot only Kansas but the entire Nation. I thank Finance Committee \nChairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley and their staffs for \nfighting so hard to ensure that the tax title of the Senate bill \nremained in the conference report.\n  I am honored to serve on the Finance Committee under their \nleadership, just as I am honored to serve on the Agriculture Committee. \nThey often take hits from all corners around here because of their \nefforts to work together. But it is because of their bipartisanship \nthat we have been able to show the American people that we can work\n\n[[Page S4206]]\n\ntogether to get things done in Washington.\n  They have fashioned an agricultural tax relief package that provides \ntargeted tax relief for farmers and ranchers. It encourages significant \ninvestments in conservation, it decreases our reliance on foreign \nenergy, and it invests in our rural communities.\n  Of particular importance to many of us is a provision that does \ncorrect an inequity in the Tax Code that harms retired and disabled \nfarmers when they receive the Conservation Reserve Program payments. I \nand many others on both sides of the aisle have worked for years to get \nthis fixed.\n  We also help agricultural businesses manage the growing costs of \nsecuring agricultural pesticides and fertilizers. While important to \nfarmers and agricultural businesses, these can also be used for illegal \npurposes. They have in the past, including the manufacture of \nexplosives, and other drugs very harmful, more especially to young \npeople. Those of us in the heartland who remember the attack on \nOklahoma City in 1995 know this risk all too well. Having served on the \nIntelligence Committee, I know all too well about this risk.\n  Also included in this title is important tax assistance for a \ncommunity called Greensburg, KS. Ten days go, we marked the 1-year \nanniversary of the EF-5 tornado--a mile and a half wide--an EF-5 \ntornado that literally wiped the town off the Kansas prairie. I have \nseen tornado damage. Serving in the Armed Services, I have seen tornado \ndamage. I have never seen anything like this, destroying literally 95 \npercent of this community of 1,500 people. The grade school, high \nschool, city hall, hospital, water tower, fire station, every church, \nand all but three businesses in the town were completely destroyed. \nLives were lost in this storm.\n  In the aftermath of this devastation, Senator Brownback and I put \ntogether a very modest and temporary tax relief bill to help residents \nand small businesses pick up the pieces and rebuild Greensburg. This \ntax relief mirrors many of the same provisions Congress approved to \nhelp those affected by Hurricanes Rita and Katrina.\n  Some in the House actually questioned why this legislation was \nnecessary and why it belonged on a farm bill. It belonged in the farm \nbill because this is a rural development and rural revitalization \nissue. The provisions in the package will help residents rebuild the \n1,000 homes that were damaged or destroyed and will help the 113 small \nbusinesses in Greensburg to rebuild and grow their businesses.\n  This tax legislation represents exactly what our Government should do \nto help in times of extreme need, and it belongs in this bill. Frankly, \nthe House should have passed it a year ago, as the Senate did \noriginally on May 25, 2007.\n  The tax title of this conference report is a solid win for rural \nAmerica, and it is a major reason why I will support this legislation--\ndespite my concerns with the commodity title and crop insurance, which \nI have already gone over.\n  I also thank the chairman of the Agriculture Committee and the \nranking member, Senator Chambliss, for working with me to address my \nconcerns with regard to the Rural Utilities Service's broadband loan \nprogram. The reforms included here represent a rare bipartisan and \nconsensus-driven effort to bring broadband Internet to more Americans.\n  As has been noted by others, the conference report makes significant \ninvestments in conservation programs that are popular in Kansas, such \nas EQIP and the Open Fields program that Senator Conrad and I have been \nworking on for years.\n  I am also pleased to see the investments made in nutrition policy, \nspecifically the provisions which encourage our schoolchildren to eat \nmore whole grain foods. Whole grain products are an excellent source of \nfiber and provide nutrients that help reduce the risk of heart disease.\n  Finally, the bill includes two sections that are extremely important \nto Kansas.\n  First, through the livestock title of this bill, we have ensured that \ncompetition is protected in the marketplace and that producers will \ncontinue to be able to market their livestock as they see fit. I am \nalso pleased the livestock title allows for the implementation of the \nCOOL program, the country-of-origin labeling program, in a way that \ndoes not require additional burdensome paperwork on our producers in \nthe beef industry. The beef industry is nearly a $6-billion-a-year \nindustry in Kansas. The livestock title of the bill helps us ensure it \nwill continue to be an important part of our State's economy.\n  The research title of this bill also includes an important provision \nto allow DHS to continue plans to build a new National Bio and \nAgroDefense Facility, NBAF.\n  The research that will be conducted at this facility will be crucial \nin protecting our livestock and commodity industries, human health, and \nthe overall health of our Nation's economy. I thank the chairman and \nranking member for helping to ensure this provision was included in the \nconference report.\n  So, Mr. President, as I have said before, this is not the best \npossible bill. But it may be--and I think is--the best bill possible \nunder extremely difficult circumstances. Certainly the chairman \nunderstands that.\n  While I am not pleased with the way our Kansas wheat and sorghum \nproducers are treated in this bill, I am worried that no farm bill or \nrevisiting the farm bill in the next year or two may lead to an even \nless desirable outcome.\n  You have heard of ``The Last Picture Show.'' This may be ``The Last \nFarm Bill.'' The fact is that we do have important provisions in this \nbill. We also have producers who, in a few short days or weeks, will be \nin the fields harvesting their 2008 winter wheat crops. They need--no, \nthey deserve the predictability and stability of a long-term bill. It \nis time to let them know the rules of the game.\n  I wish, Mr. Chairman, we could seek unanimous consent simply to pass \nthe bill tonight and thereby relieve the President of any decision he \nmight have to make in terms of a possible veto, even though the vote in \nthe House was certainly overwhelming on behalf of the bill.\n  With that, I thank my chairman for his patience.\n  I thank you, Mr. President, for your patience.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak of my support for the \nconference report on the farm bill. I am delighted to follow my \ncolleague, Senator Roberts, who supports the bill, who has served on \nthe conference committee and has been a longtime worker and writer of \nfarm bills. I think this is probably Senator Roberts' fifth or sixth \nfarm bill. So I am delighted to follow in his wake here and to support \nthe same farm bill.\n  I wish to commend my colleagues, Senator Harkin and Senator \nChambliss, for their leadership on this issue. I am proud to represent \nan agriculture State, along with Senator Roberts, and I am proud to \nrepresent Kansas producers and their interests here in Washington. I am \nproud to be here representing my dad and brother who are full-time \nfarmers and people who both use the farm bill and swear at it from time \nto time as well, complaining about different of its provisions that are \nin the farm bill that hit them in an adverse way.\n  Still, I think overall this is a good farm bill. I think some of the \nhighlights of the farm bill are the expansion of ethanol and the \ncellulosic ethanol field. It is an area we are seeing now--with grain \nprices rising and people being concerned about the competition between \nfood and fuel moving into cellulosic--that makes enormous sense, and I \nthink it is clearly one of the ways of the future we need to go.\n  The expansion of biobased products that is in the bill, the expansion \nof the conservation area in the bill, with a keen interest in the \nenvironment that continues to grow in the country in its importance and \nits importance to farmers--I think those are all highlights of the \nbill.\n  I think weak aspects of the bill are its treatment, particularly in \nmy State, toward wheat and sorghum producers. I think those are weak \naspects of this bill.\n  So I think, overall, as my colleague from Kansas said, we need to get \nsome certainty of a bill done, and it is way\n\n[[Page S4207]]\n\npast time for that to take place--way past time. The extensions that \nhave been taking place are an insult to producers who have to have some \nform of planning on the horizon to be able to move forward. They do not \njust buy inputs on a whim. They have to have some planning on the \nhorizon for buying fuels, for being able to buy fertilizers and \nchemicals, and, obviously, with us doing this in May, this spring \nplanting season is over in many places and certainly in the waning \nweeks in others. We need to get this done.\n  Much has been said about this farm bill. It has been well over 2 \nyears in the making. I do not believe it is a perfect farm bill. No \nbill ever is. But I believe it is a bill we need to pass. My producers \nback home simply want a bill passed. That is what I continue to hear \nmore and more: We just want to see a bill passed. They are tired of the \nconstant wrangling back and forth, and they are not pleased with the \ncommodity title that has been cut. Neither am I. But they would rather \nhave the certainty that this bill represents than continue living under \n1- or 2-week extensions.\n  I would like to focus on reasons why I am supporting this farm bill.\n  First--and one of the provisions noted by my colleague--the tax \npackage attached to this bill has a lot of provisions my farmers and \nranchers should be able to take advantage of. There are several \nprograms and incentives for young and beginning farmers, as well as \nmandatory funding for rural micro-entrepreneurs.\n  This is an issue I have been focused on for several years, along with \nmy colleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan. We and many others have \nput forward the New Homestead Act, trying to target the outmigration \nfrom rural areas, and to cause and to help investment in rural \ncommunities, to help stem this tide of outmigration. While we have not \nbeen successful in passing that New Homestead Act yet, I am pleased \nthat many of the initiatives in this farm bill are taken from or mirror \nthose provisions in the New Homestead Act. I think they will help in \nthe outmigration progress that is a big problem in my State, that is a \nbig problem, I know, in the chairman's State, in Iowa, as well.\n  Another piece of the tax package I am pleased is in this bill is the \nprovisions to help Greensburg, KS, rebuild. My colleague from Kansas \nnoted this is a town that was nearly wiped out. Ninety percent of the \ntown was wiped out. The President has visited there twice. He most \nrecently gave the commencement address at the high school, less than 2 \nweeks ago.\n  It is heartening to see the heart of the people in rebuilding. You \nknew from when you saw Greensburg right after the tornado hit and when \nyou met with the people that this town was coming back, that the will \nand the spirit of the people were there. They are building it back \ngreen. It is really fascinating to see the number of small-scale and \nlarge-scale windmills that are in the town, the number of green \nconstruction sites and buildings that are going up. They want this town \nto be green Greensburg, and they are doing it. It is a very interesting \nthing to see.\n  I was visiting with the John Deere dealership there, and he was \nshowing me all of the green features they are putting in. This will be \nthe most environmentally sensitive John Deere dealership in the \ncountry. You can say: Well, I am not sure if that title means a whole \nlot, but it is going to be a model for dealerships around the country \nin the farm equipment business. They are excited about it, and I am \nexcited for them.\n  This bill contains tax provisions that my colleague from Kansas, \nSenator Roberts, has worked hard to get passed. They passed this body \nthree times but have never made it into law. With this bill, they will \nbecome law and go into practice.\n  I am also pleased there are several initiatives in this bill to \ndevelop the biofuels and biobased products. The agriculture industry is \nnow a food, fiber, and fuels business. For years, this has been the \ndream of people in agriculture: to expand the base of the industry from \nfood and fiber to food, fiber, and fuels. Well, that has now taken \nplace. That is now here.\n  You travel across my State, you travel across the chairman's State, \nand there have been enormous investments in ethanol and the expansion \nof that industry, and it has been a great industry. I realize recently \na lot of people have taken to hitting at ethanol. I would ask them, \nwhen they go to the gas pump and they are filling up and they are \nlooking at how high this price is, that they would consider that price \nwould be 25 to 40 cents higher without ethanol. Do they want that?\n  I would note as well that the price of corn is not the culprit on the \nrising food prices. It has had an impact, but quite modest for what \npeople are experiencing, and it is keeping down your fuel prices in an \necologically sound way. I think we can expand that ecologically sound \nfashion with the cellulosic base. So I would hope in the future you \nwould not only have a corn stream going into the ethanol plant but you \nwould have a corn stover or fodder stream going into that same ethanol \nplant that would build and create ethanol out of both cellulose and out \nof the grain as well. That can happen with this title here.\n  I think one of the key provisions is loan guarantees and a new \nproduction tax credit of $1.01 per gallon for cellulosic ethanol that \nwill be available through December of 2012. I think this is a key \nprovision and a very helpful provision in this bill.\n\n  We have been able to make numerous everyday household items recently \nout of agricultural products. Not only do these products reduce our \nneed for petroleum, they also provide a new market for farmers in rural \nareas to tap into.\n  For instance, the Kansas Polymer Research Center at Pittsburg State \nUniversity in Pittsburgh, KS, has been studying, developing, and \npatenting ways to use various soybean oils to replace petroleum \nproducts. The foam rubber in car seats now, they have a patent to be \nable to make that--and it is being made in some places or soon will \nbe--out of soybean oil rather than out of oil products. They have come \nup with ways to use soybean oil to create new chairs, materials in \ncarpet, and even green concrete. Now, the color of the concrete is not \nactually green, but it is using soybean oil providing a new market for \nour farmers and is up to four times stronger than regular concrete. I \nam pleased to see this is being supported in the bill.\n  As I mentioned, I think cellulosic ethanol is one of the key titles \nof the bill. One of the Nation's first cellulosic ethanol plants is \nbeing built in Hugoton, KS. I am pleased it is there. I look forward to \nthe further development of cellulosic ethanol, and this bill helps us \nget there.\n  Finally, while it is not specifically legislated through this bill, \nit is my hope the USDA will hold ``New Uses Expos'' around the country \nto showcase these bio-based products that we clearly have been \ntargeting the Congress to do and to expand with; that the marketplace \ncan expand with, that this title does, that this bill does, and we need \nto show those products off in many places around this country and \naround the world as a further greening of the United States and the use \nof the agricultural industry in expanding its base. This simply makes \nsense. Not only is the Federal Government required to procure bio-based \nproducts when available and affordable, but these are the types of \ninnovative ideas that we should be pushing our agricultural industry to \nfurther develop. We all want our farm economy to move toward a more \nmarket-based system, and these new uses provide us with that \nopportunity.\n  In the livestock title, I would like to also add that I am pleased to \nsee it is going to allow our livestock producers to produce for a \nmarket and not create artificial barriers so the producer cannot get \ncloser to the consumer. There were provisions that were being suggested \nbefore that would block our producers, our livestock producers, \nparticularly our beef producers in Kansas, from being able to get \ncloser to the consumer and thus more of the consumer dollar back to the \nfarmer. Those are not in here, and I am very pleased the livestock \ntitle does not contain those and has worked with the producers, the \nlivestock producers, to help them out.\n  These are just a few reasons I am supporting this bill. I think the \ncircumstances have been very difficult, but I believe it is a bill \nworth supporting. I wish to congratulate the\n\n[[Page S4208]]\n\nchairman and ranking member, Senator Chambliss, for their leadership on \na very tough issue and on a tough farm bill, and it is time to get it \npassed.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor, and I note the absence \nof a quorum.\n  Mr. President, I will withhold that for just a minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Harkin). I thank the Senator from Kansas.\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Parliamentary inquiry: Are we in a quorum call?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No. We are on the bill, and the Senator is \nrecognized for up to 26 minutes.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Thank you very much, Mr. President and Mr. Chairman. \nThank you so much.\n  Let me first say thank you to all of the people who have worked on \nthis legislation in this body. Tonight is a night to celebrate what can \nbe done when people come together and work for a common effort. To the \nchairman of the Agriculture Committee, the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer, I will only say it is his patience which is the kind of \npatience of Job which has gotten us here tonight on the evening before \nwe pass the conference report on the farm bill and get it moved forward \nto finality. It takes someone such as the Senator from Iowa who is the \nonly U.S. Senator who still lives in the same house that he was born \nin, who really understands what it is like to be a salt-of-the-earth \nfarmer and rancher, to move forward with the kind of patience and \nleadership to finally be at the point where we are going to get this \nhistoric farm bill across the finish line. So I wish to thank him, as \nwell as Ranking Member Chambliss for his leadership.\n  This has been a work long in progress. I remember some 3 years ago \nbeginning some of the first conversations about the rewrite of the farm \nbill. I fondly remember the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, \nSenator Harkin, coming to the State of Colorado to hold the very first \nhearing on this farm bill which is here before us tonight. For that, \nthe producers, the nutrition programs, the hunger programs, the farmers \nand ranchers of the State of Colorado and of this Nation will always be \ngrateful.\n  I also wish to say thank you to Senator Baucus and to Senator \nGrassley, the chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee. I \nhave the privilege of sitting on both the Finance Committee and the \nEnergy Committee. At the end of the day, how both committees were able \nto work together to develop a package that is one that we will be \nrightfully proud of is in part a great tribute to both Chairman Baucus, \nas well as Senator Grassley, for their work.\n  I also wish to thank Senator Conrad for his leadership in \nunderstanding the numbers. He is in a unique situation as the chairman \nof the Budget Committee and is the one who understands the Federal \nbudget perhaps better than anybody else in this entire Chamber. I wish \nto thank also the others who served on the conference committee and who \nlabored so hard to get this bill across the finish line, and to my \ncolleagues on the Finance Committee, as well as on the Agriculture \nCommittee, for all of their great work.\n  Across the hallway, on the other side of this Capitol, I wish to \nthank Chairman Peterson of the House Agriculture Committee and Chairman \nRangel for his hard work as well, and Congressman Salazar, a member of \nthe Agriculture Committee, one of the salt-of-the-earth, true farmers \nstill here in Washington, DC, who still wears the calluses on his hands \nfrom the work that he does on tractors and out in the fields. I thank \nhim for his leadership.\n\n  Finally, in terms of thanking leadership, it is important for us also \nto recognize that we would not be here were it not for Senator Harry \nReid, our majority leader, because it was through his efforts that he \nsteadfastly continued to push for us to get a final farm bill. His \nmultiple meetings with Speaker Pelosi and with the leadership in the \nSenate in the committees to try to get us across the finish line is \nsomething we must honor and we must pay tribute to because without his \nleadership, we would not be here tonight.\n  I also wish to briefly say thank you to my wonderful staff and to the \nproducers of the State of Colorado, to Grant Leslie, my legislative \ndirector, Brendan McGuire, to Tommy Olsen, and to all of my State staff \nand Washington staff who worked so hard on this bill.\n  I strongly support this farm bill conference report and I wish to \nthank everyone who has worked on this bill. It is a bill which is \nbipartisan, forward-thinking, a balanced package, and it is one which I \nthink will pass overwhelmingly tomorrow.\n  There is a lot riding on this farm bill. This is a bill that helps \nfamilies put healthy and safe food on their tables. It helps kids get \nfresh fruits and vegetables for their lunches. It helps protect our \nland and our water. It helps us build a clean energy economy so vital \nto the national security of America and of the 21st century. Nowhere, \nhowever, is the farm bill more important, of course, than on farms and \nranches in small towns and rural communities all across our Nation. \nToday, more than half of the counties in America are designated as \nrural counties. Mr. President, 44 of the 64 counties in my State of \nColorado are defined as rural counties. For the last 8 years, many of \nthese counties which are home to 50 million Americans have, in my view, \nbeen largely ignored by Washington, DC--ignored in its policies and \nignored in its priorities. This farm bill sets us on the right track \nand in a new direction.\n  We can see the effects of Washington's neglect in places such as my \nnative Conejos County, one of the poorest counties in the entire United \nStates of America where almost a quarter of the residents today still \nlive below the poverty line. You can also see the difficulty in rural \nAmerica on many of the Main Streets across the country, including Main \nStreet of Brush, CO, where you can drive down Main Street and probably \nhalf of the businesses and stores have been closed down. The population \nin all of those counties across all of the eastern plains of my State \nhas been declining.\n  The truth is, the rural communities across our country are \nstruggling. Median income in rural counties is around $11,000 less than \nthe national median--$11,000 less than the national median. So country \ncousins and city cousins, when they compare their average per capita \nincome, they know if you happen to live in that part of the country, \nyou are going to end up making about $11,000 less than if you happen to \nlive in the city.\n  Jobs in many rural areas across America are disappearing. Hospitals \nand health clinics are closing. Schools have declining enrollments, and \nyoung people everywhere across rural America have to leave to find \nopportunities elsewhere. It is an exodus that takes place from rural \nAmerica into urban America day after day, year after year, decade after \ndecade.\n  Of the 1,729 rural counties in the Nation, 865--that is about half of \nthose counties--lost population between 2000 and 2005. This map shows \nall of those red counties which have been losing population between \nthose years, and it is those counties in all of America that we try to \naddress to provide a new direction, a new hope, a new opportunity and \noptimism for rural America in this farm bill.\n  In my view, rural America has been forgotten for far too long, and \npassing this farm bill is of the utmost urgency. This legislation will \nhelp bring new life, new energy, and new opportunities for farmers and \nranchers and for small town populations all across America. As a \nreminder of the importance of our farms and ranches in rural \ncommunities for our food supply in our society, I have for a long time \nsince my days as attorney general in Colorado had a sign on my desk \nthat says: ``No Farms, No Food.''\n  Today, I have that sign on my desk in Washington, DC. I think it is \nalways important for all of us to understand the importance of \nagriculture and the food security of this Nation to take every \nopportunity to remind the world and to remind our fellow 300 million \nAmerican citizens that our food security ought never to be taken for \ngranted.\n  Tonight, this legislation, which has been led by Chairman Harkin, is \nmaking that statement across America: No Farms, No Food. I will tell my \ncolleagues that anyone who goes without food for a day or two will \nrecognize how important our farms are to America's food security.\n\n[[Page S4209]]\n\n  Unfortunately, I don't think the President of the United States has \nunderstood what is at stake. I hope he doesn't veto this bill. He has \nsaid multiple times that he will, even though his administration has \nhad ample opportunity and has been at the table of negotiations and \ndialogue on the farm bill for many years now. So I am hopeful at the \nend of the day, this President, who at least in pictures is from \nCrawford, TX, would understand what those rural communities--including \nthe community of Crawford, TX, and the communities across all of rural \nTexas--that signing this farm bill is an important way for him to stand \nand say rural America is, in fact, important.\n  I am proud of this bill before us. The farm bill will spur the clean \nenergy revolution that is already underway on our farms and fields \nacross America. It will help us reach the goal of producing 25 percent \nof our energy from renewable resources by the year 2025. There was a \nprovision that was included in the 2007 Energy bill which we passed out \nof this Senate and signed by the President which Senator Grassley and \nmyself worked on during that Energy bill. This farm bill will stimulate \nrural development because in a number of different ways it will provide \nthe stimulus needed for rural development to move forward, but in \nparticular broadband, which is really needed in the 21st century for \nrural America to advance, is included and addressed in this bill in a \nmajor way.\n  This farm bill--thank you, Mr. Chairman of the Agriculture \nCommittee--is also the strongest conservation farm bill in the history \nof the United States of America. It will help in an unparalleled way, \nunprecedented way to protect our lands, our water, and our air for \nfuture generations to come.\n  This farm bill also makes significant major investments in nutrition. \nSome of these changes are long overdue, including the changes to the \nfood stamps program. This bill will help make sure we have healthy and \nsafe food on dinner tables all across our country.\n  Finally, this bill will bring a better balance and certainty to \nagricultural markets, while closing loopholes and carrying out needed \nreforms for our farm programs.\n  Through a set of smart investments, this bill will help America build \na clean energy economy that has its roots in America's farms and \nfields. I predict that in the decade ahead, we will see rural America \nand agriculture start to bloom and flower as it embraces the new energy \nfrontier. With the $1 billion in the farm bill devoted to energy \nprograms and an additional $403 billion in tax incentives for the \nproduction of renewable energy, farmers will be able to apply for \ngrants to develop biorefineries and improve the handling, harvest, \ntransport, and storage of feedstocks for biofuels.\n  This bill includes tax credits for small wind turbines and cellulosic \nbiofuel production, and it stimulates research into the methods and \ntechnologies that will allow the most productive lands in the world to \nprovide more and more of our energy.\n  On rural development, this farm bill lays the infrastructure to rural \nbroadband and micro business loans, for accelerating economic \ndevelopment in rural areas. The bill includes $150 million for \nimportant rural development initiatives, including the $15 million for \nthe Micro Enterprise Loan Program, a provision I was honored to work on \nwith Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska. The program will also provide \ntechnical assistance and small grants and loans to beginning rural \nentrepreneurs. The micro loans will provide incentives for beginning \nentrepreneurs to open their businesses in rural communities, thereby \ncreating jobs and increasing the rate of rural migration. According to \nthe Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado, \nmicroenterprises account for about 30 percent of the jobs in 37 of the \nState's mostly rural counties. These types of important programs are \nessential to economic development.\n  In my view, this is the strongest conservation bill in the history of \nfarm bills, building on the 2002 farm bill by investing an additional \n$4.4 billion in conservation programs. Non-Federal agricultural and \nforest lands occupy 1.4 billion acres here in the mainland of America. \nThat is about 70 percent of the land in the lower 48 States.\n  We all consume the air, the water, and open space, and enjoy them \nall, so it makes sense that the farm bill should provide some incentive \nfor farmers and ranchers to deliver these public goods, along with all \nthe other products they grow.\n  That is why the farm bill increases spending on conservation programs \nby $7.9 billion, including increasing funding to important programs \nsuch as the one developed by the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, \nthe Environmental Quality Incentive Program, EQIP, increasing the \namount by $3.4 billion. It provides $1.3 billion to the Wetland Reserve \nProgram and extends the Conservation Reserve Program by 32 million \nacres to be enrolled in the program from 2010 to 2012, all of which \nhave been very successful programs in the State of Colorado.\n  This is a picture of an EQIP conservation innovation grant at work in \nmy State of Colorado. These farmers from the Saint Vrain and Boulder \nCreek watersheds are learning new practices that reduce tillage and \nincrease yields from those farmlands. At the end of the day, these \nfarmers went home with new ways to boost their bottom line, while \nreducing erosion. These programs work. The EQIP program works. We know \nthat we, as a nation, will benefit from them.\n  On nutrition, sometimes people forget that the largest investments in \nthis farm bill don't actually go to the commodity programs or the \nenergy programs or to any of the other titles of the farm bill; they go \nfor nutrition. Nutrition programs receive two-thirds of the funding of \nthis bill. This farm bill does some wonderful additional things for \nnutrition and for hunger, including the more than $10 billion for \nnutrition programs that will reduce hunger and provide kids with \nhealthy meals. That is $10 billion above what had been provided before. \nThat is a significant investment in nutrition.\n  I am particularly proud we are able to expand the chairman's Fresh \nFruit and Vegetable Program in all 50 States, including my State of \nColorado. That means that in my State--my small State of Colorado--\n80,000 Colorado kids are going to get fresh fruits and vegetables in \ntheir school lunches. This will reduce childhood obesity, increase \nproductivity in school, and it will teach the habits of a healthy \nlifestyle.\n  In food production, there are benefits to rural development, energy \nproduction, but this farm bill also ensures continued production of \nsafe, healthy food right here at home.\n  Growing up on our ranch and farm in the San Luis Valley in southern \nColorado taught me how tough it is to make a living off the land. You \nwork sun up to sundown all year. You cannot take Sundays off. It is a \n7-day-a-week job--most of the time 365 days a year. You try to raise a \ngood crop or a healthy herd, and then without anything you can do to \nprevent it, a disaster comes, something such as disease, drought, hail, \nor flooding, which can wipe it all away. I still remember when \nhailstorms would hit our farm. My mother would take and pour a salt \ncross outside of our house in the hope that somehow the hail would \nforego destroying our wheat and our alfalfa and other crops, because \nthat was our only way of subsisting. We have gone beyond the cross \nhere, although we all have faith. We have moved forward with the \ncreation of a disaster program that, hopefully, will help us address \nthe issue of disaster in rural America.\n  I know the time is late. I want to make a quick comment about some of \nthe reform efforts about which some have criticized this farm bill, \nincluding the White House. I think those criticisms are wrongly placed. \nI think there may be additional reform we can do and may do at another \ntime with the farm bill. But it is important to note we have included \nreform in this farm bill. This farm bill requires direct attribution of \npayments to individuals, rather than ``entities'' so that there is 100 \npercent transparency about who is receiving farm program payments.\n\n  The bill eliminates the three-entity rule and also includes a \nprovision that I helped with to eliminate the ``cowboy starter kits,'' \nwhich will prevent the distribution of commodity support payments for \nland that has been subdivided for houses or transferred to \nnonagricultural uses. This is an important fix.\n  I conclude by saying that those of us who have had the privilege of \nbeing a\n\n[[Page S4210]]\n\npart of rural America can appreciate how important agriculture in our \nrural communities is to our country. That is why I am hopeful the \nPresident's threat to veto the bill will be reconsidered.\n  The farm bill is not only about farms, it is about our future. It is \nabout the entrepreneur who wants to build a biofuels plant in eastern \nColorado; it is about the third grader who, for the first time, will \nget fresh fruits and vegetables for lunch; it is about the mother who \nwants us to reduce our dependence upon foreign oil so her children do \nnot have to fight a war far away in the Middle East. It is about all of \nus who want to make sure we have a strong and secure America.\n  We have a lot at stake in the passage of this farm bill. I urge my \nDemocratic and Republican colleagues to join us and send a strong \nstatement about the importance of rural America, our food security, and \nour energy security in an overwhelming vote on the conference report \ntomorrow.\n  On my part, I will be very proud to take this farm bill back to the \nState of Colorado and go throughout the great State of Colorado and \nmeet with those who care about rural America and the food security of \nthis country, and who care so much about nutrition, and to talk to them \nabout how it is that after 2\\1/2\\ years of hard labor, we have finally \ngotten to the end of the journey and we have a farm bill of which we \ncan all rightfully be proud.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and I thank the chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I believe there are no more speakers on \nthe farm bill tonight, or I should say the food, conservation and \nenergy bill. I will close by thanking all of the speakers tonight who \nspoke so eloquently and strongly for this bill. I thank them for their \ndiligence and interest in and so many of them for their efforts in \nbringing us to this point. It truly is a bipartisan bill.\n  A lot of times while I am traveling around Iowa and other States, \npeople will come up to me and say: Can't you people get together and \nquit your bickering and get something done? I am sure the Presiding \nOfficer has heard that, too. We have all heard that. Well, this is a \ntime when we did that. We did get together in a bipartisan fashion on \nour committee and we worked hard. We got it through our committee in a \nday and a half. In December, we had the vote here and we had 79 votes \nfor the farm bill. You cannot get much more bipartisan than that. So we \ndid it. We worked together.\n  Tomorrow, we will have another hour and a half of debate, evenly \ndivided, on the bill. There will be at least one motion, which has \nalready been made, on a point of order. I don't know if there will be \nany others tomorrow morning. Then we will proceed to final passage. I \nwill have more to say tomorrow morning.\n  Again, I thank all of the members of the Agriculture Committee on \nboth sides of the aisle. I can honestly say each member of our \ncommittee had a hand in this bill in one way or the other, or on \ncertain parts of it--some more than others in different parts. The \nPresiding Officer, my good friend from Colorado, Senator Salazar--if he \nhad one fingerprint on this bill, it would be the energy title and all \nthe great work he did to help focus us on getting more in the bill for \nbiomass energy, that is, energy from cellulose--to begin the process of \nmoving us toward more clean, renewable energy in this country. I thank \nthe Senator from Colorado for all of his hard work in that area. \nHowever, the Senator also had a lot to do with the nutrition title, to \nmake sure that was a good title to help low-income Americans.\n  Everybody on our committee had a hand in this. I am privileged to \nchair a great committee.\n  This is a committee of caring people. I know each of them. I can say \nthat characterization applies on both sides of the aisle. These are \npeople who care very deeply about fighting hard to represent the \nminority of Americans who live on our farms and our ranches and in our \nsmall towns and communities. But for, I think, the interest and \ninvolvement of the members of this Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry \nCommittee, the legislation that is passed here would leave a lot of our \nrural people on the sidelines.\n  Let's face it, we don't have the votes here on farm and rural issues \nlike we used to in the old days. So it falls on the shoulders of those \nof us on our Agriculture Committee who represent agriculture and people \nwho live in rural America, it falls on us to make sure their voices are \nheard and their concerns are addressed.\n  That is why I say I am privileged to chair a committee of caring \npeople, who care very deeply about those minority of Americans who work \nout there on farms and ranches every day, get up, feed the livestock, \nplant the crops, harvest the crops, who never know from one day to the \nnext what the weather is going to bring or what foreign involvement may \nmean to markets or what effect a crop failure or abundant crop in \nanother country has on this country and on our markets and prices. \nAgriculture is different. A lot of people say: Why do we have farm \nprograms? We don't have a program for this business or that business. \nIt is because agriculture is so unique. It is sort of the wellspring of \neverything else in our society--the production of our food and fiber, \nfor the health of our country, and for our exports.\n  I was listening to the President of the United States give his State \nof the Union Address earlier this year. I heard him say, there was one \npassage--I will never forget--he reminded us that last year our trade \ndeficit had shrunk. I had hoped to hear him say in the next sentence, \nthanks to our nation's farmers because were it not for the exports of \nour agricultural commodities, our trade deficit would be much worse \nthan it is.\n  Again, I thank everyone for all of their statements. I thank all the \nmembers of our committee. We will be here tomorrow morning, and we will \nhave a final vote. I hope we will have a strong vote. I hope we can \nbeat our 79 votes that we had in December. The House today had 318 \nvotes. So I hope we have an equally strong vote in the Senate tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/14/senate-section/article/S4210-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, MAY 15, 2008\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.
