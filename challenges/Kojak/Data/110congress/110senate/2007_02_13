Mr. President, I want to spend a few minutes talking \nabout the importance of what we are doing with this bill and why \namendments ought to be allowed in order. I have a very specific \namendment I have filed that has to do with health care in this country. \nBasically, it has to do with the health care of the most vulnerable in \nthis country, babies.\n  In the early 1980s, an epidemic of an unknown virus started in this \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S1880]]\n\nWe now know it as HIV/AIDS, and a lot of progress has been made in that \nfight. During the Reagan Presidency, his AIDS Commission recommended \nroutine testing. That was in 1986. In 2005, the CDC finally recognized \nthe wisdom of that AIDS Commission recommendation, and it is now CDC \npolicy that routine testing from the ages of 17 to 64 be carried out on \neverybody in this country who encounters health care.\n  The Ryan White bill, which was recently passed in the 109th Congress, \ntook note of those recommendations. And within the HIV community, there \nhas been debate about the CDC guidelines. But some of that was put to \nrest on the basis of what we know has been an exemplary program in two \nStates that have all but eliminated HIV transmission to babies.\n  The policies in many States in this country require extensive \ncounseling before anybody can be tested. What was found by the CDC, and \nmany other organizations, is that a small number of people who are \npregnant will actually get tested. New York, led by a courageous \nDemocratic legislator by the name of Nettie Mayersohn, passed a law in \n1996. In that year they had 500 babies born with HIV. In the last 2 \nyears, since that law has been passed, they have had less than 7.\n  Now, what happened? What did they do? What they did was they used \ncommonsense public health, and they said: we test women who are \npregnant for lots of diseases antenatally so we can know how to handle \nthem and take care of their infant should they have one of those \nproblems. They applied that same common sense to HIV, and hundreds of \nbabies are born every year in New York who do not get HIV because \ncommonsense public health policies were applied.\n  It is very simple. If we know your HIV status, and you are positive, \n99 percent of the time we can keep your child from getting HIV. There \nis not hardly any other disease we have in obstetrics--and I am an \nobstetrician--that is that effective.\n  What we have done in the bill before us is take away all the money \nfor that, take all the money away the CDC says now is the guideline, \ntheir recommendation, the recommendation of the American Medical \nAssociation, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. \nWhy are we doing that? There is a claim it was an earmark. I will not \nspend the time to bore everybody with the definition of an ``earmark.'' \nThis came as part of the Enzi-Kennedy Ryan White bill because it is \ngood public health policy and it applies as an incentive to every State \nout there to start doing something that will make a difference in \nsomeone's life.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that HIV be \na routine testing procedure. Washington, DC, has a wonderful Director \nof their AIDS Commission, Marsha Martin. Last June they started routine \ntesting in this city. This city has 3.5 percent, it would seem, of its \npopulation infected with HIV--about three and half to four times the \nrest of the Nation. They have identified almost 1,600 HIV patients.\n  Now, why is that important? The reason that is important is because \n70 percent of the infections that are now occurring in HIV are \noccurring in people who do not know they are infected. And if they do \nnot know they are infected, they will transmit the disease without \nknowing they are transmitting it.\n  Before the Nettie Mayersohn law in New York State, only 62 percent of \nthe women who were pregnant knew their HIV status. After that, we are \nat almost 96 percent. The difference is 500 babies a year born with HIV \nversus 7--a very significant difference.\n  What does that mean in terms of the children? It means a life not \nhaving a disease, not being stuck, not being given medicine, and having \na life expectancy of less than 25 years of age. That is what that \nmeans.\n  So with that leadership in the State of New York, what has been \naccomplished is 99 percent of the prenatal transmission of HIV has been \nprevented. It also means those pregnant women who are HIV positive are \nnow being treated at a much earlier stage in their disease, which gives \nthem far greater--probably the same life expectancy as you or I because \nof the tremendous advances in medicine. What we do know is the later \nthe diagnosis, the shorter their life expectancy and the higher the \ncost.\n  Now, let me walk you through, for a minute, what others say about \nthis. CDC also recommends prenatal testing and treatment of newborns. \nHere is what they have said:\n\n       Considering the potential for preventing transmission, no \n     child in this country should be born whose HIV status or \n     whose mother's status is unknown.\n\n  It costs $10 to test, it costs $75 to treat, to prevent 99 percent of \nthem. It makes a major difference in thousands of children's lives \nevery year. It makes a major difference in thousands and thousands of \nwomen's lives every year to have this diagnosis.\n  What happens if we do not do it, if we do not encourage it? And this \npart of the Ryan White Act was meant to incentivize States to move to \nthe CDC recommendation. It costs $10,000 a year to treat a newborn who \nis infected with HIV.\n  One of the problems with this tremendous epidemic that we face is it \nnarrows in on a group of people, a large percentage of whom happen to \nbe African-American women. They account for two-thirds of the infection \nin women yet are 13 percent of our population. How dare us take this \naway.\n  Multiple organizations have supported this policy. The Early \nDiagnosis Grant Program was established by the Ryan White HIV/AIDS \nTreatment Modernization Act. It provides $30 million for grants that \nwill be utilized for States that become eligible to do the testing and \nthe treatment for both mothers and their infants.\n  To be eligible for the funds, they have to offer a voluntary opt-out \nHIV testing program for pregnant women. They have to commit to \nuniversal HIV testing of newborns when the HIV status of their mother \nis unknown. They have to offer voluntary opt-out HIV testing of clients \nat sexually transmitted disease clinics. And they have to offer \nvoluntary opt-out HIV testing of clients at substance abuse treatment \ncenters, where we know most of the disease tends to be seen.\n  This is current CDC policy--the people whom we trust to tell us what \nto do. Funding for this grant is provided out of existing HIV moneys at \nCDC, prevention funds that are already there, which they know will have \ntremendous positive effects.\n  Now, think about it: 500 infants at $10,000 a year, every year. \nMultiply it, multiply it, multiply it, and it only takes 4\\1/2\\ years \nto spend $30 million if we do not do this. These funds are targeted for \nthose most at risk of infection, as well as those most likely to \nbenefit from treatment.\n  President Bush, in his budget, asked for this money to be directed as \nwell. So this is not something that does not have broad support, both \nin the health community, with the President, and many of those most \nactive in the HIV community.\n  The point we should not forget is baby AIDS can be virtually \neliminated if expectant mothers with HIV are identified and treated for \nHIV during their pregnancy. When treatment is provided during \npregnancy, labor, and delivery, and to infants after birth, the risk of \ntransmission goes down to less than 1 percent. Without treatment, 25 \npercent of the infants will become HIV infected.\n  But how do we treat? We cannot treat unless we know they have it. We \ncannot know they have it unless they are tested. We cannot test unless \nwe have the incentives to test. So this creates the incentive programs \nfor States to copy what both New York and Connecticut did. Connecticut \nhas not had an HIV-infected baby since 2001.\n  They have eliminated it in Connecticut. Why should we not do the same \nthing? Why should we disallow an amendment to restore this funding that \ngoes to the heart of those most vulnerable in our country? It also goes \nto help those who are most disaffected, those who are on the poorer \nspectrum, those who have less opportunity because that is where we see \nmore infection.\n  For the 1 percent who would not be cured, what we know is, we are \ntreating early. We are not waiting until they get the disease in a \nfull-blown state. What we know is, your likelihood of dying, if you are \ndiagnosed when your CD 4 count is below 50, exponentially goes up. So \nearly diagnosis with HIV is of paramount importance.\n\n[[Page S1881]]\n\n  It also needs to be said that one out of every four people in this \ncountry who have HIV don't know it. They have no knowledge that they \nhave it. That one out of four accounts for 70 percent of the new \ninfections in this country. So the CDC policy of frequent testing, opt-\nout testing, more testing is a policy that makes absolute sense from a \npublic health perspective.\n  Because only a few States have similar laws to Connecticut and New \nYork, hundreds of babies will still become infected this year. To take \nthis money out, to say none of the money can be spent for this program, \ncondemns hundreds of newborn babies to a life of HIV infection and \nAIDS. That is what this bill does. It condemns hundreds of babies in \nthis country to a life with HIV. It is a preventable disease. Why would \nwe do that? Why would we come anywhere close to that?\n  I mentioned Marsha Martin. Since last year, they started a policy of \nroutine frequent testing, and 16,000 individuals in Washington, DC, \nhave been tested. Five hundred eighty people who would not have \notherwise been tested have been diagnosed with HIV at a stage at which \nwe can save their life. Some of those were pregnant women. People say: \nYou don't need to do this. Why is it important for every woman to know \nwhether she is HIV positive or negative if she gives birth to a baby? \nBecause only 25 percent of the time does this virus get transmitted to \nthe baby at birth. But what they don't think about is, if they breast-\nfeed the baby, they will transmit the virus as well. So your baby may \nnot be infected at birth, but if you breast-feed your baby and you are \ncarrying HIV, it is a death sentence for the baby. So to not know your \nstatus puts your baby at risk, even though it was not infected at \nbirth.\n  Here is what happened in Connecticut. They went from 28 percent of \nthe women who knew their HIV status before they passed the law to 90 \npercent of the women. What does that translate into? That translates \ninto saving lives, not just the women who were HIV positive who found \nout and had early treatment but their children as well. Why would we \nnot want to incentivize the rest of the States to do what has been \nsuccessful in New York and Connecticut and several other States?\n  The health commissioner of New York is pushing to change State law to \nmake testing more convenient for patients and health care providers:\n\n       We are aggressively offering testing to patients who come \n     to us for routine physicals, heart disease, a sprained ankle. \n     We are lessening the stigma sometimes associated with HIV and \n     helping connect many more HIV-positive individuals with early \n     treatment.\n\n  Here is the other difference I would hope the esteemed Members of the \nSenate would recognize. By doing early testing, the cost to treat is \n$10,000 a year. By doing late testing, the cost to treat is $40,000 a \nyear, with much more in terms of complications. Again, to test costs \n$10, to treat a newborn is $75, versus $10,000 a year at a minimum.\n  Women, children, and African Americans will be most affected by the \ntermination of this program. Since the beginning of the HIV epidemic, \nAfrican Americans have accounted for almost 400,000 of the estimated 1 \nmillion AIDS diagnoses in our country. According to the 2000 census, \nAfrican Americans made up 13 percent of our population. However, in \n2005, 49 percent of the estimated 40,000 new cases were African \nAmerican. It is 24 times the rate in African-American women than it is \nin white women. Why would we not want to intercede with testing to save \ntheir lives?\n  Between 120 and 160,000 women in the United States are infected with \nHIV. In 2001, the National Congress of Black Women issued a report \nentitled ``African American Women and the HIV/AIDS Initiative,'' that \noutlined that group's strategy to combat HIV/AIDS among black women. \nAmong their recommendations: Every State should be required to screen \nall pregnant women for HIV and test all newborns for the virus and \nCongress should appropriate funds for such initiatives. Every year that \npasses results in hundreds of more cases of baby AIDS that could have \nbeen prevented.\n  Who supports doing this perinatal testing and treatment? The American \nMedical Association, the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force, the \nAIDS Health Care Foundation, the Children's AIDS Fund, multiple medical \ngroups, and, yes, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the \none agency we fund to tell us what we should do. It is their policy. We \nare denying their policy. We are denying infants the right to live \nwithout HIV.\n  Here is what they said:\n\n       Based on information presented in the MMWR, the available \n     data indicate that both ``opt-out'' prenatal maternal \n     screening and mandatory newborn screening achieve higher \n     maternal screening rates than ``opt-in'' prenatal screening.\n\n  The status quo.\n\n       Accordingly, CDC recommends that clinicians routinely \n     screen all women for HIV infection, using an ``opt-out'' \n     approach and that jurisdictions with statutory barriers to \n     such prenatal screening consider revising them. In addition, \n     CDC encourages clinicians to test for HIV any newborn whose \n     mother's HIV status is unknown . . . CDC recommends rapid \n     testing of the infant immediately postpartum so that \n     antiretroviral prophylactics can be offered to HIV-exposed \n     infants.\n\n  Ninety-nine percent, we can prevent. We have taken out the capability \nfor other States what New York and Connecticut have done, and we are \nrefusing to allow the replacement of that to save the weakest and most \nvulnerable in our country.\n  What are the claims we have heard? Here is the first claim: Even \nwithout funding for this particular HIV testing grant program, Federal \nfunds will still be available for HIV testing. What is true is that \nother Federal funds can provide HIV testing. As written, section \n20613(b)(1) of this bill specifies that none of the funds appropriated \nfor 2007 can be used for any early diagnosis grants. This \nwould specifically forbid Federal funding for HIV testing of pregnant \nwomen in any area--newborns, patients receiving treatment for substance \nabuse, and those accessing services at STD clinics. These populations \ninclude those most at risk for HIV, as well as those who can most \nbenefit from early treatment and intervention. It is counterintuitive \nthat this would be a part of this bill.\n\n  What are the activities that are supported by this $30 million that \nare going to be prohibited, including HIV AIDS testing, including rapid \ntesting? It only costs $10. It precludes prevention counseling. It \nexcludes treatment of newborns exposed to HIV. It excludes treatment of \nmothers infected with HIV or AIDS and the costs associated with linking \nthe diagnosis of AIDS to care and treatment for that disease. The $30 \nmillion instead will revert to other CDC HIV/AIDS program activities \nwhich in recent years have included the following: Beachside \nconferences, flirting classes, erotic writing seminars, zoo trips, and \nother dubious initiatives that do not have any lifesaving impact or \nnear lifesaving impact as early diagnosis and treatment.\n  This $30 million is either going to be spent effectively or it is \ngoing to be wasted. President Reagan's AIDS Commission was right. They \nsaid it in 1986. The CDC caught up last year in 2005 to the policies \nthat were recommended to this Congress in 1985-1986.\n  Few, if any, States would benefit from the funding provided by this \nprogram. The point of this program is to encourage States to update \ntheir policies to reflect CDC's recommendations for HIV testing and \nbaby AIDS treatment. That is the whole purpose. That is part of the \nwhole Ryan White grant. It is to improve our approach to HIV, to \neliminate newborn infections, and to eliminate transmission from those \nwho don't know. While few States would immediately qualify for early \ndiagnosis grants, the availability of the funds was intended to get \nthem to move to the point where they would take advantage of that, \nwhich means they would be saving hundreds of babies' lives every year \nand protecting the lives of the mothers who were there to nurture them. \nIt makes no sense that we would prohibit money for this process.\n  Many States, including Illinois, are already moving in this \ndirection. States such as New York and Connecticut have had the \npolicies in place for over a decade. And the proof is there.\n  What is the other claim? This bill defunds all earmarks. The Early \nDiagnosis Grant Program is an earmark and, therefore, has not been \nsingled out but has been removed, along with other special funding \nprojects.\n  Fact: The Early Diagnosis Grant Program is not an earmark. All States\n\n[[Page S1882]]\n\nwith routine testing policies are eligible for the funding provided by \nthis grant. Those which are not currently eligible can become eligible \nby passing the law or implementing State regulations to meet funding \neligibility.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. COBURN. I am happy to yield to the senior Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. May I inquire as to how much longer the distinguished \nSenator will be speaking?\n  Mr. COBURN. About 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator. If the Senator will yield further \nmomentarily, I ask the Chair, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. We are in morning business. The \nminority has 41 minutes; the majority has 66 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair and the distinguished Senator for \nyielding.\n  Mr. COBURN. This program doesn't match the definition or criteria of \nan earmark approved by the Senate in January or used by the \nCongressional Research Service. On January 16, 2007, the Senate \napproved an amendment by a vote of 98 to zero, defining the term \n``earmark'' as a provision or report language included primarily at the \nrequest of a Member, delegate, resident commissioner, or Senator, \nproviding, authorizing or recommending a specific amount of \ndiscretionary budget authority, credit authority or spending authority \nfor a contract loan, loan guarantee, loan authority or other \nexpenditure with or to an entity or targeted to a specific State, a \nspecific locality or a specific congressional district, other than \nthrough a statutory or administrative formally driven competitive war \nprocess.\n  This doesn't come anywhere close to that definition. It doesn't meet \nany of criteria that the Senate has defined as earmark. It is not \ndirected to any specific State, any entity, any location, and does not \nbypass the statutory award process.\n  CRS defines an earmark as funds set aside with an account for \nspecific organization or location, either in the appropriations act or \nthe joint explanatory statement of the conference committee. CRS notes \nthat such designations generally bypass the usual competitive \ndistribution of awards by a Federal agency. This doesn't meet any of \nthat. It is hogwash to call this an earmark, and everybody knows it. \nEverybody knows it.\n\n  Claim: This program would violate the privacy rights of women by \nrequiring mandatory HIV testing.\n  This doesn't require mandatory HIV testing. It offers women to have \ntesting and they can say, ``I don't want to be tested,'' rather than \nfor them to have to ask to be tested.\n  Current laws mandating extensive pre- and post-test counseling make \nHIV testing the most overregulated diagnostic and thereby discourage \nhealth providers from offering patients screening for HIV.\n  Testing newborns for HIV is too little too late. That is the other \npoint I have heard. The science doesn't support that at all. If the \nbaby has HIV antibiotics, 99 percent of the time we can prevent them \nfrom becoming infected. Of those who do, the 1 percent who do become \ninfected, we can treat so much better by knowing it at an early stage. \nWe can extend their life for years at less than $40,000 a year, at \n$10,000 a year. By not knowing and waiting until their CD4 counts come \ndown precipitously low, we go from $10,000 a year in treatment to \n$40,000 a year in treatment.\n  I will finish with a couple of comments.\n  In the early eighties, I delivered a little girl. Her name was Megan. \nTwo years later, her mother re-presented to me with full-blown AIDS. \nThe mother died 3 weeks later. Megan lived an additional 8 years.\n  Had we done this and had we known to have done this, Megan would be \nalive and flourishing. Her mother would be alive with HIV. Megan would \nhave never gotten HIV.\n  I will never have that little girl's face removed from my memory. We, \nby this bill and not allowing the reestablishment, are creating \nthousands of Megans in this country--thousands, thousands. If this body \nwants that on their shoulders, continue what we are doing today. But if \nwe claim to be here to help the helpless, to put in place policies \nthat, No. 1, the best of the science tells us are the right policies, \nand No. 2, makes a massive difference in individual lives, then make in \norder this amendment to restore this money. By not doing so, you walk \nout of here condemning hundreds of infants, thousands of infants to \ndeath, at worst, and a life on medicines for the rest of their life.\n  You also condemn a large group of African-American women to the lack \nof knowledge and the lack of effective drugs that can give them a \nnormal life. You can decide. The power is on the majority side. They \nget to decide this issue. But you dare not come back into this Chamber \nsaying that you care for children, that you care for minorities, and at \nthe same time have gutted one of the programs that will give hope to \nthose same groups of people. You can't have it both ways. You can't \nsingle out good medicine, good public health care, and true compassion \nfor those most at risk, and then come back and claim you care.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, for how long am I recognized?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has under morning \nbusiness up to 65 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, today marks the 136th day of the fiscal year. The \nfiscal year is over one-third complete. We will be debating House Joint \nResolution 20, a joint funding resolution for the nine remaining \nappropriations bills that were not completed during the 109th Congress. \nThe Republican leadership during the 109th Congress left us with a \ngreat deal of unfinished appropriations business. Only 2 of the 11 \nappropriations bills were enacted into law; 13 of the 15 Federal \nDepartments are struggling to cope with a very restrictive continuing \nresolution which expires at midnight this coming Thursday.\n  As I noted last week, this was not the fault of the Appropriations \nCommittee. Under the able leadership of Chairman Thad Cochran, all of \nthe fiscal year 2007 appropriations bills were reported from the \ncommittee by July 20. All--a-l-l--all of the bills were bipartisan \nbills approved by unanimous votes. Unfortunately, the Republican \nleadership of the 109th Congress chose not to bring domestic \nappropriations bills to the floor before the election and then chose \nnot to finish those bills after the election. Instead, Congress passed \na series of restrictive continuing resolutions.\n  If Congress were to simply extend the existing continuing \nresolutions, we would leave huge problems for veterans and military \nmedical care, for education programs, law enforcement programs, funding \nfor global AIDS, funding for energy independence, and funding for \nagencies that provide key services to the elderly, such as the Social \nSecurity Administration and the 1-800-Medicare call center.\n  In December, the new House of Representatives appropriations \nchairman, David Obey, and I plotted a bipartisan and bicameral course \nfor dealing with this problem. Based on that plan, there were intense \nnegotiations--intense negotiations--in January which included the \nmajority and the minority in the House and the Senate.\n  I, as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, consulted with \nseveral Senators, and especially with Senator Thad Cochran, several \ntimes during that process, and his ranking members and their staffs \nwere included throughout the process.\n  The resolution that is now before the Senate is the product of these \nefforts. The resolution, which totals $463.5 billion, meets several \ngoals. Let me repeat the figure: $463.5 billion. That would be $463.50 \nfor every minute that has passed since our Lord, Jesus Christ, was \nborn.\n  Get this. These are the goals: First, funding stays within the $873.8 \nbillion statutory cap on spending, the cap which was set during the \n109th Congress and which equals the President's request.\n  Second, the legislation does not--does not--include earmarks. We \neliminated over 9,300 earmarks. Hopefully, the ethics reform bill will \nestablish greater transparency and accountability in the earmarking \nprocess. Once the ethics reform bill is in place, we will establish a \nmore open, disciplined,\n\n[[Page S1883]]\n\nand accountable process for congressional directives in the fiscal year \n2008 bill.\n  Third, there is no--there is no--emergency spending in this \nresolution.\n  Finally--finally--essential national priorities receive a boost in \nthe legislation. To help pay for these priorities, we cut over $11 \nbillion from 125 different accounts and we froze spending at the 2006 \nlevel for 450 accounts. These national priorities have broad bipartisan \nsupport, as noted in the White House Statement of Administration \nPolicy. Many of these increases reflect administration priorities.\n  For veterans care, we include $32.3 billion, an increase of $3.6 \nbillion over the fiscal year 2006 level. For defense health \ninitiatives, we include $21.2 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion over \nfiscal year 2006. To provide care for military members and their \nfamilies, including treating servicemembers wounded in action in Iraq \nand Afghanistan, for the Labor, HHS, and Education bill, funding is \nincreased by $2.3 billion.\n  Title I grants for our schools are funded at $12.8 billion, an \nincrease of $125 million over fiscal year 2006, which will provide \napproximately 38,000 additional low-income children with intensive \nreading and math instruction. The legislation also funds the title I \nschool improvement fund at $125 million to target assistance to the \n6,700 schools that failed to meet No Child Left Behind requirements in \nthe 2005-2006 school year. For the first time in 4 years, we will have \nan increase in the maximum Pell higher education grant from $260 to \n$431.\n  The National Institutes of Health are funded at $28.9 billion, an \nincrease of $620 million over fiscal year 2006.\n  Three hundred million dollars is included for the Federal Mine Safety \nand Health Administration. Let me say that again. Three hundred million \ndollars is included for the Federal Mine Safety and Health \nAdministration, an increase of $23 million over fiscal year 2006, to \nallow the agency to continue its national efforts to hire and train new \nmine safety inspectors for safety in the Nation's 2,000 coal mines.\n  The legislation increases funding for Federal, State, and local law \nenforcement by $1.6 billion. According to the FBI, last year violent \ncrime rose--went up--in America for the first time in 15 years.\n  Under the continuing resolution now in law, highway funding is \nfrozen--frozen--at the 2006 level. Under this joint funding resolution, \nthe Federal-Aid Highway Program is fully funded at the level guaranteed \nin the highway law.\n  The joint resolution includes $4.8 billion for global AIDS and \nmalaria programs, an increase of $1.4 billion over fiscal year 2006.\n  Last week there was debate concerning the level of funding for the \n2005 base closure and realignment program. The resolution that is \nbefore the Senate provides $2.5 billion for the base closure and \nrealignment 2005 program. This level is $1 billion--I say again--this \nlevel is $1 billion higher than the level available in the current \ncontinuing resolution the President signed on December 9. However, this \nlevel is $3.1 billion below the level requested by the President. I \nassure all Senators that the Appropriations Committee, of which I have \nthe honor of being chairman, intends to address the $3.1 billion \nincrease when the Senate takes up the $100 billion supplemental the \nPresident sent to the Congress last week. Last week. I have every \nexpectation that the supplemental will be before the Senate next month. \nThis being February, I have every expectation that the supplemental \nwill be before the Senate next month.\n  Now, let me take a moment to review how we came to be where we are on \nfunding the base closure account. Last year, under the very able and \ncompetent leadership of Chairman Thad Cochran, Senator Hutchison, and \nSenator Feinstein, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported out the \nMilitary Construction bill on July 20, which was over 6 months ago, and \nthe bill included $5.2 billion for the base closure account. \nUnfortunately--I say unfortunately--that bill was never sent to the \nPresident. The President triggered the problem when he vowed to veto \nthe fiscal year 2007 Defense bill unless the Senate added $5 billion--\n$5 billion; that is $5 for every minute since Jesus Christ was born--$5 \nbillion to the Senate version of the Defense bill. This is the same $5 \nbillion the Senate Appropriations Committee had put toward addressing \nneeds, such as funding the base closure account and funding veterans \nmedical care.\n  The Republican leadership of the 109th Congress followed the \nPresident's lead, appropriated the $5 billion to the Defense bill, and \ndid not send to the President the Military Construction-Veterans bill \nor eight of the other appropriations bills. Funding for BRAC was among \nthe many victims of that decision. Thus, and therefore, it was left to \nthe 110th Congress to solve the budgetary mess left by that decision.\n  While the extra $1 billion added to BRAC in this resolution does not \nbring the program up to the level of the President's budget request, it \nis sufficient--it is sufficient--to address one of the Defense \nDepartment's most urgent BRAC priorities; namely, the construction of \nfacilities needed to bring U.S. troops back from Europe. The remaining \n$3.1 billion for the base closure effort can and will be addressed \nthrough the supplemental next month.\n  This is not a perfect resolution, but it is a thoughtful resolution. \nBy complying with the statutory cap on spending, it is a fiscally \ndisciplined resolution. By eliminating earmarks, it provides Congress \nwith time to pass ethics reform legislation to increase transparency \nand accountability. By targeting resources toward national priorities, \nsuch as veterans and military medical care, we--the pronoun ``we''--\nsolve the most distressing of the problems created by the existing \ncontinuing resolution.\n  Now, looking ahead to the fiscal year 2008 bill, I am committed to \nworking with my friend and colleague, Senator Thad Cochran, the ranking \nmember from Mississippi, to bring--hear me--to bring 12 individual \nbipartisan and fiscally responsible fiscal year 2008 appropriation \nbills to the floor. When? When? This year.\n  However, on this, the 136th day of fiscal year 2007, adoption of \nHouse Joint Resolution 20 will ensure that we answer some of our \nNation's most pressing needs and avoid an unnecessary Government \nshutdown. It is time to act. I urge swift--not Tom Swift, but swift \nadoption of the resolution.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum and I ask \nunanimous consent that the time be charged equally against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that morning \nbusiness be dispensed with, that the Senate resume consideration of \nH.J. Res. 20, the continuing resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from the State of \nPennsylvania, I object.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I came to the Senate yesterday to spend \nseveral hours speaking to the Senate to describe the loss of a program \ncritical to rural counties in my State. The Secure Rural School and \nCommunity Self-Determination Act of 2000 benefits more than Oregon. In \nfact, there are 38 other States and 700 counties nationwide that are \naffected. The safety net program it embodies protected 8.5 million \nschoolchildren, 557,000 teachers, and 18,000 schools from Washington \nState to California to Mississippi and West Virginia. That safety net \nwas removed through expiration last September.\n  Last week, I filed an amendment to the continuing resolution that \nwould have extended the Secure Rural School and Community Self-\nDetermination Act by 1 year. This time is needed to keep these 700 \ncounties whole while Congress writes and enacts a longer term program.\n  Yesterday, I was allowed to speak but not as long as I had hoped to \nspeak. In fairness to other colleagues and at the request of the \nmajority leader, I ended up only taking up a couple of hours. I thought \nit was necessary yesterday and, still, to describe fairly the severe \nimpacts the expiration of the\n\n[[Page S1884]]\n\nSecure Rural School Fund will have upon my State and upon many others. \nLikewise, the amendment tree has been filled to prevent the Senate from \nconsidering amendments such as mine.\n  The CR is critical to my State and others to have this amendment on \nit simply because of the operation of time. There is one other vehicle \ncoming up--the emergency supplemental--that could also serve to \nmitigate the damage which is being done. But that bill is not expected \nto pass until sometime in April. Between now and then, thousands of \npublic employees will be laid off. Public libraries will be closed, \npublic services curtailed, public safety put in jeopardy.\n  While this bill will keep the Federal Government afloat, the most \nbasic elements of our extended democracy in places such as Oregon will \nbe in peril. That is not fair. It is not something I will condone or \nbless with my vote on this bill.\n  I will continue to come to the Senate and speak to this, even after \ncloture is invoked, to try to appeal to my colleagues that this \ncontinuing resolution, which is the continued work product of the 109th \nCongress, should include this indispensable provision, this funding, \nthat is so vital to the most basic services which Government is called \nupon to provide.\n  Some may wonder why we are at this juncture, why it has taken so \nlong, where there has been no action. As a former Member of the \nmajority, I cannot begin to count the numbers of meetings I attended, \npleading the case of my State, asking for consideration and being met \nwith warm words but no commitments. My colleague now, Senator Wyden, is \nundertaking nobly to do the same thing as a Member of the current \nmajority. Together, we are both committed to doing everything that is \npossible, that this business not be left undone because it is so \ncritical to the State of Oregon and others.\n  It affects Oregon disproportionately because the formula for the \nSecure Rural School and Community Self-Determination Act was based on \nhistoric timber levels. Many Americans do not realize that Oregon is \nover half owned by the Federal Government. The Federal Government \ncreated the western expansion in large measure because of the Railroad \nAct, incentivizing people to go and settle. California had the gold, \nbut Oregon had the green gold in the form of timber, logs, raw material \nfor building homes and structures throughout America and, frankly, \nthroughout the world.\n  The relationship that was developed between Oregon and the Federal \nGovernment was based upon timber. Because local and State governments \nare constitutionally prohibited from taxing the Federal Government, the \nFederal Government realized, as the greatest landowner, it had to \nprovide some opportunity for local communities to have things such as \nschools, paved roads, police officers, and the like, the things which \nare normally in the general funds of counties. What it did, when the \nFederal Government would put up timber for sale, it would do it on a \nbid basis; 75 percent of the money received from bidding Federal timber \nwould come to Washington, DC; 25 percent would go to the local \ncommunities. This was in lieu of property taxes because they had no \nother recourse to tax the Federal Government. This went on for well \nover 100 years and it worked wonderfully.\n  But the ethic in the United States has changed as it relates to the \nharvesting of trees and the extraction of natural resources. The \nspotted owl was held up as an emblem that its survival was imperiled by \nthe harvesting of trees. After 15 years of the Endangered Species Act \nlisting of the spotted owl, it has now become clear the threat to the \nspotted owl was not logging; it was, in fact, the barred owl, which is \nnot native to Oregon but which eats the spotted owl. In addition to \nthat because timber harvest was ended on public lands, we now suffer \nextraordinary nonhistoriclike wildfires that consume millions of acres, \ndestroying spotted owl habitat.\n  But in all of this, through the decade of the 1990s, President \nClinton generously recognized the forest policies he had implemented \nwere doing great harm to rural communities, to timber-dependent towns, \nso we established the Secure Rural School and Community Self-\nDetermination Act. In establishing that, it made up the difference, a \nbandaid, if you will, until we could write Federal timber policy in a \nway that would allow for these communities to survive in the interim.\n  President Bush was elected to office. He has tried mightily, through \nthe Healthy Forest Initiative, through supporting and, for the first \ntime, funding the Northwest Forest Act, to try to free up timber so the \nfunds are not necessary. But despite his best efforts, the courts and \nthe laws of Congress have prevented that from occurring.\n  So with the expiration of this act, we desperately need its \ncontinuance, its reenactment, as we continue to work to rebalance the \nenvironmental and economic equation.\n  The irony is we are losing spotted owls through natural predation and \nthrough catastrophic wildfire. And all of the 30,000 jobs lost in my \nState--family wage jobs--those have not been replaced and Americans \nstill need timber.\n  So where do we get our timber? We get it from Canada. Canada has \nspotted owls as well. But what Canada does to fill the void America \ncreated for American consumers is to overcut its lands without near the \nenvironmental protections we have on our own forest lands. As a result \nof that, the question ought to be asked: Does the spotted owl know the \ndifference between the border of the United States and the Canadian \nborder? I believe the answer is no.\n  As science and evidence is proving more all the time, the peril to \nthe spotted owl is not humankind, it is its own kind, the barred owl, \nand then, of course, catastrophic wildfire.\n  Congress needs to live up to this. This is an obligation that comes \nwhen the Federal Government, as the biggest land owner, has said you \ncan't cut trees. But when it says you can't cut trees, that comes with \na cost. It is a cost with a price, and it is a price which the Federal \nTreasury owes as a matter of a moral obligation.\n  The time to act is now. Yes, we can wait for the emergency \nsupplemental, but if we do, much of the damage will already have begun \nto take place. It is not necessary that we wait. It is necessary that \nwe act now. That is my appeal. That is my message. That will continue \nto be the reason why I come to the Senate to inform my colleagues of \nthis problem and of this moral obligation. If we can't have the \nresources in terms of dollars, then allow Oregonians to restore its \ntimber industry so it can produce jobs, produce timber, produce the tax \nbase so these communities can live. It is basic fairness.\n  The time to show it is now on the continuing resolution, at this time \nand today.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the quorum call be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am out here again today to urge the \nSenate to pass the bipartisan joint funding resolution that is before \nus. It is H.J. Res. 20. As I mentioned yesterday evening when I was out \nhere on the Senate floor, President Bush's Transportation Secretary, \nMary Peters, testified before us last week that we will see ``drastic \nconsequences'' if we fail to pass this funding resolution that is now \nin front of us. We are going to see painful cuts to aviation safety, \nhighway safety, and highway construction. I also can tell my colleagues \nwe will see painful and unnecessary cuts in housing, law enforcement, \nand veterans health care.\n  I want to make sure every Senator understands the importance of the \nvote\n\n[[Page S1885]]\n\nwe are going to have and understands the difference between the \ncontinuing resolution that our Government is currently running on and \nthe joint funding resolution, H.J. Res. 20, that we are currently \ndebating.\n  If we fail to pass H.J. Res. 20, the bill before us, and, instead, \nextend the current continuing resolution for the rest of this year, we \nare going to see families across this country lose their housing. We \nare going to see airline safety inspectors who are furloughed. We are \ngoing to see air traffic controllers who will be furloughed, highway \nconstruction will be cut, and, as a result, some States are going to \nhave to wait until the next construction season to deal with very \ncritical safety and congestion problems.\n  In short, failing to pass H.J. Res. 20, the issue before us, we are \ngoing to hurt our communities severely. That is why it is so important \nwe pass this resolution, which is a bipartisan bill, that has been very \ncarefully crafted to address the most critical funding shortfalls \nacross our entire Government. We have to pass H.J. Res. 20, and we need \nto do it this week, by this Thursday.\n  Communities across our country need more help in fighting crime, and \nthat is one reason we have to pass this joint funding resolution. \nWithout this resolution, without this bill, our State and local law \nenforcement will be cut by $1.2 billion. The joint funding resolution \nwe have before us will prevent that drastic cut, and our resolution \nadds money for Byrne grants and COPS grants, providing a $176 million \nincrease over last year for those two programs. That money will go \nstraight to our local communities to help them fight crime.\n  When I go home and sit down with our law enforcement officials in my \nhome State of Washington, they tell me they need more help from all of \nus in the Federal Government.\n  A few months ago, I was out in Yakima, WA, listening to our local law \nenforcement officials talk about their tremendous efforts to fight meth \nand gangs. They told me that Byrne grants are absolutely critical to \ntheir efforts.\n  There is a huge difference for Byrne grant funding under a continuing \nresolution--that we would be under if we do not pass this joint funding \nresolution--and the joint funding resolution. Under the joint funding \nresolution, the Byrne Grant Assistance Program is funded at $519 \nmillion. That is an increase of $108.7 million over fiscal year 2006. \nUnder our bill, the COPS Program is funded at $541.7 million. That is \nan increase of $67.9 million over fiscal year 2006.\n  Those programs are exactly the type of support that our local law \nenforcement officials need. But they will only get that--they will only \nget that--if we pass the joint funding resolution that is now before \nthe Senate.\n  Our resolution also supports national efforts to fight crime. Under a \ncontinuing resolution, the FBI would have to lay off 4,000 special \nagents. Let me repeat that for my colleagues. If we go under a \ncontinuing resolution and fail to pass the funding resolution that is \nbefore us, the FBI will have to lay off 4,000 special agents.\n  Now, at a time when violent crime is rising, when robberies are up \nnearly 10 percent nationwide, when the FBI is working very hard to \nfight crime, do we really want to lay off 4,000 FBI agents? Of course \nnot. That is why the resolution provides the FBI with an additional \n$216 million over fiscal year 2006. That means the FBI will not have to \nlay off those special agents if we pass this funding resolution. If we \ndo not pass H.J. Res. 20, those FBI agents will be furloughed, sitting \nat home, unpaid, rather than out working to fight crime.\n  Also the Justice Department's Violence Against Women office is funded \nat $382.5 million in our resolution. That is nearly $1 million over \ntheir funding of fiscal year 2006, critical dollars for a very \nimportant initiative to fight violence against women.\n  The joint funding resolution will also help us to cut off funding to \nterrorists. The Treasury Department today is working very hard to block \nthe flow of money to terrorists. Last year, Treasury hired new \nintelligence analysts in that effort. Under a CR, those new analysts \nwould be furloughed. Talk about a step backwards in the fight against \nterror. Our joint funding resolution, however, ensures that those \nanalysts will stay on the job and keep disrupting terror financing.\n  In short, we have to pass H. J. Res. 20 so we prevent cuts in local \nlaw enforcement, so we prevent the layoffs of thousands of FBI agents, \nand we keep our Federal law enforcement efforts on track. This vote \ncoming up is very critical. Either you vote to support funding law \nenforcement at an appropriate level or you are voting to cut funding to \nyour local law enforcement community. That is the choice every Senator \nwill have to make.\n  America's veterans also have a great deal at stake when the Senate \nvotes on this joint funding resolution. I just came from a hearing with \nVA Secretary Nicholson this morning. It is absolutely clear to me that \nwe are not doing enough yet to meet the needs of those who have served \nour country so honorably. Veterans today are facing long lines for \nhealth care. Veterans who need mental health care are being told they \nhave to wait to see a doctor. The VA is not prepared for the many \nveterans who are coming home with serious physical challenges. We need \na VA budget for the current year that meets their needs. If we pass a \ncontinuing resolution, veterans are going to get less funding and, with \nit, fewer medical services, less funding for medical facilities, and \nmore delays in getting the benefits they have earned. We owe our \nveterans more than cuts and delays. Under the joint funding resolution, \ntotal funding for VA medical care is $32 billion. That is an increase \nof about $3.5 billion over the fiscal year 2006 appropriated level.\n  Let me talk about one other VA account in particular. Under the joint \nfunding resolution we have before us, VA medical services are funded at \nabout $25 billion. That is an increase of $2.965 billion over the \nfiscal year 2006 appropriated level. That money is going to help our \nveterans with medical care, including inpatient and outpatient care, \nmental health care, and long-term care. Under our bill, there is an \nextra $70 million for the VA's general operating expenses, and some of \nthat money is going to help our Veterans Benefits Administration deal \nwith the massive backlog of benefit claims. The VA has told us they \nwanted to hire a net of 300 more employees so we can cut down this \nwaiting time all of us are hearing about from our veterans when we go \nhome who can't get the benefits they need. Without the joint funding \nresolution, the VA will not be able to hire those new employees, and \nveterans are going to continue to tell us they face long delays for the \nbenefits they have earned and deserve.\n  I also want to talk about the effect that not passing the joint \nfunding resolution would have on critical programs under my own \njurisdiction in the Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development \nSubcommittee. If we do not pass the joint funding bill, our air traffic \ncontrollers are going to be furloughed. Our air safety inspectors will \nbe furloughed. If we fail to pass this bipartisan bill, we are going to \nsee a decline in our ability to provide railroad inspections, pipeline \nsafety inspections, and to make sure we get truck safety inspections \nacross the country. Simply put, if we don't pass this bipartisan bill, \nthe safety of the people we represent is going to be put in danger.\n  We are also going to feel the consequences in the critical area of \nhousing. If we don't pass this funding resolution, hundreds of \nthousands of Americans are going to face a housing crisis. In fact, \n157,000 low-income people could lose their housing; 70,000 people could \nlose their housing vouchers; and 11,500 housing units that are housing \nthe homeless could be lost.\n  Those are only some of the consequences Americans will face if this \nCongress fails to act in the next 2 days to pass this joint funding \nresolution. Don't take my word for it. Last Thursday I held a hearing \nwith President Bush's very able Secretary of Transportation Mary \nPeters. At that hearing, she talked in very clear terms about the \nconsequences of not passing this joint funding resolution. I asked \nSecretary Peters what it would mean for safety and hiring if we did not \npass this joint funding resolution. She said to me:\n\n       [W]e will see a serious decline in the number of safety \n     inspectors: truck safety inspectors, rail safety inspectors, \n     aviation inspectors across the broad range in our program.\n\n  That is directly from the Transportation Secretary.\n\n[[Page S1886]]\n\n  Does any Senator want to be responsible for voting for a serious \ndecline in the number of truck safety inspectors, rail safety \ninspectors, aviation safety inspectors? How would you ever explain that \nto your constituents, that you voted to undermine their safety as they \ntravel by car or train or plane?\n  We also need to pass this joint funding resolution because without \nit, our States will not be able to address their most pressing highway, \nbridge, and road problems. In fact, Secretary Peters, President Bush's \nTransportation Secretary, warned us last week that some States could \nmiss an entire construction season if we do not pass this bill this \nweek. She said:\n\n       It is especially important to those States who have a \n     construction season that will be upon us very, very shortly, \n     and if they are not able to know that this funding is coming \n     and be able to let contracts accordingly we could easily miss \n     an entire construction season.\n\n  All of us better recognize that our constituents are going to feel \nthe impact of this vote on their roads and bridges and highways if we \ndo not pass the joint funding resolution. The bill before the Senate \nprovides an additional $3.75 billion in formula funding for our \nNation's highway and transit systems. That funding will serve to create \nalmost 160,000 new jobs, and it will help us alleviate congestion, an \nissue many of us face in our States. It is going to be an important \ninfusion of cash for the States to address their needs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a table that has been provided to me by \nthe Federal Highway Administration which displays the highway funding \nincreases that will be seen by each of our States be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record,

It is very important that we each understand the impact \nof not passing this joint funding resolution with the additional $3.75 \nbillion in funding formula to each and every one of our States.\n  The failure to pass this resolution is also going to have a painful \nimpact on hundreds of thousands of Americans when it comes to housing. \nIn this bipartisan bill, we worked to make sure our vulnerable families \nwould not be thrown out in the streets or face out-of-reach rent \nincreases. We provided critical support for section 8 homeless \nassistance grants, housing equity conversion loans, HOPE VI, and public \nhousing operating funds. If we do not pass this joint funding \nresolution and continue on a CR, that would mean housing vouchers are \ngoing to be lost, many of our low-income residents will become \nhomeless, renters will be displaced or face unaffordable rent \nincreases, and many of our seniors are going to lose a valuable source \nof equity. And importantly, efforts to replace deteriorating public \nhousing units will be eliminated.\n  Clearly, for all I have walked through, the consequences of not \npassing the joint funding resolution are going to be severe for some of \nour country's most vulnerable families. It is clear that our \ncommunities across the board are going to pay a very high price unless \nwe pass H.J. Res. 20 before us. I urge my colleagues to vote to allow \nour low-income families to keep\n\n[[Page S1887]]\n\na roof over their heads. I urge my colleagues to vote to keep our \nsafety inspectors on the job, to keep highway construction projects \nmoving forward, to help our local law enforcement fight crime, and I \nurge Senate colleagues to vote to give our veterans the care and \nbenefits they have earned.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.J. Res. 20; otherwise, you will \nhave to tell your veterans and your police officers, your commuters, \nyour air traffic controllers, your public housing tenants, your housing \nadvocates, and your airline passengers, pilots, and flight attendants \nwhy you voted against them.\n  I urge my colleagues this afternoon to vote for cloture and then \nallow us to finish H.J. Res. 20 so we can put the funding in place that \nis sorely needed in every area in our local communities and for the \npeople we represent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized \nfor up to 5 minutes, and that following my remarks, the remaining time \nuntil 12:30 p.m. be provided to the Republican side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I have the unenviable task of \nencouraging my colleagues to support the continuing resolution that \nlies before the Senate. Loading all of the unfinished bills from last \nyear into a continuing resolution that barely funds programs at \nadequate levels is not my idea of a job well done by the Senate. The \nSenate should have worked its will last year and passed these bills \nseparately before the end of the fiscal year. But that is now water \nunder the bridge. Our task today is to finish off this process so that \nwe can move forward with a fresh start in a new year.\n  The continuing resolution before us is a stripped down, bare bones \nversion of a funding bill. It contains no earmarks--not a one. It \nprovides the minimum funding needed to protect our rural communities, \nand keep our farming economy going. It provides support for critical \nresearch that helps keep our agriculture sector productive and put food \non our tables--but we have left it up to the USDA to apportion these \nfunds. Critical efforts to protect rural drinking water and grow rural \nhousing were also maintained. In short, we did the best we could to \nprotect rural America, save small farms, and maintain a safe and \nreliable food supply.\n  I understand that some Members may not be happy with some of the \ndifficult choices that we had to make. But the alternative is much \nworse. Continuing to live under the current funding agreement would \nhave been devastating to rural America, agribusiness, and would have \nshaken consumers' faith in the food they buy at the local grocery \nstore.\n  Without this continuing resolution, the Food Safety and Inspection \nService would not have enough funds to get through the rest of the \nyear. Without it, FSIS would have to lay off employees beginning in \nSeptember. Without inspectors, 6,000 meat and poultry facilities would \nbe shut down across the country. Do any of my colleagues want to \nexplain to their constituents why they can't buy meat during the month \nof September? Without this CR, 700,000 people connected to the food \nindustry will be laid off once the USDA can no longer inspect the meat \nproduced in this country.\n  The proposal before us may not be perfect, but I believe it is a \nbetter alternative than endangering our food supply.\n  The cuts threatened by the current funding agreement will hurt more \nthan just our grocery shopping habits. They will also be felt in \ndoctor's offices and hospitals around the country. Continuation of the \ncurrent CR will force the Food and Drug Administration to lay off 652 \npersonnel. Some of these employees have the job of approving new \nmedical devices. Does the Senate really want to force patients to wait \nup to 20 percent longer for the medical care that will help them \nrecover? Does the Senate really want to stand in the way of these kinds \nof life and death decisions?\n  Sometimes in this body we can get caught up in the dollars and cents \nof the decisions we make, and lose track of the impact our votes have \non real peoples lives. I understand that there are many of my \ncolleagues that are concerned about the budget deficit. I am as well. I \ncame to the Senate when there were record deficits, and we took \ndifficult votes to get this country back into financial shape and \ncreate budget surpluses. I know what it takes to balance a budget. But \nnot funding food inspections and delaying life saving medical care is \nnot the way we should balance the budget. We have a responsibility to \nprotect the health and welfare of the people back home. The current CR \nfails to fulfill that mission, but the bill we are going to pass \nsucceeds.\n  Mr. President I yield the remainder of the time to my colleague from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, inquiry: Can you advise me how much time \nremains in morning business on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republicans now control 16 minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin for \nhis courtesy.\n  Mr. President, I would like to speak for no more than the next 10 \nminutes. If the Chair will advise me after the expiration of that time, \nthen I will yield to the senior Senator from Texas.\n  The House passed a continuing resolution that is before the Senate. \nIn fact, it is a $464 billion omnibus spending bill that makes major \npolicy changes and shifts billions of dollars away from important \nnational priorities.\n  The omnibus, I believe, is a flawed proposal and should be fixed \nbefore it becomes law, which means that amendments should be offered \nand voted on by the Senate.\n  Unfortunately, the majority leader has decided not to allow the usual \nprocess for amendments to be offered and voted on to occur and, in \nfact, has blocked those amendments, and it is unlikely we will have an \nopportunity to improve this Omnibus appropriations bill before it is \nvoted on.\n  We have several amendments we are prepared to offer on this omnibus \nbill, if allowed to do so, which I do believe would measurably improve \nit. While our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have pledged, \nas we have, to support our troops, this bill will delay the return of \nmany U.S. troops from overseas. We are prepared to offer a budget-\nneutral amendment to restore more than $3 billion in funding for the \nU.S. military. More than 12,000 American troops serving overseas will \nbe unable to come home if the plan on the floor now becomes law without \nany amendments. The barracks necessary to house these returning troops \nwill not be funded in this spending plan.\n  To have the majority not allow the Senate to vote on the proposed \namendment which would restore this funding and support our troops and \nto prevent our troops from coming home to the facilities they need in \norder to accommodate them, to me, is simply a bad way to do business \nand is difficult for me to explain to my colleagues and my constituents \nback home.\n  The majority promised not to change policy through a spending bill \nbut now have eliminated a bipartisan baby AIDS prevention program. We \nhave an amendment by Senator Coburn that will ensure that more than $30 \nmillion dedicated to this lifesaving baby AIDS program is not blocked \nby this omnibus.\n  We were also told by the majority they believe in earmark reform, \nspecial projects that are funded through an earmark in the budget \nprocess, but they are in this Omnibus appropriations bill allowing what \nI would call back-door earmarking.\n  We have an amendment we are prepared to offer that would protect \ntaxpayers' funds by guaranteeing that the omnibus is truly earmark free \nand by preventing back-room deals to fund wasteful programs after this \nbill is passed.\n  Finally, in a general sense, talking about the kinds of amendments \nthat need to be offered and voted on on this bill, the majority \npromised to be sensitive to those who are in the most need of \nassistance, but this Omnibus appropriations bill takes money from crime \nvictims, $1.2 billion, and spends it on other Government programs. This \nis simply, I believe, a bad way to do business and I think is \ninconsistent with the spirit of bipartisanship with\n\n[[Page S1888]]\n\nwhich this Congress started with the work we have been able to do on \nlobby and ethics reform, on minimum wage, and small business tax and \nregulatory relief.\n  I also have two other amendments I would like to call up to this bill \nthat I wish to mention briefly, but unfortunately, as I already \nmentioned, the majority leader has seen fit to deny any Senator the \nopportunity, in this the world's greatest deliberative body, to even \noffer any additional amendments. Nevertheless, I wish to take a moment \nto highlight them.\n  The first amendment would restore funding to the Department of \nEnergy's FutureGen Program and do so without busting the budget. \nFutureGen, as my colleagues know, is a demonstration project launched \nby President Bush in 2003 to test new technology in refining coal in \ngenerating electricity. If successful, FutureGen technologies could \nhelp lower energy costs, increase domestic energy resources, and \neliminate harmful air pollutants.\n  On the Senate floor, we talk a lot about ending our reliance on \nforeign sources of energy, as well as our need to produce energy in the \ncheapest way possible.\n  The Omnibus appropriations bill that is on the floor, to which we are \nbeing denied an opportunity to offer amendments, pulls the carpet from \nunder the FutureGen Program which seeks to address both of those needs.\n  Solutions to our energy future must be made by utilizing a variety of \ntechnologies, both traditional and new, innovative technology. We \ncannot turn our back on our most abundant domestic resource, coal, but \nwe can make sure that the kind of innovation and research that this \nFutureGen project is designed to do can make sure we can use that \ndomestic energy resource in a way that is entirely consistent with our \nuniversal desire to have a clean environment.\n  One other amendment I would offer would restore the cuts that the \nomnibus bill makes from the U.S. Marshals Service. This amendment also \ndoes not bust the budget. The Omnibus appropriations bill shortchanges \nthe men and women in the U.S. Marshals Service who are on the \nfrontlines protecting the safety of our Federal judges and our court \npersonnel.\n  Every day the Marshals Service protects more than 2,000 sitting \nFederal judges, as well as other court officials, at more than 400 \ncourthouses and facilities across the Nation. The protection of our \nFederal judges by the U.S. Marshals Service is one of the most \nimportant and perhaps least-recognized assignments in law enforcement. \nBut a disturbing trend is afoot. Increasingly, judges, witnesses, \ncourthouse personnel, and law enforcement personnel who support them \nare the subject of violence simply for carrying out their duties.\n  We can all agree that the safety of our men and women who serve in \nthese important law enforcement capacities deserve the proper funding \nnecessary for them to do their job.\n  Mr. President, I regret, more with a sense of disappointment than \nanger, the fact that the majority leader has denied us an opportunity \nto offer amendments on any of these priorities, matters which I think \nwe can all agree deserve our consideration and close scrutiny. But \ngiven the fact that, rather than the bipartisan cooperation we were \npromised at the outset of this Congress, we are seeing basically a my-\nway-or-the-highway approach to this Omnibus appropriations bill, not \nonly are our troops not going to get the $3.1 billion that is necessary \nto provide housing and assets for them to return home, but we know \nclean coal-burning technology and research is going to be denied and \nput off, pushed down the road with harm to our Nation and, finally, we \nknow the U.S. Marshals Service, responsible for protecting our Federal \njudiciary, is going to be denied the resources they need to do their \njob.\n\n  This is simply not the right way to do business, certainly not in the \nbipartisan spirit which we were promised at the outset of this \nCongress. I hope that the majority leader will reconsider and allow us \nto offer amendments and have an up-or-down vote on each of these \namendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, how much time remains in morning \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A little less than 7\\1/2\\ minutes. The Senator \nfrom Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nnotified at 3\\1/2\\ minutes, and I will then leave the rest of our time \nfor the distinguished Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am very troubled by this process. We \nare taking up a $463 billion appropriations bill. There is no amendment \non the House side and no amendment on the Senate side being allowed. We \nare going to cloture with no capability of amendments. Yet the deadline \nfor this bill is February 15. We have several days in which we could \noffer amendments, debate amendments, and go back to the House, if we \nset our minds to doing it. And if there was a true bipartisan spirit, \nwe would be able to do that.\n  It has been said we didn't pass these appropriations bills last year, \nand that is correct. We didn't for a variety of reasons, some of which \nwas obstruction from the other side and some of which was obstruction \non this side. I understand that. But now we are where we are. We have \nbeen here before.\n  When the Republicans took control in 2003, after the Democrats had \nthe majority, we didn't put a continuing resolution forward for the 11 \nappropriations bills that had not been passed. We put forward an \nOmnibus appropriations bill, a bill that was amendable. There were, in \nfact, 100 amendments offered. There were 6 days of debate, and the bill \nwas passed with mostly Democratic amendments.\n  I do think, in a sense of fairness, that is what was expected when \nthe majority switched, that we would have an Omnibus appropriations \nbill with some reasonable number of amendments. Our leadership \ncertainly offered a limited number with a limited time for debate. We \nwouldn't have had to have a cloture vote if we had been able to have \nthat open dialog, but we didn't. Now we have a $463 billion bill, in \nwhich $3 billion has been taken out of what this Congress passed last \nyear for military construction to prepare for the base closing law we \npassed and to implement that on the deadline we made, which was 6 \nyears. There was a request for $5.6 billion that was necessary for us \nto bring 12,000 troops home this year and to go forward with the rest \nof the appropriations for the troops coming home from overseas, and $3 \nbillion was taken out of the bill that has passed and put into other \npriorities with no hearings and no amendments allowed on the floor.\n  I don't see that is in any way able to be described as fair, \nbipartisan. It is not the way we ought to do business in the Senate.\n  So here we are taking $3 billion from our military accounts and \nputting them into accounts throughout the Federal Government. I cannot \nthink of anything more important than making sure our troops, when they \ncome home from overseas, have living conditions and training facilities \nthat we are trying to provide for them. The reason we are moving them \nhome from overseas is to give them better training facilities. That is \nwhat the bulk of the $3 billion is going to do, and that is why we need \nto stop cloture on this bill, offer one or two amendments and send the \nbill to the House. We have plenty of time to work out something so \nsimple.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is at the 3\\1/2\\-minute mark.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues: Do not vote for \ncloture on this bill yet. We will have plenty of time to fund the other \npriorities in the bill, but we can also add amendments. This is the \nSenate. There are 100 Members, and we should have a say in a $463 \nbillion omnibus appropriation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about my amendment \nNo. 253 that I would like to offer to the fiscal year 2007 omnibus \nspending bill.\n  My amendment seeks to strengthen the provisions in section 112 \ndealing with earmarks. According to the sponsors, the goal of this \nsection is to turn off the hidden earmarks for this year's spending, \nbut, unfortunately, it does not achieve that goal.\n\n[[Page S1889]]\n\n  First, the language in H.J. Res. 20 say--on page 9--that hidden \nearmarks shall have no ``legal effect,'' but it does not clearly state \nthat hidden earmarks shall have no guiding effect. These earmarks \nalready have no legal effect. The point of this section was not to \nrestate current law, but rather to make it clear that hidden earmarks \nhave no effect, legal or otherwise.\n  As my colleagues know, over 95 percent of all earmarks are not even \nwritten into our appropriations bills. If we don't fix the language in \nthis resolution we are debating today, all of these earmarks could \ncontinue. It is not certain that they will but they could and that is \nsomething we should fix to protect American taxpayers.\n  Our Federal agencies need to understand that hidden earmarks mean \nnothing and should be completely ignored in their decisionmaking. Our \nFederal agencies need to spend American tax dollars in ways that meet \ntheir core missions and serve true national priorities. Federal \nagencies should not feel pressure to fund special interest earmarks \nwritten by the powerful lawmakers who may cut their funding in \nretaliation.\n  Second, the language in H.J. Res. 20 applies to hidden earmarks in \nthe fiscal year 2006 committee reports, but it does not turn off the \nhidden earmarks buried in committee reports prior to 2006 or those \nafter it. In addition, the language does not turn off earmarks that may \nbe requested through direct communications between lawmakers and our \nFederal agencies, either by phone or in private emails.\n  I understand that the Democratic leader is not going to allow any \namendments. The Democratic leader scheduled this debate right before \nthe Government's current funding expires so we will all be forced to \naccept it. This practice has been going on for years, and I am afraid \nit has become very destructive.\n  We are going to vote on whether to cut off debate on this measure \ntoday at 2:30 p.m. and I will be forced to oppose that motion. Since \nthe Democratic leader has blocked me and other Senators from getting \nvotes on our amendments, I cannot in good conscience vote to cut off \ndebate. My amendment makes small changes to this resolution that would \ngreatly improve its integrity, and there is still time to send this \nmeasure back to the House for its approval.\n  I also want to make it clear that while we have a responsibility in \nthis body to address hidden earmarks in this resolution, the President \nalso has a responsibility to do his part. In a letter that I sent last \nweek, I called on him to instruct his agencies to ignore all earmark \nrequests that do not have the force of law, and I believe he will. He \nsaid in the State of the Union Address this year that:\n\n       Over 90 percent of earmarks never make it to the floor of \n     the House and Senate--they are dropped into committee reports \n     that are not even part of the bill that arrives on my desk. \n     You didn't vote them into law. I didn't sign them into law. \n     Yet, they're treated as if they have the force of law. The \n     time has come to end this practice.\n\n  It appears as though our Federal agencies are beginning to follow \nthrough on the President's directive. Last week, a memo was circulated \nat the Department of Energy that said:\n\n       Because the funding provided by H.J. Res. 20 will not be \n     subject to non-statutory earmarks and the President's policy \n     on earmarks is clear, we must ensure that the Department only \n     funds programs or activities that are meritorious; the \n     Department itself is responsible for making those \n     determinations.\n\n  This is a great sign of progress and I hope other agencies will \ncirculate their own memos to this effect. Our agencies have been under \nthe thumb of powerful appropriators for so long, it may be difficult \nfor them to transition to a world without earmarks. But that is what \nthey must do because that is what the American people expect. Americans \nwant their Federal tax dollars to be spent in competitive ways that \nmeet the highest standards. If a project is going to get Federal \nfunding, they expect--just like with a Federal contract--that the money \ngo to the project with the most merit regardless of whose State or \ndistrict it is in.\n  We are making great progress on reforming our budget process and \nreducing earmarks, and I urge my colleagues to help us continue this \nprogress and win back the trust of the American people.\n  Mr. President, I wish to make a few additional comments about my \namendment No. 253 to the fiscal year 2007 omnibus spending bill. This \nis an amendment that would strengthen a provision in the bill that is \nunder section 112. This gets back to the earmark discussion. The Senate \ncan be proud of the debate and the votes we have taken to disclose \nearmarks and to eliminate the hidden earmarks that have been added in \nconference for years. Unfortunately, the language in this omnibus bill \ncontinues the status quo. It says that earmarks have no legal \neffect. It does not take the debate we have all agreed on and make it a \nprohibition that earmarks cannot be added in conference.\n\n  We know that 95 percent of earmarks are in report language. They do \nnot have the force of law. Yet, through intimidation and other ways, \nCongress has been able to get the executive branch to follow through on \nthese earmarks for years. My amendment would simply go back to what we \nhave already agreed on as a Senate and prohibit these wasteful, hidden \nearmarks that waste billions of taxpayer dollars every year from being \nincluded in report language.\n  I am encouraged that the White House is responding. We have a memo \nthat the Energy Department sent out last year to its managers telling \nthem not to give preferential treatment to nonbinding, nonlegal \ncongressional earmarks; that earmarks should be meritorious, as they \nsaid in their memo, before they are considered. This would free up all \nthe Federal agencies to focus their spending and their time on Federal \npriorities, not just specific special interest earmarks that a Member \nof Congress happens to attach to a bill.\n  I understand the majority leader is not going to allow any \namendments. That is very regrettable, particularly since it leaves out \nsomething on which I think we all agree.\n  The cloture motion we have been asked to vote on at 2:30 is a motion \nto cut off debate. That means we can no longer talk about the \nprovisions in ways that could improve this bill. For that reason, I am \ngoing to have to vote against cloture and hope the majority leader will \nreconsider, particularly amendments like this which are easy and which \nthis Chamber has already voted unanimously to support.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield back.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/13/senate-section/article/S1889-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I can do this, I think in 5 or 6 minutes. I \nyield myself such time as I may consume. Am I recognized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today is the 136th day of fiscal year 2007. \nIt is\n\n[[Page S1890]]\n\npast time to complete the remaining nine fiscal year 2007 \nappropriations bills. Agencies have limped along through October, \nNovember, December, January, and half of February based on a very \nrestrictive continuing resolution. Thirteen of the fifteen departments \ndo not know how much money they will have for a fiscal year that is now \none-third gone, one-third over.\n  This is a deplorable way to run a government, any government, \nspecifically the Federal Government--this Government.\n  Under the existing continuing resolution, our veterans hospitals are \nconfronting the need to deny health care to 500,000 veterans and to \nforce 850,000 veterans to wait longer for their care. H.J. Res. 20 \nincludes an increase of $3.6 billion to solve the problem. On this, the \n136th day of fiscal year 2007, it is time to act.\n  Under the existing continuing resolution, the Social Security \nAdministration is facing longer lines for approving benefits, and \nfurloughs of employees. The 1-800 Medicare call centers, which have \nreceived over 35 million calls from the elderly with questions about \ntheir coverage, will have to shut down for the final months of the \nfiscal year. H.J. Res. 20 solves those problems. It is time to act.\n  Under the existing continuing resolution, the Department of Defense \nwill have to delay elective surgeries, nonemergency care, and increase \nthe cost of some pharmaceuticals for Active-Duty members, their \nfamilies, and retirees. H.J. Res. 20 includes an increase of $1.4 \nbillion to solve the problem. It is time to act.\n  Under the existing continuing resolution, funding for highways and \ntransit is frozen at fiscal year 2006 levels, putting 160,000 jobs at \nrisk. H.J. Res. 20 fully funds the highway and transit guarantees. It \nis time to act.\n  Under the existing continuing resolution, no funds are provided to \nthe Department of Defense to build the facilities needed to bring our \ntroops back home from Europe. H.J. Res. 20 includes $1 billion to solve \nthat problem. It is time, again I say, to act.\n  According to the White House Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, \nunder the existing continuing resolution 110,000 to 175,000 people will \nlikely die of HIV-related causes. H.J. Res. 20 includes a $1.4 billion \nincrease to help HIV victims. It is time to act.\n  H.J. Res. 20 complies with the $872.8 billion statutory cap on \nspending. It contains no earmarks and, I should say, eliminates 9,300 \nprior earmarks.\n  Hallelujah. It eliminates 9,300 prior earmarks.\n  H.J. Res. 20 cuts 125 accounts below fiscal year 2006 levels and \nfreezes 450 accounts at the 2006 level. H.J. Res. 20 is tough, it is \ndisciplined, and it addresses critical needs. It is time to act.\n  I urge Members to vote aye on the cloture motion and on the \nresolution.\n  Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has about 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Under the previous order, the clerk will report the motion to invoke \ncloture.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close the debate on Calendar No. \n     18, H.J.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nChambliss and I, from Georgia, be recognized for a few minutes to pay \ntribute to Representative Norwood.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, first of all, I thank Leader Reid and \nLeader McConnell for bringing this resolution\n\n[[Page S1891]]\n\nforward in a very timely fashion. We learned during the lunch hour \ntoday that Representative Charlie Norwood of Georgia passed away, a \nvictim of cancer.\n  Charlie had been fighting valiantly that disease for over 3 years, \nhaving a lung transplant, and, unfortunately--after the transplant's \nsuccess for a year and Charlie doing well--cancer occurred in one lung \nand then transferred to his liver.\n  His wife Gloria has been an absolutely wonderful human being, seeing \nto it that Charlie continued to do his work in the House of \nRepresentatives, even though suffering greatly from the effects of the \ncancer that reoccurred.\n  Charlie Norwood was elected in 1994 and was a classmate and fellow \nrepresentative with many of us here--Senator Coburn, Senator Graham, \nSenator Lincoln, Senator Chambliss, and myself.\n  On behalf of all of us who have had the chance to serve with Charlie \nNorwood, we today pay tribute to his life, the great accomplishments he \nmade on behalf of his district, and his untiring effort to bring about \nquality, affordable health care within the reach of every single \nAmerican.\n  He will be remembered for many things: his tenacity, his great sense \nof humor, his commitment to his district, and to his people. But from a \npolitical standpoint and a service standpoint, he will be remembered \nfor Norwood-Dingell, the legislation that laid the groundwork for \nreforms in health care that even go on at this day.\n  So as a Member of the Senate from Georgia, as a personal friend of \nCharlie Norwood and his beautiful wife Gloria, and as one who is so \nthankful for the contributions he made to my State, to me as an \nindividual, and to this body, I pay tribute to Charlie Norwood, pass on \nthe sympathy and the condolences of my family to his wife Gloria and \nhis many friends.\n  And again, I repeat my thanks to Senator McConnell and Senator Reid \nfor their timely recognition of the passing of Charlie Norwood.\n  It is my pleasure now to, with unanimous consent, recognize Senator \nChambliss from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nGeorgia for those very generous and kind words about our mutual friend.\n  I rise today to pay tribute to a guy who has been a great inspiration \nnot just for the last 3 years when he has so bravely fought the deadly \ndisease that ultimately got him--cancer--but Charlie Norwood and I were \nelected to Congress together in 1994.\n  Charlie was one of those individuals who came to Congress for the \nright reason; that is, to make this country a better place for our \ngeneration as well as for future generations to live.\n  Charlie worked every single day to make sure he could personally do \neverything he could as a Member of the House of Representatives to make \nthis country better.\n  Charlie grew up a Valdosta Wildcat. Now, to people in this body that \nmay not mean a whole lot, but to anybody who lives in our great State, \ngrowing up a Valdosta Wildcat and playing for the Wildcat football team \nis a very special asset.\n  Valdosta is a very unique town down in my part of the State, down in \nthe very southern part of our State. The football lore of Valdosta is \nsecond to no other community in the country.\n  Charlie loved his Valdosta Wildcats. He and I used to sit on the \nfloor of the House every now and then, particularly during football \nseason, and talk about his days of growing up. My hometown of Moultrie \nis the biggest football rival of Valdosta.\n  Charlie loved life. He loved things like football. He also loved his \nfamily. He was the proud husband of Gloria Norwood, who is one more \ngreat lady, and he had two sons and several grandchildren.\n  Charlie used to take his grandchildren to Atlanta every year at \nThanksgiving, used to take the girls. He would let those girls have the \nrun of a very nice hotel in Atlanta to do whatever they wanted, \nincluding Charlie Norwood, a mean, gruff, old dentist from Augusta, GA, \nsitting down in the afternoon and having tea with his granddaughters. \nHe was, indeed, a very special person, a guy who loved his country, \nloved his State, loved his family, and really cared about what is best \nfor America.\n  One anecdote about Charlie I will never forget. He and I became good \nfriends during the 1994 campaign. We both signed the Contract with \nAmerica. We ran on the Contract with America. One provision in there \nwas requiring an amendment to the Constitution calling for the Federal \nbudget to be balanced. Charlie and I both felt very strongly about \nthat. We were sitting on the floor of the House of Representatives one \nnight together, as we were debating and voting on the amendment to the \nConstitution calling for a balanced budget, and as the numbers in favor \nof the bill grew and grew, the roar within the Chamber itself got \nlouder and louder. It took 397 votes to reach the point where the \nbalanced budget amendment would pass, and when it hit 350, the roar got \nlouder. It hit 360. Finally, it hit 397. Charlie looked over at me and \nsaid: Sax, that is why we came here. He was that kind of person who \ntruly cared about his country and the principles for which he stood.\n  He was a man who will truly be missed, as my colleague, Senator \nIsakson, said, for his ideas on health care. He truly believed that \nevery person who received health care treatment in this country ought \nto have the ability to look their physician in the eye and make sure \nthey had the right to choose the physician from whom they were \nreceiving medical services. It is only fitting that Charlie's Patient's \nBill of Rights was reintroduced in the House in the last several days. \nI look forward, hopefully, to Congressman Dingell taking up that bill \nand debating that bill. It was a controversial bill then. It will be \ncontroversial again. But just because Charlie Norwood felt so strongly \nabout it, I am hopeful we will see some movement on that bill.\n  As I wind down, I have such fond memories about Charlie from a \npersonal standpoint. But most significantly, the great memories I will \nalways have about Charlie Norwood are about his commitment to America, \nhis commitment to freedom, his commitment to the men and women who wear \nthe uniform of the United States, of which he was one--he was a veteran \nof Vietnam--and about the great spirit Charlie Norwood always brought \nto every issue on the floor of the House of Representatives. He was a \ngreat American. He was a great Member of the House of Representatives. \nHe was a great colleague. He was a great friend who will be missed.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/13/senate-section/article/S1891-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1891-S1897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  MAKING FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2007--\n                               Continued\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for up to 20 minutes on the continuing resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  A few days ago, I came to the floor deeply concerned because someone, \nsomeone over in the House of Representatives--first, let me ask the \nChair, will you please give me a minute's notice when my 20 minutes is \nup?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At the conclusion of 19 minutes, the Senator \nwill be given notice.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you very much.\n  Someone over in the House of Representatives, before they sent that \ncontinuing resolution or joint funding resolution over here, had taken \nthe Teacher Incentive Fund, which was to be funded at $100 million a \nyear, and reduced it to $200,000. In other words, they killed the \nfunding. I couldn't imagine someone would do that on purpose, and so I \ncame here to say so. I know it was a confusing time and there were lots \nof different priorities to be met. Perhaps, in the difficulty of \nputting together the joint funding resolution, it was just a slip-up. I \nsaid I\n\n[[Page S1892]]\n\nhoped it wasn't the signal of what the new Democratic majority's \neducation policy would be because I couldn't imagine the new Democratic \nmajority--or the old Democratic minority, for that matter--or any of us \non either side being against the Teacher Incentive Fund.\n  What the Teacher Incentive Fund does is almost the most crucial thing \nwe need to do in helping our schools succeed. It makes grants to States \nand cities that are doing the best work in trying to find fair ways to \nreward outstanding teaching and to reward good principals. Every \neducation meeting I go to, and I have been going to them for years, \nthat ends up being the No. 1 thing we need to do. First are parents, \nsecond are teachers and principals, and everything else is about 5 \npercent. In other words, a child who has a head start at home is a \nchild who is going to get an education almost no matter what else \nhappens. But if you add an outstanding teacher and an outstanding \nprincipal to whatever happens at home, the school is better and the \nclassroom is better and the child succeeds. This is especially true for \nlow-income children in America, which is exactly what the Teacher \nIncentive Fund is designed to meet.\n  Well, I wasn't disappointed because within 5 minutes after I began, \nthe distinguished Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, the assistant \nDemocratic leader, came on the floor, and I think I am being fair in \ncharacterizing his remarks when he said: Whoa, wait a minute. This is a \ngood program. In fact, I just received a call this afternoon, said \nSenator Durbin, from the superintendent of the Chicago schools, and he \nsaid we need this program. He said we have a lot of low-income, poor \nkids who aren't making it, whom we are leaving behind, we want to help \nthem, and this helps us do that. He said we have a grant under the \nTeacher Incentive Fund to do it.\n  We heard further testimony at a roundtable in our Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee that in the Chicago schools they closed \nsome schools where children were not learning year after year after \nyear. What did they do? They put in a new team--a new principal, a new \nset of teachers. And what did they do with the teachers? They paid them \n$10,000 a year more than they were otherwise making to make sure they \nwould go there because they were the teachers known in Chicago to be \nable to help low- achieving students achieve.\n  We all know from our experience and research that virtually every \nchild can learn. Some children just need a little extra help getting to \nthe starting line. If you don't get it at home, you especially need it \nat school. And where you get it at school is from outstanding teachers \nand principals.\n  So it wasn't Senator Durbin, who is the assistant Democratic leader \nin the Senate, who was trying to kill the Teacher Incentive Fund. So I \nhave been wondering for the last few days, well, then, who was it? Who \nwas it? Well, now I know, Mr. President, because they have announced \nit.\n  Today comes a letter to me--``Dear Senator Alexander''--on behalf of \nthe National Education Association, the NEA, with 3.2 million members, \nsaying:\n\n       We urge your opposition to several ill-conceived amendments \n     to the continuing resolution. Specifically, we urge you to \n     vote ``no'' on an amendment to be offered by Senator \n     Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, that would provide $99 \n     million for the teacher incentive fund.\n\n  So the NEA, in its brilliance, has written me a letter to ask me to \nvote against my own amendment.\n  I am astonished. That doesn't surprise me so much. Any of our offices \ncan make a mistake. But what I want the President to know, and I want \nour colleagues to know--I want them to know who is against this, and I \nwant the world to know what they are against. What they are against is \nhelping find a fair way to pay good teachers more for teaching well and \nto train and help good principals lead schools, especially in big \ncities where we have a lot of low-income children who are falling \nbehind.\n  This is not some abstract notion. The President had recommended $100 \nmillion for the Teacher Incentive Fund as part of the No Child Left \nBehind legislation. In a bipartisan way it passed several years ago, \nand we are in the midst of a remarkably bipartisan approach to see what \nwe need to do about NCLB as we reauthorize it for 5 years, and part of \nit is the Teacher Incentive Fund.\n  In a very tight budget, President Bush has recommended not just $100 \nmillion for the next year, he has recommended $200 million.\n  I placed into the Record a few days ago Secretary of Education \nSpellings' letter saying this is very important. We have just started \nthis program. We made a number of grants to cities all across America, \n16 grants across the country, at least one State--in South Carolina. \nYou have cut us off. You stopped us from making an evaluation and \nreporting back to the Senate, to the Congress, how this is working. You \nare disappointing these school districts who have stepped up to do \nthis.\n  That is what has happened. Just to be very specific, here is the kind \nof thing that the Teacher Incentive Fund grant does. Memphis, our \nbiggest city, has an unusually large number of our lowest performing \nschools. It is our poorest big city, one of the poorest big cities in \nAmerica. It has a real solid school superintendent, she's excellent, \nand they are working hard to improve.\n  A lot of the Memphis citizens are putting together a special effort \nto say: One of the single best things we can do in Memphis is to take \nevery single one of our school principals, put them through a training \nprogram for a year, hook up with New Leaders for New Schools to do \nthat, continuing after the year, and then we will put them back in \ncharge of their school. We will give them autonomy to make the changes \nthey need to make, and we will see if these children can succeed \nbecause we know if they can succeed, if we help them the correct way--\nwe give them extra hours, as we have in our charter schools, give them \nextra training, we know they will succeed.\n  Memphis City Schools and New Leaders for New Schools were awarded a \ngrant for $3.1 million in the year 2006, the first year after the 5-\nyear grant totaling $18 million. Over the 5-year grant, Memphis plans \nto provide training and incentive grants to 83 principals serving \nalmost one-third of the schools in the Memphis school system. \nPrincipals will receive incentive grants of at least $15,000 a year.\n  What is wrong with that? Why would the largest educational \nassociation in America oppose taking a city with low-performing \nstudents and saying we are going to kill the program that trains your \nprincipals and pay them $15,000 more a year to do a better job? Why \nwould they do that?\n  The assistant Democratic leader doesn't agree with that. At least he \nsaid so on the floor of the Senate. I don't agree with it. I don't \nthink the parents of the children agree with it. The school \nsuperintendent doesn't agree with it, nor does the mayor. Who is \nagainst this? We are trying to pay more money to the members of the \nassociation that is trying to kill the program. That is what we are \ntrying to do.\n  It is not just Memphis. I think it is important that my colleagues in \nthe Senate--if the snow and the ice has not caused them to flee to the \nsuburbs. I think most of them are in their offices, maybe a few are \neven listening. I want them to know that the National Education \nAssociation wants to kill the program for the Northern New Mexico \nNetwork, the Northern New Mexico Network for Rural Education, a \nnonprofit organization, one of the 19 grantees of the Teacher Incentive \nFund. It is partnering with four school districts. They serve a region \nwith high levels of poverty, high concentrations of Native Americans \nand Hispanic students, extreme rural conditions, small schools. So the \nNEA wants to kill the program to help make those teachers and those \nprincipals better.\n  Here's another project, New Leaders for New Schools in the DC public \nschools. This is a coalition with DC public schools and several others, \nto provide direct compensation to teachers and principals who have \ndemonstrated their ability to move student achievement.\n  What a terrible thing to reward--teachers who have demonstrated an \nability to move student achievement. Let's kill that program right \naway. We don't want that happening in the District of Columbia, do we?\n  Let's go to the Chicago public schools. Chicago has taken a lot of \nsteps in their public schools. The\n\n[[Page S1893]]\n\nmayor deserves a lot of credit for that. The school system deserves a \nlot of credit. They know these children can't wait 5 or 10 years to \nhave a good education experience, so, as I mentioned earlier, in some \ncases they are not moving the school, they are just transforming it. \nHow do you transform a school? There is only one way. You move in a new \nprincipal and you move in some really good teachers. There is only one \nway to transform a school, and that is it.\n  So the Chicago public schools in collaboration with the National \nInstitute for Excellence in Teaching proposes the Recognizing \nExcellence in Academic Leadership. At the heart of that is multiple \nevaluations, opportunities for new roles and responsibilities, \nrecruitment, development, retention of quality staff in 40 Chicago high \nschools that serve 24,000 students. The NEA wants to kill that program. \nThat is the third grantee.\n  Let's go to Denver. The Denver public schools proposed a twofold \ndistrict-wide expansion of its professional compensation system for \nteachers--that means we pay them more--to develop and implement and \nevaluate a performance-based compensation system for principals.\n  My goodness, Denver wants to pay its best principals more money so \nthey might stay in the school? And how are they going to do that? They \nare going to think about it. They are going to work within the system. \nThey are going to ask for outside help. They are not just imposing a \none-time bonus, merit pay system. They are trying to lead the country \nin doing this. The National Education Association says: No, let's kill \nit.\n  The National Education Association not only said, no, let's kill it, \nthey issued a threat to Members of the Senate. ``Votes associated with \nthese issues may be included in the NEA legislative report card for the \n110th Congress.'' That means if you vote against the Alexander \namendment or anybody else's amendment supporting the Teacher Incentive \nFund, what we, the National Education Association, will do is write all \nthe teachers in Tennessee or Rhode Island or wherever we may be and \nsay: Your Senator is anti-education.\n\n  Why is the Senator anti-education? Because he wants to support a \nprogram to find a fair way to reward outstanding principals and \nteachers who are teaching low-income children and helping them succeed.\n  California--my goodness. The Mare Island Technology Academy--here is \nanother thing that NEA would like to stomp out. It proposes to extend a \ncurrent project to award incentives to teachers and principals \ninstrumental in increasing student achievement. We can't have that in \nCalifornia, at least under the NEA.\n  The Houston independent school district--maybe Senators Cornyn and \nHutchison would like to know about this. It is the largest public \nschool district in Texas, the seventh largest in the United States. It \nproposes an incentive plan for teachers that focuses on teacher \neffectiveness and growth in learning. We don't want that in any school, \ndo we?\n  Guilford County, NC--maybe Senator Burr and Senator Dole would like \nto be aware of this because their schools proposed a financial \nrecruitment project called Mission Possible and plans to extend the \nprogram to an additional seven schools, charter schools in various \nStates.\n  Another project. Alaska--one school district there serves as the \nfiscal agent. They are working on the same sort of progress and \nexpanding on a current program with the Re-Inventing Schools Coalition.\n  South Carolina Department of Education. A modified version of the \nexisting teacher advancement program to implement a performance-based \ncompensation system to address problems with recruitment and retention \nin 23 high-need schools in six districts. We wouldn't want 23 high-need \nschools in six South Carolina districts to have a program to pay good \nteachers more for teaching well, would we? We would like to kill that \nin the Congress because the National Education Association might put us \non their list of not voting for the NEA legislative report card.\n  Dallas independent school district--they have a similar program. They \nwant to identify and reward principals and teachers based on a \ncombination of direct and value-added measures of student achievement. \nCan't have that.\n  The school district of Philadelphia, PA. Let's pay particular \nattention to this one. The overall purpose of Philadelphia's initiative \nis to pilot a performance-based staff development and compensation \nsystem that is teacher pay and principals, that provides teachers and \nprincipals with clear incentives that are directly tied to student \nachievement, growth and classroom observations conducted according to \nan objective standards-based rubric at multiple points during the \nschool year. Twenty high-need urban elementary schools that have \ndemonstrated high degrees of faculty buy-in--that means the teachers \nwant it--will participate in the pilot.\n  Nobody is making them do it. They are volunteering to do it. The \nteachers want it. Leaders from the school district of Philadelphia's \nadministration and from two unions, representing all Philadelphia \nteachers and principals, have designed the pilot and will oversee its \nimplementation. So the National Education Association says kill the \nprogram in Philadelphia for a lot of high-need kids, even though the \nprogram involves the unions who work in those schools. That is a very \narrogant attitude, it seems to me.\n  Ohio, State Department of Education, Eagle County, CO, and Weld \nCounty, CO--those are just the schools and school districts and the \nStates where the Department has made 16 grants in the first year of its \noperation.\n  As you can see, the common thread running through here is, can we \nfind a fair way to reward outstanding teachers and help in training and \nreward outstanding principals so they will stay in the classroom, so \nthey will have an even better idea of what they are doing, so we can \nhonor them, treat them in a more professional way? If we were to do \nthat, wouldn't that be better?\n  Why wouldn't the largest educational association in America welcome \nthis? I know in Chattanooga, TN, when the new Senator from Tennessee, \nBob Corker, was mayor, he was more effective than I was in working with \nthe local teachers association or union, and he did just this--\ngenerally with their participation and agreement. And he helped, in a \nmodel school system in Chattanooga, TN, find a way to attract teachers \nto the schools where children were having trouble learning and needed \nextra help. These were teachers who had shown an ability to help these \nstudents achieve more. So they were paid more for that. They were paid \nmore for that.\n\n  Let me conclude my remarks. I ask unanimous consent for another 5 \nminutes, if I may?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I will conclude my remarks with a little bit of \nhistory. If you sense, in my voice, a heavy amount of disappointment, \nit is because this goes back a long ways. In 1983, when I was Governor \nof Tennessee, I proposed what then was the first statewide program to \npay teachers more for teaching well. We called it the Master Teacher \nProgram.\n  I was astonished, after a term as Governor, to discover that not one \nState was paying one teacher one penny more for teaching well. I could \nnot understand how we were going to keep outstanding men and women in \nthe classrooms, particularly--this was 25 years ago, almost--now that \nwomen had many more employment opportunities. The math teacher was \nheaded for IBM, the science teacher was going over here. One reason was \nbecause of the teacher pay scale. You could make more for staying \naround a long time, you could make more for getting another degree, but \nyou couldn't make a penny more for being good.\n  I went around to try to find out how do we reward outstanding \nteaching, and everybody said you can't do that. Not quite everybody. \nOne person who did not say that was Albert Shanker, who was the head of \nthe American Federation of Teachers, which is the second largest \nteachers union. Mr. Shanker said if we have master plumbers we can have \nmaster teachers, and maybe we need to get busy trying to think of a \nfair way to do that. He invited me to go to Los Angeles and speak to \nthe convention of the American Federation\n\n[[Page S1894]]\n\nof Teachers. They were very skeptical--which I understand, because \nprofessionals who are already working in their profession have a right \nto be skeptical of outsiders who would come in and say we are going to \ngrade you. Even though these teachers are in the business of grading \nthemselves.\n  I spoke to the American Federation of Teachers. I worked with Mr. \nShanker. I even raised taxes in Tennessee. Guess who was against doing \nwhat we eventually did? The National Education Association. Their \nPresident said we are going to send whatever we need into Tennessee to \ndefeat Alexander's silly ideas, and we fought for a year and a half and \nfinally I won, temporarily, and Tennessee established a career ladder \nprogram which eventually attracted 10,000 teachers with 10- or 11-month \ncontracts who volunteered to go up the career ladder to a second or \nthird level. They were called master teachers.\n  We raised the pay for every teacher by $1,000, just if they took the \nbasic teacher competency test. That was voluntary, too, but more than \n90 percent did it. And 10,000 teachers did. That was quite a number. \nThis was sort of the model T of the teacher compensation plans.\n  Since then, a lot has happened across the country. Governor Jim Hunt \nand others, with the support of the teachers unions, have developed the \nNational Board of Professional Teaching Standards Certified Teacher \nProgram, which is one way of certifying a biology teacher in the same \nway you would certify an orthopedic doctor. This is helpful if you are \non the school board in Providence, you can say: I don't have the means \nto evaluate if this teacher is better than that teacher, but if you are \na board certified teacher we will pay you $10,000 more a year. That has \nworked pretty well. Some places around the country have found ways to \ndo that, but it is not possible for a school board in the town to take \non the whole mixture of difficulties that go with a fair way to reward \nteachers.\n  We did it in 1983 and 1984, and we had to create a panel of teachers \nwho were outside the district of the teacher who wanted to be a master \nteacher to avoid politics. We made sure one of those teachers was of \nthat same subject. If it was an eighth grade U.S. history teacher, then \nsomebody on the panel was an eighth grade U.S. history teacher. \nPrincipal evaluations were part of it and a teacher portfolio was part \nof it.\n\n  One thing we did not know how to do then and we are just beginning to \nunderstand in our country is how to measure student achievement. Our \ncommon sense says a teacher makes a big difference, but how do we \nmeasure it? The challenge, as we work on schools that need help, is how \ndo we make sure they have the best teachers and the best school \nleaders? It is a big challenge, but it is not impossible.\n  We are learning, after 4 years of No Child Left Behind, that 80 \npercent of our schools I would call high-achieving schools are meeting \nall the adequate yearly progress requirements for No Child Left Behind. \nThat means we have about 20 percent of our schools that aren't. In 5 \npercent of the schools, they are only behind in one category. So it is \nonly 15 percent of the schools where children are chronically not \nlearning and being left behind. The ugly fact was, before No Child Left \nBehind, we let that happen.\n  Now we put the spotlight on it, and we have to do something about it. \nThe best way to do something about it is what? Get a terrific school \nleader and help him or her be a good principal, move in some tremendous \nteachers or reward those who are there and keep them teaching. And the \nNational Education Association says kill the program that is the most \nimportant Federal program to do that? I don't understand that; I don't \nunderstand.\n  I say to my colleagues in the Senate of both parties, I hope this \napproach will have unanimous opposition in the Senate. I hope we say we \nwant to reward efforts in Memphis, in New Mexico, DC, Chicago, Denver, \nDallas, Houston, Philadelphia, Chattanooga, where they tackle the \nproblem. No, we are not talking about a one-time bonus pay for people, \nor teacher of the year, who the principal might like. We are talking \nabout a more professional system where we can say talented men and \nwomen who are teachers, we like to honor you. We want to work with you \nin your district to form a way to honor you and raise your pay.\n  There is one reason I regret having to make this speech, I had a \nwonderful visit the other day. It came from six or seven members of the \nTennessee Education Association. Earl Wiman, Guy Stanley, Paula Brown, \nNita Jones, and Kristen Allen came to my office. We visited for a \nwhile. I am about to write a handwritten note to Earl Wiman to say how \nmuch I appreciated the visit. He was a career ladder teacher, making \n$75,000 extra dollars over his tenure. He said ``I want to thank you \nfor that.'' We acknowledged there were problems with the master teacher \nprogram we had in Tennessee as there always are when you start up \nsomething new. It was a terrific visit from people I greatly respect.\n  It reminded me, wherever I go in Tennessee, retired teachers or \ncurrent teachers come up to me and say, thank you for the master \nteacher program. It paid for my child's education. It honored my work. \nIt raised my retirement pay. It kept me teaching. You would be \nsurprised how many times this happened, so I know this can be done.\n  But it cannot be done if the largest educational association in \nAmerica sends out letters such as this threatening Senators with, in \neffect, writing every teacher in their district, and saying you are a \nbad Senator because you voted against the NEA legislative report card.\n  I would give them an F on a letter for another reason. They said that \nthe Teacher Incentive Fund restricts the use of funds to only two \npossible uses: merit pay and tenure reform. That is not true, at least \nnot according to the Department of Education. We called over there \ntoday. This is what they told me: The Department of Education says the \nwords ``tenure'' or ``merit pay'' do not even appear in the application \nforms. The specific goals of the teacher incentive fund include: one, \nimproving student achievement by increasing teacher and principal \neffectiveness; two, reforming teacher and principal compensation \nsystems so that teachers and principals are rewarded for increases in \nstudent achievement; three, increasing the number of effective teachers \nteaching minority, poor, and disadvantaged students in hard-to-staff \nsubjects; and finally, creating sustainable, performance-based \ncompensation systems.\n  Applicants must outline how they will utilize classroom evaluations \nthat are conducted multiple times throughout the school year and \nprovide incentives for educators to take on additional responsibilities \nand easy leadership roles.\n  The Department also gives extra points to applications that \ndemonstrate they have support from a significant proportion of \nteachers, the principal, and community. As I mentioned, in Philadelphia \nor Denver, that means the teachers' union.\n  I know in this joint funding resolution it looks as though we are not \ngoing to have a chance to amend that. That is why I voted against \ncloture. I understand that. Both sides of our aisle did not get our \nwork done so we have had to clean it up too quickly this year. The \nTeacher Incentive Fund took a big hit.\n  I say earnestly to my colleagues in the Senate, I hope Senators will \nlook at the Teacher Incentive Fund carefully. I hope you will think \nabout what your ideas are for improving schools with low-performing \nstudents. I hope you will ask yourself whether what they are doing in \nChicago, for example, to move in a new principal and to move in a team \nof teachers and to train them more and to pay them more might not be \none way to do it. If Denver wants to do it this way, and Dallas wants \nto do it that way, and Philadelphia wants to do it that way, and Mayor \nCorker helped Chattanooga do it, why shouldn't we help them?\n\n  We don't want the Federal Government to take over the local schools, \nbut clearly one of the appropriate things for the Federal Government to \ndo in support of elementary and secondary education and high school \neducation is to help solve this tough problem of how do we fairly and \neffectively reward outstanding teaching and outstanding school \nleadership.\n  If we don't do this in our current system, we are not going to be \nable to keep the best men and women in our classrooms, especially in \nthe most difficult classrooms, which is where our\n\n[[Page S1895]]\n\nspotlight is going. We know that 80 percent of our schools in America \nare high-achieving schools, they are making the advanced yearly \nprogress under No Child Left Behind. Five percent more are just missing \nit, and in the 15 percent, don't we want to ignore this letter from the \nNational Education Association?\n  I will answer their letter from here. I am not going to vote against \nthe Alexander amendment.\n  I hope they will write me often. I hope it is not this kind of letter \nagain. I say to my friends from Tennessee who were good enough to \ntravel all the way up here and visit with me, I am going to work a \nlittle harder in communicating with them. I know there will be issues \nupon which we disagree--the Tennessee Education Association and I have \nproved in the past we can disagree.\n  What I want to prove to them in the future is there are lots of ways \nwe can agree. I know they are dedicated professionals, they are working \nhard every day under difficult circumstances--many with children whose \nparents don't feed them well, don't teach them before they come to \nschool, and don't take care of them in the afternoon. I want to be \nsensitive to that.\n  In my remarks today I want to send a clear message to the National \nEducation Association: I am disappointed in their letter, I am \ndisappointed in their attitude. I hope the Senate rejects their \nattitude. But I want to be as clear to my friends in the Tennessee \nEducation Association that I greatly appreciate their visit.\n  I look forward to redoubling my efforts to work with them. I look \nforward to talking with them over time about support. I encourage their \nways to honor their professionals, including development of a \ncompensation program that rewards outstanding teaching and schools.\n  I ask unanimous consent the letter from the National Education \nAssociation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                February 13, 2007.\n     Hon. Lamar Alexander,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Alexander: On behalf of the National Education \n     Association's (NEA) 3.2 million members, we urge your \n     opposition to several ill-conceived amendments to the FY07 \n     Continuing Resolution. Specifically, we urge you to vote NO \n     on:\n       An amendment to be offered by Senator Alexander (R-TN) that \n     would provide $99 million for the Teacher Incentive Fund \n     (TIF); and\n       Any amendment that would call for across-the-board cuts to \n     already depleted domestic programs.\n       Votes associated with these issues may be included in the \n     NEA Legislative Report Card for the 110th Congress.\n       NEA strongly opposes the Teacher Incentive Fund, which \n     diverts scarce resources from existing underfunded \n     professional development programs. For example, Title II of \n     the Elementary and Secondary Education Act allows use of \n     funds for the stated purposes of the Teacher Incentive Fund \n     and also gives states and school districts significant \n     flexibility to utilize funds for activities that best meet \n     their needs. In contrast, the Teacher Incentive Fund \n     restricts use of funds to only two possible uses--merit pay \n     and tenure reform.\n       The proposed CR would reduce TIF funding, while increasing \n     funding for programs proven effective in maximizing student \n     achievement. We support the CR as proposed and oppose any \n     effort to increase TIF funding.\n       NEA also opposes any proposal to reduce funding across-the-\n     board, further stretching limited resources among already \n     struggling domestic programs. Although such amendments may be \n     addressing very worthy goals, we believe they are more \n     appropriately considered as part of bills to be debated \n     later, such as Emergency Supplemental legislation. Therefore, \n     we urge your vote against any such amendment.\n       We thank you for your consideration of our views on these \n     important issues.\n           Sincerely,\n     Diane Shust,\n       Director of Government Relations.\n     Randall Moody,\n       Manager of Federal Policy and Politics.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, we are in the posture of having \nto pass an appropriations bill that is to none of our liking because \nthe Congress is not fulfilling its responsibility in the budgeting and \nthe appropriations process. It goes back to the fact that albeit the \nSenate and the Senate Appropriations Committee were responsible in \nproducing all 13 appropriations bills, the leadership in the last \nCongress decided they did not want to pass 11 of those 13. To the best \nof my recollection, it was the Departments of Defense and Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bills that were passed, leaving all the others \nwithout funding. Each time we have continued emergency stopgap funding. \nThe particular law that is in effect now goes until midnight this \nThursday. That is no way to run a railroad. It puts us in the posture \nof having to take something instead of nothing which would shut down \nthe Government. That is not a logical way to do it.\n  The entire Federal budgetary process ought to be revamped. In the old \ndays, back in the 1970s, the Budget Act was enacted because it was \ngiving the new tools available for the Congress to discipline itself on \nspending, to hold down spending. Over 22 years, we have seen the Budget \nAct become not an economic process but a political process in which \nbudget documents are submitted--for example, the one submitted by the \nPresident, completely unrealistic--so that political goals can say they \nare going to be achieved; in other words, moving the budget toward \nbalance. The President has pointed that out over a 5-year period. When, \nin fact, the reality is that a lot of the President's assumptions in \nhis budget he has sent to the Congress are not realistic. In fact, they \nare fiction.\n  For example, there is a tax that is called the alternative minimum \ntax. It was designed years ago so that people with higher incomes that \nhad huge deductions couldn't offset all of their income. They would \nhave to pay some tax. It was designed to go to that higher income group \nso that they would still pay their fair share. If that alternative \nminimum tax is not allowed to be applied in the future--and I can't \ntell you the technicalities--it comes down and it swoops in a great \ndeal of the middle class, which it was never intended to do, middle-\nincome people, with the result that much higher taxes would be paid in \nthe very income levels that the alternative minimum tax was never \ndesigned to hit.\n  Naturally, a Congress in the future is not going to let that happen, \nfor that additional tax to go on the middle class. Yet the President's \nassumptions in the budget he has sent are that that alternative minimum \ntax is going to go away and, therefore, the increased revenue is going \nto be coming into the Federal Government from the middle-income \ntaxpayers. Therefore, it makes it look like his budget deficit is \ngetting smaller and smaller and moving toward balance.\n  The same thing is true with the tax cuts that were enacted back in \n2001. Over the next several years, a number of those tax cuts expire. \nThose tax cuts that affect the middle class are not going to expire \nbecause the Congress is not going to let that happen. If it did, as the \nPresident has proposed in his budget, the revenues to the Government \nare going to be greater and, therefore, the annual deficit is going to \nbe less. But that is not realistic. So what we have is a document of \npolitical fiction.\n  This isn't the first time. This has been going on over the last \ncouple of decades. But when it leads us down the path of fiction, \nsleight of hand, a head fake on what the budgetary condition of the \ncountry is, as the country, indeed, ought to make its staggering steps \ntoward balancing the budget, at least down the line in the next 5 to 7 \nyears, when that is all a political fiction, it undermines confidence. \nIt undermines the entire system. In large part, it leads to where we \nare today.\n  We are going to pass what is known as a continuing resolution, which \nis an end-of-the-day budget that is pared down, that doesn't address \npriorities as it should. And are the American people served best by \nthis kind of process? No.\n  This Senator thinks it is time for us to have some major overhaul of \nthe Budget Act. There are a lot of other\n\n[[Page S1896]]\n\nthings in the Budget Act that could be reformed, many of which are \ntechnical in nature and very extensive. I will not take the time to go \ninto them today. But when are we going to learn? When are we going to \nstop using the budget of the United States as a political tool instead \nof moving us in an economic way toward a sound economic plan to bring \nour fiscal house in order?\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in more detail about \nthe ``earmarks'' that some members of this body claim remain in H.J. \nRes. 20. On February 7, 2007, one of our colleagues issued a press \nrelease on his Web site which was critical of H.J. Res. 20, the \ncontinuing appropriations resolution. Of note was his claim that the \nresolution continues a number of earmarks. That claim, both generally \nand specifically, is not true.\n  The list of ``earmarks,'' stated as fact in this press release, are \nall supposedly found in the Ag Chapter of the resolution. I would like \nto take a minute to address those specific items and explain why this \ninformation is wrong.\n  Our colleague claims that H.J. Res. 20 provides $350,000 for the \nWorld Food Prize. Although this item was funded in the fiscal year 06 \nbill as part of General Provision 790, H.J. Res. 20, in section 21004, \nprovides that the amount available for Section 790 is zero. So, \nobviously, that earmark has been removed.\n  Our colleague claims that $1.5 million for construction of the \nentrance to the U.S. National Arboretum is funded in H.J. Res. 20. \nFirst of all, this item was never included in the 2006 bill, which is \nwhat H.J. Res. 20 is based on. It was, however, included in the 2007 \nbill under the agricultural research service buildings and facilities \naccount. H.J. Res. 20, in section 20101, provides that the amount \navailable for that account is zero. The entire account, not just the \nearmark, is removed.\n  Our colleague claims that H.J. Res. 20 contains more than $1 million \nfor alternative salmon products, including baby food products. This \nitem was funded under the special research grants program of the \nCooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service. H.J. Res. \n20, in section 20102, provides that the amount available for that \nprogram is zero so the earmark is removed.\n  Our colleague claims that H.J. Res. 20 contains $591,000 for the \nMontana Sheep Institute. This item was also funded under the special \nresearch grants account of the Cooperative Research, Education, and \nExtension Service, which, as I stated earlier, was eliminated in \nsection 20102 of H.J. Res. 20. Thus the earmark was removed.\n  Here is a third ``earmark'' claim under this same account, which was \neliminated. The Senator claims that H.J. Res. 20 contains $295,000 for \nwool research, again, under the special research grants account of the \nCooperative Research, Education, and Extension Service. I repeat again \nthat H.J. Res. 20, in section 20102, provides that the amount available \nfor that program is zero. Again, and I know I am beginning to sound \nlike a broken record, but the earmarks are removed.\n  In another account, the Senator claims that $232,000 remains for the \nNational Wild Turkey Federation. This item was funded under the Federal \nAdministration program of the Extension Service. H.J. Res. 20 provides \nthat all funds for the Federal Administration program are reduced to a \nlevel that only protects Federal FTE positions definitely not the \nNational Wild Turkey Federation. H.J. Res. 20, in section 20103, \nprovides that all other funding in that program, which would include \nfunds for the National Wild Turkey Federation, is zero. There are no \nearmarks.\n  The Senator claims that $100,000 is contained in the Agricultural \nMarketing Service account to establish a farm-raised catfish grading \nsystem. However, this item was never included in the 2006 bill, which, \nagain, is what H.J. Res. 20 is based on. It was included in the 2007 \nbill, which never even passed the Senate floor. There is not, and never \nwas, any funding for this activity in a bill that passed the House or \nSenate. There are no earmarks in this account.\n  Finally, the Senator's press release states that $2,970,000 is \ncontinued to maintain a partnership between USDA and the National Fish \nand Wildlife Foundation. This was funding provided by the natural \nresources conservation service conservation operations account to a \nnon-Federal entity. H.J. Res. 20, in section 20104, provides that all \nfunds for the conservation operations account were reduced to a level \nthat only protects federal FTE positions. H.J. Res. 20 provides that \nall other funding in that program, which would include funds for the \nNational Fish and Wildlife Foundation, is zero. Once again, there are \nno earmarks.\n  As our colleagues should now realize, not only does H.J. Res. 20 not \ncontinue these items, H.J. Res. 20 actually removes the money which \nwould make their funding possible, even if the administration wished to \ndo so. For even those who wish to claim that money is still provided in \nthe resolution which would enable the items to end up getting funded, \nit is obvious that in these claims, specifically listed in a press \nrelease, that is simply not possible. While I do appreciate zeal for \nfinding and making public all earmarks, perhaps a closer reading of \nH.J. Res. 20 would have prevented these misstatements from occurring.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to a global \ncompetitiveness amendment to H.J. Res. 20 and to call attention to the \nchallenges facing U.S. financial markets. The first half of the \namendment highlights findings from two recent reports that the U.S. is \nalready losing ground in the key areas of global initial public \nofferings, IPOs, and over-the-counter, OTC, derivatives. The second \nhalf of the amendment expresses the sense of the Senate about what \nsteps should be taken to bolster the competitiveness of this essential \nsector of the U.S. economy.\n  IPOs are critical to our economy because when a company goes public, \nit creates capital--and that means jobs and investment opportunities \nwith great potential payoffs. The risk-taking exemplified by IPOs is in \nthe most important sense the critical fuel of a market economy. OTC \nderivatives play a critical role in our economy, assisting investors to \nmore precisely match their investments to their risk preferences, and \nhelping companies to manage or hedge their risks. Additionally, these \ninstruments provide liquidity to financial markets and reduce \nvolatility by helping to diversify and distribute risk. At the same \ntime the OTC derivatives industry attracts highly skilled professionals \nwho, by virtue of the demand created by their talents, have the \npotential to contribute significantly to an area's tax base.\n  Together, IPOs and OTC derivatives contribute to a robust and dynamic \ncapital market which is a tremendously beneficial force for our economy \nand an empowerment to our citizens. It is critical to ensuring economic \ngrowth, job creation, low costs of capital, innovation, \nentrepreneurship, and a strong tax base in key areas of the country. \nThe U.S. financial sector acts as a catalyst for all other sectors in \nthe U.S. economy. That is why the decline in global initial public \nofferings in the United States, and the fact that London already enjoys \nclear leadership in the fast growing OTC derivatives market, are such \nworrying trends.\n  Fortunately, academics, business leaders, and politicians are working \ntogether to study this issue. They have identified several specific \nproblems that hinder the competitiveness of the U.S. capital markets \nand have issued reports outlining possible solutions. Chaired by former \nWhite House economic adviser Glenn Hubbard and former Goldman Sachs \npresident John Thornton, the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation \nwas formed in September 2006 and issued its preliminary report in \nNovember 2006. Mr. Schumer of New York along with New York Mayor \nBloomberg released the McKinsey Report on New York Competitiveness in \nJanuary 2007 outlining regulatory, legal, and accounting changes they \nsay are necessary to maintain the city's status as a leading global \nfinancial center.\n  Both reports add considerably to the understanding of the challenges \nthat American capital markets face and\n\n[[Page S1897]]\n\noffer solutions that could help American markets, companies, and \nworkers to better compete.\n  According to the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation:\n\n       A key measure of competitiveness, one particularly relevant \n     to the growth of new jobs, is where new equity is being \n     raised--that is, in which market initial public offerings \n     (IPOs) are being done. The trend in so-called ``global'' IPOs \n     i.e., IPOs done outside a company's home country, provides \n     evidence of a decline in the U.S. competitive position. As \n     measured by value of IPOs, the U.S. share declined from 50 \n     percent in 2000 to 5 percent in 2005. Measured by number of \n     IPOs, the decline is from 37 percent in 2000 to 10 percent in \n     2005.\n\n  According to the McKinsey Report on New York Competitiveness:\n\n       London already enjoys clear leadership in the fast-growing \n     and innovative over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market. \n     This is significant because of the trading flow that \n     surrounds derivatives markets and because of the innovation \n     these markets drive, both of which are key competitive \n     factors for financial centers. Dealers and investors \n     increasingly see derivatives and cash markets as \n     interchangeable and are therefore combining trading \n     operations for both products. Indeed, the derivatives markets \n     can be more liquid than the underlying cash markets. \n     Therefore, as London takes the global lead in derivatives, \n     America's competitiveness in both cash and derivatives flow \n     trading is at risk, as is its position as a center for \n     financial innovation.\n\n  The challenge we are facing is that the U.S. capital markets are \nlosing their competitive edge in intensifying global competition. A \nshrinking proportion of international companies are listing shares on \nU.S. stock exchanges and the fast-growing OTC derivatives market are \ngrowing more rapidly elsewhere.\n  This amendment welcomes these reports and encourages Congress and the \nadministration to begin to vet and consider their recommendations.\n  (1) Congress, the President, regulators, industry leaders, and other \nstakeholders should carefully review the Interim Report of the \nCommittee on Capital Markets Regulation, published in November 2006, \nand the McKinsey Report on New York Competitiveness, published in \nJanuary 2007, and take the necessary steps to reclaim the preeminent \nposition of the United States in the financial services industry.\n  (2) The Federal and State financial regulatory agencies should, to \nthe maximum extent possible, coordinate activities on significant \npolicy matters, so as not to impose regulations that may have adverse \nunintended consequences on innovativeness with respect to financial \nproducts, instruments, and services, or that impose regulatory costs \nthat are disproportionate to their benefits, and, at the same time, \nensure that the regulatory framework overseeing the U.S. capital \nmarkets continues to promote and protect the interests of investors in \nthose markets.\n  (3) Given the complexity of the financial services marketplace today, \nCongress should exercise vigorous oversight over Federal regulatory and \nstatutory requirements affecting the financial services industry and \nconsumers, with the goal of eliminating excessive regulation and \nproblematic implementation of existing laws and regulations.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, few would argue that these are challenging \ntimes for U.S. foreign policy. Faced with threats from a growing \nradical Islamic ideology, tense situations in North Korea and Iran, an \nescalating civil war in Iraq, humanitarian crises of biblical \nproportions in Africa and elsewhere, and countless other challenges, it \nis clear that we need as perhaps never before the hand of experience \nguiding our foreign policy.\n  It is no secret that I have disagreed--deeply disagreed--with many of \nthe foreign policy decisions made by this administration. I said in \n2002 that it was a mistake to invade Iraq, and my judgement has never \nwavered: the President was wrong to start this war, he was wrong to \ncontinue this war, and he is wrong to escalate this war.\n  However, we are in Iraq now. American men and women are caught in the \ncross-fire of sectarian warfare that has been brewing for centuries. \nAnd I believe that the way out is primarily political and diplomatic, \nnot solely through the use of military force. The recommendations of \nthe Iraq Study Group are just the latest reminder that we must engage \ndiplomatically with other nations--not only with our friends and \nallies, but also with our competitors and even our enemies--to seek new \nsolutions.\n  That is why the leadership at the State Department is so important, \nand why I am pleased that last night the Senate voted to confirm the \nnomination of Ambassador John Negroponte to become Deputy Secretary of \nState. I had an opportunity to meet with Ambassador Negroponte \nrecently, and I am encouraged by his long track record of service to \nhis country, as a foreign service officer and ambassador in many \ndifferent regions of the world. In his most recent assignments, he has \nproven himself capable of performing in the most challenging of roles, \nas U.S. Ambassador to Iraq and as the Director of National \nIntelligence. Prior to that, he served as U.S. Ambassador to the United \nNations, where he earned this high praise from another diplomat, former \nSecretary General Kofi Annan:\n\n       He's an outstanding professional, a great diplomat and a \n     wonderful ambassador.\n\n  When I met with Ambassador Negroponte, I conveyed to him my strong \nbelief that we must rely on diplomacy and peaceful negotiation to reach \nlasting stability in the Middle East. I also emphasized that pursuing \nsome sort of Sunni vs. Shi'a alignment in the Middle East as the \nbalance of power in the region shifts is not in the best interests of \nthe United States or the world. I am encouraged that Ambassador \nNegroponte seems to agree with me, and I look forward to working with \nhim and other administration officials as we seek a path toward peace.\n  Ambassador Negroponte has demonstrated the savvy and expertise of a \nworld-class diplomat. Our Nation needs experienced professionals who \ncan rise above the fray of partisan politics guiding our foreign \npolicy, particularly in such turbulent times as these. I look forward \nto working with Ambassador Negroponte in his new role as Deputy \nSecretary of State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/13/senate-section/article/S1897-3", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1897-S1898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONGRATULATING LAKE FOREST ACADEMY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to congratulate \nan outstanding school on 150 years of educational excellence.\n  Lake Forest Academy is an independent high school and boarding school \nin Lake Forest, IL, 30 miles north of Chicago. It was founded by elders \nof the Presbyterian Church in Chicago and 150 years ago today--on \nFebruary 13, 1857--it was chartered by the State of Illinois as a \ncollege preparatory school for boys.\n  Classes began at Lake Forest Academy in 1858 with a total of five \nstudents. While its enrollment today is considerably larger, Lake \nForest Academy remains committed to its founding principle: to educate \nthe whole child.\n  Dr. Martin Luther King said, ``Intelligence plus character that is \nthe goal of true education.'' And for 150 years, that has been the goal \nof Lake Forest Academy. Its educational mission is based on ``four \npillars:'' character, scholarship, citizenship and responsibility.\n  Some things have changed at Lake Forest Academy, however. Among the \nmost notable changes: in 1974, Lake Forest formally merged with The \nYoung Ladies Seminary at Ferry Hall, becoming a college prep school for \nyoung men and young women.\n  Lake Forest takes pride in the diversity of its students and faculty, \nand the global perspective of its programs.\n  As the oldest institution in the city of Lake Forest four years older \nthan\n\n[[Page S1898]]\n\nthe city itself Lake Forest Academy is an integral part of the fabric \nof its community and the State of Illinois.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor a great \nKentuckian, Mr. Danny Orazine, for his 13-year service as county judge-\nexecutive to the people of McCracken County.\n  Mr. Orazine is the epitome of a man dedicated to serving his county \nresidents, all the while ensuring a strong relationship with the city \ngovernment as well. He is a modest, ethical, and fairminded man who has \ngiven much to McCracken County, and I am proud of the work he has done.\n  On Monday, December 25, 2006, The Paducah Sun newspaper published an \narticle highlighting Mr. Orazine's many years of service. I ask \nunanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record and \nthat the entire Senate join me in thanking this beloved Kentuckian.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Paducah Sun, December 25, 2006]\n\n              Reflections: Orazine Returns to Simple Life\n\n                            (By Brian Peach)\n\n       Danny Orazine isn't a politician. At least he doesn't think \n     of himself as one. This coming from the man who has spent the \n     past 21 years in McCracken County public office--time that \n     was every bit as challenging as he would have liked.\n       ``Honestly, I don't really like politics,'' the outgoing \n     judge-executive said in a recent interview. ``I'm a simple \n     person.''\n       He's not flashy. Not begging for the spotlight. He'll wear \n     a suit when he needs to, but he'd rather lose the tie \n     whenever possible.\n       Look no further than his truck for proof of his modesty.\n       He still drives a 1983 Ford pickup that he bought new. It \n     has about 250,000 miles on it.\n       ``I've got the same house, same wife, same truck,'' he said \n     with a laugh, adding that a new paint job on the truck has \n     kept it looking good. He'll have to give back his county-\n     issued car, but that's OK. He'll just turn to his trusty \n     pickup a little more often.\n       He considers himself a strong Democrat, but he's not crazy \n     about partisan politics.\n       ``I normally worked closely with Democratic governors,'' he \n     said, adding that he still considers his relationship strong \n     with Gov. Ernie Fletcher and his Republican cabinet. The two \n     joked recently at ground-breaking and ribbon-cutting \n     ceremonies, and he said it's because partisan politics don't \n     come into play.\n       ``I'm a simple person,'' he said.\n       At one point, he thought of walking away.\n       ``In the middle of my first tenure, I was about ready to \n     resign,'' he said.\n       But he stayed on, and was re-elected twice, serving 13 \n     years as judge-executive after eight as a county \n     commissioner.\n       It was sewers that got him into office. They were the big \n     issue back then. After that, he just hung around.\n       ``We just didn't get sewers in the smaller districts,'' \n     Orazine said, referring in part to the Hendron area 18 years \n     ago.\n       The sewer agency was finally formed in July 1999 with the \n     merger of separate city and county sewer agencies. He said \n     the goal was to merge the water districts into one as well, \n     but today, ``I would never ask the water districts in the \n     county to give up theirs for the Paducah Water Works board.''\n       Paducah Mayor Bill Paxton recently asked Orazine to serve \n     on the city water board, and he accepted.\n       He'll leave behind a big corner office and lots of \n     responsibilities, but take his love for the community with \n     him. He's been offered a couple of full-time jobs since his \n     defeat, but he said he wants to get away from ``the politics \n     stage.''\n\n\n                             Running Clean\n\n       On his window sill are pictures--family and friends--as \n     well as a $20 bill, laminated and labeled: First Campaign \n     Contribution to Danny Orazine from Don Utley, Aug. 21, 1991.\n       He was elected judge-executive two years later. On his wall \n     are many pictures, including a large one of Paducah native \n     and former U.S. Vice President Alben Barkley, and one of his \n     campaign posters that Orazine said was from 1948.\n       He has never been offered a bribe, he said. ``I used to kid \n     about never being offered a bribe. Guess they didn't think \n     that I had enough clout to get it down. . . . Hopefully they \n     just thought I wouldn't have accepted it.''\n       He said advice from Julian Carroll stuck with him over the \n     years: If you'll only take your paycheck, you'll never have \n     any problems.\n       ``I have adhered to that,'' Orazine said, pointing out that \n     among his first responsibilities at the end of this year will \n     be turning in his eight-year-old county-issued Ford Taurus.\n\n\n                             Time of Change\n\n       He's leaving office, and it's in large part due to county \n     residents feeling it was time for a change. They picked Van \n     Newberry to replace Orazine in the May primary. He said his \n     was a good, tough run.\n       Zoning issues and building code enforcement were just a \n     couple of the ``monumental ordinances'' that he said the \n     fiscal court passed, and that weren't entirely popular with \n     the voters. About six years ago, the fiscal court required \n     that all new homes undergo a five-point inspection. The \n     problem was that some people decided to build homes on their \n     own, and may not have realized that the inspection also \n     checks for earthquake protection, given the proximity to the \n     New Madrid Fault.\n       ``People might cut a plan out of a magazine and come in \n     with it,'' he said. But most of those plans account for \n     possible seismic activity. ``We were stuck with not having a \n     building code or having seismic in it.''\n       The county opted to keep the more stringent codes, and the \n     five-point inspections--which Orazine said have led to a few \n     building delays during the busy construction season. ``It \n     took a while to catch up,'' he said. ``Now (in the winter), \n     the building has slowed and they're caught up.''\n       As for the city and county working together on such \n     projects as a comprehensive plan, Orazine never viewed that \n     as a step toward a metro government. Even so, he admitted \n     that at times, ``It's hard to tell where the city ends and \n     the county begins.''\n       Many city residents have moved into the county over the \n     past several years, and the city is occasionally annexing \n     county land into the city, often at a developer's request.\n       ``Anything, good or bad, affects both the city and county \n     now,'' he said. ``We have to prioritize what we're going to \n     prioritize, and talk over those things we place as \n     priorities.''\n       The downtown riverfront, though located in the city, will \n     benefit the entire area, and it's something the judge says \n     must naturally include the county, and that includes \n     financial support.\n       County government, he notes, ``is very lean by nature.'' \n     That's mainly in regard to the budget. Comparatively \n     speaking, Paducah's is about $28 million, while the county's \n     is about $20 million.\n       ``If we didn't have the grants and money that the state \n     gives us, it'd be about half the city's,'' Orazine said of \n     the budget. ``That's why we're hesitant about hiring people \n     over here. . . . That's just the nature of the county.''\n       He looked to the city's fire department in saying that the \n     county couldn't afford to pay its firefighters. Grants help \n     keep the five volunteer fire districts operational.\n       ``There's a lot of pride that goes into them,'' he said. \n     ``Probably the biggest factor in the metro-government \n     discussion, moneywise, is I think you're going to have to \n     keep your volunteer firefighters.\n       ``If anybody ever proposed (a paid county fire department), \n     oh my, property taxes would go so high. I wouldn't want to be \n     anywhere near public office when that happens.''\n       That all comes back to the idea of a metro government. He \n     said county residents' pride in fire departments and parks \n     being operated by volunteers adds to the pride when they do \n     look nice, albeit, he said, not as nice as Noble Park.\n       ``The county was just not ready for it,'' he said of metro \n     government suggestions. But because he worked so closely with \n     the city during his tenure, particularly with Paxton, ``I got \n     associated with that, but I never went there and had no plans \n     to. That sure didn't keep me from working with the mayor.''\n       Paxton said Orazine ``is one of the most ethical, fair-\n     minded people I have ever known,'' and it made him easy to \n     work with. ``I enjoyed every minute of it,'' Paxton said. ``I \n     think the city and county benefited from not only the \n     closeness of my relationship with Danny, but also (his \n     relationship) with former Mayor Albert Jones, who was \n     extremely close with the judge.''\n\n\n                             Helping Youth\n\n       Another area Orazine looks back on with a smile is \n     everything he has done to help youths.\n       ``I got a special place for juveniles,'' he said of his \n     desire to help them. ``I didn't get into trouble (as a \n     teenager), but it was a wonder I graduated--It took me five \n     years to get through high school.''\n       Now, thanks to his push, the county puts about $1 million \n     each year toward helping children and teens, in large part \n     through the McCracken Regional Juvenile Detention Center.\n       Orazine is also a member of the state Office of Juvenile \n     Justice Advisory Board, which he has served on since it was \n     founded in 1998. He also serves on the Juvenile Detention \n     Council Board locally. As his tenure as judge-executive ends, \n     he plans to resign from those boards. That means fewer trips \n     to Frankfort for the state board meetings.\n       He lasted a term and a half before hiring a county \n     administrator--a position incoming Judge-Executive Van \n     Newberry wants to abolish. Orazine said he was becoming \n     overwhelmed with the large and small projects.\n       ``In the midst of all that, an employee of the courthouse \n     came in'' complaining about the texture of the toilet paper--\n     ``that it was too rough,'' he said, still sounding \n     exasperated at having to handle minor tasks when he had more \n     important things to deal with.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/13/senate-section/article/S1899-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S1899]]\n                 NOMINATION OF GEN GEORGE W. CASEY JR.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I voted last Thursday in opposition to \nthe nomination of GEN George W. Casey, Jr., to be the 36th Chief of \nStaff of the U.S. Army.\n  This decision did not come easily, but after watching the slow \nfailure of our Iraq strategy since the invasion in March 2003, it was \ntime for some accountability.\n  This is not to say General Casey, alone, should take the blame for \nthe multitude of mistakes in Iraq. In fact, there is no doubt that the \nbuck stops at the President's desk and this is his war.\n  It is President Bush more than any other individual who is \nresponsible for the dire situation we face in Iraq today.\n  It was he who ordered the invasion and he who has stubbornly stuck to \na strategy that has put success in Iraq increasingly out of reach.\n  In addition to President Bush, Vice President Cheney and former \nSecretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld were some of the strongest public \nbackers of the campaign to invade Iraq that failed to plan for the \nchaotic aftermath that we are now mired in today. And it should not be \nforgotten that it was George Tenet, then the Director of the CIA, who \npresided over the flawed intelligence analysis that suggested that Iraq \nhad weapons of mass destruction and was in the process of developing a \nnuclear capability. It was Tenet who told us that this intelligence was \na ``slam dunk.''\n  Yet, that said, our military strategy over the past several years \nshould not be free from criticism.\n  General Casey has served as the commander of Multi-national Force--\nIraq since July 2004. Over these past 2\\1/2\\ years, I can see little to \napplaud regarding our military strategy on the ground.\n  Too many times, in my view, General Casey, and those around him, \nfailed to provide the Congress with accurate assessments of what has \nbeen happening in Iraq. For example, it was General Casey who suggested \nthat the situation in Iraq would improve enough following the December \n2005 elections that troop reductions could take place in early 2006. He \neven went so far as to provide specific projections of troop \nwithdrawals, saying in August 2005 that the level of U.S. troops in \nIraq could be drawn down to about 100,000 by the spring of 2006.\n  Earlier, in June 2005, he said, and I quote:\n\n       I'm confident that we'll be able to continue to take \n     reductions over the course of this year based on the security \n     situation and the progress of the Iraqi security forces.\n\n  Time and time again General Casey came before us in Congress and \npainted an overly optimistic view of the situation on the ground in \nIraq. Just last week, at his confirmation hearing in front of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, General Casey suggested that, rather \nthan a ``slow failure,'' he sees ``slow progress'' in Iraq.\n  Since General Casey took over as commander of all coalition forces in \nIraq, we have seen the following:\n  Car bombings have grown from 30 a month when General Casey took \ncommand to about 80 today.\n  Daily insurgent attacks have skyrocketed from 50 to some 200 today.\n  The training of Iraqi forces, which General Casey touted as the means \nfor an exit of U.S. troops from Iraq, has been slow and inconsistent.\n  In fact, though General Casey called 2006 the ``Year of the Police'' \nin Iraq, we have seen increased infiltration of Iraqi police forces by \nShiite militias and growing Iranian influence.\n  While 320,000 Iraqi troops have been ``trained and equipped'' \naccording to the Pentagon, our troop level today, 140,000, is just a \nfew thousand less than when General Casey took command in July 2004.\n  Iraqi security forces have 91 brigades that are taking the ``lead'' \nin counterinsurgency operations throughout the country, yet these \nforces are now responsible for the security of only 2 of Iraq's 18 \nprovinces.\n  I have no doubt that General Casey is a good man with an impeccable \ncharacter. Many of the mistakes regarding our Iraq strategy are not the \nresult of his leadership.\n  But it is time that the Senate insists upon accountability.\n  It is past time for the Senate to provide oversight by showing that \nwe will not accept anything but unvarnished, forthright candor from our \nmilitary leaders.\n  We expect independent views from our military leaders,\n  and this has simply been too often lacking over these past few years.\n  General Casey deserves credit for his long, dedicated service to this \ncountry. But I did not believe he should to be promoted to Chief of \nStaff of the Army. Therefore, I regretfully cast my vote against his \nnomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/13/senate-section/article/S1899-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CELBRATING OREGON'S BLACK HISTORY\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, each Congress I rise to honor February as \nBlack History Month. Each February since 1926, our Nation has \nrecognized the contributions of Black Americans to the history of our \nNation.\n  This is no accident; February is a significant month in Black \nAmerican history. Abolitionist Frederick Douglass, President Abraham \nLincoln, and scholar and civil rights leader W.E.B. DuBois were born in \nthe month of February. The 15th amendment to the Constitution was \nratified 136 years ago this month, preventing race discrimination in \nthe right to vote. The National Association for the Advancement of \nColored People was founded in February in New York City. And on \nFebruary 25, 1870, this body welcomed its first Black Senator, Hiram R. \nRevels of Mississippi.\n  In this important month I want to celebrate some of the contributions \nmade by Black Americans in my home State of Oregon. Since Marcus Lopez, \nwho sailed with Captain Robert Gray in 1788, became the first person of \nAfrican descent known to set foot in Oregon, a great many Black \nAmericans have helped shape the history of my State. Throughout this \nmonth, I will come to the floor to highlight some of their stories.\n  Reverend Jesse James ``J.J.'' Clow was a beloved minister and a \nprominent figure in the struggle for civil rights in Portland, OR. In \n1936, Reverend Clow began a service of ministry at Portland's Mount \nOlivet Baptist Church. Mount Olivet was the first African-American \nbaptist church in the State of Oregon and during the 1940s and 1950s \nwas also the largest Black church in the State. It was from this \nvantage point that Clow lived and preached a social gospel that \ncontributed to the civil rights battles of Portland's WWII challenges \nand continued through the turbulent 60s.\n  Clow was born in Hufsmith, TX, 1 of 15 children. Clow finished high \nschool at Tuskegee Institute and received his B.A. from Virginia Union \nUniversity. His first pulpit was in Virginia, a second in Georgia, \nbefore arriving in Portland. His experiences growing up in the South \nhelped prepare him for a lifetime of activism for justice and civil \nrights.\n  During the World War II years, Clow served as president of the local \nchapter of the NAACP. He was also deeply involved in the establishment \nof a Portland office of the Urban League. Along with these national \norganizations, Clow and other Portland area Black leaders worked \ntirelessly to improve housing and employment opportunities for African \nAmericans. These efforts were largely responsible for ridding the city \nof many traditional economic and social segregation policies, including \nOregon's first civil rights ordinance in 1953.\n  Upon his retirement from Mount Olivet in 1963, Reverend Clow spoke \nwarmly of the progress he had witnessed during his lifetime. He \ncontinued to believe that Christianity must be interpreted in terms of \nhow men behave towards one another and not just to comfort them. Until \nhis death, Clow encouraged the community of Portland to more fully \nembrace democratic ideals in its social, political, and economic \nsectors.\n  Reverend Clow is only one example of the Black men and women who \nchanged the course of history in Oregon and in the United States. \nDuring the remainder of Black History Month, I will return to the floor \nto celebrate more Oregonians like Rev. J.J. Clow, whose contributions, \nwhile great, have not yet received the attention they deserve.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/13/senate-section/article/S1900-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S1900]]\n                          S. 331 COSPONSORSHIP\n\n  Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, William Odom is one of the finest \nintelligence officers who have served in our military. Retiring at the \nrank of lieutenant general, his distinguished Army career culminated in \nhis heading up the U.S. Army's intelligence division and the National \nSecurity Agency. He has worked tirelessly to help the country \nunderstand and deal with the challenges to its security and defense. I \nhave known the general for decades, and, like many of my colleagues, I \ndeeply value his judgment and insight.\n  That is why I read his opinion piece from last Sunday's Washington \nPost, ``Victory is Not an Option,'' with great interest.\n  General Odom lays out the truths and myths of the Nation's \ninvolvement in Iraq. Among the clear truths is that the dream of a real \ndemocracy gaining roots in that war-torn country is simply that, a \ndream. He rightly points out, too, that any Iraqi government is likely \nto be more anti than pro-American at the end of the day.\n  As for the myths, he sensibly lays out that it is pure fantasy for \nanyone to think that our presence is actually preventing the horrible \ncarnage from unfolding or holding Iran back from gaining influence with \nits neighbor. It is similarly a flight of the imagination to think that \nour military presence is actually stanching--as opposed to \nencouraging--al-Qaida's involvement in the country. Finally, it is a \nmyth to think that we must stay in Iraq ``to support the troops.'' In \nfact, he notes, many of our brave men and women in the country \nunderstand the cold realities that unfold there every day, and many of \nthem believe that we should get out of Iraq.\n  General Odom makes some sensible suggestions for a new policy \ndirection, something beyond the absurd ``surge'' that is only the same \nold repast of stay-the-course with a different seasoning. We should get \nout of Iraq and recognize that our presence there has become a source \nof instability for the whole Middle East. He smartly suggests that we \nshould work with our international partners to seek order and \nstability, which will fundamentally alter the balance against the \nradicals who want to stir up even more strife.\n  I ask unanimous consent that General Odom's article, ``Victory Is Not \nan Option,'' now be printed in the Record. I urge my colleagues to read \nthis article closely and truly think about what General Odom is saying. \nThe logic is clear and sensible. I think it is incontrovertible.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 11, 2007]\n\n                        Victory Is Not an Option\n\n                          (By William E. Odom)\n\n       The new National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq starkly \n     delineates the gulf that separates President Bush's illusions \n     from the realities of the war. Victory, as the president sees \n     it, requires a stable liberal democracy in Iraq that is pro-\n     American. The NIE describes a war that has no chance of \n     producing that result. In this critical respect, the NIE, the \n     consensus judgment of all the U.S. intelligence agencies, is \n     a declaration of defeat.\n       Its gloomy implications--hedged, as intelligence agencies \n     prefer, in rubbery language that cannot soften its impact--\n     put the intelligence community and the American public on the \n     same page. The public awakened to the reality of failure in \n     Iraq last year and turned the Republicans out of control of \n     Congress to wake it up. But a majority of its members are \n     still asleep, or only half-awake to their new writ to end the \n     war soon.\n       Perhaps this is not surprising. Americans do not warm to \n     defeat or failure, and our politicians are famously reluctant \n     to admit their own responsibility for anything resembling \n     those un-American outcomes. So they beat around the bush, \n     wringing hands and debating ``nonbinding resolutions'' that \n     oppose the president's plan to increase the number of U.S. \n     troops in Iraq.\n       For the moment, the collision of the public's clarity of \n     mind, the president's relentless pursuit of defeat and \n     Congress's anxiety has paralyzed us. We may be doomed to two \n     more years of chasing the mirage of democracy in Iraq and \n     possibly widening the war to Iran. But this is not \n     inevitable. A Congress, or a president, prepared to quit the \n     game of ``who gets the blame'' could begin to alter American \n     strategy in ways that will vastly improve the prospects of a \n     more stable Middle East.\n       No task is more important to the well-being of the United \n     States. We face great peril in that troubled region, and \n     improving our prospects will be difficult. First of all, it \n     will require, from Congress at least, public acknowledgment \n     that the president's policy is based on illusions, not \n     realities. There never has been any right way to invade and \n     transform Iraq. Most Americans need no further convincing, \n     but two truths ought to put the matter beyond question:\n       First, the assumption that the United States could create a \n     liberal, constitutional democracy in Iraq defies just about \n     everything known by professional students of the topic. Of \n     the more than 40 democracies created since World War II, \n     fewer than 10 can be considered truly ``constitutional''--\n     meaning that their domestic order is protected by a broadly \n     accepted rule of law, and has survived for at least a \n     generation. None is a country with Arabic and Muslim \n     political cultures. None has deep sectarian and ethnic \n     fissures like those in Iraq.\n       Strangely, American political scientists whose business it \n     is to know these things have been irresponsibly quiet. In the \n     lead-up to the March 2003 invasion, neoconservative agitators \n     shouted insults at anyone who dared to mention the many \n     findings of academic research on how democracies evolve. \n     They also ignored our own struggles over two centuries to \n     create the democracy Americans enjoy today. Somehow Iraqis \n     are now expected to create a constitutional order in a \n     country with no conditions favoring it.\n       This is not to say that Arabs cannot become liberal \n     democrats. When they immigrate to the United States, many do \n     so quickly. But it is to say that Arab countries, as well as \n     a large majority of all countries, find creating a stable \n     constitutional democracy beyond their capacities.\n       Second, to expect any Iraqi leader who can hold his country \n     together to be pro-American, or to share American goals, is \n     to abandon common sense. It took the United States more than \n     a century to get over its hostility toward British \n     occupation. (In 1914, a majority of the public favored \n     supporting Germany against Britain.) Every month of the U.S. \n     occupation, polls have recorded Iraqis' rising animosity \n     toward the United States. Even supporters of an American \n     military presence say that it is acceptable temporarily and \n     only to prevent either of the warring sides in Iraq from \n     winning. Today the Iraqi government survives only because its \n     senior members and their families live within the heavily \n     guarded Green Zone, which houses the U.S. Embassy and \n     military command.\n       As Congress awakens to these realities--and a few members \n     have bravely pointed them out--will it act on them? Not \n     necessarily. Too many lawmakers have fallen for the myths \n     that are invoked to try to sell the president's new war aims. \n     Let us consider the most pernicious of them.\n       (1) We must continue the war to prevent the terrible \n     aftermath that will occur if our forces are withdrawn soon. \n     Reflect on the double-think of this formulation. We are now \n     fighting to prevent what our invasion made inevitable! \n     Undoubtedly we will leave a mess--the mess we created, which \n     has become worse each year we have remained. Lawmakers \n     gravely proclaim their opposition to the war, but in the next \n     breath express fear that quitting it will leave a blood bath, \n     a civil war, a terrorist haven, a ``failed state,'' or some \n     other horror. But this ``aftermath'' is already upon us; a \n     prolonged U.S. occupation cannot prevent what already exists.\n       (2) We must continue the war to prevent Iran's influence \n     from growing in Iraq. This is another absurd notion. One of \n     the president's initial war aims, the creation of a democracy \n     in Iraq, ensured increased Iranian influence, both in Iraq \n     and the region. Electoral democracy, predictably, would put \n     Shiite groups in power--groups supported by Iran since Saddam \n     Hussein repressed them in 1991. Why are so many members of \n     Congress swallowing the claim that prolonging the war is now \n     supposed to prevent precisely what starting the war \n     inexorably and predictably caused? Fear that Congress will \n     confront this contradiction helps explain the administration \n     and neocon drumbeat we now hear for expanding the war to \n     Iran.\n       Here we see shades of the Nixon-Kissinger strategy in \n     Vietnam: widen the war into Cambodia and Laos. Only this \n     time, the adverse consequences would be far greater. Iran's \n     ability to hurt U.S. forces in Iraq are not trivial. And the \n     anti-American backlash in the region would be larger, and \n     have more lasting consequences.\n       (3) We must prevent the emergence of a new haven for al-\n     Qaeda in Iraq. But it was the U.S. invasion that opened \n     Iraq's doors to al-Qaeda. The longer U.S. forces have \n     remained there, the stronger al-Qaeda has become. Yet its \n     strength within the Kurdish\n\n[[Page S1901]]\n\n     and Shiite areas is trivial. After a U.S. withdrawal, it will \n     probably play a continuing role in helping the Sunni groups \n     against the Shiites and the Kurds. Whether such foreign \n     elements could remain or thrive in Iraq after the resolution \n     of civil war is open to question. Meanwhile, continuing the \n     war will not push al-Qaeda outside Iraq. On the contrary, the \n     American presence is the glue that holds al-Qaeda there now.\n       (4) We must continue to fight in order to ``support the \n     troops.'' This argument effectively paralyzes almost all \n     members of Congress. Lawmakers proclaim in grave tones a \n     litany of problems in Iraq sufficient to justify a rapid \n     pullout. Then they reject that logical conclusion, insisting \n     we cannot do so because we must support the troops. Has \n     anybody asked the troops?\n       During their first tours, most may well have favored \n     ``staying the course''--whatever that meant to them--but now \n     in their second, third and fourth tours, many are changing \n     their minds. We see evidence of that in the many news stories \n     about unhappy troops being sent back to Iraq. Veterans groups \n     are beginning to make public the case for bringing them home. \n     Soldiers and officers in Iraq are speaking out critically to \n     reporters on the ground.\n       But the strangest aspect of this rationale for continuing \n     the war is the implication that the troops are somehow \n     responsible for deciding to continue the president's course. \n     That political and moral responsibility belongs to the \n     president, not the troops. Did not President Harry S. Truman \n     make it clear that ``the buck stops'' in the Oval Office? If \n     the president keeps dodging it, where does it stop? With \n     Congress?\n       Embracing the four myths gives Congress excuses not to \n     exercise its power of the purse to end the war and open the \n     way for a strategy that might actually bear fruit.\n       The first and most critical step is to recognize that \n     fighting on now simply prolongs our losses and blocks the way \n     to a new strategy. Getting out of Iraq is the pre-condition \n     for creating new strategic options. Withdrawal will take away \n     the conditions that allow our enemies in the region to enjoy \n     our pain. It will awaken those European states reluctant to \n     collaborate with us in Iraq and the region.\n       Second, we must recognize that the United States alone \n     cannot stabilize the Middle East.\n       Third, we must acknowledge that most of our policies are \n     actually destabilizing the region. Spreading democracy, using \n     sticks to try to prevent nuclear proliferation, threatening \n     ``regime change,'' using the hysterical rhetoric of the \n     ``global war on terrorism''--all undermine the stability we \n     so desperately need in the Middle East.\n       Fourth, we must redefine our purpose. It must be a stable \n     region, not primarily a democratic Iraq. We must redirect our \n     military operations so they enhance rather than undermine \n     stability. We can write off the war as a ``tactical draw'' \n     and make ``regional stability'' our measure of ``victory.'' \n     That single step would dramatically realign the opposing \n     forces in the region, where most states want stability. Even \n     many in the angry mobs of young Arabs shouting profanities \n     against the United States want predictable order, albeit on \n     better social and economic terms than they now have.\n       Realigning our diplomacy and military capabilities to \n     achieve order will hugely reduce the numbers of our enemies \n     and gain us new and important allies. This cannot happen, \n     however, until our forces are moving out of Iraq. Why should \n     Iran negotiate to relieve our pain as long as we are \n     increasing its influence in Iraq and beyond? Withdrawal will \n     awaken most leaders in the region to their own need for U.S.-\n     led diplomacy to stabilize their neighborhood.\n       If Bush truly wanted to rescue something of his historical \n     legacy, he would seize the initiative to implement this kind \n     of strategy. He would eventually be held up as a leader \n     capable of reversing direction by turning an imminent, tragic \n     defeat into strategic recovery.\n       If he stays on his present course, he will leave Congress \n     the opportunity to earn the credit for such a turnaround. It \n     is already too late to wait for some presidential candidate \n     for 2008 to retrieve the situation. If Congress cannot act, \n     it, too, will live in infamy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/13/senate-section/article/S1901-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   IN RECOGNITION OF SEHNERT'S BAKERY\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to \ncongratulate a very special place in my hometown of McCook, NE. It is a \nplace which exemplifies the thousands of family-owned small businesses \nlining the main streets of every small town in America, businesses \nwhich are the driving force in keeping those towns economically viable.\n  This year marks the 50th anniversary of Sehnert's Bakery in McCook, \nNE. It was in 1957 when Walt and Jean Sehnert, the grandchildren of \nimmigrants who came to America 110 years ago, bought the bakery as a \nplace to work hard, earn a decent living, and raise a family.\n  Today, their son Matt Sehnert and his wife Shelly carry on the \ntradition by providing the people of McCook with some of the most \ndelicious pastries on the planet. Matt and Shelly credit a dedicated \nand hard-working crew, who also take pride in Sehnert's longstanding \ntradition.\n  As many small businesses do in order to survive in a competitive \nenvironment, Matt and Shelly have modernized Sehnert's Bakery and \nexpanded it to include a catering service and cafe, where I often meet \nwith constituents during visits home.\n  My memories of Sehnert's go back to when I was a teenager in McCook \nand was able to get a job there, working early Saturday mornings. I \nlearned a lot about how to make piecrusts and decorate cakes. I also \nlearned that it is easy to overdose on glazed donuts when you work in a \nbakery Walt Sehnert can still recall my first day on the job.\n  My fellow colleagues, if you ever have the pleasure of visiting my \nhometown of McCook, NE, I urge you to drop by Sehnert's Bakery and \nenjoy some of their mouth-watering donuts, or maybe some pies or \nperhaps one of their famous ``Jiffy Burgers,'' whose recipe remains a \nclosely guarded secret in McCook.\n  Sehnert's Bakery and Bieroc Cafe Catering Service is located at 312 \nNorris Avenue. That is Norris, as in George Norris, who very capably \nserved Nebraska in the U.S. Senate from 1913 to 1943. Yes, McCook has \nproduced two U.S. Senators, as well as three of Nebraska's Governors. \nNot bad for a town with a population of just 8,000 people; but of \ncourse, that is why the Sehnerts and I are proud to call it \nhome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/13/senate-section/article/S1901-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:57 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of it reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 34.

A bill to amend the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to require \na voter-verified permanent paper ballot under title III of such Act, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nVoting Integrity and Verification Act, VIVA, of 2007. The time has come \nto ensure that the vote of each American is counted and counted as they \nintended. VIVA will get us closer to that goal by mandating the use of \nvoter-\n\n[[Page S1904]]\n\nverified paper ballots in any election with Federal candidates.\n  It was President Johnson who helped Black Americans win the right to \nvote, who said, ``The vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised \nby man . . .'' Indeed, it is the ability of a nation, like ours, to \nhold free and fair elections, which guarantees our government is based \non consent of the governed; and, majority rule with minority rights.\n  It is the guarantee of a ballot that cools the impassioned hearts of \nmany in the electorate, even when a majority of citizens disagree with \ntheir government over a war, court decision, or action by lawmakers or \nthe executive branch.\n  For any democracy to long withstand these external and internal \nconflicts, it is vital that the governed have unwavering faith that \ntheir votes will be counted. Ever since the 2000 Presidential recount \nin Florida and, more recently, the disputed congressional election in \nSarasota, an increasingly high number of Americans have come to lack \nconfidence in the way our States record, tally, and verify votes.\n  If this Congress doesn't act to restore voter confidence, I fear our \ndemocracy--in the words of philosopher and educator Robert Maynard \nHutchins--could suffer ``a slow extinction from apathy, indifference \nand undernourishment.''\n  VIVA authorizes $300 million in Federal funding to assist in the \nimplementation of the requirements in this bill. This bill establishes \nmandatory security requirements for voting systems used in Federal \nelections. It also will provide for routine, random audits of paper \nballots and make it illegal for a chief State election administration \nofficial to take an active part in a political campaign.\n  With another Presidential election on the horizon, we need to fix \nthis--and fix it now. Let us never have another election after which \ncitizens are left to doubt its legitimacy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SALAZAR (for himself, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Isakson, and Mr. \n        Pryor):\n  S. 560. A bill to create a Rural Policing Institute as part of the \nFederal Law Enforcement Training Center; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I have often referred to our rural \ncommunities as ``the forgotten America.'' Indeed, rural America is the \nbackbone of our country--but is too often neglected by policymakers and \npoliticians who have lost touch with people in the heartland. Nowhere \nis this neglect felt more acutely than in small-town law enforcement \nagencies--which have been confronted with decreased funding, increased \nhomeland security responsibilities, and the great toll of a meth \nepidemic that is devastating rural America.\n  Many people do not realize that most American law enforcement \nagencies serve rural communities or small towns. Indeed, of the nearly \n17,000 police agencies in the United States, 90 percent serve a \npopulation of under 25,000 and operate with fewer than 50 sworn \nofficers.\n  I am well aware of the difficulties small town law enforcement \nagencies face day-in, day-out. When I was the attorney general of \nColorado, I had the honor to work with some of America's finest law \nenforcement officials--many of them from rural Colorado. Men like Jerry \nMartin, the Dolores County Sherriff, who have consistently been able to \ndo more with less. But the pressure they face is great.\n  The growing demands on rural law enforcement, and shrinking budgets, \nhave hit training programs particularly hard. Many rural law \nenforcement agencies simply do not have the budget to provide officers \nwith adequate training. Furthermore, even those agencies that can come \nup with the money simply can't afford to take their police officers off \nthe beat long enough to get additional training.\n  That is where the Rural Policing Institute comes in. FLETC does a \nfantastic job training Federal, State, and local law enforcement \nofficials. But FLETC does not have enough resources dedicated \nspecifically toward training rural law enforcement officials. So the \nRural Policing Institute would: evaluate the needs of rural and tribal \nlaw enforcement agencies; develop training programs designed to address \nthe needs of rural law enforcement agencies, with a focus on combating \nmeth, domestic violence, and school violence; export those training \nprograms to rural and tribal law enforcement agencies; and conduct \noutreach to ensure that the training programs reach rural law \nenforcement agencies.\n  As Colorado's attorney general, I learned that a small investment in \nlaw enforcement training can pay great dividends. This legislation \nwould do just that--by ensuring that our rural and small town law \nenforcement officers have the training they need to protect their \ncommunities.\n  I am proud of my roots in rural southern Colorado. Communities like \nmine are the heart of our Nation--and the men and women who protect \nthem deserve the best possible training.\n  I thank Senators Chambliss, Isakson, and Pryor for cosponsoring this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BUNNING (for himself, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. \n        Brownback, Mr. Burr, Mr. Craig, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Domenici, Mr. \n        Hatch, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Smith, Mr. \n        Vitter, and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 561. A bill to repeal the sunset of the Economic Growth and Tax \nRelief Reconciliation Act of 2001 with respect to the expansion of the \nadoption credit and adoption assistance programs; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the American \nfamily and the need to extend important tax relief provisions to help \nmake adoption more affordable. The high cost of adoptions causes many \ncouples to dismiss adoption as too expensive. By helping to ease this \nfinancial burden, we can encourage the development of more stable \nfamilies and provide a brighter future for thousands of children.\n  These important goals prompted us to act in 2001, when we passed \nimportant adoption incentives in the form of tax credits. However, \nthese provisions are set to expire or ``sunset'' after December 31, \n2010.\n  Our entire society benefits when children are placed with loving, \npermanent families. That is why today I am introducing the Adoption Tax \nRelief Guarantee Act with Senator Ben Nelson.\n  The Adoption Tax Relief Guarantee Act will permanently extend the \n2001 adoption incentives allowing those Americans who adopt a child to \ncontinue to receive a credit in the amount of their qualified expenses \nand guarantees the maximum $10,000 credit for those who adopt children \nwith special needs. This legislation will help middle class families \nbreak the financial barriers and successfully adopt a child, especially \nthose children with special needs who are in particular need of a \nloving home.\n  I am pleased that Senators from both sides of the aisle have \ncosponsored this legislation, and that it has received endorsement from \nthe National Council for Adoption and RESOLVE: the National Infertility \nAssociation. The adoption tax credit and assistance programs have \nalready helped countless children and families by making adoption more \naffordable. We owe it to future generations of children in need to make \nthese provisions permanent.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Adoption Tax Relief \nGuarantee Act, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 561\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as ``The Adoption Tax Relief \n     Guarantee Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REPEAL OF APPLICABILITY OF SUNSET OF THE ECONOMIC \n                   GROWTH AND TAX RELIEF RECONCILIATION ACT OF \n                   2001 WITH RESPECT TO ADOPTION CREDIT AND \n                   ADOPTION ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS.\n\n       Section 901 of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief \n     Reconciliation Act of 2001 is amended by adding at the end \n     the following new subsection:\n       ``(c) Exception.--Subsection (a) shall not apply to the \n     amendments made by section 202 (relating to expansion of \n     adoption credit and adoption assistance programs).''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS:\n  S. 562. A bill to provide for flexibility and improvements in \nelementary and\n\n[[Page S1905]]\n\nsecondary education, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the No Child \nLeft Behind Flexibility and Improvements Act. I am pleased to be joined \nin this effort by my colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe. Our \nlegislation would give greater local control and flexibility to Maine \nand other States in their efforts to implement the No Child Left Behind \nAct, NCLB, and provides common sense reforms in keeping with the worthy \ngoals of NCLB.\n  Since NCLB was enacted in 2002, I have had the opportunity to meet \nwith numerous Maine educators to discuss their concerns with the law. \nIn response to their concerns, in March 2004, Senator Snowe and I \ncommissioned the Maine NCLB Task Force to examine the implementation \nissues facing Maine under both NCLB and the Maine Learning Results. Our \ntask force included members from every county in the State and had \nsuperintendents, teachers, principals, school board members, parents, \nbusiness leaders, former State legislators, special education experts, \nassessment specialists, officials from the Maine Department of \nEducation, a former Maine Commissioner of Education, and the Dean from \nthe University of Maine's College of Education and Human Development.\n  After a year of study, the Task Force presented us with its final \nreport outlining recommendations for possible statutory and regulatory \nchanges to the Act. These recommendations form the basis of the \nlegislation that we are introducing today.\n  First, our legislation would provide new flexibility for teachers of \nmultiple subjects at the secondary school level to help them meet the \n``highly qualified teacher'' requirements. Unfortunately, the current \nregulations place undue burdens on teachers at small and rural schools \nwho often teach multiple subjects due to staffing needs, and on special \neducation teachers who work with students on a variety of subjects \nthroughout the day. Under the bill, provided these teachers are highly \nqualified for one subject they teach, they will be provided additional \ntime and less burdensome avenues to satisfy the remaining requirements.\n\n  Second, our legislation would provide greater flexibility to States \nin the ways that they demonstrate student progress in meeting State \neducation standards. Specifically, it would permit States to use a \ncohort growth model, which tracks the progress of the same group of \nstudents over time. It would also permit the use of an ``indexing'' \nmodel, where progress is measured based on the number of students whose \nscores improve from, for example, a ``below-basic'' to a ``basic'' \nlevel, and not simply on the number of students who cross the \n``proficient'' line.\n  Third, our legislation would provide schools with better notice \nregarding possible performance issues, allowing schools a chance to \nidentify and work with a particular group of students before being \nidentified. It would expand the existing ``safe-harbor'' provisions to \nallow more schools to qualify for this important protection. The \nchanges made in our bill are in keeping with what assessment experts \nand teachers know--that significant gains in academic achievement tend \nto occur gradually and over time.\n  Fourth, our legislation would allow the members of a special \neducation student's IEP team to determine the best assessment for that \nindividual student, and would permit the student's performance on that \nassessment to count for all NCLB purposes.\n  One reason this change is so important for Maine is that we have \nsmall student populations and Maine has chosen a very small subgroup \nsize--only 20 students. I was very concerned to hear reports that in \nsome schools, special education students fear that they are being \nblamed for their school not making adequate yearly progress. While the \nstatute explicitly prohibits the disaggregation of student data if it \nwould jeopardize student privacy, I am concerned to hear that this is \nnot working out in practice.\n  This legislative change is also based on principles of fairness and \ncommon sense. Many times, it simply does not make sense to require a \nspecial needs student to take a grade-level assessment that everyone \nknows he or she is not ready to take. Many special education students \nare referred for special education services precisely because they \ncannot meet grade-level expectations. Allowing the IEP team to \ndetermine the best test for each special student will bring an \nimportant improvement to the Act.\n  Fifth, the legislation addresses my concern about the statute's \ncurrent requirement that all schools reach 100 percent proficiency by \n2013-2014. Our bill would require the Secretary of Education to review \nprogress by the States toward meeting this goal every 3 years, and \nwould allow her to modify the timeline as necessary.\n  Our legislation is a comprehensive effort to provide greater \nflexibility and commonsense modifications to address the key NCLB \nchallenges facing Maine, and other States. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues on these issues during the upcoming NCLB \nreauthorization process.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS:\n  S. 563. A bill to extend the deadline by which State identification \ndocuments shall comply with certain minimum standards and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \naddress the growing concern among States regarding the Real ID Act of \n2005, which requires States to meet minimum security standards before \ncitizens can use drivers' licenses for Federal purposes. As the \ndeadline for compliance with Real ID rapidly approaches, States are \nbeginning to send a very clear message that they are deeply concerned \nthat they will not be able to meet these standards. The bill I \nintroduce today recognizes those concerns by giving everyone more time \nto devise a way to make drivers' licenses more secure without unduly \nburdening State governments and without threatening privacy and civil \nliberties.\n  To begin, some background may be useful. The 9/11 Commission, finding \nthat all but one of the 9/11 hijackers had acquired some form of U.S. \nidentification, recommended that the Federal Government should set \nstandards for the issuance of drivers' licenses. Taking up that \nrecommendation I worked with a bipartisan group of Senators, especially \nSenator Lieberman, to craft a provision in the 2004 Intelligence Reform \nand Terrorism Prevention Act that would accomplish this goal. This \nprovision called for the creation of a committee composed of experts \nfrom the Federal Government, from State governments, and from other \ninterested parties such as privacy and civil liberties advocates and \ninformation technology groups. This committee was charged with \ndeveloping a means of providing secure identification that protected \nprivacy and civil liberties and respected the role of States in issuing \nthese documents.\n  The committee diligently began meeting, but before it could complete \nits work, the House of Representatives attached the Real ID Act of 2005 \nto an emergency war supplemental bill, thus halting this productive \neffort. Unlike our intelligence reform bill, the Real ID Act of 2005 \ndid not include States and other interested parties in the rulemaking \nprocess and instead instructed the Department of Homeland Security to \nsimply write its own regulations. Nearly 2 years later, we still have \nnot seen these regulations in spite of a looming May 2008 deadline for \nStates to be in compliance with the Real ID Act.\n  As States begin work this year on their 2008 budgets, they still have \nno idea what the regulations will require of them. They do know, from a \nstudy released in 2006 by the National Governors Association, that the \ncost to States to implement Real ID could total more than $11 billion \nover the first 5 years. As a result, many States--my home State of \nMaine included--have passed resolutions that have sent the message to \nWashington that they cannot and will not implement Real ID by the May \n2008 deadline.\n  My bill has two primary objectives: 1. It gives us the time and \nflexibility we need to come up with an effective system to provide \nsecure drivers' licenses; and 2. it gets the experts from the States \nand from the technology industry and from the privacy and civil \nliberties advocates back at the table and gives them a chance to make \nthese regulations work.\n\n[[Page S1906]]\n\n  There are three main provisions in this bill: First, the bill \nprovides that States will not have to be Real ID compliant until 2 \nyears after the final regulations are promulgated. This means that no \nmatter how long it takes the Department of Homeland Security to finish \nthese regulations, States will have a full 2 years to implement them. \nMost likely that will mean an extension from 2008 to 2010.\n  Second, the bill gives the Secretary of Homeland Security more \nflexibility to waive certain requirements of Real ID if an aspect of \nthe program proves technically difficult to implement. Under the \ncurrent law, the Secretary of Homeland Security has the discretion to \nwaive the requirements for Real ID on a State-by-State basis if the \nState cannot comply for justifiable reasons. Because it is possible \nthat some of the technological advances necessary for Real ID may not \nbe in place when compliance is required, the bill will provide the \nSecretary specific authority to waive compliance with specific \nrequirements if these technological systems are not up and running--\nrelieving the States from the burden of seeking exemptions from Real ID \nfor technological reasons not within their control.\n  Third, it reconstitutes the committee that we created in 2004 and \nthat was making good progress in its discussions. The committee would \nbe required to look at the regulations published by the Department of \nHomeland Security and to make suggestions for modifications to meet the \nconcerns of States, privacy advocates, and the other interested \nparties. The committee would report these suggestions to the Department \nof Homeland Security and to Congress. The Department of Homeland \nSecurity would either have to make these modifications or explain why \nit chose not to do so. In addition, the committee could recommend to \nCongress statutory changes that would mitigate concerns that could not \nbe addressed by modifications to the regulations.\n  This bill gives us the time and the information that Congress and the \nDepartment of Homeland Security need to better implement the \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission in order to make our drivers' \nlicenses secure so that they cannot be used again as a part of a plot \nto attack our country. This bill does this in a way that does not \nrewind the clock three years but instead keeps us moving forward to a \nmore secure America.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to address Real ID and to put us back on track in protecting our \nprivacy, protecting our liberty, and protecting our country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 564. A bill to modernize water resources planning, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I introduce the Water Resources \nPlanning and Modernization Act of 2007. I am pleased to be joined in \nintroducing this legislation by the senior Senator from Arizona, Mr. \nMcCain. We have worked together for some time to modernize the U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers and I thank Senator McCain for his continued \ncommitment to this issue.\n  I was pleased that the Senate made significant progress last Congress \nand included many key reforms in the Senate-passed Water Resources \nDevelopment Act. I again thank my colleagues who cosponsored a \nsuccessful independent peer review amendment: the Senator from \nDelaware, Mr. Carper; the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman; the \nformer Senator from Vermont, Mr. Jeffords; and the Senators from Maine, \nMs. Collins and Ms. Snowe. I also want to acknowledge the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Boxer, for her support for this amendment. In \naddition, I appreciate the efforts to include reform provisions in the \nunderlying bill by the then-Environment and Public Works Committee \nChairs and Ranking Members: the former Senator from Vermont, Mr. \nJeffords; the Senator from Montana, Mr. Baucus; the Senator from \nOklahoma, Mr. Inhofe; and the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Bond. After \nsix years of efforts on this issue, we made significant progress. \nHowever, negotiations between the House and Senate stalled and no \nconference report was agreed to.\n  By introducing this bill today, I am renewing my efforts to ensure \nthat the Corps of Engineers' water resources planning is brought into \nthe 21st century. As we all know, Hurricane Katrina produced one of the \nmost tragic and costly natural disasters in our Nation's history. Water \nresources projects authorized by Congress and planned by the Corps of \nEngineers contributed to the loss of vital coastal wetlands (which can \nprovide natural buffers from storm surge), intensified the storm surge \ninto New Orleans, and encouraged development in flood-prone areas.\n  The flawed project planning, however, did not end there. Floodwalls \nand levees that the Corps built to protect New Orleans failed \ncatastrophically during Hurricane Katrina. It is now well recognized \nand indeed, the Corps has acknowledged--that flawed engineering and \nconstruction led to those failures and the flooding of much of New \nOrleans.\n  Over the past decade, dozens of governmental and scientific studies \nhave documented other flaws in Corps of Engineers' project planning. \nMost recently, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) testified \nthat recent Corps studies ``did not provide a reasonable basis for \ndecision-making'' because they were ``were fraught with errors, \nmistakes, and miscalculations, and used invalid assumptions and \noutdated data.'' The GAO found that the recurring problems at the \nagency were ``systemic in nature and therefore prevalent throughout the \nCorps' Civil Works portfolio.''\n  We can, and must, do better.\n  Congress should not authorize additional Army Corps projects until it \nhas considered and passed the reforms included in the Water Resources \nPlanning and Modernization Act. From ensuring large projects are sound \nto using natural resources to protect our communities, modernizing \nwater resources policy is a national priority.\n  The Water Resources Planning and Modernization Act of 2007 represents \na sensible effort to increase our environmental stewardship and \nsignificantly reduce the government waste inherent in poorly designed \nor low priority U.S. Army Corps of Engineers projects. It represents a \nway to both protect the environment and save taxpayer dollars. With \nsupport from Taxpayers for Common Sense Action, National Taxpayers \nUnion, Council for Citizens Against Government Waste, American Rivers, \nAssociation of State Wetland Managers, Defenders of Wildlife, \nEarthjustice, Environmental Defense, Friends of the Earth, National \nWildlife Federation, Republicans for Environmental Protection, Sierra \nClub, Surfrider Foundation, and the World Wildlife Fund, the bill has \nthe backing of a committed and diverse coalition.\n  The Water Resources Planning and Modernization Act of 2007 can be \nbroadly divided into five parts: ensuring sound projects and \nresponsible spending, valuing our natural resources, focusing our \nresources, identifying vulnerabilities, and updating the Army Corps of \nEngineer's planning guidelines.\n  To ensure that Corps water resources projects are sound, the bill \nrequires independent review of those projects estimated to cost over \n$40 million, those requested by a Governor of an affected state, those \nwhich the head of a federal agency has determined may lead to a \nsignificant adverse impact, or those that the Secretary of the Army has \nfound to be controversial. As crafted in the bill, independent review \nshould not increase the length of time required for project planning \nbut would protect the public--both those in the vicinity of massive \nprojects and those whose tax dollars are funding projects. The Director \nof Independent Review can also require independent review of the \ntechnical designs and construction of flood damage reduction projects \nto ensure public safety and welfare. The independent review provision \nis identical to that supported by a majority of my colleagues last \nCongress and included in the Senate-passed WRDA.\n  We must do a better job of valuing our natural resources, such as \nwetlands, that provide important services. These resources can help \nbuffer communities from storms, filter contaminants out of our water, \nsupport vibrant economies, and provide vital fish and wildlife habitat. \nRecognizing the role\n\n[[Page S1907]]\n\nof these natural systems, the Water Resources Planning and \nModernization Act of 2007 brings the Corps' 1986 mitigation standards \ninto line with their regulatory program by requiring Corps water \nresources projects to meet the same mitigation standard that is \nrequired of all private citizens and other entities under the Clean \nWater Act. Where States have adopted stronger mitigation standards, the \nCorps must meet those standards. I feel very strongly that the Federal \ngovernment should be able to live up to this requirement. \nUnfortunately, all too often, the Corps has not completed required \nmitigation. This legislation will make sure that mitigation is \ncompleted, that the true costs of mitigation are accounted for in Corps \nprojects, and that the public is able to track the progress of \nmitigation projects.\n  Our current prioritization process is not serving the public good. To \naddress this problem, the bill reinvigorates the Water Resources \nCouncil, originally established in 1965, and charges it with providing \nCongress a prioritized list of authorized water resource projects \nwithin one year of enactment and then every two years following. The \nprioritized list would also be printed in the Federal Register for the \npublic to see. The Water Resources Council described in the bill, \ncomprised of cabinet-level officials, would bring together varied \nperspectives to shape a list of national needs. In short, the \nprioritization process would be improved to make sure Congress has the \ntools to more wisely invest limited resources while also increasing \npublic transparency in decision making--both needed and reasonable \nimprovements to the status quo.\n  Taking stock of our vulnerabilities to natural disasters must also be \na priority. For this reason, the bill also directs the Water Resources \nCouncil to identify and report to Congress on the nation's \nvulnerability to flood and related storm damage, including the risk to \nhuman life and property, and relative risks to different regions of the \ncountry. The Water Resources Council would also recommend improvements \nto the nation's various flood damage reduction programs to better \naddress those risks. Many of these improvements were discussed in a \ngovernment report following the 1993 floods so the building blocks are \navailable; we just need to update the assessment. Then, of course, we \nmust actually take action based on the assessment. To help speed such \naction, the legislation specifies that the Administration will submit a \nresponse to Congress, including legislative proposals to implement the \nrecommendations, on the Water Resources Council report no later than 90 \ndays after the report has been made public. We cannot afford to have \nthis report, which will outline improvements to our flood damage \nreduction programs, languish like others before it.\n  The process by which the Army Corps of Engineers analyzes water \nprojects should undergo periodic revision. Unfortunately, the Corps' \nprinciples and guidelines, which bind the planning process, have not \nbeen updated since 1983. This is why the bill requires that the Water \nResources Council work in coordination with the National Academy of \nSciences to propose periodic revisions to the Corps' planning \nprinciples and guidelines, regulations, and circulars. Updating the \nproject planning process should involve consideration of a variety of \nissues, including the use of modern economic analysis and the same \ndiscount rates as used by all other Federal agencies. Simple steps such \nas these will lead to more precise estimates of project costs and \nbenefits, a first step to considering whether a project should move \nforward.\n  Modernizing all aspects of our water resources policy will help \nrestore credibility to a Federal agency historically rocked by scandal \nand currently plagued by public skepticism. Congress has long used the \nArmy Corps of Engineers to facilitate favored pork-barrel projects, \nwhile periodically expressing a desire to change its ways. Back in \n1836, a House Ways and Means Committee report referred to Congress \nensuring that the Corps sought ``actual reform, in the further \nprosecution of public works.'' Over 150 years later, the need for \nactual reform is stronger than ever.\n  My office has strong working relationships with the Detroit, Rock \nIsland, and St. Paul District Offices that service Wisconsin, and I do \nnot want this bill to be misconstrued as reflecting on the work of \nthose district offices. What I do want is the fiscal and management \ncloud over the entire Army Corps to dissipate so that the Corps can \nbetter contribute to our environment and our economy--without wasting \ntaxpayer dollars or endangering public safety.\n  I wish the changes we are proposing today were not needed, but \nunfortunately that is not the case. In fact, if there were ever a need \nfor the bill, it is now. We must make sure that future Corps projects \nproduce predicted benefits, are in furtherance of national priorities, \nand do not have negative environmental impacts. This bill gives the \nCorps the tools it needs to do a better job and focuses the attention \nof Congress on national needs, which is what the American taxpayers and \nthe environment deserve.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 564\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Water Resources Planning and \n     Modernization Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Council.--The term ``Council'' means the Water \n     Resources Council established under section 101 of the Water \n     Resources Planning Act (42 U.S.C. 1962a).\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Army.\n\n     SEC. 3. NATIONAL WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MODERNIZATION \n                   POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States that all water \n     resources projects carried out by the Corps of Engineers \n     shall--\n       (1) reflect national priorities for flood damage reduction, \n     navigation, and ecosystem restoration; and\n       (2) seek to avoid the unwise use of floodplains, minimize \n     vulnerabilities in any case in which a floodplain must be \n     used, protect and restore the extent and functions of natural \n     systems, and mitigate any unavoidable damage to natural \n     systems.\n\n     SEC. 4. MEETING THE NATION'S WATER RESOURCE PRIORITIES.\n\n       (a) Report on the Nation's Flood Risks.--Not later than 18 \n     months after the date of enactment of this Act, the Council \n     shall submit to the President and Congress a report \n     describing the vulnerability of the United States to damage \n     from flooding and related storm damage, including the risk to \n     human life, the risk to property, and the comparative risks \n     faced by different regions of the country. The report shall \n     assess the extent to which the Nation's programs relating to \n     flooding are addressing flood risk reduction priorities and \n     the extent to which those programs may unintentionally be \n     encouraging development and economic activity in floodprone \n     areas, and shall provide recommendations for improving those \n     programs in reducing and responding to flood risks. Not later \n     than 90 days after the report required by this subsection is \n     published in the Federal Register, the Administration shall \n     submit to Congress a report that responds to the \n     recommendations of the Council and includes proposals to \n     implement recommendations of the Council.\n       (b) Prioritization of Water Resources Projects.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Council shall submit to Congress \n     an initial report containing a prioritized list of each water \n     resources project of the Corps of Engineers that is not being \n     carried out under a continuing authorities program, \n     categorized by project type and recommendations with respect \n     to a process to compare all water resources projects across \n     project type. The Council shall submit to Congress a \n     prioritized list of water resources projects of the Corps of \n     Engineers every 2 years following submission of the initial \n     report. In preparing the prioritization of projects, the \n     Council shall endeavor to balance stability in the rankings \n     from year to year with recognizing newly authorized projects. \n     Each report prepared under this paragraph shall provide \n     documentation and description of any criteria used in \n     addition to those set forth in paragraph (2) for comparing \n     water resources projects and the assumptions upon which those \n     criteria are based.\n       (2) Project prioritization criteria.--In preparing a report \n     under paragraph (1), the Council shall prioritize each water \n     resource project of the Corps of Engineers based on the \n     extent to which the project meets at least the following \n     criteria:\n       (A) For flood damage reduction projects, the extent to \n     which such a project--\n       (i) addresses the most critical flood damage reduction \n     needs of the United States as identified by the Council;\n       (ii) does not encourage new development or intensified \n     economic activity in flood prone areas and avoids adverse \n     environmental impacts; and\n\n[[Page S1908]]\n\n       (iii) provides significantly increased benefits to the \n     United States through the protection of human life, property, \n     economic activity, or ecosystem services.\n       (B) For navigation projects, the extent to which such a \n     project--\n       (i) produces a net economic benefit to the United States \n     based on a high level of certainty that any projected trends \n     upon which the project is based will be realized;\n       (ii) addresses priority navigation needs of the United \n     States identified through comprehensive, regional port \n     planning; and\n       (iii) minimizes adverse environmental impacts.\n       (C) For environmental restoration projects, the extent to \n     which such a project--\n       (i) restores the natural hydrologic processes and spatial \n     extent of an aquatic habitat;\n       (ii) is self-sustaining; and\n       (iii) is cost-effective or produces economic benefits.\n       (3) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that to \n     promote effective prioritization of water resources projects, \n     no project should be authorized for construction unless a \n     final Chief's report recommending construction has been \n     submitted to Congress, and annual appropriations for the \n     Corps of Engineers' Continuing Authorities Programs should be \n     distributed by the Corps of Engineers to those projects with \n     the highest degree of design merit and the greatest degree of \n     need, consistent with the applicable criteria established \n     under paragraph (2).\n       (c) Modernizing Water Resources Planning Guidelines.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 2 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and every 5 years thereafter, the \n     Council, in coordination with the National Academy of \n     Sciences, shall propose revisions to the planning principles \n     and guidelines, regulations, and circulars of the Corps of \n     Engineers to improve the process by which the Corps of \n     Engineers analyzes and evaluates water projects.\n       (2) Public participation.--The Council shall solicit public \n     and expert comment and testimony regarding proposed revisions \n     and shall subject proposed revisions to public notice and \n     comment.\n       (3) Revisions.--Revisions proposed by the Council shall \n     improve water resources project planning through, among other \n     things--\n       (A) focusing Federal dollars on the highest water resources \n     priorities of the United States;\n       (B) requiring the use of modern economic principles and \n     analytical techniques, credible schedules for project \n     construction, and current discount rates as used by all other \n     Federal agencies;\n       (C) discouraging any project that induces new development \n     or intensified economic activity in flood prone areas, and \n     eliminating biases and disincentives to providing projects to \n     low-income communities, including fully accounting for the \n     prevention of loss of life as required by section 904 of the \n     Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (33 U.S.C. 2281);\n       (D) eliminating biases and disincentives that discourage \n     the use of nonstructural approaches to water resources \n     development and management, and fully accounting for the \n     flood protection and other values of healthy natural systems;\n       (E) utilizing a comprehensive, regional approach to port \n     planning;\n       (F) promoting environmental restoration projects that \n     reestablish natural processes;\n       (G) analyzing and incorporating lessons learned from recent \n     studies of Corps of Engineers programs and recent disasters \n     such as Hurricane Katrina and the Great Midwest Flood of \n     1993; and\n       (H) ensuring the effective implementation of the National \n     Water Resources Planning and Modernization Policy established \n     by this Act.\n       (d) Revision of Planning Guidelines.--Not later than 180 \n     days after submission of the proposed revisions required by \n     subsection (b), the Secretary shall implement the \n     recommendations of the Council by incorporating the proposed \n     revisions into the planning principles and guidelines, \n     regulations, and circulars of the Corps of Engineers. These \n     revisions shall be subject to public notice and comment \n     pursuant to subchapter II of chapter 5, and chapter 7, of \n     title 5, United States Code (commonly known as the \n     ``Administrative Procedure Act''). Effective beginning on the \n     date on which the Secretary carries out the first revision \n     under this paragraph, the Corps of Engineers shall not be \n     subject to--\n       (1) subsections (a) and (b) of section 80 of the Water \n     Resources Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 1962d-17); and\n       (2) any provision of the guidelines entitled ``Economic and \n     Environmental Principles and Guidelines for Water and Related \n     Land Resources Implementation Studies'' and dated 1983, to \n     the extent that such a provision conflicts with a guideline \n     revised by the Secretary.\n       (e) Availability.--Each report prepared under this section \n     shall be published in the Federal Register and submitted to \n     the Committees on Environment and Public Works and \n     Appropriations of the Senate and the Committees on \n     Transportation and Infrastructure and Appropriations of the \n     House of Representatives.\n       (f) Water Resources Council.--Section 101 of the Water \n     Resources Planning Act (42 U.S.C. 1962a) is amended in the \n     first sentence by inserting ``the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security, the Chairperson of the Council on Environmental \n     Quality,'' after ``Secretary of Transportation,''.\n       (g) Funding.--In carrying out this section, the Council \n     shall use funds made available for the general operating \n     expenses of the Corps of Engineers.\n\n     SEC. 5. INDEPENDENT PEER REVIEW.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Construction activities.--The term ``construction \n     activities'' means development of detailed engineering and \n     design specifications during the preconstruction engineering \n     and design phase and the engineering and design phase of a \n     water resources project carried out by the Corps of \n     Engineers, and other activities carried out on a water \n     resources project prior to completion of the construction and \n     to turning the project over to the local cost-share partner.\n       (2) Project study.--The term ``project study'' means a \n     feasibility report, reevaluation report, or environmental \n     impact statement prepared by the Corps of Engineers.\n       (b) Director of Independent Peer Review.--The Secretary \n     shall appoint in the Office of the Secretary a Director of \n     Independent Review. The Director shall be selected from among \n     individuals who are distinguished experts in engineering, \n     hydrology, biology, economics, or another discipline related \n     to water resources management. The Secretary shall ensure, to \n     the maximum extent practicable, that the Director does not \n     have a financial, professional, or other conflict of interest \n     with projects subject to review. The Director of Independent \n     Review shall carry out the duties set forth in this section \n     and such other duties as the Secretary deems appropriate.\n       (c) Sound Project Planning.--\n       (1) Projects subject to planning review.--The Secretary \n     shall ensure that each project study for a water resources \n     project shall be reviewed by an independent panel of experts \n     established under this subsection if--\n       (A) the project has an estimated total cost of more than \n     $40,000,000, including mitigation costs;\n       (B) the Governor of a State in which the water resources \n     project is located in whole or in part, or the Governor of a \n     State within the drainage basin in which a water resources \n     project is located and that would be directly affected \n     economically or environmentally as a result of the project, \n     requests in writing to the Secretary the establishment of an \n     independent panel of experts for the project;\n       (C) the head of a Federal agency with authority to review \n     the project determines that the project is likely to have a \n     significant adverse impact on public safety, or on \n     environmental, fish and wildlife, historical, cultural, or \n     other resources under the jurisdiction of the agency, and \n     requests in writing to the Secretary the establishment of an \n     independent panel of experts for the project; or\n       (D) the Secretary determines on his or her own initiative, \n     or shall determine within 30 days of receipt of a written \n     request for a controversy determination by any party, that \n     the project is controversial because--\n       (i) there is a significant dispute regarding the size, \n     nature, potential safety risks, or effects of the project; or\n       (ii) there is a significant dispute regarding the economic, \n     or environmental costs or benefits of the project.\n       (2) Project planning review panels.--\n       (A) Project planning review panel membership.--For each \n     water resources project subject to review under this \n     subsection, the Director of Independent Review shall \n     establish a panel of independent experts that shall be \n     composed of not less than 5 nor more than 9 independent \n     experts (including at least 1 engineer, 1 hydrologist, 1 \n     biologist, and 1 economist) who represent a range of areas of \n     expertise.

A bill to expand and enhance postbaccalaureate opportunities \nat Hispanic-serving institutions, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the next \ngeneration of Hispanic Serving Institutions legislation. This \nlegislation is critical if we, as a nation, are going to continue to \ncompete in a global economy. Education is the key to building a strong \nand dynamic economy, and therefore, it is our obligation to ensure \nquality educational opportunities for all Americans. That is why I am \nintroducing, along with my colleague, Senator Hutchison, the Next \nGeneration Hispanic Serving Institutions Act of 2007. This legislation \nis supported by the Hispanic Associations of Colleges and Universities, \nand the Hispanic Education Coalition, a coalition of 25 organizations \ndedicated to improving educational opportunities for more than 40 \nmillion Hispanics living in the United States. I ask unanimous consent \nthat their letters of support appear in the text following this \nstatement. Senators Bill Nelson, Martinez, Clinton, Cornyn, Salazar, \nBoxer, and Feinstein have joined in this effort as cosponsors.\n  According to Census Bureau data, the Hispanic population in the \nUnited States grew by 25.7 million between 1970 and 2000, and continues \nto grow at a very brisk pace. The most recent Census data puts the \nHispanic population at over 40 million, representing approximately 14 \npercent of the U.S. population and making it the Nation's largest \nminority group. Estimates project that the Hispanic population will \ngrow by 25 million between 2000 and 2020. By the year 2050, 1 in 4 \nAmericans will be of Hispanic origin.\n  Currently, Hispanics make up about 13 percent of the U.S. labor \nforce. While the overall labor force is projected to slow down over the \nnext decades as an increasing number of workers reach retirement age, \nthe Hispanic labor force is expected to continue growing at a fast \npace. It will expand by nearly 10 million workers between now and 2020, \nthrough a combination of immigration and native-born youth reaching \nworking age.\n  Our Nation's economic and social success rests, in large part, on the \nlevel of skills and knowledge attained by our Hispanic population.\n  I was one of the authors and lead supporters of the original \nHispanic-Serving Institutions proposal when it was enacted as part of \nthe Higher Education Act in 1992 in order to increase educational \nopportunities for Hispanic students. Since then, Hispanic-Serving \nInstitutions (HSIs) have made significant strides in increasing the \nnumber of Hispanic students enrolling in and graduating from college. \nAlthough Hispanic-serving institutions account for only 5 percent of \nall institutions of higher education in the United States, HSIs enroll \nover half (51 percent) of all Hispanics pursuing higher education \ndegrees in the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.\n  While Hispanic high school graduates go on to college at higher rates \nthan they did even ten years ago, Hispanics still lag behind their non-\nHispanic peers in postsecondary school enrollment. In 2000, only 21.7 \npercent of all Hispanics ages 18 through 24 were enrolled in \npostsecondary degree-granting institutions in the United States.\n  We must take HSIs to the next level. While the percentage of \nHispanics attending college has increased significantly over the past \nfew years, Hispanics only earned 6 percent of all bachelor's degrees \nawarded, 4 percent of all master's degrees, and only 3 percent of all \ndoctorates. But the pace of bachelor's degrees or higher earned by \nHispanics is accelerating rapidly, according to the Department of \nEducation. Therefore, we must keep pace. We must increase the capacity \nof our institutions of higher education to serve the increasing number \nof Hispanic students.\n  The Next Generation HSI bill does just that. Simply, this legislation \nwill improve educational opportunities for Hispanic students by \nestablishing a competitive grant program to expand post-baccalaureate \ndegree opportunities at HSIs.\n  Current law only provides support for two-year and four-year Hispanic \nServing Institutions. This legislation will support graduate \nfellowships and support services for graduate students, facilities \nimprovement, faculty development, technology and distance education, \nand collaborative arrangements with other institutions. This \nlegislation will build capacity and establish a long overdue graduate \nprogram for HSIs.\n  Hispanic students now account for nearly 17 percent of the total \nkindergarten through grade 12 student population. Estimates project \nthat this student population will grow from 11 million in 2005 to 16 \nmillion in 2020. We must provide our institutions of higher education \nwith the resources and supports to build capacity and serve the \nincreasing Hispanic student population. We must be ready for the next \ngeneration of students to meet the demands of a competitive workforce \nand to fully participate in the global economy. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                         HACU,\n\n                                San Antonio, TX, February 8, 2007.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: On behalf of the Hispanic \n     Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) and its 450 \n     member institutions, I want to express my sincerest \n     appreciation for your efforts in re-introducing the ``Next \n     Generation Hispanic-Serving Institutions Act.'' You have long \n     been a champion of Hispanic higher education issues and we \n     appreciate all that you do.\n       This landmark piece of legislation, first introduced in the \n     108th Congress with bipartisan support, will help to \n     eradicate the chronic shortage of Hispanic professionals \n     lacking advanced degrees. As we both know, the number of \n     Hispanics earning post-baccalaureate degrees at HSIs between \n     the years of 1991 and 2000 increased by 136 percent, thus \n     showing the demand and need to increase graduate program \n     capacity at these institutions. Of the more than 270 HSIs \n     serving half\n\n[[Page S1911]]\n\n     of the 1.8 million Hispanics enrolled in higher education \n     programs, only 44 have graduate programs in place. This \n     failure to provide adequate graduate opportunity is a \n     travesty to the Hispanic community and should be addressed.\n       The eagerly anticipated re-introduction of The Next \n     Generation Hispanic-Serving Institutions Act in the 110th \n     Congress will be a central focus of HACU's 2007 Legislative \n     Agenda. As the only nationally recognized voice for our \n     country's fast-growing community of HSIs, HACU fully \n     recognizes the critical importance of this proposal to \n     dramatically expand post-baccalaureate degree opportunities \n     for the country's youngest and largest ethnic population.\n       Your past success at winning support for HSIs in Title V of \n     the Higher Education Act and your new efforts to build upon \n     that success with the inclusion of a new graduate education \n     component are extraordinary testimony to your leadership in \n     opening the doors to college and career success for this and \n     future generations of our youth.\n       Please call upon our offices for any assistance in support \n     of your important work, which is so critical to building a \n     better future for our Hispanic communities and for our \n     country.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                Antonio R.

Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: On behalf of the Hispanic Education \n     Coalition and its twenty-five member organizations, we \n     express our strong support for your re-introduction of the \n     ``Next Generation Hispanic-Serving Institutions Act.'' You \n     have long been a champion of Hispanic higher education, and \n     we appreciate all that you do to secure equal educational \n     opportunities for Latinos.\n       The Next Generation Hispanic-Serving Institutions Act will \n     help to eradicate the chronic shortage of Hispanic \n     professionals with advanced degrees. The number of Hispanics \n     earning post-baccalaureate degrees at HSIs between the years \n     of 1991 and 2000 increased by 136 percent, demonstrating a \n     high demand and need to increase graduate program capacity at \n     these institutions. Out of 262 HACU member HSIs that serve \n     over 50% of the 1.6 million Hispanics enrolled in higher \n     education programs, only 44 currently have graduate programs \n     in place. The Next Generation Hispanic-Serving Institutions \n     Act will help to remedy this deficit.\n       The Hispanic Education Coalition and its member \n     organizations commend your leadership and will work with you \n     to secure final passage of this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Peter Zamora,\n       Acting Regional Counsel, MALDEF.\n     Roger Rosenthal,\n       Executive Director, Migrant Legal Action Program.\n\n                                 S. 565\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, Senator McCain and I are today introducing, \nby request, the administration's proposed\n\n[[Page S1912]]\n\nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. As is the case \nwith any bill that is introduced by request, we introduce this bill for \nthe purpose of placing the administration's proposals before Congress \nand the public without expressing our own views on the substance of \nthese proposals. As chairman and ranking member of the Armed Services \nCommittee, we look forward to giving the administration's requested \nlegislation our most careful review and thoughtful consideration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 569. A bill to accelerate efforts to develop vaccines for diseases \nprimarily affecting developing countries and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Vaccines for the \nFuture Act of 2007.\n  This legislation seeks to accelerate the development of vaccines for \nHIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other diseases that are major \nkillers of people living in developing countries. HIV/AIDS, malaria, \nand tuberculosis are devastating sub-Saharan Africa where, combined, \nthey claim as many as 5 million lives a year. Yet there are no vaccines \nfor these diseases.\n  Vaccines are one of the most effective public health measures of the \n20th century. With U.S. leadership, the global community has eradicated \nsmallpox, and we are close to eradicating polio. Vaccines for diseases \nsuch as measles and tetanus have dramatically reduced childhood \nmortality worldwide. These public health victories benefit every \ncountry.\n  Vaccines for diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and for \nother, less well-known diseases would save millions of lives. \nPartnerships between governments, private foundations, and businesses \nhave made significant strides toward the development of vaccines, but \nmuch more needs to be done.\n  One of the biggest challenges is that drug companies do not have a \nstrong financial incentive to invest in the development of vaccines for \nthese diseases because there is no reliable market for them. In other \nwords, vaccine manufacturers are reluctant to commit the hundreds of \nmillions of dollars necessary to create a new vaccine with no obvious \nway to recoup their investment. What is needed is the promise of market \ndemand to encourage industry to develop the vaccines for these \ndiseases.\n  Five countries--Britain, Italy, Norway, Russia, and Canada--along \nwith the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, have developed such a \nmarket solution. On February 9, 2007, in Rome, they pledged $1.5 \nbillion for an initiative called an Advance Market Commitment, AMC, \naimed at encouraging pharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines for \ndiseases caused by the pneumococcus bacterium, such as pneumonia and \nmeningitis. These diseases claim the lives of an estimated 1 million \nchildren per year, most of whom live in the developing world. Through \nthis AMC, these countries and the Gates Foundation have pledged to \npurchase pneumococcal vaccines that will work in poor countries.\n  Although a vaccine for pneumococcal disease exists in the United \nStates and other developed countries, this version is not effective \nagainst the strains prevalent in developing countries. By committing to \npurchase large quantities of a successful vaccine beforehand, the \nAdvance Market Commitment aims to bridge the gap between the vaccine \nmakers' research costs and the future sales needed to cover the costs \nof their investment. Experts are hopeful that this initiative could \naccelerate by a decade the widespread use of a pneumococcal vaccine \nspecific to the developing world and could prevent the deaths of an \nestimated 5.4 million children by 2030.\n  In 2005, the United States, at the G8 Summit in Gleneagles, Scotland, \nagreed to encourage the development of vaccines for diseases affecting \nthe developing world and endorsed the Advance Market Commitment \nconcept. I believe that, with continued strong U.S. leadership, we can \nsave many more lives in this new century. Because of the promise that \nvaccines hold, I am introducing the ``Vaccines for the Future Act of \n2007.'' My bill would authorize the United States to contribute to the \nAdvance Market Commitment for pneumococcal vaccines. Equally important, \nit would require the administration to develop a comprehensive strategy \nand make a commitment to speed development, testing, and distribution \nof life-saving vaccines for other diseases, including AIDS, malaria, \nand tuberculosis, through innovative financial incentives like the AMC.\n  I am hopeful that my fellow Senators will join me in supporting this \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 569\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Vaccines for the Future Act \n     of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) AIDS.--The term ``AIDS'' has the meaning given the term \n     in section 104A(g) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 \n     U.S.C. 2151b-2).\n       (2) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n     ``appropriate congressional committees'' means the Committee \n     on Appropriations and the Committee on Foreign Relations of \n     the Senate and the Committee on Appropriations and the \n     Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives.\n       (3) Developing country.--The term ``developing country'' \n     means a country that the World Bank determines to be a \n     country with a lower middle income or less.\n       (4) HIV/AIDS.--The term ``HIV/AIDS'' has the meaning given \n     the term in section 104A(g) of the Foreign Assistance Act of \n     1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151b-2).\n       (5) GAVI alliance.--The term ``GAVI Alliance'' means the \n     public-private partnership launched in 2000 for the purpose \n     of saving the lives of children and protecting the health of \n     all people through the widespread use of vaccines.\n       (6) Neglected disease.--The term ``neglected disease'' \n     means--\n       (A) HIV/AIDS;\n       (B) malaria;\n       (C) tuberculosis; or\n       (D) any infectious disease that, according to the World \n     Health Organization, afflicts over 1,000,000 people and \n     causes more than 250,000 deaths each year in developing \n     countries.\n       (7) World bank.--The term ``World Bank'' means the \n     International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Immunization is an inexpensive and effective public \n     health intervention that has had a profound life-saving \n     impact around the world.\n       (2) During the 20th century, global immunization efforts \n     have successfully led to the eradication of smallpox and the \n     elimination of polio from the Western Hemisphere, Europe, and \n     most of Asia. Vaccines for diseases such as measles and \n     tetanus have dramatically reduced childhood mortality \n     worldwide, and vaccines for diseases such as influenza, \n     pneumonia, and hepatitis help prevent sickness and death of \n     adults as well as children.\n       (3) According to the World Health Organization, combined, \n     AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria kill more than 5,000,000 \n     people a year, most of whom are in the developing world, yet \n     there are no vaccines for these diseases.\n       (4) Other, less well-known neglected diseases, such as \n     pneumococcal disease, lymphatic filariasis, leptospirosis, \n     leprosy, and onchocerciasis, result in severe health \n     consequences for individuals afflicted with them, such as \n     anemia, blindness, malnutrition and impaired childhood growth \n     and development. In addition, these diseases result in lost \n     productivity in developing countries costing in the billions \n     of dollars.\n       (5) Infants, children, and adolescents are among the \n     populations hardest hit by AIDS, malaria, and many other \n     neglected diseases. Nearly 11,000,000 children under age 5 \n     die each year due to these diseases, primarily in developing \n     countries. Existing and future vaccines that target children \n     could prevent more than 2,500,000 of these illnesses and \n     deaths.\n       (6) The devastating impact of neglected diseases in \n     developing countries threatens the political and economic \n     stability of these countries and constitutes a threat to \n     United States economic and security interests.\n       (7) Of more than $100,000,000,000 spent on health research \n     and development across the world, only $6,000,000,000 is \n     spent each year on diseases that are specific to developing \n     countries, most of which is from public and philanthropic \n     sources.\n       (8) Despite the devastating impact these and other diseases \n     have on developing countries, it is estimated that only 10 \n     percent of the world's research and development on health is \n     targeted on diseases affecting 90 percent of the world's \n     population.\n       (9) Because the developing country market is small and \n     unpredictable, there is an insufficient private sector \n     investment in research\n\n[[Page S1913]]\n\n     for vaccines for neglected diseases that disproportionately \n     affect populations in developing countries.\n       (10) Creating a broad range of economic incentives to \n     increase private sector research on neglected diseases is \n     critical to the development of vaccines for neglected \n     diseases.\n       (11) In recognition of the need for more economic \n     incentives to encourage private sector investment in vaccines \n     for neglected diseases, an international group of health, \n     technical, and economic experts has developed a framework for \n     an advance market commitment pilot program for pneumococcal \n     vaccines. Pneumococcal disease, a cause of pneumonia and \n     meningitis, kills 1,600,000 people every year, an estimated \n     1,000,000 of whom are children under age 5. This pilot \n     program will seek to stimulate investments to develop and \n     produce pneumococcal vaccines that could prevent between \n     500,000 and 700,000 deaths by the year 2020.\n       (12) On February 9, 2007, 5 countries, Britain, Canada, \n     Italy, Norway, and Russia, together with the Bill and Melinda \n     Gates Foundation, pledged, under a plan called an Advance \n     Market Commitment, to purchase pneumococcal vaccines now \n     under development. Together, these countries and the Bill and \n     Melinda Gates Foundation have committed $1,500,000,000 for \n     this program. Experts believe that this initiative could \n     accelerate by a decade the widespread use of such a vaccine \n     in the developing world and could prevent the deaths of an \n     estimated 5,400,000 children by 2030.\n\n     SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON SUPPORT FOR NEGLECTED DISEASES.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the President should continue to encourage efforts to \n     support the Global HIV Vaccine Enterprise, a virtual \n     consortium of scientists and organizations committed to \n     accelerating the development of an effective HIV vaccine;\n       (2) the United States should work with the Global Fund to \n     Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the Joint United \n     Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (``UNAIDS''), the World Health \n     Organization, the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, the \n     GAVI Alliance, and the World Bank to ensure that all \n     countries heavily affected by the HIV/AIDS pandemic have \n     national AIDS vaccine plans;\n       (3) the United States should support and encourage the \n     carrying out of the agreements of the Group of 8 made at the \n     2005 Summit at Gleneagles, Scotland, to increase direct \n     investment and create market incentives, including through \n     public-private partnerships and advance market commitments, \n     to complement public research in the development of vaccines, \n     microbicides, and drugs for HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, \n     and other neglected diseases;\n       (4) the United States should support the development of \n     effective vaccines for infants, children, and adolescents as \n     early as is medically and ethically appropriate, in order to \n     avoid significant delays in the availability of pediatric \n     vaccines at the cost of thousands of lives;\n       (5) the United States should continue supporting the work \n     of the GAVI Alliance and the Global Fund for Children's \n     Vaccines as appropriate and effective vehicles to purchase \n     and distribute vaccines for neglected diseases at an \n     affordable price once such vaccines are discovered in order \n     to distribute them to the developing world;\n       (6) the United States should work with others in the \n     international community to address the multiple obstacles to \n     the development of vaccines for neglected diseases including \n     scientific barriers, insufficient economic incentives, \n     protracted regulatory procedures, lack of delivery systems \n     for products once developed, liability risks, and \n     intellectual property rights; and\n       (7) the United States should contribute to the pilot \n     Advance Market Commitment for pneumococcal vaccines launched \n     in Rome on February 9, 2007, which could prevent some 500,000 \n     to 700,000 child deaths by the year 2020 and an estimated \n     5,400,000 child deaths by 2030.\n\n     SEC. 5. PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Partnerships between governments and the private sector \n     (including foundations, universities, corporations, \n     community-based organizations, and other nongovernmental \n     organizations) are playing a critical role in the area of \n     global health, particularly in the fight against neglected \n     diseases, including HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.\n       (2) These public-private partnerships improve the delivery \n     of health services in developing countries and accelerate \n     research and development of vaccines and other preventive \n     medical technologies essential to combating infectious \n     diseases that disproportionately kill people in developing \n     countries.\n       (3) These public-private partnerships maximize the unique \n     capabilities of each sector while combining financial and \n     other resources, scientific knowledge, and expertise toward \n     common goals which cannot be achieved by either sector alone.\n       (4) Public-private partnerships such as the International \n     AIDS Vaccine Initiative, PATH's Malaria Vaccine Initiative, \n     and the Global TB Drug Facility are playing cutting edge \n     roles in the efforts to develop vaccines for these diseases.\n       (5) Public-private partnerships serve as incentives to the \n     research and development of vaccines for neglected diseases \n     by providing biotechnology companies, which often have no \n     experience in developing countries, with technical assistance \n     and on the ground support for clinical trials of the vaccine \n     through the various stages of development.\n       (6) Sustaining existing public-private partnerships and \n     building new ones where needed are essential to the success \n     of the efforts by the United States and others in the \n     international community to find a cure for these and other \n     neglected diseases.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the sustainment and promotion of public-private \n     partnerships must be a central element of the strategy \n     pursued by the United States to create effective incentives \n     for the development of vaccines and other preventive medical \n     technologies for neglected diseases debilitating the \n     developing world; and\n       (2) the United States Government should take steps to \n     address the obstacles to the development of these \n     technologies by increasing investment in research and \n     development and establishing market and other incentives.\n\n     SEC. 6. COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY FOR ACCELERATING THE \n                   DEVELOPMENT OF VACCINES FOR NEGLECTED DISEASES.\n\n       (a) Requirement for Strategy.--The President shall \n     establish a comprehensive strategy to accelerate efforts to \n     develop vaccines and microbicides for neglected diseases such \n     as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis.

A bill to designate additional National Forest System lands \nin the State of Virginia as wilderness or a wilderness study area, to \ndesignate the Kimberling Creek Potential Wilderness Area for eventual \nincorporation in the\n\n[[Page S1914]]\n\nKimberling Creek Wilderness, to establish the Seng Mountain and Bear \nCreek Scenic Areas, to provide for the development of trail plans for \nthe wilderness areas and scenic areas, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Virginia \nRidge and Valley Act of 2007. This bill seeks to add six new wilderness \nareas, expand six existing wilderness areas, and create two new \nnational scenic areas in the Jefferson National Forest. Today, \nCongressman Rick Boucher will join me by introducing companion \nlegislation in the United States House of Representatives.\n  Throughout my nearly three decades in the United States Senate, I \nhave strived to preserve Virginia's natural resources through the \ndesignation of wilderness areas and, today, I am proud to say that \nVirginia boasts just over 100,000 acres of designated wilderness lands. \nHowever, there is still much work to be done. If enacted, the Virginia \nRidge and Valley Act of 2007 will substantially increase this figure by \nexpanding our opportunities for uninterrupted enjoyment in the forest \nwith the addition of nearly 43,000 acres of new wilderness and \nwilderness study lands and almost 12,000 acres of national scenic \nareas.\n  Virginia is blessed with great natural beauty and diversity. From the \ncoves and inlets of the Chesapeake Bay, to the exquisite peaks of the \nShenandoah Mountains, residents and visitors alike can enjoy a \nbountiful array of natural treasures. As demand for development in \nVirginia continues to increase, it is imperative that Congress act \nexpeditiously to protect these wild lands. Through wilderness and \nnational scenic area designations, we can ensure that these areas \nretain their natural character and influences.\n  As an avid outdoorsman, I enjoy opportunities for recreation like \nmost Americans. Therefore, I want to stress the many joyful outdoor \nactivities that will be enhanced by the wilderness designation in these \nareas, including: hunting, fishing, hiking, camping, canoeing, and \nhorseback riding, to name a few. By designating these lands as \nwilderness and scenic areas, we ensure that Virginians will be able to \nenjoy these activities in an unspoiled playground for generations to \ncome.\n  I am pleased that my colleague from Virginia, Senator Jim Webb, has \nagreed to co-sponsor this important legislation, and I urge the rest of \nmy colleagues to join me in support of this bill. I thank you for this \nopportunity to speak on behalf of the Virginia Ridge and Valley Act of \n2007\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 572. A bill to ensure that Federal student loans are delivered as \nefficiently as possible in order to provide more grant aid to students; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, more than 40 years ago, Congress \nrecognized the importance of a college education in opening the door to \nthe American dream. We agreed then that no qualified student should be \ndenied the opportunity to go to college because of the cost. Guided by \nthat principle, we enacted the Higher Education Act of 1965.\n  Times have changed since then. College education has become even more \ncritical to success in the global economy. Yet, Congress has shamefully \nlost sight of this fundamental principle, especially in recent years.\n  Today, 400,000 qualified students a year don't attend a four-year \ncollege because they can't afford it. The cost of college has more than \ntripled over the last twenty years, and vast numbers of families can't \nkeep up. Twenty years ago, the maximum Pell Grant--the lifeline to \ncollege for low-income and first-generation students--covered more than \nhalf the cost of attendance at a typical four-year public college. \nToday, it only covers 32 percent.\n  Yet each year, the federal government wastes billions of taxpayer \ndollars on subsidies to private lenders to do a job that could be done \nmuch more efficiently without these middlemen.\n  At a time when students and families are pinching pennies more than \never to pay for college, we can't let this situation continue. We \nshould use scarce tax dollars to help students, not banks.\n  The system we created 40 years ago involved federally-guaranteed \nstudent loans made by private lenders, and it's now known as the \nFederal Family Education Loan Program, or FFEL. At that time, Congress \nwasn't sure lenders would be willing to loan money to students with no \ncredit history, so we created a system with guarantees against default. \nFour decades later, student default rates are near an all-time low and \nprivate lenders hold over $100 billion in federal student loan volume. \nFederal guarantees and subsidies have made student loans the second \nmost profitable business for banks, after credit cards. The stock price \nof the biggest lender, Sallie Mae, has skyrocketed from $3 to more than \n$40 in the last decade.\n  In 1994, Congress finally recognized that we could give students a \nbetter deal and save billions of dollars by cutting out the middleman. \nWe created the Direct Loan program, in which loans are issued directly \nto students, from the United States Treasury. The loans are serviced \nand collected under contracts with private companies, but there is no \nmiddleman making the loans.\n  The Direct Loan program is much less expensive for taxpayers, because \nit provides loan capital at a lower rate than banks, and avoids \nbillions of dollars in unnecessary subsidies to lenders.\n  If we had gone to a system of 100 percent Direct Loans in 1994, the \ngovernment would have saved over $30 billion since the program was \ncreated. Unfortunately, because of the lobbying of the private lenders, \nthe FFEL program continues, and the Direct Loan program has never been \nallowed to compete on a level playing field.\n  As a result, we continue to waste taxpayer money by paying an \nunnecessary middleman, we shield lenders from risk, and we continue to \nguarantee them a very profitable return.\n  It's time to encourage serious competition in the college loan \nmarketplace, and let students reap the benefits.\n  Today, Senator Gordon Smith (R-OR), Congressmen George Miller (D-CA) \nand Tom Petri (R-WI) and I are proposing a bipartisan plan to do that. \nOur bill will increase student financial aid by squeezing billions of \ndollars in corporate welfare out of the student loan program.\n  Our bill, The Student Aid Reward Act, will provide colleges and \nuniversities with grant aid to increase scholarships for their \nstudents. It is completely paid for by increased efficiency in \ndelivering student loans. The bill encourages colleges to use the \ndirect loans, which are cheaper for both the government and taxpayers, \nand allows them to keep half the savings to increase need-based aid. \nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates that our plan will generate \n$13 billion in savings over the next 10 years from schools switching to \nthe more efficient program. The bill would provide at least $10 billion \nfor additional college scholarship aid at no additional cost to \ntaxpayers.\n  According to President Bush's 2008 education budget, student loans \nmade through the more expensive FFEL program in 2007 cost $3 more for \nevery $100 in loans than the same loans made directly from the \nTreasury. Yet, colleges and students have no incentive under current \nlaw to use the more efficient program.\n  Our Student Aid Reward Act encourages colleges to choose the less \nexpensive of the government's student loan programs.\n  It requires the Secretary of Education to determine every year which \nloan program is more efficient. Schools are rewarded with additional \nscholarship funds for using the more efficient of the two programs. \nCompetition will encourage both programs to improve the efficiency of \ntheir operations. Schools, students, and taxpayers will all benefit.\n  Estimates based on the most recent Bush Administration budget \nindicate that under our plan, each college will receive an incentive \npayment equal to one and a half percent of the total amount borrowed by \nstudents at the college.\n  In Massachusetts: students at Boston College will receive almost $1.4 \nmillion in additional financial aid. Students at UMASS Amherst will \nreceive $1.3 million more. Students at Springfield College will receive \nover $700,000 more.\n\n[[Page S1915]]\n\nStudents at Emerson College would receive nearly half a million dollars \nmore.\n  For students nationwide, college will be more affordable for millions \nof young men and women at no additional taxpayer cost.\n  Title IV of the Higher Education Act today is called ``Student \nAssistance''--not ``Lender Assistance.'' The federal student aid system \nwas created to help students and families afford college. But in recent \nyears, it has been corrupted into a system that lines the pockets of \nthe banks. It's time to throw the private money lenders out of the \ntemple of higher education. Scarce Federal education dollars should go \nto deserving students, not greedy private lenders.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Student \nAid Reward Act of 2007 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 572\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and \nthe Public health Service Act to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and \ntreatment of heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases \nin women; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, February is American Heart Month, and \nheart disease remains the Nation's leading cause of death.\n  Many women believe that heart disease is a man's disease and, \nunfortunately, do not review it as a serious health threat. However, \nevery year, since 1984, cardiovascular disease claims the lives of more \nwomen than men. In fact, cardiovascular disease death rates have \ndeclined significantly in men since 1979, while the death rate for \nwomen hasn't experienced the same rate of decline. The numbers are \ndisturbing: cardiovascular diseases claim the lives of more than \n460,000 women per year; that's nearly a death a minute among females \nand nearly 12 times as many lives as claimed by breast cancer. One in \nthree females has some form of cardiovascular disease. And one in four \nfemales dies from heart disease.\n  That is why I am pleased to join my colleague from Michigan, Senator \nStabenow, to introduce important legislation, the HEART for Women Act, \nor Heart disease Education, Analysis and Research, and Treatment for \nWomen Act. This important bill improves the prevention, diagnosis and \ntreatment of heart disease and stroke in women.\n  In my State of Alaska--taken together--heart disease, stroke and \nother cardiovascular diseases are also the leading cause of death, \ntotaling nearly 800 deaths each year. Women in Alaska have higher death \nrates from stroke than do women nationally. Mortality among Native \nAlaskan women is dramatically on the rise, whereas, it is actually \ndeclining among Caucasian women in the Lower 48.\n  Despite being the number one killer, many women and their health care \nproviders do not know that the biggest health care threat to women is \nheart disease. In fact, a recent survey found that 43 percent of women \nstill don't know that heart disease is the number one killer of women.\n  Perhaps even more troubling, is the lack of awareness among health \ncare providers. According to American\n\n[[Page S1916]]\n\nHeart Association figures, less than one in five physicians recognize \nthat more women suffer from heart disease than men. Among primary care \nphysicians, only 8 percent of primary care physicians--and even more \nastounding--only 17 percent of cardiologists recognize that more women \ndie of heart disease than men. Additionally, studies show that women \nare less likely to receive aggressive treatment because heart disease \noften manifests itself differently in women than men.\n  This is why the HEART Act is so important. Our bill takes a three-\npronged approach to reducing the heart disease death rate for women, \nthrough; 1. education; 2. research; and, 3. screening.\n  First, the bill would authorize the Department of Health and Human \nServices to educate healthcare professionals and older women about \nunique aspects of care in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of \nwomen with heart disease and stroke.\n  Second, the bill would require disclosure of gender-specific health \ninformation that is already being reported to the Federal Government. \nMany agencies already collect information based on gender, but do not \ndisseminate or analyze the gender differences. This bill would release \nthat information so that it could be studied, and important health \ntrends in women could be detected.\n  Lastly, the bill would authorize the expansion of the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention's WISEWOMAN program (the Well-Integrated \nScreening and Evaluation for Women Across the Nation program). The \nWISEWOMAN program provides free heart disease and stroke screening to \nlow-income uninsured women, but the program is currently limited to \njust 14 States.\n  My State of Alaska is fortunate to have two WISEWOMAN program sites. \nThese programs screen for high blood pressure, cholesterol and glucose \nin Native Alaskan women and provide invaluable counseling on diet and \nexercise. One program in Alaska alone has successfully screened 1,437 \nAlaskan Native women and has provided them with a culturally \nappropriate intervention program that has produced live-saving results.\n  Mr. President, heart disease, stroke and other cardiovascular \ndiseases cost Americans more than any other disease--an estimated $430 \nbillion in 2007, including more than $280 billion in direct medical \ncosts. To put that number in perspective, that's about the same as the \nprojected Federal deficit for 2007. We, as a nation, can control those \ncosts--prevention through early detection is the most cost-effective \nway to combat this disease.\n  Tomorrow, as we celebrate Valentine's Day and see images of hearts \njust about everywhere, let us not forget that the heart is much more \nthan a symbol--it is a vital organ that can't be taken for granted. \nCoronary disease can be effectively treated and sometimes even \nprevented--it does not have to be the number one cause of death in \nwomen. And, that is why I encourage my colleagues to support the HEART \nfor Women Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 574.

A bill to authorize appropriations for border and \ntransportation security personnel and technology, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Dorgan to \nintroduce a bill of critical importance to the security of our borders: \nthe Border Infrastructure and Technology Modernization Act.\n  It was two decades ago when an American border last underwent a \ncomprehensive infrastructure overhaul. That was when Senator Dennis \nDeConcini of Arizona and I put forth a $357 million effort to modernize \nthe southwest border. A great deal has changed since 1986, and more \nimportantly, since September 11, 2001. Congress has acted to improve \nsecurity at airports and seaports, but we have not yet addressed our \nbusiest ports, located on our land borders. This is where our \ninfrastructure is its weakest, and we must act to prevent terrorists \nfrom exploiting this weakness. It is critical that we give our northern \nand southern borders the resources they need to address their \nvulnerabilities.\n  In 2001, the General Services Administration completed a \ncomprehensive assessment of infrastructure needs on the southwestern \nand northern borders of the United States. This assessment found that \noverhauling both borders would cost $784 million.\n  Since the publication of that assessment, many of the needs \nidentified remain outstanding, and new needs have arisen as \nfacilitating commerce has become more complicated in the face of new \nsecurity concerns.\n  Congress must address these needs. We must give the Department of \nHomeland Security the tools it needs to secure our borders. The Border \nInfrastructure and Technology Modernization Act creates a number of \nthose tools.\n  The bill requires the General Service Administration (GSA) to \nidentify port of entry infrastructure and technology improvement \nprojects that would enhance homeland security. The GSA would work with \nthe Department of Homeland Security to prioritize and implement these \nprojects based on need.\n  The Secretary of Homeland Security would have to prepare a Land \nBorder Security Plan to assess the vulnerabilities at each port of \nentry on the northern border and the southern border. This plan will \nrequire the cooperation of Federal, State and local entities involved \nat our borders to ensure that the individuals with first hand knowledge \nof our border needs are consulted about the plan.\n  My bill would also modernize homeland security along the United \nStates' borders by implementing a program to test and evaluate new \ntechnologies.\n  Because equipment and technology alone will not solve the security \nproblems on our border, these test sites will also house facilities so \npersonnel who must use these technologies can train under realistic \nconditions.\n  I believe that these measures are an important part of addressing \nthis nation's homeland security needs, and I am pleased to introduce \nthe bill with Senator Dorgan.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 575\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Border Infrastructure and \n     Technology Modernization Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to provide for the effective prosecution of terrorists \nand guarantee due process rights; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Restoring the \nConstitution Act of 2007--a bill to provide for the effective \nprosecution of terrorists and guarantee due process rights. I am \npleased to be joined by Senators Leahy, Feingold, and Menendez as \noriginal cosponsors. This bill would make significant important changes \nto the Military Commissions Act of 2006 which became law last October.\n  I have served in this body for more than a quarter-century, but I \nremember few days darker than September 28, 2006, the day the Senate \npassed President Bush's Military Commissions Act. Let me be honest with \nyou, I believe this body gave in to fear that day. I believe we looked \nfor refuge in the rule of men, when we should have trusted in the rule \nof law.\n  Restoring the Constitution Act of 2007 is more than mere tinkering \nwith provisions of the Military Commissions Act. This legislation, \nwhich is similar to the bill that I introduced in the last Congress, \nmakes major and important changes to that law in order to ensure we \nhave the essential legal tools to achieve a lasting American victory \nwithout violating American values.\n  What does this proposed legislation do?\n  It restores the writ of habeas corpus for individuals held in U.S. \ncustody.\n  It narrows the definition of unlawful enemy combatant to individuals \nwho directly participate in hostilities against the United States in a \nzone of active combat, who are not lawful combatants.\n  It requires that the United States live up to its Geneva Convention \nobligations by deleting a prohibition in the law that bars detainees \nfrom invoking Geneva Conventions as a source of rights at trial.\n  It permits the accused to retain qualified civilian attorneys to \nrepresent them at trial.\n  It prevents the use of evidence in court gained through the \nunreliable and immoral practices of torture and coercion.\n  It charges the military judge with the responsibility for ensuring \nthat the jury is appropriately informed as to the sources, methods and \nactivities associated with developing out of court statements proposed \nto be introduced at trial, or alternatively that the statement is not \nintroduced.\n  It empowers military judges to exclude hearsay evidence they deem to \nbe unreliable.\n  It authorizes the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces to \nreview decisions by the military commissions.\n  It limits the authority of the President to interpret the meaning and \napplication of the Geneva Conventions and makes that authority subject \nto congressional and judicial oversight.\n  It clarifies the definition of war crimes in statute to include \ncertain violations of the Geneva Conventions.\n  Finally, it provides for expedited judicial review of the Military \nCommissions Act of 2006 to determine the constitutionally of its \nprovisions.\n  To be clear--I absolutely believe that under very clearly proscribed \ncircumstances military commissions can be a useful instrument for \nbringing our enemies to justice. But those who ask us to choose between \nnational security and moral authority are offering us a false choice, \nand a dangerous one. Our Nation has been defeating tyrants and would-be \ntyrants for more than two centuries. And in all that struggle, we've \nnever sold our principles--because if We did, we would be walking in \nthe footsteps of those we most despise.\n  In times of peril, throwing away due process has been a constant \ntemptation--but that is why we honor so highly those who resisted it. \nAt Nuremberg, America rejected the certainty of execution for the \nuncertainty of a trial, and gave birth to a half-century of moral \nauthority. Today I am asking my colleagues to reclaim that tradition, \nto put the principles of the Constitution above the passion of the \nmoment. That reclamation can begin today--if we remedy President Bush's \nrepugnant law. We can do it--and keep America Secure at the same time.\n  Freedom from torture. The right to counsel. Habeas corpus. To be \nhonest, it still amazes me that we have to come to the floor of the \nSenate to debate these protections at all. What would James Madison \nhave said if you told him that someday in the future, a Senator from \nConnecticut would be forced to publicly defend habeas corpus, the \ndefendant's right to a day in court, the foundation of Our legal system \ndating back to the 13 century? What have we come to that such long-\nsettled, long-honored rights have been called into question?\n  But here we are. And now it is upon us to renew them. I'd like to \ntalk in detail about several key components of my legislation. The \nMilitary Commissions Act eliminated habeas corpus. Habeas corpus allows \na person held by the government to question the legality of his \ndetention. In my view, to deny this right not only undermines the rule \nof law, but damages the very fabric of America. It is not who we are, \nand it is not who we aspire to be. My bill reopens the doors to the \nCourt house by restoring the writ of habeas corpus for individuals held \nin U.S. custody.\n  By approving the Military Commissions Act, Congress abdicated its \nconstitutionally-mandated authority and responsibility to safeguard \nthis principle and serve as a co-equal check on the executive branch. \nThis law confers an unprecedented level of power on the president, \nallowing him the sole right to designate any individual as an \n``unlawful enemy combatant'' if he or she engaged in hostilities or \nsupported hostilities against the United States. In my view and in the \nview of many legal experts, this definition of ``unlawful enemy \ncombatant'' is unmanageably vague. As we have all seen, ``unlawful \nenemy combatants'' are subject to arrest and indefinite detention, in \nmany cases without ever being changed with a crime, let alone being \nfound guilty. My bill would curtail potential abuse of the unlawful \nenemy combatant designation by narrowing the definition of unlawful \nenemy combatant to individuals who directly participate in hostilities \nagainst the United States in ``a zone of active combat'', and who are \nnot lawful combatants. This correction is desperately needed to restore \nAmerica's standing in the world and to right injustices that have \nrecently been documented by international human rights organizations.\n  According to the Pentagon, last October, only 70 out of the 435 \ndetainees housed at U.S. prison camps were expected to face a military \ntrial, leaving hundreds of others to be held indefinitely. And while \nthe Pentagon acknowledges that at least 110 of these detainees were \nlabeled ``ready to release,'' for some reason they have been kept under \nlock and key. Then there are stories such as the one about Asif Iqbal, \na British humanitarian aid volunteer who, according to a January 10, \n2007 Associated Press story, was mistakenly captured in Afghanistan and \nsubjected to isolation, painful positioning, screeching music, strobe\n\n[[Page S1919]]\n\nlights, sleep deprivation, and extreme temperatures. After three \nmonths, of enduring such treatment, Iqbal was released in 2004 without \nany charges brought against him.\n  Such sordid episodes have gravely undermined our apparent commitment \nto the Geneva Conventions and damaged our status both at home and in \nthe global community. By failing to reaffirm our obligations under \nthese vital treaties, the Military Commissions Act has only \nfurther eroded America's moral authority and perhaps ceded our nation's \nstatus as the leading proponent of international law and human rights. \nFor this reason, the legislation I am offering today will reaffirm our \nobligations under the Geneva Conventions in several key ways. First, it \nwould allow detainees to invoke the Geneva Conventions as a source of \nrights in their trials, overturning a ban put in place by the Military \nCommissions Act. Second, this legislation will limit the authority of \nthe President to interpret and redefine the meaning and application of \nthe Geneva Conventions by subjecting this authority to Congressional \nand judicial oversight. Lastly, my bill would statutorily define \ncertain violations of the Geneva Conventions as war crimes. These \nprovisions are all vitally important in allowing the United States to \neffectively wage the war on terror. The war that we are currently \nwaging requires increasing international cooperation, but the \nPresident's plan puts us on a path of increasing isolation from even \nour staunchest allies.\n\n  Furthermore, this path is undermining our government's commitments to \nfundamental tenets of the American legal system. One of these tenets \nentails the right of the accused not only to confront his/her accuser \nbut also to retain an attorney to represent him/her at trial. This is a \nbasic right afforded to even the most egregious criminals under \ndomestic law. And yet, under the administration's plan, this measure is \nbeing abandoned. In response, my bill sets standards for legal \nrepresentation and allows for civilian legal counsel in military \ncommission proceedings.\n  Even more importantly, my bill improves on these proceedings by \nprohibiting the use in court of any evidence that was gained through \nthe unreliable and immoral practices of coercion. Incredibly, the \nMilitary Commissions Act lacks this blanket ban on evidence gained \nthrough torture. This is critically important for two very different \nreasons. Torture has been proven to be ineffective in interrogations, \nyielding highly unreliable information because a detainee, hoping to \nend the pain, will simply say whatever he believes an interrogator \nwants to hear. Second, torture allows foreign militaries to mistreat \nfuture American prisoners of war and use U.S. actions as an excuse. No \none has said it with more authority than our colleague, Senator John \nMcCain.\n  As he stated last year, ``the intelligence we collect must be \nreliable and acquired humanely, under clear standards understood by all \nour fighting men and women . . . the cruel actions of a few to darken \nthe reputation of our country in the eyes of millions,''\n  To address these concerns, my bill restores to military judges the \nresponsibility of ensuring that information introduced at trial has not \nbeen obtained through methods defined as cruel, inhuman, or degrading \ntreatment by the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005. Sadly, the Military \nCommissions Act shows disrespect for and mistrust of the highly trained \nprofessionals on our military's bench by stripping them of autonomy and \nauthority. The legislation I am proposing today empowers military \njudges to exclude hearsay evidence they deem to be unreliable. In \naddition, this bill will grant military judges discretion in the event \nthat classified evidence has a bearing on the innocence of an \nindividual but is excluded due to national security concerns and \ndeclassified alternatives are insufficient. America's military judges \nhave been fully trained and prepared to handle classified information. \nThe Bush administration's failure to recognize this fact is an insult \nto the men and women of our military's bench and an affront to our \nmilitary's justice system.\n  Unlike the current administration, I trust our courts to be able to \nhandle the delicate legal and national security issues inherent in the \ncases involving so-called unlawful enemy combatants. This legislation \ntherefore provides for appeals of the military commissions' decisions \nto be heard by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. In my \nview, the right to an appeal is one of the most fundamental rights \ngranted to anyone in our justice system. We 3 grant appeals to people \naccused of some of the most heinous crimes imaginable. We do this \nbecause we know that courts are not infallible. They can err in their \ndecisions, and in order for these mistakes to be rectified and to avoid \npunishing innocent men and women, appeals must be allowed.\n  All of these provisions are important. But perhaps none is more \nurgent than the final measure in my bill, which requires expedited \njudicial review of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 to determine \nthe constitutionally of its provisions. I believe that the United \nStates Congress made a crucial mistake--that is why we must ensure that \neach provision of the Administration's Military Commissions Act is \nquickly reviewed by our Nation's courts. I believe that upon such \nreview, those best qualified to make these judgments--members of our \nesteemed judiciary--will see to it that the most egregious provisions \nof this act will be overturned.\n  All 100 members of this body have been given the gravest of \nresponsibilities. The people of this country have entrusted us with \nthis Nation's security; and they have entrusted us with this Nation's \nprinciples. But those who argue that our principles stand in the way of \nour security are sadly, sorely mistaken: They are the source of our \nstrength.\n  Five months ago, we departed from that source. But it is not too late \nto turn back. It is not too late to redeem our error. I implore my \ncolleagues to join me.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the Restoring \nthe Constitution Act of 2007, which was introduced today by Senator \nDodd. It amends the deeply flawed Military Commissions Act of 2006 to \nrestore basic due process rights and to ensure that no person is \nsubject to indefinite detention without charge based on the sole \ndiscretion of the President.\n  Let me be clear: I welcome efforts to bring terrorists to justice. \nThis administration has for too long been distracted by the war in Iraq \nfrom the fight against al Qaeda. We need a renewed focus on the \nterrorist networks that present the greatest threat to this country.\n  Last year, the President agreed to consult with Congress on the \nmakeup of military commissions only because he was essentially ordered \nto do so by the Supreme Court in the Hamdan decision. Congress should \nhave taken that opportunity to pass legislation that would allow these \ntrials to proceed in accordance with our laws and our values. That is \nwhat separates America from our enemies. These trials, conducted \nappropriately, would have had the potential to demonstrate to the world \nthat our democratic, constitutional system of government is not a \nhindrance but a source of strength in fighting those who attacked us.\n  Instead, we passed the Military Commissions Act, legislation that \nviolates the basic principles and values of our constitutional system \nof government. It allows the government to seize individuals on \nAmerican soil and detain them indefinitely with no opportunity for them \nto challenge their detention in court. And the new law would permit an \nindividual to be convicted on the basis of coerced testimony and even \nallow someone convicted under these rules to be put to death.\n  The checks and balances of our system of government and the \nfundamental fairness of the American people and legal system are among \nour greatest strengths in the fight against terrorism. I was deeply \ndisappointed that Congress enacted the Military Commissions Act. The \nday that bill became law was a stain on our Nation's history.\n  It is time to undo the harm caused by that legislation.\n  The Restoring the Constitution Act amends the Military Commissions \nAct to remedy its most serious flaws, and I am pleased to support it.\n  First of all, this legislation would restore the great writ of habeas \ncorpus, to ensure that detainees at Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere--\npeople who have been held for years but have not\n\n[[Page S1920]]\n\nbeen tried or even charged with any crime--have the ability to \nchallenge their detention in court. Senator Dodd's bill would repeal \nthe habeas stripping provisions of both the Military Commissions Act \nand the Detainee Treatment Act.\n  Habeas corpus is a fundamental recognition that in America, the \ngovernment does not have the power to detain people indefinitely and \narbitrarily. And that in America, the courts must have the power to \nreview the legality of executive detention decisions.\n  Habeas corpus is a longstanding vital part of our American tradition, \nand is enshrined in the U.S. Constitution.\n  As a group of retired judges wrote to Congress last year, habeas \ncorpus ``safeguards the most hallowed judicial role in our \nconstitutional democracy--ensuring that no man is imprisoned \nunlawfully.''\n  The Military Commissions Act fundamentally altered that historical \nequation. Faced with an executive branch that has detained hundreds of \npeople without trial for years now, it eliminated the right of habeas \ncorpus.\n  Under the Military Commissions Act, some individuals, at the \ndesignation of the executive branch alone, could be picked up, even in \nthe United States, and held indefinitely without trial, without due \nprocess, without any access whatsoever to the courts. They would not be \nable to call upon the laws of our great nation to challenge their \ndetention because they would have been put outside the reach of the \nlaw.\n  That is unacceptable, and it almost surely violates our Constitution. \nBut that determination will take years of protracted litigation. Under \nthe Dodd bill, we would not have to wait. We would restore the right to \nhabeas corpus now. We can provide a lawful system of military \ncommissions so that those who have committed war crimes can be brought \nto justice, without denying one of the most basic rights guaranteed by \nthe Constitution to those held in custody by our government.\n  Some have suggested that terrorists who take up arms against this \ncountry should not be allowed to challenge their detention in court. \nBut that argument is circular--the writ of habeas allows those who \nmight be mistakenly detained to challenge their detention in court, \nbefore a neutral decision-maker. The alternative is to allow people to \nbe detained indefinitely with no ability to argue that they are not, in \nfact, enemy combatants. Unless it can be said with absolute certainty \nthat every person detained as an enemy combatant was correctly \ndetained--and there is ample evidence to suggest that is not the case--\nthen we should make sure that people can't simply be locked up forever, \nwithout court review, based on someone slapping a ``terrorist'' label \non them.\n  We must return to the great writ. We must be true to our Nation's \nproud traditions and principles by restoring the writ of habeas corpus, \nby making clear that we do not permit our government to pick people up \noff the street, even in U.S. cities, and detain them indefinitely \nwithout court review. That is not what America is about.\n  But the Restoring the Constitution Act does far more than restore \nhabeas corpus. It also addresses who can be subject to trial by \nmilitary commission.\n  The Military Commissions Act was justified as necessary to allow our \ngovernment to prosecute Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and other dangerous men \ntransferred to Guantanamo Bay in 2006. Yet if you look at the fine \nprint of that legislation, it becomes clear that it is much, much \nbroader than that. It would permit trial by military commission not \njust for those accused of planning the September 11 attacks, but also \nindividuals, including legal permanent residents of this country, who \nare alleged to have ``purposefully and materially supported \nhostilities'' against the United States or its allies.\n  This is extremely broad. And by including hostilities not only \nagainst the United States but also against its allies, the Military \nCommissions Act allows the U.S. to hold and try by military commission \nindividuals who have never engaged, directly or indirectly, in any \naction against the United States.\n  Not only that, but the Military Commissions Act would also define as \nan unlawful enemy combatant subject to trial by military commission, \nanyone who ``has been determined to be an unlawful enemy combatant by a \nCombatant Status Review Tribunal or another competent tribunal \nestablished under the authority of the President or the Secretary of \nDefense.'' This essentially grants a blank check to the executive \nbranch to decide entirely on its own who can be tried by military \ncommission.\n  Senator Dodd's bill makes clear that the President cannot \nunilaterally decide who is eligible for trial by military commission. \nUnder the Dodd bill, in order to be tried by military commission, an \nindividual must have directly participated in hostilities against the \nUnited States in a zone of active combat, or have been involved in the \nSeptember 11 attacks, and cannot be a lawful enemy combatant.\n  Senator Dodd's bill also addresses the structure and process of the \nmilitary commissions themselves. It ensures that these military \ncommission procedures hew closely to the long-established military \nsystem of justice, as recommended by countless witnesses at \ncongressional hearings last summer.\n  Some examples of the ways in which the Dodd bill improves the \nmilitary commission procedures include: It prevents the use of evidence \nin court gained through torture or coercion. It ensures that any \nevidence seized within the United States without a search warrant \ncannot be introduced as evidence. It empowers military judges to \nexclude hearsay evidence they deem to be unreliable. It authorizes the \nexisting U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces to review decisions \nby military commissions, rather than the newly created ``Court of \nMilitary Commission Review,'' whose members would be appointed by the \nSecretary of Defense. And it provides for expedited judicial review of \nthe Military Commissions Act to determine the constitutionally of its \nprovisions before anyone is tried by military commission, so that we \nwill not face even more delays in the future.\n  Many of these provisions were included in the bill passed by the \nSenate Armed Services Committee in September 2006, but then stripped \nout or altered in backroom negotiations with the Administration. The \nbill also improves changes to the War Crimes Act and emphasizes the \nimportance of compliance with the Geneva Conventions.\n  In sum, Senator Dodd's legislation addresses many of the most \ntroubling and legally suspect provisions of the Military Commissions \nAct. Congress would be wise to make these changes now, rather than wait \naround while the Military Commissions Act is subject to further legal \nchallenge, and another 4 or 5 years are squandered while cases work \ntheir way through the courts again.\n  In closing let me quote John Ashcroft. According to the New York \nTimes, at a private meeting of high-level officials in 2003 about the \nmilitary commission structure, then-Attorney General Ashcroft said: \n``Timothy McVeigh was one of the worst killers in U.S. history. But at \nleast we had fair procedures for him.'' How sad that Congress passed \nlegislation about which the same cannot be said. We can and must undo \nthis mistake.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Levin, Ms. \n        Cantwell, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mr. Lautenberg, and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 577. A bill to amend the Commodity Exchange Act to add a provision \nrelating to reporting and recordkeeping for positions involving energy \ncommodities; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Snowe, \nLevin, Cantwell, Boxer, Feingold, Bingaman, Lieberman, Lautenberg, and \nMikulski to introduce a bill to provide necessary Federal oversight of \nour energy markets.\n  Just as is currently required for trades performed on the New York \nMercantile Exchange (NYMEX), this bill would require record keeping and \ncreate an audit trail for all electronic over-the-counter energy \ntrades.\n  Generally, in energy markets, the term ``over-the-counter trading'' \nrefers to the trading of an energy commodity directly between two \nparties that does not take place on a regulated exchange.\n\n[[Page S1921]]\n\n  Six years after the California energy crisis, this bill is long \noverdue. As global oil and gas prices increase and as we work to reduce \nglobal greenhouse gas emissions, the American public needs reliable, \ntransparent energy markets that are not subject to manipulation by \ntraders.\n  Specifically, the bill would: require traders who perform trades on \nelectronic trading facilities such as the Intercontinental Exchange \n(ICE) to keep records and report large positions carried by their \nmarket participants in energy commodities for five years or longer. \nThese are the same requirements that apply to traders that do business \non NYMEX; require traders to provide such records to the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission (CFTC) or the Justice Department upon \nrequest. Again, these are the same requirements for NYMEX traders; and \nrequire persons in the United States who trade U.S. energy commodities \ndelivered in the U.S. on foreign futures exchanges to keep similar \nrecords and report large trades.\n  The Western Energy Crisis in 2000-2001 provided a wake-up call about \nthe extent to which energy traders can impact demand and drive up \nprices.\n  California and the entire West Coast faced rolling blackouts and \nskyrocketing electricity costs, while companies like Enron, Duke, \nWilliams, AES and Reliant enjoyed record revenues and profits.\n  In California, the cost of electricity was $8 billion in 1999, $27 \nbillion in 2000, $27.5 billion in 2001, and $12 billion in 2002 after \nthe crisis abated. Demand did not increase by more than 150 percent \nbetween 1999 and 2000. But prices did.\n  Why? Because companies like Enron manipulated the market in order to \ndrive the price of electricity up.\n  As a result, Californians have been left with a $40 billion bill. \nThis is an unacceptable burden.\n  One of the main causes of the crisis is a loophole in current law \nthat allows for energy commodities--such as natural gas, electricity, \noil, and gasoline--to be traded on over-the-counter markets with no \nFederal oversight.\n  While over-the-counter trades of all other commodities--pork bellies, \nsoybeans, wheat and rice, for example--are regulated by the Federal \nGovernment, energy trades are not.\n  Our country currently faces natural gas prices that have been \nextremely volatile, and oil prices that have gone through the roof.\n  With gas prices reaching well above $2 per gallon across the country, \nand over $2.50 in my State of California, our constituents deserve to \nknow why those prices are so high.\n  The New York Times has reported that manipulation of electronic \nenergy trades has pushed these prices higher and higher.\n  Testifying at the Enron trial, the former Chief Executive Officer of \nEnron North America and Enron Energy Services, David Delainey was \nasked: ``Is volatility a good thing for a speculative trader?''\n  His response: ``Yes.''\n  When asked to explain his answer, he said: The higher the volatility \nthat you have, the better--the higher the potential profit you can make \nfrom an open position you might have in the marketplace . . . if the \nprice change is only a couple cents either way, you can't make a whole \nlot of money in trading.\n  And if you have, you know, 50, 60 cents, dollar moves in price you're \ngoing to make a lot more money for--for every position you might have . \n. .\n  Unfortunately, Enron's demise did not sound the death knell for \nunregulated over-the-counter energy trades. Instead, these trades now \ntake place on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).\n  Over-the-counter trades performed on ICE are exempt from Federal \noversight. In other words, the CFTC cannot require traders on ICE to \nkeep records or report trades in energy commodities. As a result, the \nCFTC does not have a complete picture of what occurs in the energy \nmarkets.\n  The CFTC has recently asked ICE to provide information for certain \nelectronically traded energy contracts. ICE has agreed to comply. I \nwelcome these positive developments, but nonetheless believe that this \nlegislation is necessary to remove any doubt as to the CFTC's authority \nto mandate these reports and to ensure these requirements are not \nadministratively removed at some later date.\n  In this request, the CFTC has only asked ICE to report those trades \nthat are performed using NYMEX-established prices. NYMEX does not \nestablish prices for electricity, so none of the electricity trades \nwill be reported. This means that under current circumstances, the CFTC \nstill will not be getting a full picture of the energy market from \nICE's reports.\n  Our bill will require reporting of all electronic over-the-counter \nenergy trades and will provide legislative certainty that these trades \nwill be reported.\n  We learned the hard way that if there is no oversight of these \nmarkets, they are subject to manipulation.\n  It is high time to fix this problem. Our bill will do just this.\n  That is why I urge my colleagues to support this bill. The \nlegislation will simply provide the CFTC with the data it needs to \nensure that manipulation and fraud are not taking place on our energy \nmarkets.\n  So who would be against this proposal?\n  The traders who are making millions of dollars off of volatility in \nthese markets. And some of these traders are people who learned their \nskills at Enron--like star-Enron trader John Arnold who made $75 to \n$100 million in 2005 at Centaurus Energy, a hedge fund investing in \nenergy commodities.\n  The other beneficiaries of high oil and natural gas prices are the \nenergy companies themselves. Oil major Chevron made almost $13.4 \nbillion in the first 9 months of 2006--a 34 percent rise in profits \nover the same 9 months in 2005.\n  The number 3 U.S. oil company, ConocoPhillips, reported a 25 percent \nsurge in profits in the first 9 months of 2006, boosted by sharply \nhigher crude oil prices. Net income in the first 9 months of 2006 rose \nto $12.35 billion from $9.85 billion in the same time period of 2005.\n  And ExxonMobil made more money in 2006 than any company in history. \nAll of these record profits are due to the fact that oil prices are so \nhigh.\n  So while consumers are paying more than $2 a gallon at the pump, \ntraders and oil companies are making out like bandits.\n  I hope that we have enough consensus this year to pass this \nlegislation in order to shine some light on our energy markets and \ndetermine if speculation, manipulation, or hoarding is occurring in the \noil, gas, and electricity markets.\n  I would like to thank the following organizations for their support \nof this bill: Agricultural Retailers Association, Air Transport \nAssociation of America, American Public Gas Association, American \nPublic Power Association, Consumer Federation of America, Consumers \nUnion, Industrial Energy Consumers of America, National Association of \nWheat Growers, National Barley Growers Association, New England Fuel \nInitiative, Pacific Northwest Oil Heat Council, Petroleum \nTransportation and Storage Association, Petroleum Marketers Association \nof America, PG Corporation, Sempra, and Southern California Edison.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation and I \nask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 577\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nimprove requirements under the Medicaid program for items and services \nfurnished in or through an educational program or setting to children, \nincluding children with developmental, physical, or mental health \nneeds, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's a privilege to join my Senate and \nHouse colleagues in introducing the ``Protecting Children's Health in \nSchools Act of 2006.'' This bill will ensure that the Nation's 7 \nmillion school children with disabilities will have continued access to \nhealth care in school.\n  In 1975, the Nation made a commitment to guarantee children with \ndisabilities equal access to education. For these children to learn and \nthrive in schools, the integration of education with health care is of \nparamount importance. Coordination with Medicaid makes an immense \ndifference to schools in meeting the needs of these children.\n  This year, however, the Bush Administration has declared its intent \nto end Medicaid reimbursements to schools for the support services they \nneed in order to provide medical and health-related services to \ndisabled children. The Administration is saying ``NO'' to any further \nfinancial help to Medicaid-covered disabled children who need \nspecialized transportation to obtain their health services at school. \nIt is saying ``NO'' to any legitimate reimbursement to the school for \ncosts incurred for administrative duties related to Medicaid services.\n  It's bad enough that Congress and the Administration have not kept \nthe commitment to ``glide-path'' funding of IDEA needs in 2004. Now the \nAdministration proposes to deny funding to schools under the Federal \nprogram that supports the health needs of disabled children. It makes \nno sense to make it so difficult for disabled children to achieve in \nschool--both under IDEA and the No Child Left Behind.\n  At stake is an estimated $3.6 billion in Medicaid funds over the next \nfive years. Such funding is essential to help identify disabled \nchildren and connect them to services that can meet their special \nhealth and learning needs during the school day.\n  This decision by the Administration follows years of resisting \nMedicaid reimbursements to schools that provide these services, without \nclear guidance on how schools should appropriately seek reimbursement.\n  The ``Protecting Children's Health in Schools Act'' recognizes the \nimportance of schools as a site of delivery of health care. It ensures \nthat children with disabilities can continue to obtain health services \nduring the school day. The bill also provides for clear and consistent \nguidelines to be established, so that schools can be held accountable \nand seek appropriate reimbursement.\n  The legislation has the support of over 60 groups, including parents, \nteachers, principals, school boards, and health care providers--people \nwho work with children with disabilities every day and know what is \nneeded to facilitate their growth, development, and long-term success.\n  I urge all of our colleagues to join us in supporting these children \nacross the Nation, by providing the realistic support their schools \nneed in order to meet these basic health care requirements of their \nstudents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/13/senate-section/article/S1922-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1922-S1925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 78--DESIGNATING APRIL 2007 AS ``NATIONAL AUTISM \n   AWARENESS MONTH'' AND SUPPORTING EFFORTS TO INCREASE FUNDING FOR \n    RESEARCH INTO THE CAUSES AND TREATMENT OF AUTISM AND TO IMPROVE \nTRAINING AND SUPPORT FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH AUTISM AND THOSE WHO CARE FOR \n                        INDIVIDUALS WITH AUTISM\n\n  Mr. HAGEL (for himself, Mr. Feingold, and Ms. Stabenow) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                               S. Res. 78\n\n       Whereas autism is a developmental disorder that is \n     typically diagnosed during the first 3 years of life, robbing \n     individuals of their ability to communicate and interact with \n     others;\n       Whereas autism affects an estimated 1 in every 150 children \n     in the United States;\n       Whereas autism is 4 times more likely to occur in boys than \n     in girls;\n       Whereas autism can affect anyone, regardless of race, \n     ethnicity, or other factors;\n       Whereas it costs approximately $80,000 per year to treat an \n     individual with autism in a medical center specializing in \n     developmental disabilities;\n       Whereas the cost of special education programs for school-\n     aged children with autism is often more than $30,000 per \n     individual per year;\n       Whereas the cost nationally of caring for persons affected \n     by autism is estimated at upwards of $90,000,000,000 per \n     year;\n       Whereas despite the fact that autism is one of the most \n     common developmental disorders, many professionals in the \n     medical and educational fields are still unaware of the best \n     methods to diagnose and treat the disorder; and\n       Whereas designating April 2007 as ``National Autism \n     Awareness Month'' will increase public awareness of the need \n     to support individuals with autism and the family members and \n     medical professionals who care for individuals with autism: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 2007 as ``National Autism Awareness \n     Month'';\n       (2) recognizes and commends the parents and relatives of \n     children with autism for their sacrifice and dedication in \n     providing for the special needs of children with autism and \n     for absorbing significant financial costs for specialized \n     education and support services;\n       (3) supports the goal of increasing Federal funding for \n     aggressive research to learn the root causes of autism, \n     identify the best\n\n[[Page S1923]]\n\n     methods of early intervention and treatment, expand programs \n     for individuals with autism across their lifespans, and \n     promote understanding of the special needs of people with \n     autism;\n       (4) stresses the need to begin early intervention services \n     soon after a child has been diagnosed with autism, noting \n     that early intervention strategies are the primary \n     therapeutic options for young people with autism, and that \n     early intervention significantly improves the outcome for \n     people with autism and can reduce the level of funding and \n     services needed to treat people with autism later in life;\n       (5) supports the Federal Government's more than 30-year-old \n     commitment to provide States with 40 percent of the costs \n     needed to educate children with disabilities under part B of \n     the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. \n     1411 et seq.);\n       (6) recognizes the shortage of appropriately trained \n     teachers who have the skills and support necessary to teach, \n     assist, and respond to special needs students, including \n     those with autism, in our school systems; and\n       (7) recognizes the importance of worker training programs \n     that are tailored to the needs of developmentally disabled \n     persons, including those with autism, and notes that people \n     with autism can be, and are, productive members of the \n     workforce if they are given appropriate support, training, \n     and early intervention services.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 79--RELATIVE TO THE DEATH OF REPRESENTATIVE CHARLES \n                      W.

Con. Res. 11\n\n       Whereas there is general consensus among the people of the \n     United States and the global community that, with respect to \n     international trade and investment rules--\n       (1) global environmental, labor, health, food security, and \n     other public interest standards must be strengthened to \n     prevent a global ``race to the bottom'';\n       (2) domestic environmental, labor, health, food security, \n     and other public interest standards and policies must not be \n     undermined, including those based on the use of the \n     precautionary principle (the internationally recognized legal \n     principle that holds that, when there is scientific \n     uncertainty regarding the potential adverse effects of an \n     action, a product, or a technology, a government should act \n     in a way that minimizes the risk of harm to human health and \n     the environment);\n       (3) provision and regulation of public services such as \n     education, health care, transportation, energy, water, and \n     other utilities are basic functions of democratic government \n     and must not be undermined;\n       (4) raising standards in developing countries requires \n     additional assistance and respect for diversity of policies \n     and priorities;\n       (5) countries must be allowed to design and implement \n     policies to sustain family farms and achieve food security;\n       (6) healthy national economies are essential to a healthy \n     global economy, and the right of governments to pursue \n     policies to maintain and create jobs must be upheld;\n       (7) the right of State and local and comparable regional \n     governments of all countries to create and enforce diverse \n     policies must be safeguarded from imposed downward \n     harmonization; and\n       (8) rules for the global economy must be developed and \n     implemented democratically and with transparency and \n     accountability;\n\n       Whereas many international trade and investment agreements \n     in existence and currently being negotiated do not serve \n     these interests; and\n       Whereas many international trade and investment agreements \n     in existence have caused substantial harm to the health and \n     well-being of communities in the United States and within \n     countries that are trading partners of the United States: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That any agreement relating to trade and \n     investment that is negotiated by the executive branch with \n     another country should comply with the following:\n       (1) Requirements applying to all countries.--\n       (A) Investor and investment policy.--If the agreement \n     includes any provision relating to foreign investment, the \n     agreement may not permit a foreign investor to challenge or \n     seek compensation because of a measure of a government at the \n     national, State, or local level that protects the public \n     interest, including a measure that protects public health, \n     safety, and welfare, the environment, and worker protections, \n     unless a foreign investor demonstrates that the measure was \n     enacted or applied primarily for the purpose of \n     discriminating against a foreign investor or foreign \n     investment.\n       (B) Services.--The agreement, to the extent applicable, \n     shall comply with the following:\n       (i) In general.--The agreement may not provide for \n     disciplinary action against a government measure relating \n     to--\n\n       (I) a public service, including public services for which \n     the government is not the sole provider;\n       (II) a service that requires extensive regulation;\n       (III) an essential human service; and\n       (IV) a service that has an essentially social component.\n\n       (ii) Services described.--A service described in clause (i) \n     includes a public benefit program, health care, health \n     insurance, public health, child care, education and training, \n     the distribution of a controlled substance or product \n     (including alcohol, tobacco, and firearms), research and \n     development on a natural or social science, a utility \n     (including an energy utility, water, waste disposal, and \n     sanitation), national security, maritime, air, surface, and \n     other transportation services, a postal service, energy \n     extraction and any related service, and a correctional \n     service.\n       (iii) Revision of commitments.--The agreement shall permit \n     a country that has made a commitment in an area described in \n     clause (i) to revise that commitment for the purposes of \n     public interest regulation without any financial or other \n     trade-related penalty.\n       (iv) Subsidies and government procurement.--The agreement \n     shall ensure that any rule governing a subsidy or government \n     procurement fully protects the ability of a government to \n     support and purchase a service in a way that promotes \n     economic development, social justice and equity, public \n     health, environmental quality, human rights, and the rights \n     of workers.\n       (v) Regulation of foreign investors.--The agreement shall \n     guarantee that all governments that are parties to the \n     agreement may regulate foreign investors in services and \n     other service providers in order to protect public health and \n     safety, consumers, the environment, and workers' rights, \n     without requiring the governments to establish their \n     regulations to be the least burdensome option for foreign \n     service providers.\n       (C) Environmental, labor, and other public interest \n     standards.--The agreement--\n\n[[Page S1924]]\n\n       (i) may not supersede the rights and obligations of parties \n     under multilateral environmental, labor, and human rights \n     agreements;\n       (ii) shall, to the extent applicable, include commitments--\n\n       (I) to adhere to specified workers' rights and \n     environmental standards;\n       (II) to enforce existing domestic labor and environmental \n     provisions; and\n       (III) to abide by the core labor standards of the \n     International Labor Organization; and\n\n       (iii) shall subject the commitments described in clause \n     (ii) to binding enforcement on the same terms as commercial \n     provisions.\n       (D) Food safety.--The agreement may not--\n       (i) require international harmonization of food safety \n     standards in a manner that undermines the level of human \n     health protection provided under the laws of a country; or\n       (ii) restrict the ability of governments to enact policies \n     to guarantee the right of consumers to know where and how \n     food is produced.\n       (E) Agriculture and food security.--The agreement may not, \n     with respect to food and other agricultural commodities--\n       (i) contain provisions that prevent countries from--\n\n       (I) establishing domestic and global reserves;\n       (II) managing supply;\n       (III) enforcing antidumping provisions;\n       (IV) ensuring fair market prices; or\n       (V) vigorously enforcing antitrust laws, in order to \n     guarantee competitive markets for family farmers; or\n\n       (ii) prevent countries from developing the necessary \n     sanitary and phytosanitary standards to prevent the \n     introduction of pathogens or other potentially invasive \n     species that may adversely affect agriculture, human health, \n     or the environment.\n       (F) Governmental authority.--The agreement may not contain \n     provisions that bind national, State, local, or comparable \n     regional governments to limiting regulatory, taxation, \n     spending, or procurement authority--\n       (i) without sufficient transparency as described in \n     paragraph (4), including an opportunity for public review and \n     comment; and\n       (ii) without the explicit, informed consent of the \n     national, State, local, or comparable regional legislative \n     body concerned.\n       (G) Access to medicines and seeds.--\n       (i) Medicines.--The agreement may not contain provisions \n     that prevent countries from taking measures to protect public \n     health by ensuring access to medicines.\n       (ii) Seeds.--The agreement may not constrain the rights of \n     farmers to save, use, exchange, or sell farm-saved seeds and \n     other publicly available seed varieties.\n       (2) Requirements applying to only the united states.--\n       (A) Temporary entry of workers.--The agreement may not--\n       (i) make a new commitment on the temporary entry of \n     workers, because such policies should be determined by the \n     Congress, after consideration by the congressional committees \n     with jurisdiction over immigration, to avoid an array of \n     inconsistent policies; or\n       (ii) include any policy that fails to--\n\n       (I) include labor market tests that ensure that the \n     employment of temporary workers will not adversely affect \n     other similarly employed workers;\n       (II) involve labor unions in the labor certification \n     process implemented under the immigration program for \n     temporary workers granted nonimmigrant status under section \n     101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1101(a)(H)(i)(b)), including the filing by an employer \n     of an application under section 212(n)(1) of that Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1182(n)(1)); or\n       (III) guarantee the same workplace protections for \n     temporary workers that are available to all workers.\n\n       (B) Policies to support united states workers and small, \n     minority, and women-owned businesses.--The agreement shall \n     preserve the right of Federal, State, and local governments \n     to maintain or establish policies to support United States \n     workers and small, minority, or women-owned businesses, \n     including policies with respect to government procurement, \n     loans, and subsidies.\n       (C) United states trade laws.--The agreement may not--\n       (i) contain a provision that modifies or amends, or \n     requires a modification of or an amendment to, any law of the \n     United States regarding safeguards from unfair foreign trade \n     practices, including any law providing for--\n\n       (I) the imposition of countervailing or antidumping duties;\n       (II) protection from unfair methods of competition or \n     unfair acts in the importation of articles;\n       (III) relief from injury caused by import competition;\n       (IV) relief from unfair trade practices; or\n       (V) the imposition of import restrictions to protect \n     national security; or\n\n       (ii) weaken the existing terms of the Agreement on \n     Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on \n     Tariffs and Trade 1994, or the Agreement on Subsidies and \n     Countervailing Measures, of the World Trade Organization, \n     including through the domestic implementation of rulings of \n     dispute settlement bodies.\n       (D) Food safety.--The agreement may not--\n       (i) restrict the ability of the United States to ensure \n     that food products entering the United States are rigorously \n     inspected to establish that they meet all food safety \n     standards in the United States, including inspection \n     standards; or\n       (ii) force the United States to accept different food \n     safety standards as ``equivalent'', in a manner that \n     undermines the level of human health protection provided \n     under domestic law.\n       (3) Treatment of developing countries.--The agreement shall \n     grant special and differential treatment for developing \n     countries with regard to the timeframe for implementation of \n     the agreement as well as other concerns.\n       (4) Transparency.--\n       (A) In general.--The process of negotiating the agreement \n     shall be open and transparent, including through--\n       (i) prompt and regular disclosure of full negotiating \n     texts; and\n       (ii) prompt and regular disclosure of negotiating positions \n     of the United States.\n       (B) Public availability of offers and requests.--In \n     negotiating the agreement, any request or offer relating to \n     investment, procurement, or trade in services must be made \n     public within 10 days after its submission if such request or \n     offer--\n       (i) proposes that specific Federal, State, or local laws or \n     regulations in the United States, including subsidies, tax \n     rules, procurement rules, professional standards, and rules \n     on temporary entry of persons, be changed, eliminated, or \n     scheduled under the agreement;\n       (ii) proposes to cover under the agreement--\n\n       (I) specific essential public services, including public \n     benefits programs, health care, education, national security, \n     sanitation, water, energy, and other utilities; or\n       (II) private service sectors that require extensive \n     regulation or have an inherently social component, including \n     maritime, air transport, trucking, and other transportation \n     services, postal services, utilities such as water, energy, \n     and sanitation, corrections, education and childcare, and \n     health care; or\n\n       (iii) proposes an action or process of general application \n     that may interfere with the ability of the United States or \n     State, local, or tribal governments to adopt, implement, or \n     enforce laws and regulations identified in clause (ii)(I) or \n     to provide or regulate services identified in clause \n     (ii)(II).\n       (C) Representation of interests.--The broad array of \n     constituencies representing the majority of the people of the \n     United States, including labor unions, environmental \n     organizations, consumer groups, family farm groups, public \n     health advocates, faith-based organizations, and civil rights \n     groups, must have at least the same representation on trade \n     advisory committees and the same access to trade negotiators \n     and negotiating fora as those constituencies representing \n     commercial interests.\n       (D) Dispute resolution mechanisms.--Any dispute resolution \n     mechanism established in the agreement shall be open and \n     transparent, including through disclosure to the public of \n     documents and access to hearings, and must permit \n     participation by nonparties through the filing of amicus \n     briefs, as well as provide for standing for State and local \n     governments as intervenors.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to again submit a measure \nto begin to address one of the central problems our Nation faces, \nnamely the loss of family-supporting jobs because of our flawed trade \npolicies.\n  Today's announcement that the U.S. trade deficit for 2006 rose to \n$764 billion, setting a record for the fifth consecutive year, is a \nstark reminder of just how seriously flawed our trade policies are. \nThose policies have far reaching consequences, and they require a \nmultifaceted response.\n  One response must be to take on the trade deficit directly, and I \nhave been pleased to join the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, to \ndo just that.\n  But we also must change the agreements into which we enter with our \ntrading partners.\n  The record of the major trade agreements into which our Nation has \nentered over the past few years has been dismal. Thanks in great part \nto the flawed fast track rules that govern consideration of legislation \nimplementing trade agreements, the United States has entered into a \nnumber of trade agreements that have contributed to the significant job \nloss we have seen in recent years, and have laid open to assault \nvarious laws and regulations established to protect workers, the \nenvironment, and our health and safety. Indeed, those agreements \nundermine the very democratic institutions through which we govern \nourselves.\n  The loss of jobs, especially manufacturing jobs, to other countries \nhas been devastating to Wisconsin, and to the entire country. When I \nopposed the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Uruguay round of \nthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,\n\n[[Page S1925]]\n\nPermanent Normal Trade Relations for China, and other flawed trade \nmeasures, I did so in great part because I believed they would lead to \na significant loss of jobs. But even as an opponent of those \nagreements, I don't think I could have imagined just how bad things \nwould get in so short a time.\n  The trade policy of this country over the past several years has been \nappalling. The trade agreements into which we have entered have \ncontributed to the loss of key employers, ravaging entire communities. \nBut despite that clear evidence, we continue to see trade agreements \nbeing reached that will only aggravate this problem.\n  This has to stop. We cannot afford to pursue trade policies that gut \nour manufacturing sector and send good jobs overseas. We cannot afford \nto undermine the safeguards we have established for workers, the \nenvironment, and our public health and safety. And we cannot afford to \nchip way at our democratic heritage by entering into trade agreements \nthat supercede our right to govern ourselves through open, democratic \ninstitutions.\n  The legislation I am introducing today addresses this problem, at \nleast in part. It establishes some minimum standards for the trade \nagreements into which our Nation enters. It sets forth principles for \nfuture trade agreements. It is a break with the so-called NAFTA model, \nand instead advocates the kinds of sound trade policies that will spur \neconomic growth and sustainable development.\n  The principles set forth in this resolution are not complex. They are \nstraightforward and achievable. The resolution calls for enforceable \nworker protections, including the core International Labor Organization \nstandards.\n  It preserves the ability of the United States to enact and enforce \nits own trade laws.\n  It protects foreign investors, but states that foreign investors \nshould not be provided with greater rights than those provided under \nU.S. law, and it protects public interest laws from challenge by \nforeign investors in secret tribunals.\n  It ensures that food entering into our country meets domestic food \nsafety standards.\n  It preserves the ability of Federal, State, and local governments to \nmaintain essential public services and to regulate private sector \nservices in the public interest.\n  It requires that trade agreements contain environmental provisions \nsubject to the same enforcement as commercial provisions.\n  It preserves the right of Federal, State, and local governments to \nuse procurement as a policy tool, including through Buy American laws, \nenvironmental laws such as recycled content, and purchasing preferences \nfor small, minority, or women-owned businesses.\n  It requires that trade negotiations and the implementation of trade \nagreements be conducted openly.\n  These are sensible policies, and will advance the goal of increased \ninternational commerce.\n  The outgrowth of the major trade agreements into which we have \nentered has been a race to the bottom in labor standards, environmental \nstandards, health and safety standards, in nearly every aspect of our \neconomy. A race to the bottom is a race in which even the winners lose.\n  For any who doubt this, I invite you to ask the families in Wisconsin \nwho have watched their jobs move to China.\n  We can't let this continue to happen. We need to turn our trade \npolicies around. We need to pursue trade agreements that will promote \nsustainable economic growth for our Nation and for our trading \npartners. This resolution will begin to put us on that path, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/13/senate-section/article/S1925-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 264.
