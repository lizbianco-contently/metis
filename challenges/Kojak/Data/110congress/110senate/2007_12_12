Mr. President, the Senate will be in a period of morning \nbusiness for 3 hours this morning. The reason for the inordinate amount \nof time is that--I will make a presentation in a little bit to get this \nstarted--we have more than 100 pieces of legislation that are held up, \nlegislation that could move so very quickly, in a matter of minutes. \nBut we cannot do that because there are Republican holds on these \nbills.\n  So we are going to go through our period of time this morning, asking \nconsent to move to these bills. We hope some of them will pass. Some of \nthem we should get done.\n  The leading cause of death in 20 States in the United States for \nchildren under age 14 is getting caught in the drains of swimming \npools. It has been somewhat noted because John Edwards had one of the \nfirst legal cases in that regard.\n  Alaska, where you would not think there are a lot of swimming pools, \nor at least I would not, but there obviously are lots of swimming \npools, that is the leading cause of death in Alaska for children.\n  We have a hold on that bill. It passed the House with three \ndissenting votes, 418 to 3. We cannot pass that. There are children \ndying while we are not able to proceed on something such as that. There \nare over 100 issues similar to that. It is not right. So if people \nwonder why we are spending so much time, that is the reason. Maybe we \nwill get some of these people who are on the other side of the aisle \nwho object to this to come, rather than these hidden holds, and speak.\n  It is not good for the body. If there are problems with a piece of \nlegislation, that is one thing. But take that one case as an example. \nFollowing morning business, we will conduct two rollcall votes in \nrelation to the two Gregg amendments. Other amendments will be debated \nfollowing the Gregg votes and more rollcall votes will occur through \nthe day and into the evening.\n  I would like to commend Senators Harkin and Chambliss for their work \nthey have accomplished in getting an agreement with respect to the \namendments. As to the list of amendments right now, all 20 Republican \namendments have been offered; the Democrats have offered 8 or 9.\n  The work they have done in the last few days I think has been \nexemplary. While they were successful in getting agreements on these \namendments, other amendments will still need to be debated and voted on \nor accepted by the two managers.\n  As the year comes to a close, and the first year of the 110th \nCongress winds down, there is no doubt, if we continue in the current \ndirection, this will be known as the Congress of Republican \nobstruction.\n  Already, in 1 year, Republicans have arrived at the all-time \nobstruction record for a full 2-year session. What we are seeing this \nyear from Republicans is not ordinary obstruction, it is obstruction on \nsteroids. It is terribly damaging to the American people. I do not \nquestion the right of Republicans to block bills, in fact, block bill \nafter bill; that is how the Senate has worked. And we all play by the \nsame rules. But because you have the right does not make it right.\n\n  On a daily basis, Republican Senators talk about the lack of progress \nthis year. For all we have done, why have we not done more, they say. \nThe answer is obstruction, Republican obstruction. It is disingenuous \nfor Republicans to complain about a lack of progress and then make a \nconcerted effort to block change----\n  Obstruction of the prescription drug bill, to make medicines more \naffordable. We have been able to accomplish a lot, but it has been \ndifficult when we have had to file about 60 cloture petitions.\n  We have been able to do some good things with the minimum wage, 9/11 \nCommission recommendations, the landmark ethics and lobbying reform, we \nhave done some good work with mine resistant combat vehicles, we have \ngiven the National Guard equipment they need, we have stepped in and \nlooked at the plight of American veterans based on the Walter Reed \nscandal.\n  We have revitalized the Gulf Coast after Katrina, disaster relief for \nsmall business and farmers, Western wildfire relief. We have looked \ninto the scandal relating to the U.S. attorneys. We passed legislation \nto help correct that. We have passed the WRDA, Water Resources \nDevelopment Act, and a competitiveness bill led by Senators Bingaman \nand Alexander, we have been able to get that done.\n  We have done the most significant change to college education since \nthe GI Bill of Rights. We have been able to do some good things \nregarding the Internet, keeping the Internet tax free, expanding Head \nStart. We have done some good things.\n  But we have been stopped from doing other important things. The \nprescription drug bill is a perfect example. As we speak, companies can \ngo negotiate for lower priced drugs for their employees. The Veterans' \nAdministration can negotiate for lower prices for veterans but Medicare \ncannot. There is a prohibition that Medicare cannot negotiate for lower \npriced drugs. That should be changed. We tried to change it. It was \nblocked; obstruction of our efforts to change the course in Iraq; \nobstruction of our efforts to pass an AMT fix in a fiscally responsible \nway; obstruction of our FHA bill, a bill that President Bush has called \nupon us to pass that would help Americans save their homes from \nforeclosure.\n  These are a few of the well-known examples. My Democratic colleagues \nand I this morning are going to talk about some of the lesser known \npriorities Republicans have blocked. These bills might not make \nheadlines, but they will make a difference in people's lives, such as \nthe swimming pool drains I talked about.\n  All these bills we will seek to pass today will make our country \nstronger. Every single one of them has fallen victim to Republican \nobstruction. There are no serious complaints about the bills which we \nseek to pass this morning, at least I do not think so. Many of them \nhave already more than 50 cosponsors, Democrats and Republicans--we \nacknowledge mostly Democrats but Democrats and Republicans.\n  Many have already been overwhelmingly passed by the House of \nRepresentatives and could be sent to the President's desk this \nafternoon. This morning's bills, though, are the tip of the iceberg. We \ncan come to the floor tomorrow or the next day and days after that and \nseek action on bills similar to these that we are going to talk about.\n  So we hope in the coming hours, the Republican minority will call off \ntheir needless holds, call off their obstruction, call off their \npolitical posturing and start working with us to make life better for \nthe American people.\n  As I indicated, a number of my colleagues will follow. What I am \ngoing to talk about now, I am going to talk about the ALS registry--\nALS, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, the Lou Gehrig's disease, this \ngreat first baseman for the New York Yankees who was a man of iron who \ncould not overcome this disease.\n  Similar to all people who get this disease, from the time it is \ndiscovered until you die is an average of 18 months. We have all had \nfriends and relatives who have suffered and died from this disease. It \nis caused by a degeneration of the nerve cells that control voluntary \nmuscle, which causes muscle weakness and atrophy. It is nearly always \nfatal. It may give victims, as I have indicated, a short time to live.\n  Once in a while you find someone who lives several years, and that is \na blessing in their lives. Early this year, a woman named Kathie \nBarrett and her husband Martin traveled to Washington, DC, from Sparks, \nNV, to advocate on behalf of the ALS registry.\n  What is a registry? It is the first step to solve the problems of \ndisease. Many years ago, they developed a cancer registry. I was \ninvolved in setting up one for a disease called interstitial cystitis. \nIt is a disease that afflicts mostly women; 90 percent of the people \nwho\n\n[[Page S15159]]\n\nhave the disease are women. It is a bladder disease that is \ntremendously debilitating. I had three women visit me in my Las Vegas \noffice. They did not want to be there. They were there out of \ndesperation. They all had this disease, which was thought for many \nyears to be psychosomatic.\n  It is best described as shoving slivers of glass up and down one's \nbladder. What was the first thing we had to do? We developed a \nregistry. As a result of that, 40 percent of the people who have this \ndisease are no longer suffering. They are symptom free.\n  Medicine was developed. It does not take care of everyone, but \nbecause of the registry, they were able to determine how people are \naffected, where they are affected, in different parts of the country, \nand how different medicines work. That is what we are trying to do \nhere, develop, on behalf of Lou Gehrig's disease, a registry.\n  Kathie was diagnosed with this disease in May of 2002. She is still \nalive, which is a miracle. Despite having a breathing capacity of about \n60 percent of normal, with considerable muscle loss in her neck and \nback, she made the long trip from Sparks, 2,600 miles. She and her \nhusband made that trip because they believe passage of this registry is \nessential to the search for a cure for this devastating illness.\n  Every year about 6,000 people learn they have this disease, for which \nthere is no cure, and only one specific FDA-approved drug. That drug \nworks on 20 percent of the patients, and even for them, it extends life \nfor usually less than a year. So for a number of reasons, ALS has \nproven particularly difficult for scientists and doctors to make \nprogress upon.\n  One of the reasons is there is not a centralized place for data \ncollected on the disease. Right now, that is the case. There is only a \npatchwork of data about ALS available to researchers. So this \nlegislation, the ALS Registry Act, will do something that is both \nsimple and crucial. It would create an ALS registry at the Centers for \nDisease Control to help arm our Nation's researchers and clinicians \nwith the tools and information they need to make progress in the fight \nagainst this dread disease.\n  The data made available by a registry will potentially allow \nscientists to identify causes of the disease and maybe even lead to the \ndiscovery of a new treatment, a cure for ALS or even a way to prevent \nthe disease in the first place.\n  This may not lead to a cure overnight, but it will give those who \nsuffer reason for hope, real scientific hope. If you are looking for \nbipartisanship, look no further. The House recently passed a similar \nmeasure, H.R. 2295, by a vote of 411 to 3. How often does anything pass \nthe House by such a large margin?\n  Before the Thanksgiving recess, the HELP Committee in the Senate \nfollowed suit by reporting the ALS Registry Act unanimously. What is \nmore, two-thirds of the Senate, Democrats and Republicans alike, are \ncosponsors. I am appreciative of the work of my Republican colleagues, \nSenators Warner and Enzi, as well, of course, Senator Kennedy, who is \nalways out front on these issues.\n\n  Unfortunately, despite the nearly unanimous support of the House of \nRepresentatives, the unanimous committee vote, and the overwhelming \nsupport of 67 cosponsors, we have objections--all over here, of course. \nFor Kathie and Martin Barrett of Sparks and many thousands just like \nthem, hope remains unfulfilled. Why has this happened? This crucial \nbill has been subjected to Republican holds. While some Republicans \nstand in the way, people's lives hang in the balance. Let's not forget \nthe average life expectancy for an individual with this disease, after \nit is diagnosed, is 18 months, a year and a half. This is not a moment \nwhen we should stall. We don't have a moment to spare. We should send \nthis bill to the President today. I ask my Republicans, please end \ntheir holds, end this senseless obstruction. The eyes of the Barretts \nand tens of thousands of Americans suffering are upon us. Let's honor \ntheir courage and grace by fulfilling their hope for a cure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the ALS bill that is now \nbefore the Senate be read three times, passed, and any statements \nrelated thereto be printed in the Record at the appropriate place.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Reserving the right to object, would the Senator modify \nhis request to include the passage of S. 2340, the troop funding bill?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, isn't this something? Would I modify my \nrequest for the Barretts from Sparks to get billions of dollars for the \ntroops in Iraq? The answer is no. We have just appropriated $470 \nbillion, and there will be appropriate measures before we leave here to \ndirect, if the Senate wills, funding for the troops. I think the \nAmerican people should see this. Would I modify my request to allow for \nmore money for the war in Iraq at this time? The answer is no. This is \nan issue dealing with Lou Gehrig's disease, not a debate on the war in \nIraq. It deals with people who are sick.\n  I had in my office last night two marines. One of them lost both his \nlegs, a wonderful young man, 21 years old. With him was a man who had \njust gotten out of bed to come to my office. He was on his fourth tour \nof duty before he got blown up in Iraq. We care about those people in \nIraq. We care about them a lot. That is why we appropriated $470 \nbillion for the military. That is why we are well aware of the need to \ntake a look at funding for more in Iraq. We have given the troops \neverything they have needed. We, the Democrats, have given them more \nthan the President has requested, with money for MRAPs, for veterans \ncoming home. I hope everyone sees this for what it is.\n  Will I agree to modify my request to allow for more money for Iraq at \nthis time? The answer is no.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am sorry the majority leader has \nobjected. The fact is, unless we act promptly, the Department of \nDefense will be forced to issue potential furlough notices to almost \n100,000 civilian employees at the Department of Defense, since they are \nrequired to do so at least 60 days in advance--hardly something anyone \nwould welcome during the holiday season. Our Army will be out of funds \nby mid-February, the Marine Corps by March. This demonstrates almost \nsort of an attention deficit disorder when it comes to finishing the \nwork of the Congress. We have been on the farm bill. Now we are off the \nfarm bill to do something else without finishing the work before us. I \nam disappointed, but the Senator does have a right to object. I respect \nthat.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Secretary of Defense, Mr. Gates, told \nall of us the Wednesday before we broke for Thanksgiving that the \ntroops would be fine--the Army until the first of March, the Marines \nuntil the middle of March. That is what he told us. I believe him. I \nhave talked to him since then. He has confirmed that. I know there is \nspin from the White House that they are going to start laying people \noff. Let's be realistic.\n  We have a request before the Senate to allow a registry to be created \nso we can try to find a cure for a dread disease. We are going to be \nout of here hopefully in a few days, hopefully a week or 10 days. We \nare going to complete the funding for our country prior to that time. \nPart of that consideration--I have spoken to my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle--is what do we do about the President's request, his \n$196 billion request for more money for Iraq. We have to take a look at \nthat. We want to take a look at that.\n  I am concerned that we fund the Government. We don't want a \nGovernment shutdown. Maybe some people in the White House would like \nthat. We don't want a Government shutdown. We are going to work very \nhard to accomplish that.\n  Today, there are going to be a number of requests for pieces of \nlegislation that are important. I believe people with Lou Gehrig's \ndisease deserve a few minutes of our time today. That is what I asked \nthat we pass. It was objected to. I understand that, but that is really \ntoo bad. That is legislation creating a registry so people can try to \nfind out what causes this disease,\n\n[[Page S15160]]\n\nwhere the disease occurs in our country. It was objected to. That is \ntoo bad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/12/senate-section/article/S15160-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, what we are going to witness for the \nnext 3 hours is the kind of thing that gives the public such a low \nimpression of Congress. Looking at the new Gallup poll that just came \nout, the President has a 37-percent approval rating--certainly not \nanything to applaud if you are a Republican. But the Democratic \nCongress has a 22-percent approval rating, 15 percent below the \nPresident. Why is that? I think it is because the American public \nthought they sent us here to legislate. Obviously, in a body such as \nthe Senate, in order to legislate you have to do things on a bipartisan \nbasis. We are very different from the House of Representatives. We are \nactually beginning to make progress on the farm bill, although I must \nsay we have only had one vote this entire week. It is Wednesday \nmorning, and we have had one vote. The farm bill now is ready to move \nforward, and we are taking, at the insistence of the majority, 3 hours \nthis morning to finger-point and make excuses and try to explain to the \nAmerican people why we haven't been able to do enough on a bipartisan \nbasis to achieve anything on their behalf.\n  It is now December 12, nearly a quarter of the way through the fiscal \nyear. To date, we have had only one spending bill signed into law. The \ntroops in the field haven't been funded. The Energy bill is still \npending. Updates to the laws governing our terrorist surveillance \nprogram so that we can track terrorists and prevent attacks haven't \nbeen addressed.\n  As I indicated, we are spending 3 hours this morning engaged in what \nwill essentially be a finger-pointing exercise instead of making \nfurther progress on the farm bill, which is poised to be completed if \nwe will just stay on it. Christmas is less than 2 weeks away. You would \nthink there would be a flurry of activity on the floor. You would think \nwe would be doing everything possible so we could finish our work \nbefore New Year's Eve. But, as I indicated earlier, so far this week we \nhave had one vote, and this is Wednesday.\n  Surely the majority has scheduled votes all day today; right? Wrong. \nWe will not even consider the pending business, the farm bill, until at \nleast this afternoon. And why do we have to wait until this afternoon? \nIs it so we can spend the morning addressing tax relief or the cost of \ngasoline or our troops and veterans? None of the above. We are gathered \nhere this morning so the majority can spend hours of valuable floor \ntime trying to score political points instead of trying to make law.\n  As I indicated earlier, they have set aside 3 hours to try to show \nthat this session's very limited accomplishments haven't been their \nfault, that the endless investigations and midnight Iraq votes were not \nthe cause. They have set aside this time as if magically in the next 3 \nhours they will somehow pass the litany of things they have not been \nable to accomplish over the past 3 months.\n  Let's not waste even more time relearning the lessons of the past. \nPartisanship and refusal to work with the minority may get you a \nheadline, but it won't get bills signed into law. If you are serious \nabout accomplishments, let's get back to work. Let's work together so \nthat instead of pointing fingers, this Congress can actually point to \nsome accomplishments. It is December 12. There is simply no time for \npolitical exercises on the Senate floor.

Isn't this perfect? The minority leader on the Republican \nside comes to the floor, lamenting the fact that we aren't moving to \nthe farm bill immediately. I think there is something in the water in \nthe U.S. Capitol that leads to political amnesia. The Senator from \nKentucky has obviously forgotten that we sat on the floor and \nlanguished for more than 2 weeks because the Republicans presented us \nwith 200 amendments to the farm bill and wouldn't narrow them down to a \nreasonable number we could consider. We sat here for 2 straight weeks \nand did nothing. Now the Senator from Kentucky has great angst over the \nthought that we might even talk about anything else before we return to \nthe farm bill at noon.\n  Trust me, we will return at noon. We should have finished it weeks \nago. We could have finished it weeks ago if the Senator from Kentucky \nhad gathered his Republican conference together and said: Please, once \nevery 5 years we consider a farm bill. We don't consider amendments of \neverything under the sun--the Tax Code, medical malpractice. We focus \non the farm bill, on nutrition and rural development and agricultural \nprograms. If he had done that, if he had gathered his Republicans \ntogether and asked for a modicum of cooperation, we would have finished \nthe farm bill weeks ago.\n  Now he comes to the Senate floor with a heavy heart that we might \nspend the next 2\\1/2\\ hours talking about something other than the farm \nbill. He has forgotten, obviously, what has transpired. But the \nCongressional Record tells the story. The record is there for America \nto see.\n  This Republican minority has taken us to a new place in the Senate. \nThey have broken a record. I don't think another Congress will be able \nto match what they have been able to do, at least I hope not. There is \nsomething in the Senate called a filibuster. A filibuster is a time-\nhonored tradition where an individual Senator can virtually stop debate \non a measure by standing and speaking. Most people are familiar with it \nbecause of the popular movie of 50 or 60 years ago, ``Mr. Smith Goes to \nWashington.'' Jimmy Stewart stood at his desk, this brandnew Senator, \nfighting against the odds and against the establishment until he \ncrumbled in exhaustion. His filibuster ended as he was physically \nspent. That was an image emblazoned on the minds of many across America \nof a Senate where one person can stand and fight to the bitter end.\n  There is some truth to that movie. In a filibuster, any Senator can \ntake the floor on an amendable measure and hold the floor as long as \nthey are physically able to do so. The record may be held by Senator \nThurmond of South Carolina. If I am not mistaken, he spent some 24 \nhours once in the midst of one of these filibusters.\n  I remember reading an account, incidentally. The first man I ever \nworked for in the Senate was a Senator from Illinois named Paul \nDouglas. They knew Strom Thurmond was going to initiate this \nfilibuster. They also knew they might be able to end the filibuster \nearly if he had to take a break for a trip to the restroom. They knew \nSenator Thurmond was partial to orange juice, and they brought a \npitcher of orange juice on the Senate floor next to his desk, hoping he \nwould drink it and\n\n[[Page S15161]]\n\nit would end the filibuster. It did not work. He went on for 24 hours.\n  You can do it, and the only way to stop it is to file a motion to \nclose off that debate called a cloture motion. So in the history of the \nSenate, the record is, in the course of 2 years, 61 filibusters--\nroughly 30 filibusters a year. That is the record. Rarely have we \nreached that number--until this year. The Republican minority has now \nbroken the all-time record for filibusters in the Senate. I believe the \nnumber is 58--58--filibusters. So 58 times they have stopped the \nSenate, sometimes for the required 30 hours, but sometimes for weeks at \na time. They have taken the role of the Senate--a deliberative body--\nand turned it into an obstacle course where they toss filibusters in \nfront of every suggestion we make.\n  Well, I respect this place. I respect this institution. I am honored \nto serve here. But I think the Republican minority has abused the \ntradition of the Senate. Fifty-eight filibusters in 1 year--and we are \nnot even finished. This is an indication of their fear--their fear of \nchange, their fear of new legislation, their fear that perhaps we would \nput together a bipartisan answer to some of the challenges facing \nAmerica, their fear we will write a record of accomplishment that they \nfailed to write when they were in charge. That is what drives this--\nfear, fear of the future, fear of change. They are a party without an \nidentity. It is the party of the past using the tactics of the past, \nand America can see it.\n  I listened to Senator Reid of Nevada, our majority leader. He came to \nthe Senate floor to talk about one piece of legislation which he asked \nto bring up for a vote. It is not a radical idea. It is not a big \ngovernment program. It is not an increase in taxes or anything like it. \nSimply put, it is a registry for those afflicted with ALS, Lou Gehrig's \ndisease, in the hopes that gathering that information about the \nvictims--where they live, how old they are, and their circumstances--\nwill help us not only provide medication for them but learn about this \ndisease.\n  Can you think of anything more bipartisan than that? The first victim \nI ever personally saw with Lou Gehrig's disease was a man who served in \nthis Chamber. He was a man who was a Senator from the State of New \nYork. I mentioned Paul Douglas earlier, who I thought was one of the \nbest who ever served in our State. I once asked him, as a college \nstudent: Who were the greatest U.S. Senators?\n  He said: I think Wayne Morse is one of the greatest. And he said: Of \ncourse, Jacob Javits--a Republican Senator from New York, who was \nhonored and respected by my mentor and hero, Paul Douglas, a Democrat \nfrom Illinois.\n  Well, when I came to the House of Representatives, Jacob Javits had \nretired and was a victim of ALS. I would see him in this heroic role, \ncoming to Washington, lobbying Members of the House and the Senate for \nresearch funds on Lou Gehrig's disease. He was in a wheelchair. He had \nlost the use of his arms and legs but for just a minor amount of \nfunction he had in one hand, and he was on a respirator. He was moving \naround in a motorized wheelchair, on a respirator, begging for funds \nfor research for Lou Gehrig's disease.\n  How could you ever forget that image? I cannot.\n  I think of my neighbor in Springfield, IL, Mary Winning. She lives a \nblock away. Her husband Jim was my law partner for years. Mary came to \nme one day half in anger and half in tears over a diagnosis in her \nfamily of ALS and the fact that she did not think our Government was \ndoing enough for research on Lou Gehrig's disease. I know how much it \nmeant to her and her family.\n  I think of going through the Springfield airport last year and seeing \na young man who had been a volunteer in one of my early campaigns. I \nsaid hello to him. He was not there the next week, and I asked what \nhappened. He said, well, he had to quit. He has a history of Lou \nGehrig's disease in his family, and he has been diagnosed. Senator Reid \nsaid he has, perhaps, 18 months to live.\n  So Senator Reid comes to the floor and asks the Republicans to take \noff the hold on the bill for Lou Gehrig's disease. He asked them to \nstop the obstruction, to give the bill a chance--not to just guarantee \nit is going to pass. He would have accepted a rollcall, I am sure. Just \ngive us a chance to bring that up on the Senate floor. How much time \nwould it take? Thirty minutes? Of course, there was an objection. The \nSenator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn, objected to bringing up the bill on the \nLou Gehrig's disease registry in America--objected to bringing up the \nbill. His reason? He will not let us bring up that bill until we are \nprepared----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to extend my \nremarks under morning business for an additional 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. He, of course, wants us to only allow a registry for Lou \nGehrig's patients if we will allow a debate on providing $50 billion, \n$60 billion, $70 billion more for the war in Iraq--not paid for--and \nthat it happen immediately, even though we have been told by the \nmilitary they have enough funds to continue this war until at least the \nend of February, the first of March.\n  Well, that is the price we would have to pay under the Republican \nagenda to bring up a bill for the Lou Gehrig's registry. That is sad, \nand it shows you the extremes they will go to to stop even the most \nbenign and bipartisan bill we can think of.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/12/senate-section/article/S15161-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15161-S15165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nVETERANS TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND HEALTH PROGRAMS IMPROVEMENT ACT OF \n          2007 AND VETERANS' BENEFITS ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Last month, Mr. President, I came to the floor and asked \nunanimous consent for two bills from the Senate Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee--I did not ask that the bills be passed, only that they be \nbrought to the floor and considered. I talked to Senator Reid of Nevada \nabout this and wanted to give Senator Reid the option to determine the \namount of time in the debate, in consultation with the Republican \nminority.\n  At that time, just as this morning, a Republican Senator--in that \ncase, Senator Larry Craig of Idaho--objected. Why? Well, they objected \nbecause they did not want us to move to issues involving America's \nveterans. I think our veterans deserve to have legislation such as the \nbills I have asked to be considered.\n  The first of the two bills is the Veterans Traumatic Brain Injury and \nHealth Programs Improvement Act of 2007. That bill would allow 1.3 \nmillion middle-income veterans to enroll for VA health care and \nincrease the VA's beneficiary travel reimbursement rate--the first time \nthat travel reimbursement rate would be increased in 30 years--to help \nveterans living in rural and remote areas.\n  There are programs, as well, for the treatment of veterans with \ntraumatic brain injuries, the signature injury of the Iraq war.\n  Finally, the bill provides aid for homeless veterans, which is \nespecially important at a time when one out of four homeless people you \nsee on the streets in America are veterans.\n  I asked that this bill be brought up, that we agree on a time limit, \nconsider it, and pass it.\n  Do you know how many speeches have been given on the floor of the \nSenate by Members on both sides of the aisle about our devotion to our \nsoldiers, our men and women in uniform? Do you know how many speeches \nhave been given on this floor on both sides of the aisle about how much \nwe care and owe to our veterans? I am sure you could fill many \nCongressional Records.\n  So if this job is about more than just speeches and is about doing \nsomething to actually help our veterans, how could the Republicans \ncontinue to object? Object to helping veterans make it to the VA \nclinics and hospitals? Object to finding ways to eliminate homelessness \namong veterans? Object to the idea of expanding medical care for \nveterans who are the victims of traumatic brain injury?\n  If you want to vote against it, so be it. But to not even let us \nbring the bill to the floor for consideration? They did.\n  The second bill is the Veterans' Benefits Enhancement Act. This \ncomprehensive legislation would improve\n\n[[Page S15162]]\n\nbenefits for all veterans, especially for those with disabilities, and \nit would also correct a sad historical injustice for Filipino World War \nII vets.\n  Again, I asked for unanimous consent. The Republicans objected. \nHowever, if the Republican objections are based on substantive \nprovisions in the bill, then they should be all the more willing to \nenter into the unanimous consent request I proposed last month and will \npropose again today.\n  If we can limit amendments to those that are actually relevant to \nveterans issues, it will give an opportunity for all Senators to come \nto the floor and actually speak to an issue that means so much to our \nsoldiers, to our veterans, and all of their families.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate may proceed to \nthe consideration of Calendar No. 335, S. 1233, Veterans Traumatic \nBrain Injury and Health Programs Improvement Act of 2007, at any time \ndetermined by the majority leader, following consultation with the \nRepublican leader; that when the bill is considered, the only \namendments in order to the bill, other than the committee-reported \namendment, be first-degree amendments that are relevant to the subject \nmatter of the bill, and that they be subject to relevant second-degree \namendments; that upon the disposition of all amendments, the committee-\nreported substitute amendment, as amended, if amended, be agreed to, \nthe bill, as amended, be read the third time, passed, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table; that the title amendment be agreed \nto, and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table en bloc; that \nany statements relating thereto be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I \npersonally have no objection to the request, but there is objection by \nSenator Coburn on our side. But I believe if the Senator would modify \nthe request to include a similar time agreement immediately following \nthe time agreement he has requested on this bill to debate and vote on \nS. 2340, the troop funding bill, that we might be able to reach some \nagreement. So I would ask him to modify his request to include that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, without yielding the floor, would the \nSenator from Texas yield for a question?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator from Texas, did he attend \nthe meeting in room 407, the closed meeting, where Secretary Gates, the \nSecretary of Defense, told us there was sufficient money in the current \nappropriations bill for the Department of Defense to continue the war \nin Iraq until at least the end of February or the middle of March so \nthat it was unnecessary to pass the bill, which you have just asked me \nto consider, immediately?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Well, Mr. President, responding through the Chair, I \nwould say I did attend that meeting, at which time we were told that \ncivilian employees at the Department of Defense would, at about the \nmiddle of December, receive a notice that they would be laid off just \nprior to Christmas because of 60-day notice requirements, and that, in \nfact, the military was only able to sustain the effort in Iraq fighting \nal-Qaida--the same people who killed 3,000 Americans on September 11, \n2001--by moving money from one account to another, causing a lot of \ndisruption, increased expense, and a lot of other problems.\n  I do not know why our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, \nafter having 63 votes on Iraq so far, attempting to propose surrender \ndates and to countermand the orders of our generals in the field, are \nresisting supporting our troops during a time of war. It is unthinkable \nto me.\n  So I am sorry they are continuing to block this necessary funding for \nour troops and putting 100,000 employees at the Department of Defense--\ncivilian employees--in jeopardy during the holiday season. But I was \nthere, and I did hear those comments, in addition to the comments I \nhave just added.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask for regular order at this point.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, there is objection by Senator Coburn on \nour side. I asked for a modification, and I have not heard an objection \nto that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is the Senator from Texas raising \nan objection?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I have asked the Senator to modify--I have asked \nunanimous consent to modify his request to include a time agreement \ndebate, and a vote on S. 2340, the troop funding bill, as a \nmodification of his unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask for regular order, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I have not heard an objection to that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The pending request by the Senator \nfrom Illinois is before us. Is there objection to that request?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I see Senator Coburn on the floor. I \nbelieve there is an objection on this side. Perhaps it is appropriate \nto ask Senator Coburn to respond. But let me just say I believe we \ncould reach an agreement, a time agreement on both bills if the Senator \nwould consider modifying his request. Until we can have a chance to \ndiscuss that further, there is objection on this side of the aisle.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois has asked \nfor regular order. Is there objection to his request?\n  Mr. CORNYN. There is an objection, as I explained.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard from the Senator \nfrom Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would ask the Senator to----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois has the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will respond to the Senator from Texas, \nas he is deserving of a response.\n  Look what has just happened. Senator Reid of Nevada has asked for a \nregistry for those in the United States afflicted with Lou Gehrig's \ndisease. He wants us to at least get the names and identities of people \nwho are dying from this disease so that we can start to find treatments \nand cures. The objection came from the Republican side from Senator \nCornyn of Texas to a registry for patients suffering from Lou Gehrig's \ndisease because he insists that we have to also agree to go to a debate \non funding for the war in Iraq--$50, $60, $70 billion.\n  The Senator from Texas conceded my point that we were told by the \nSecretary of Defense there is adequate money to continue this war until \nthe end of February or first of March. So to say we have to move to \nthis immediately is hardly a compelling argument when those are the \npositions taken by the Secretary of Defense.\n  Then I came in with a request--my own unanimous consent request--to \ngo to a veterans bill to deal with traumatic brain injury, the \nsignature injury of this war in Iraq, and again the Senator from Texas, \nsaying he was speaking on behalf of the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. \nCoburn, objected to taking up this veterans legislation to provide \nadditional health care to deal with the homelessness problem among \nveterans and to increase the travel rate for veterans living in remote \nand rural areas who have to go to clinics and hospitals far from home.\n  I think it is pretty clear: Almost any excuse will do on the \nRepublican side of the aisle to object to moving to legislation. I am \ngoing to give them one more chance.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, one of the bills Republicans are stopping \nis the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act, which I \ncosponsored. This is one of the key civil rights bills of this \nCongress, creating new positions at the Department of Justice in the \nCivil Rights Division and in the FBI to strengthen the Government's \nability to investigate and prosecute race-based murders that took place \nin our country before 1970 and which have gone unsolved. The bill would \nalso create a grant program for State and local prosecutors for \nadditional resources to pursue these heinous crimes.\n  The story of Emmett Till is a legend in America--and a sad legend. It \nwas one of the most infamous acts of racial\n\n[[Page S15163]]\n\nviolence in our Nation's history. A 14-year-old African American from \nthe city of Chicago, which I am honored to represent, was murdered in \n1955 when he was visiting in Mississippi and allegedly flirted with a \nWhite woman in a grocery store. His body was found floating in the \nTallahatchie River with a 70-pound gin mill fan tied to his neck with \nbarbed wire. Emmett Till's body was returned to Chicago, and his \nmother, despite her grief, insisted that there be a public display of \nhis mutilated corpse. It was a transforming moment in American racial \nhistory. Friends of mine who are African American said that was the \nmoment when they decided they couldn't take it anymore.\n  Emmett Till's killers were never brought to justice. They were \nprosecuted and acquitted by an all-White jury. In a 1956 magazine \narticle, two men confessed to the murder. They said they had committed \nthe murder because they ``decided it was time a few people got put on \nnotice,'' in their words.\n  There were at least 114 race-related killings between 1952 and 1968, \nand in many cases, no prosecutions, no convictions. In recent years, \nthere have been a handful of successful prosecutions, but time surely \nis not on our side. These cases are old, and so are the defendants and \nwitnesses.\n  Congressman John Lewis, one of my personal heroes in Congress, is the \nsponsor of this bill that the House passed by a rollcall vote of 422 to \n2. Here is what he said about the bill:\n\n       The time has come. For the sake of history, for the sake of \n     justice, for the sake of closure, the 110th Congress must \n     pass this legislation.\n\n  The Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act should not be \ncontroversial. The Senate Judiciary Committee passed an identical \nversion by voice vote and no dissent. It has bipartisan support, 16 \ncosponsors, and authorizes $13.5 million a year but doesn't appropriate \nit. It will have to go through the regular appropriations process.\n  At this time, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nCalendar No. 237, H.R. 923, the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime \nAct, that the bill be read the third time and passed and the motion to \nreconsider be laid on the table without intervening action or debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. The Senator \nfrom Illinois had the opportunity to fund this program fully with an \namendment he voted against that I offered on the Commerce-State-Justice \nbill. The fact is that the Bush administration has already started work \non this; they have 30 active cases going now. The complaint was there \nwasn't enough money. I offered an amendment, which the Senator from \nIllinois--even the author in the Senate, Mr. Dodd, wasn't even here to \nvote for--to fund at a level greater than what this bill authorizes. \nInstead, we chose earmarks and pork instead of funding this bill. On \nthe basis of that--I also agree that we ought to be about this.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will insist on regular order for only \none point. I would ask unanimous consent that if the Senator from \nOklahoma or the Senator from Texas wants to express his objection to a \nunanimous consent request, that the time he uses in expressing his \nobjection be taken from the leader's time or from the time remaining \nfor the Republicans in morning business.\n  Mr. COBURN. I have no problem with that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. So on that basis, do we want to solve the crimes? Yes. \nDid they have an opportunity to fund that? Yes. They chose not to. The \nsponsors of the bill chose not to put the money in.\n  What they want is to play bait and switch. There is no question that \nthese should be adequately funded. The Bush administration started on \nits own, initiated this program on its own in the Justice Department. \nThey had an opportunity to vote for the money to fund this. They \nrefused to do it--not an authorization, actual dollars. So on the basis \nof that, I object.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will close because I see other \ncolleagues on the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Was an objection made?\n  Mr. COBURN. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I respect my colleague from Oklahoma. \nThere is one simple fact of legislative rule and law that he does not \nexpress accurately. There is a world of difference between an \nauthorization and an appropriation. An authorization gives you \npermission to ask for money to spend. The appropriations bill spends \nthe money. This is an authorization bill. It would have to go through \nthe regular appropriations process. What he refers to was an attempt at \nappropriating money to the Department of Justice without enacting the \nunderlying law. It is totally different.\n  Again, for the third time this morning, the Republicans have \nobstructed and stood in the way of bringing up legislation, first \nSenator Cornyn of Texas on a registry for the victims of Lou Gehrig's \ndisease, then Senator Cornyn on behalf of Senator Coburn for a veterans \nbill to deal with traumatic brain injury, and finally Senator Coburn of \nOklahoma objecting to considering even moving to a bill that would deal \nwith solving these civil rights crimes which so sadly reflect on a \nperiod of American history that should be closed in the right way.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise in support of my friend and \ncolleague from Illinois, as well as our leader, Senator Reid, about \nwhat is going on here. This is unbelievable. What we have, in fact, is \nthe folks from the other side of the aisle are in disarray. Their basic \ntenet and philosophy which govern them, which they use to govern, which \nthey have used to win elections starting with Ronald Reagan, is falling \napart. There is dissension in the Republican Party. There are different \nwings all over the place. Most importantly, the Republican base which \nsays, basically, shrink Government, get rid of Government, is very far \naway from where the American mainstream is--not just far away from \nwhere Democrats are but far away from the mainstream.\n  But my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have nowhere to go. \nThey cannot put forward a positive program because their positive \nprogram is out of date with the needs of 21st century America. So they \nhave come up with a strategy of obstruction: 57, 58, 59, and soon they \nwill set the record in numbers of filibusters--not just obstructing on \nthe most major of issues but on just about everything. Their view is: \nWe can block things and show we count. Well, the rules of the Senate \ncertainly allow them to block anything they want as long as they \nprevent us from getting 60 votes. That is true, but that is hardly a \nsign of strength. That is hardly a sign of resoluteness. It is a sign, \nin my judgment, of weakness, of an inability to do anything positive, \nand therefore a unity around just being negative.\n  In 1980, a lot of people felt Government was too big and out of \ncontrol. In 2008, with our health care system needing help, with our \neducation system needing help, with our energy policy in a shambles, \nwith our foreign policy--I heard my colleague from Texas mention \nfighting al-Qaida. What percentage of the troops in Iraq are fighting \nal-Qaida? We all know that is a misstatement of what is going on there. \nThe vast majority of those who are fighting are fighting in the war \nbetween the Sunnis and the Shiites. So our present needs in America are \ndifferent. The world has been hit by a technological revolution. The \nworld has been hit by globalization.\n  In 2000, we sat astride the globe. We had a budget surplus. We had a \nprosperous economy. We were respected in the world. Over the last 7 \nyears, under the leadership of President Bush, that has been \nsquandered. That is not just Democrats speaking; that is America \nspeaking. Close to 70 percent of America thinks we are headed in the \nwrong direction. A majority of not only Democrats but Independents and \na near majority of Republicans think we are headed in the wrong \ndirection. But my\n\n[[Page S15164]]\n\ncolleagues across the aisle, clinging to their base, narrower and \nnarrower, further and further away from the American mainstream and \nwhat the American people want, have come up with a policy of \nobstruction because they can't come up with anything else.\n  So we come to the floor and ask for reasonable debates on the major \nissues facing us, whether it be weaning us away from oil and fossil \nfuels, whether it be improving health care for children, whether it be \na change in course in Iraq, which the vast majority of America demands, \nand they block it, and then they block it again, and then they block it \nagain. My good colleagues from Illinois and from Nevada even brought up \nthe most noncontroversial bill: a registry on ALS. My uncle, who was a \nwell-known obstetrician, the head of Columbia Presbyterian Hospital's \nDepartment of Obstetrics, died of ALS. I care about this. I watched him \nwaste away. They blocked that too.\n  This strategy, which creates a feeling of false strength among my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, is doomed to failure. This \nstrategy, I predict, will help create the demise of even the large \nminority they have right now.\n  There will be a Democratic nominee; there will be a Presidential \ncampaign in the summer and the fall. That Presidential Democratic \nnominee, whoever she or he may be, will be campaigning and saying we \nneed change. We cannot get change unless we increase the number of \npeople who want change in the Senate. Senator X and Senator Y and \nSenator Z on the other side of the aisle have stood in the way of \nchange, and they will continue to. So put in a new Senator who will \nvote for change. My Republican colleagues are filibustering themselves \nout of their seats come 2008. This strategy--short term, narrow, and \nshortsighted--will not stand because the American people demand change.\n  I want to talk about one area I have been asked to talk about, the \nsubprime loan crisis. I have said time and time again we need to do \nsomething about this crisis. I have been talking about it for a long \ntime. The Bush administration and Senate Republicans have ideological \nhandcuffs on: Government should not be involved, no matter what. If \nhundreds of thousands of innocent people are losing their homes, no \nGovernment. If our financial markets are shaking and quaking, no \nGovernment. If housing prices are going down for the first time across \nAmerica so that even if you fully paid your mortgage, you are suffering \nfrom this subprime crisis, no Government, no matter what, no matter the \nconsequences.\n  Guess what that sounds like. It sounds like the Republican platform \nof the 1890s or 1920s. I thought we had learned something since then. \nGovernment is not the only answer, and it probably should not even be \nthe first answer, in most instances, but it is often the only answer. \nWhat we have seen is this administration comes up with the sort of \nplans and schemes that twist themselves into a pretzel to try to say \nthey are helping with this crisis and avoiding any Government \ninvolvement. It hasn't worked. Confidence in our credit markets \ndeclines. The number of foreclosures goes up. Housing prices continue \nto go down. The shame of it all is there are simple solutions.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will be happy to yield when I finish my remarks.\n  Now here is what we Democrats are asking for: commonsense solutions, \ndesigned to help people save their homes at an absolute minimum cost, \ndesigned to curtail the drop in housing prices, designed to restore the \nfaith that Americans, investors, and world investors have in our credit \nmarket.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \n5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. We are not asking for a bailout; far from it. We are \nasking for simple things. The simplest thing passed the House with a \nlarge number of Republican votes, and it is FHA modernization. \nPresident Bush is for FHA modernization. Secretary Paulson came and met \nwith the Finance Committee last week, with Democrats and Republicans--\nSenator Baucus and Senator Grassley were there--and urged us to pass \nFHA modernization. I haven't heard what the objection is, because FHA \nmodernization passed the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee \nin the Senate by a vote of 20 to 1. We sought to pass the bill on the \nfloor and Senate Republicans objected on November 15. On December 6, we \ntried again, and again the legislation was blocked. What has happened \nsince November 15 and today, about a month later? Hundreds, probably a \nhundred thousand, certainly tens of thousands more homes have gone into \nforeclosure, housing prices have declined further, credit markets are \nshaky, and the plan that the administration came up with, which \nassiduously, ideologically, and narrowly avoided any Government \ninvolvement, has been widely discredited and has brought no confidence \nin the credit market. The President's program became even more critical \nyesterday--the need for the FHA modernization--when it was revealed \nthat the administration's signature subprime program, FHA Secure, \nactivated in November--guess how many borrowers it helped. Hundreds of \nthousands? Tens of thousands? Thousands? No. It helped 541, when we are \nexpecting 2 million foreclosures in the next 2 years. Helping only a \nfew hundred families and saying you are doing something is \nincomprehensible.\n  I hope we will move this FHA legislation. As I said, it is supported \nby the President and by Secretary Paulson. It is the mildest of \nmeasures. It can't be too bad if President Bush is for it. That is not \nmy view, but I am trying to perhaps win over some of my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle. This FHA modernization will help in a \nsmall way. We have to do other things. The bill Senator Brown, Senator \nCasey, and I have put in the appropriations bill, with Senator Murray's \nhelp, for $200 million to help families get out of foreclosure makes \nsense. Congressman Frank and I have a bill to help Fannie and Freddie \nto help with the foreclosures, which is legislation that is needed as \nwell. But at least this is a first step. Yes, it is Government, and if \nyou are a hard right ideologue, I guess you say the ideological purity \nof keeping Government away from everything is more important than \nhelping innocent victims keep their homes, more important than keeping \nhousing prices stable, more important than keeping our credit markets \nin good shape.\n\n  I hope my colleagues will join me. I hope so for the good of the \ncountry, even though I believe, frankly, politically they are marching \ndown a path to oblivion and in the longer run it will help us get a \nbetter Senate to get things done--things that the American people \ndemand.\n  At this point, I make a plea to my colleagues that this rather \nnoncontroversial--if you judge by the breadth of its support--\nlegislation goes through on FHA modernization.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 481, S. 2338, the FHA Modernization Act \nof 2007; that the Dodd-Shelby amendment at the desk be considered and \nagreed to; the bill, as amended, be read the third time and passed; \nthat the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; and that any \nstatements relating thereto be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Under the rules of \nthe Senate, when we ask for unanimous consent, as has just been asked, \nare we not saying we will not debate the bill, we will not offer the \nbill for amendments, and that we will take the bill as it is?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The issue is what is specified \nunder the request.\n  Mr. COBURN. Which is not to debate the bill and not allow the bill to \nbe amended. I will be happy to discuss my objections to the bill. They \nare small and deal with reverse mortgages, not conventional FHA, or the \nincreased cap or the lower downpayment. I am working hard to try to \nresolve that so we do not hold up this bill.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. COBURN. I am happy to.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Would my colleague be willing to support a provision to\n\n[[Page S15165]]\n\nhave a time limit on debate on this bill, with amendments limited to \nthe substance of the bill so we can get the bill done?\n  Mr. COBURN. Yes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Let me discuss that with my colleague and maybe we can \nmove the bill. We are in the closing weeks of the session, so maybe we \ncan agree to a reasonable time limit and reasonable amendments.\n  Mr. COBURN. I have no objection to that.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I withdraw my unanimous consent request temporarily so I \nmay discuss things with my colleague from Oklahoma.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the request is \nwithdrawn. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The Senator from New York said he would yield to me at \nthe end of his statement.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator from New \nYork has expired.\n  The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Coburn for his cooperation \non an important issue with Senator Schumer, something this body needs \nto move on. I thank both Senator Schumer and Senator Coburn. I wanted \nto talk about the same issue this morning for 5 or 6 minutes.\n  Thousands and thousands of families in Ohio are struggling to keep a \nroof over their heads during the upcoming Christmas season. My State \nhas been in the grip of a mortgage crisis at some level for years, \nwhich shows no signs of letting up. Ohio is faced with one of the \nhighest foreclosure rates in the country. Our largest cities are being \nparticularly hit hard. Ohio's six biggest cities are among the 30 \nhardest hit in the Nation. It looks as if things may get worse before \nthey get better.\n  What we do in Washington, or what we fail to do here, will have a \nprofound effect on families in Akron, Cincinnati, Toledo, Columbus, and \nCleveland. It is not just my State's largest cities; it is Portsmouth, \nLima, and my hometown of Mansfield, Zanesville, Ravenna, and Marion. \nEvery day, over 200 families in Ohio lose their homes.\n  A month ago, the majority leader, Senator Reid, sought to bring up a \nbill that would modernize the FHA home loan program. Our colleagues on \nthe other side objected, claiming they had not had sufficient time to \nread the bill. Mind you, this wasn't a bill written in secret. It \npassed out of the Banking Committee 20 to 1 in September after a long \nprocess that fully involved the ranking member, Senator Shelby, a \nRepublican of Alabama, and all of my colleagues on the Banking \nCommittee.\n  By making improvements in the FHA program, more families would be \nable to refinance out of their unaffordable subprime loans and into \nfair, more equitable, and affordable FHA loans. As the Wall Street \nJournal found in an analysis published last week, many subprime \nborrowers had pretty good credit when they took out their loans. Many \nshould have been in conventional loans, but in too many cases they were \nsteered into higher priced loans, loans more profitable for the \nmortgage broker, but more costly, and ultimately disastrously so, for \nfar too many borrowers, new homeowners. Many of them should be able to \ntake out FHA loans that won't have those exploding adjustable rates.\n  We all went home for Thanksgiving, and when we came back, Senator \nReid tried again, and again our Republican colleagues objected.\n  President Bush announced last week a plan that may help a small slice \nof the population. He called on Congress to adopt FHA reform. Good for \nhim. But what he needs to do is call on his fellow Republicans to stop \nobstructing every single attempt we have tried to help homeowners in \nOhio and across the country. There may be progress today in the \nconversation between Senators Schumer and Coburn. That is our hope.\n  Most of the people who work in the mortgage industry have their \nclients' best interests at heart. They rely on repeat business and \nword-of-mouth advertising. But as the industry has evolved, it seems as \nthough more and more market participants are acting in ways that are at \nodds with their clients' interests, all for short-term and sometimes \nhuge profits.\n  Some mortgage brokers have chosen to prey on the most vulnerable--the \npoor, the elderly, and the family one paycheck away from disaster. \nTheir conduct is unforgivable.\n  Borrowers who may not have been particularly sophisticated when they \ntook out a loan are very likely going to be unfamiliar with how to \nnavigate their way out of a bad situation. They are going to need a lot \nof help, and the network of nonprofit organizations across the country \nis going to be of vital importance in providing that help. Congress \napproved $200 million. Senator Schumer and Senator Casey and I worked \nto put that money into the legislation to provide this help. But the \nPresident has threatened to veto that legislation.\n  We also need to do what we can to prevent the situation from getting \nworse. Mortgage brokers and originators have to exercise care in how \nthey do business. At a bare minimum, they should be sure a borrower can \nrepay a loan, and they need to do so based on real verification rather \nthan a wink and a nod.\n  Nobody is doing anybody a favor by convincing them to take out a loan \nthat will become unaffordable in 2 or 3 years, or that doesn't include \nthe payment of taxes and insurance.\n  No longer should the dreams of Ohioans and new homeowners across the \ncountry fall victim to the fine print. No longer should Congress turn a \nblind eye to the despicable practices that victimize our neighbors and \nour communities because foreclosure in one house affects the homes all \nover that neighborhood.\n  We have tried to provide tax relief to people who have had some of \ntheir mortgages forgiven by their lender when they sell their house for \nless than their outstanding loan. Right now, any amount of debt \nforgiven is considered income, slapping additional tax burden on a \nfamily who has gone through the trauma of losing their home.\n  But that provision is imperiled by end-of-year obstructionism as \nwell. Not one Republican supported Senator Reid's effort to force an \nend to the Republican filibuster of the tax bill that included this \nprovision.\n  Everything we have tried to do to help homeowners--from counseling \nfunds, to FHA reform, to tax relief--has been blocked by Republicans. \nIf President Bush is serious about helping homeowners, he will bring \nthis to an end. The people of Ohio have waited too long for relief. \nThey need our help. They need it now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, wouldn't you like to find a cure or \nwouldn't you like to be part of an effort to find a cure for \nAlzheimer's? Wouldn't you like to be part of a Congress that helps save \nlives, helps people and families struggling with Alzheimer's so perhaps \nthere could be medicines for cognitive stretch- out for those who are \nfacing some form of dementia? Wouldn't you like to give help to those \npracticing self-help, providing relief to hard-working caregivers?\n  I know you do, and I also know a bipartisan group of my colleagues \nwant to do that. That is why I introduced the Alzheimer's Breakthrough \nAct of 2007. I started this work a couple years ago, working with my \ncolleague, Senator Bond, who then was chair of the Subcommittee on \nAging. Now I am working with Senator Burr. We passed out of the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee in July critical legislation, \nthe Alzheimer's Breakthrough Act. It is pending on the calendar. We \nneed unanimous consent to bring it up. I come to the floor today to ask \nmy colleagues to give consent to move this bill forward.\n  This bill has two components: one is an authorizing component and the \nother a tax credit component. In the spirit of comity, I would be \nwilling to actually divide the two because I know tax policy needs to \nbe very sensitive in terms of the consequences.\n  Let me tell my colleagues what this breakthrough legislation does. It \ndoubles the funding for Alzheimer's research at NIH. It goes from $640 \nmillion to $1.3 billion, giving researchers the resources to make \nbreakthroughs. It\n\n[[Page S15166]]\n\nfunds a national summit on Alzheimer's so the best scientists in the \ncountry can come together and identify the most promising \nbreakthroughs. We are not talking about long-time, longitudinal \nstudies. We are talking about studies that are at a point of \nsignificant breakthrough, that need help, and need a boost.\n  Also in our bill is the family caregivers support tax credit. It \nwould create a $3,000 tax credit for caregivers with the extraordinary \nexpenses of caring for someone who has a chronic condition, such as \nAlzheimer's.\n  Why is this needed? Alzheimer's disease is the tsunami on the horizon \nwe cannot ignore. Today there are 5 million Americans living with \nAlzheimer's disease. It is expected to triple in the next couple \ndecades.\n  We know a lot about Alzheimer's disease. It has been 100 years since \nit was first diagnosed, and though we know a lot, we do not have a \ncure, and maybe we will not have a cure, but we certainly can have the \nbreakthroughs for what we call cognitive stretch-out. For those people \nwho are gripped by this terrible disease or another form of dementia \nand those who are in social work and medicine, they have watched people \nsay the long goodbye. We watched a gallant President and an incredible \nFirst Lady by the name of Reagan, in which the President had his long \ngoodbye and the First Lady, Nancy Reagan stuck with him every minute, \nevery hour of every day until his final resting. We salute them. We \nknow that when the President does not have the resources to deal with \nthis disease, we have so much work to do for the little people. Knowing \nthat President, he would want help for the little people.\n  We need a sense of urgency about Alzheimer's. If we find a cure to \ndelay the onset of the disease, we could save a tremendous amount in \nMedicaid and Medicare.\n  It is estimated that for every year we can have that cognitive \nstretch-out that enables people not to have to turn to institutional \nlong-term care, we can save over $500 billion in both Medicaid and \nMedicare.\n  Should we even put a price tag on finding a cure, better and earlier \ndiagnosis, faster creation of new drugs for people? Can we afford not \nto invest in this disease? I don't think so.\n\n  Alzheimer's is a terrible disease. I know it because we lived through \nit in our family. We watched prominent people be gripped by it. We know \nAlzheimer's is terrible for the person living with it, and we know it \nis an incredible drain on the caregiver, both emotionally and \nfinancially. Our country last year spent over $120 billion in dealing \nwith this disease.\n  I wish to come back to the caregiver. Usually it is a daughter or a \nspouse who takes care of an aging parent or spouse. Often they need \nhelp with durable medical equipment and specialized daycare. It could \nadd up to anywhere from $5,500 to $8,000 a year. Caring for a sick \nloved one means often you give up work, you reduce your work to part \ntime or certainly take money out of your household.\n  We held a series of hearings on this bill, including Dr. Zerhouni of \nNIH and Dr. Gerberding of the CDC and some of our most eminent \nphysicians working on this disease. It was amazing because it was so \nenergizing. Often when we think about Alzheimer's, we think there is no \nhope and no opportunity to crack this disease, but there is.\n  What the scientists told us is there is now an array of medical \npossibilities for both the prevention of Alzheimer's and also \nintervention that would enable people to have this cognitive \nstretchout.\n  I am using the words ``cognitive stretchout.'' Maybe it is a little \ntoo fancy. What it means in plain English is you have a memory, you can \nthink, you know night from day. I know for families that are gripped by \nAlzheimer's, both the person with it and the person living with it \nexperience a 36-hour day, because often with Alzheimer's, the person \ngripped by it cannot tell the time. If we can stretch out that decline \nwhere they still have their memory, still can function with the \nactivities of daily living, still know whether it is 3 o'clock in the \nafternoon or 3 o'clock in the morning, still be able to recognize their \ngrandchild and still be able to remember how to eat, my God, what do we \ngive them? We give them a year of life, we give a breather for those \nwho love them and are taking care of them, and we also give a break in \nterms of the Federal budget with the assistance we provide in long-term \ncare.\n  This bill is pending on the calendar. We have asked unanimous consent \nto go to it. I ask my colleagues, let's have a vote. If they would like \nto separate out the tax credit aspects from the authorizing \nlegislation, I would be more than willing to cooperate in the closing \nhours of this session to do that.\n  I know on the floor is my very good colleague, the Senator from Iowa, \nMr. Harkin, who chairs the Labor-HHS Subcommittee. He has been such a \nstrong advocate of NIH, and we thank him for what he has done. But he \nneeds help from those of us in the Senate to come up with these \nbreakthroughs.\n  Mr. President, rather than a parliamentary request asking consent, I \nknow our cloakroom is circulating the request. I look forward to a \nreply from our colleagues in moving this bill forward, but I ask our \ncolleagues: Join with us and move this bill forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/12/senate-section/article/S15166-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15166-S15168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  CHRISTOPHER AND DANA REEVE PARALYSIS ACT AND TRAINING FOR REALTIME \n                              WRITERS ACT\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to speak on two bills that should \nhave passed by unanimous consent because they are so widely supported, \nbut there are objections to them by some Republicans.\n  The first is the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act, and the \nother is Training for Realtime Writers Act. First, I am disappointed \nobjections have been raised against the Christopher and Dana Reeve \nParalysis Act on the other side. I do not speak for myself, but I speak \non behalf of tens of thousands of Americans who suffer from paralysis \nand their families.\n  The Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act is a bipartisan bill. It \nis a fiscally responsible bill. It addresses a critical need to \naccelerate better treatments and one day a cure for paralysis. \nCurrently, paralysis research is carried out across multiple \ndisciplines with no effective means of coordination and collaboration. \nTime, effort, and valuable dollars are used inefficiently because of \nthis problem. Families affected by paralysis are often unaware of \ncritical research results, information about clinical trials, and best \npractices. The bill will improve the long-term health prospects of \npeople with paralysis and other disabilities by improving access to \nservices, providing information and support to caregivers and their \nfamilies, developing assistive technology, providing employment \nassistance, and encouraging wellness among those with paralysis.\n  I am, frankly, surprised there continues to be an objection to moving \nthis bill forward. I negotiated this bill with my Republican colleagues \non the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee before it was \nmarked up in July. We received specific requests relating to the NIH. \nWe accepted those requests. We moved forward. We removed the NIH \nreporting provisions in response to concerns that they were duplicative \nof reporting requirements NIH already had. We responded to all the \nfeedback from the Department of Health and Human Services and the NIH \nby incorporating both substantive and technical changes. At that point \nwe were assured there were no objections. As a result of these good-\nfaith negotiations, the bill passed out of the HELP Committee with no \namendments. Given all of the efforts we made to meet concerns raised by \nSenators on the other side of the aisle, and given that Senators had an \nopportunity to file amendments at that time but chose not to, I had \nevery expectation that the bill would quickly pass the full Senate. \nInstead, it continues to be held due to Republican objections.\n\n  One of my Republican colleagues has said he will object to all \ndisease-specific bills because he does not believe that Congress should \nbe able to pass legislation specifically targeting the fights against \ncancer, ALS, Alzheimer's, and so on. I strenuously disagree with the \nSenator on this point. I believe Congress can and should be involved in \nsetting national priorities in these fields. But putting that aside, \nthe\n\n[[Page S15167]]\n\nfact is, the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act is not a disease-\nspecific bill. Paralysis and mobility impairment are not disease-\nspecific issues; they are symptoms or side effects that result from \nnumerous diseases and situations, including traumatic brain injury, \nstroke, ALS, injuries from athletic activities, injuries, of course, \nfrom combat in the U.S. Armed Forces, and many others. So paralysis is \nnot disease specific.\n  Now, again, there seems to be another objection to this bill. One of \nour Republican colleagues has said he will not allow any bills to pass \nby unanimous consent that include spending without an offset. Well, let \nme be clear: There is no funding in the Christopher and Dana Reeve \nParalysis Act legislation. It is only an authorization that allows the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention to improve the quality of \nlife and long-term health status of people with paralysis and other \nphysical disabilities.\n  Our colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe, made this case very \nclear in his discussion of the Water Resources Development bill. He \nexplained the significant difference between authorizing and \nappropriating. Authorization bills are not spending bills; they \ndetermine which projects and programs are eligible to compete for \nfuture funding and provide for congressional review and oversight. \nAuthorization bills provide the criterion for spending bills, but they \ndo not contain direct spending. So any spending for the paralysis \nprogram authorized by this legislation will be subject to the annual \nappropriations process.\n  The Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act passed the House in \nOctober. It is long overdue for passage in the Senate. When I \nintroduced this bill, Dr. Elias Zerhouni, Director of NIH, spoke in \nsupport of the bill, and let me read something he said that day.\n\n       So, really, as the Director of an institution that is \n     committed to making the discoveries that will make a \n     difference in people's lives, I feel proud and feel pleased. \n     But at the same time I'm humbled. I'm humbled because in many \n     ways the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act is the \n     harbinger of what I see as the combination of the public, the \n     leadership in Congress, and the administration and government \n     in our country that is absolutely unique, and humbled because \n     at the same time, I know it contains a lot of expectations \n     from us. And I'm at the same time confident that we can \n     deliver on these expectations of NIH, with our sister \n     agencies throughout the government. But the key thing I would \n     like to provide is an expression of commitment. At the end of \n     the day, if you do not have leaders and champions that look \n     at a problem in its entirety, today in the 21st century, you \n     cannot make progress.\n\n  So that is what Dr. Elias Zerhouni said on the day we introduced the \nbill. I agree wholeheartedly with Dr. Zerhouni. Progress is vital in \nscience and biomedical research. It is also vital in the legislative \nprocess. As Senators, we have a duty to ensure due diligence in \nconsidering legislation. But for one Senator, or two Senators or three, \nto stall this bill, I believe without legitimate cause--if the \nobjections are that it is disease specific, I have pointed out it is \nnot. Secondly, if it is being held up because there is not an offset, I \npoint out it is only an authorization bill, not a spending bill. If it \nwere an appropriations bill, it would then be legitimately subject to a \nhold or objection to unanimous consent because it did not have an \noffset, if that were the case. Anyway, I think for a handful of \nSenators to block action on this bill seems to undermine the trust that \npeople put in us as legislators to move forward on things, to respond \nto certain national needs.\n  Let us be clear: By putting this bill on hold, Senators are also \nputting people with paralysis and their families on hold. It is a \nshame, I say to these Senators. I am not asking you to vote for the \nbill. If you don't like it, you don't have to vote for it. I am only \nasking you to allow the entire Senate to work its will. Don't slam the \ndoor on our fellow citizens who are living with paralysis. There are \nsome 2 million Americans right now living with paralysis of the arms or \nlegs, or both. Many others are living with multiple sclerosis. Hundreds \nof young soldiers are returning from Iraq and Afghanistan with spinal \ncord injuries and paralysis, facing a lifetime of disability. They \nshould not be placed on hold. They shouldn't have to wait. They \nshouldn't have to have further delay. They should have this bill \npassed.\n  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to reconsider \ntheir decision to block this bill. As I said, I worked with Republicans \nbefore it went to the HELP Committee. We worked with the Department of \nHealth and Human Services downtown, with NIH, and we met all their \nobjections. We redrafted it and there weren't any objections when it \nwent through the HELP Committee. No amendments were offered. That is \nthe kind of legislation you would think would be subject to a unanimous \nconsent procedure here on the Senate floor. It is a fiscally \nresponsible bipartisan bill, as I said, that does not spend any money. \nIt only authorizes.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator has just under 4 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Four minutes.\n  I also wanted to talk about the Training for Realtime Writers Act. On \nbehalf of more than 30 million Americans who are deaf or hard of \nhearing, I express my deep disappointment that again one or two \nSenators on the other side of the aisle are blocking passage of this \nimportant legislation, the Realtime Writers Act of 2007. Again, it is a \nbipartisan bill. It is fiscally responsible. It addresses an urgent \nnational need to train more real-time captioners at a time when the \ndemand for these professionals has far outstripped the supply, and \nwhen, in fact, the law of the land says that all programs have to be \nreal-time captioned.\n\n  For those who don't know what real-time captioning is, these are the \npeople, if you are in your offices and you are watching the Senate \nfloor and you put your button on mute, you see the little closed \ncaption go across the bottom of the screen. That is someone sitting \ndown here in the bowels of the Capitol watching what we say and, on a \nmachine, typing this in so that if you are deaf or hard of hearing you \ncan read what is happening. This is true on programs you watch on \nnormal television as well.\n  Again, we all use that, I know, at different times. You don't have to \nbe deaf or hard of hearing to use closed captioning. But what has \nhappened, and how this came about is very simple. In 1996, in the \nTelecom Act, it required that all English language television \nbroadcasts be captioned by the year 2006. All television broadcasts \nmust be real-time captioned by 2006. That was last year. So it is now \n2007, and many stations across the country are not in compliance with \nthe law. As a result, a lot of deaf and hard of hearing Americans are \nnot able to access the full range of television programming we take for \ngranted. And why aren't they compliant? Well, it is a legal \nrequirement, but the fact is there are not enough captioners. We knew \nthat back when the bill was passed in 1996. That is why we gave it 10 \nyears for implementation. And little by little we have been trying to \nget more real-time captioners, but we don't have them.\n  This bill is an effort to bolster that program and to put focus on \nit. Again, it is an authorization bill. It is an authorization bill. It \nauthorizes the creation of a competitive grant program to train \ncaptioners at the funding level of $20 million a year for 5 years. So, \nagain, it is an authorization bill, not an appropriations bill.\n  There has been a shortage of real-time captioners. And you might say, \nwell, if there is a shortage, why aren't there more people? Well, a lot \nof people don't know about it. They don't know about the demand. We \nneed the training and expertise. This is a difficult job. I mean, our \nstenographers here, who take down our words, have a difficult job, but \nat least they have time to go back and print it out after they put it \ninto the machines. A real-time captioner has to listen and watch what \nwe are saying and put it on immediately. So it takes a lot of expertise \nand training to do this.\n  This act authorizes, again, the funding. It creates no new \nentitlements. It sunsets after 5 years, because once we get the number \nup and we get schools across the country teaching this, I have no doubt \nthat we will have enough in the pipeline. And let me point out that \nthis bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent three times before, \nonly to languish in the House of Representatives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority's time has expired.\n\n[[Page S15168]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 more \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would ask that 2 more minutes be added to our time; \notherwise, I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, 2 minutes will be added to \nthe Republicans' time as well.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, the House indicated they would take it up. It \nlanguished here. It passed the Senate, as I said, by unanimous consent \nthree times already. Again, it is time to keep the promise that \nCongress made to 30 million Americans in 1996. I would hope we would \nnot block the Realtime Writers Act, and let it go through, and with \nunanimous consent, as it has done three times in the Senate before. I \nwould ask those who have a hold on the bill, are they saying that 100 \nSenators before, who let this legislation go through, didn't know what \nthey were doing? We all have staffs, and we all pay attention to what \nlegislation goes through here. I think it is indicative of the support \nwe had on both sides of the aisle that the Realtime Writers Act, as I \nsaid, passed by unanimous consent three times in the past.\n  I wanted to talk about these bills because again I think they are \nboth widely supported. We have worked out agreements with people in the \npast, and I don't think there is any real, legitimate reason to keep a \nhold on these bills and not let them pass.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate take up and \npass Calendar No. 326, S. 1183, the Christopher and Dana Reeve \nParalysis Act, and Calendar No. 291, S. 675, the Training for Realtime \nWriters Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I object to both, and I will give my \nreasons why during our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as part of my closing remarks, in case an \nobjection was raised to the Training for Realtime Writers Act, I want \nto say this is something that can be done already by the \nadministration, but I would point out that they have not done it in 10 \nyears, either Democratic or Republican Presidents. Quite frankly, they \nare not focusing on it. They have said they can do it as part of their \nhigh-growth job training initiative, but they haven't done it. That is \nthe point of the legislation. They have not done this.\n  And for those interested in earmarks around here, 90 percent of the \nmoney in the high-growth job training----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, I want to close with 30 seconds, by saying that 90 \npercent----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Ninety percent of the money is noncompetitive. Over $235 \nmillion over 6 years has gone out in noncompetitive grants, and not one \npenny for real-time writers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, may I ask how much time remains on this \nside of the aisle in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 90 minutes 16 seconds.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would ask, Mr. President, that the Senator from \nOklahoma, Senator Coburn, be recognized for up to 10 minutes, followed \nby myself, followed by the Senator from Georgia, Senator Isakson, and \nthen the Senator from Idaho, Senator Craig, for the first 40 minutes of \nour time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/12/senate-section/article/S15168-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15168-S15179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DISCONTINUING BUSINESS AS USUAL\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this morning we have heard about a lot of \ngood causes and a lot of good bills. But what we have been asked to do \nis to pass bills without any debate, without the opportunity to amend, \nand we just heard a Senator say we could agree to a UC and not have to \nvote on it. Agreeing to a UC is the same as voting yes. The fact is, we \nhave had plenty of time to bring up all these bills, put them on the \nfloor, debate them and have great debates so the American people become \ninformed, and offer amendments.\n  I will say for many of these bills, I am the Senator objecting. \nSenator Harkin knows I am objecting to the two bills he just raised.\n  The point is, our debt is rising $1 million a minute. When you \nauthorize $100 million for the Realtime Writers Act, what you are \nsaying is, I intend to get the money out of the appropriations process \nto develop training for something that the market should already be \ninducing through increased wages. If in fact there is a shortage, why \nis the market not taking care of it? Is it because the pay is too low? \nMaybe the pay ought to be higher. Maybe people ought to go into it. \nInstead we are going to inject $100 million of American taxpayers' \nmoney into something that will be solved through the market. If it is \nnot, then the pay is entirely too low and the market will eventually \nadjust to it. But to say we are going to authorize something with no \nintent to ever spend, that is not the intent of an authorization. The \nintent of an authorization is to spend more money.\n  At $1.3 billion a day, we are going into debt, and it is not our \ndebt. We are transferring it to our children and our grandchildren. To \ncome down here and want to authorize and spend and pass without debate \nand pass without amendment multitudes of bills with no debate is to \nsay, in other words, take it or leave it. And if you want to amend it \nor you want to have a chance to vote on it, tough luck; we are going to \ndo it without you. It is called ``UC.''\n  The fact is, we find ourselves $9 trillion in debt now. The fact is, \nour children are facing $79 trillion worth of unfunded mandates. It is \ntime that we change the business in the Senate. To come down and claim \nyou want to just authorize but not spend is a hoax because you would \nnot be authorizing unless you do spend.\n  The other thing the American people ought to know is, out of the over \n$1 trillion in discretionary budget that we spend right now, $280 \nbillion of it is not authorized. The appropriators totally ignore the \nauthorizers. When it comes to appropriations, they appropriate whatever \nthey want. So it doesn't have to be authorized to get it done. They \nwill appropriate it if they want to do it. They don't pay any attention \nto authorization.\n  When we have $8 trillion worth of authorized programs now, to say we \ncannot eliminate some program that is not being funded to be able to \nmake room for one that should be funded, and to say we should not have \nto do that, that doesn't pass the commonsense test with the American \npublic.\n  I understand that is irritating and bristling to the way we have done \nthings in the past. I apologize if at times I am irritable and \nirritating, but I think the future generations are worth it. I do not \nthink we can continue doing business as usual. So we have seen an ALS \nbill come down. The CDC doesn't want the ALS bill, the registry, and \nthe reason is they can already do it. If we are going to do an ALS \nbill, we ought to do it for all neurologic diseases in terms of a \nregistry, not just one. What we have decided is a celebrity or an \ninterest group can come and we will place a priority there. Regardless \nof what the science says, regardless of what the basic science and the \npure science says in terms of guiding us where to go on diseases, we \nwill just respond. We will create a new program, and we will tell NIH \nwhere they have to go, or CDC where they have to go when science \ndoesn't guide them there.\n  If we are going to do that, if we really think as a body we ought to \nbe going the disease-specific direction, then why don't we do it all? \nWhy don't we say we will do the peer-reviewed science on all the \nprograms at NIH? Since we are going to pick the ones that have a cause \nbehind them, why don't we do them all. Why don't we let the lobbyists \ntell us which ones should be first? Of course, we wouldn't do that \nbecause we know the scientists at CDC and the scientists at NIH make \ndecisions, not on popularity, not on politics, but on the raw science \nthat will give us the best benefit for the most people.\n  We look good when we do those things. We do satisfy a yearning for \nthose who are handicapped or paralyzed or have breast cancer or have \ncolon cancer. But if we are going to do a registry for ALS, why aren't \nwe doing one for diabetes? We aren't we doing one for multiple myeloma? \nWhy? Why aren't we doing those things? If we are going to pick one, if \nwe are going to do\n\n[[Page S15169]]\n\na neurological disease, let's do it for all of them. It shows the \nshallowness of what we are trying to do. Our hearts are big, but we are \nnot looking at the big picture.\n  The FHA we discussed. The component in the FHA that I object to is, \nwe have a study in the FHA bill that the GAO is mandated to do on \nreverse mortgages. But at the same time, regardless of what the study \nshows, we lift the cap. All I have asked for from the authors of the \nbill is to keep the cap where it is until we get the GAO study back so \nwe know what we are doing, rather than responding to a clamoring which \nwe have no basis, in fact, to know is the accurate thing to do; \notherwise, we wouldn't be asking for the study in the first place. It \nis a simple request.\n  Instead, we come to the Senate floor and try to make us, those who \nobject, seem unreasonable when we say common sense would say if we have \na study in the bill to tell us where to go, but we are already ignoring \nwhat the results of that study may or may not be, to question that we \nshould not have a debate about that, that we should not have an ability \nto amend that, we should just blindly say yes, that is not what the \nSenate tradition is. This is a body that is supposed to be about \ndebate.\n  In the past 31 days the Senate has been in session 15 days. We have \nhad 10 votes in 15 days, and we have had 8 days without any votes at \nall. All these bills could have been on the floor and had accurate \ndebate. I would have lost most of my amendments, based on the \nhistorical record of my amendments, but the American people would have \nbenefited from the debate about those bills. Instead, we are made to \nlook as if we don't care if we want to try to improve a bill because we \nwill not agree to blindly accept a bill to go through. We are made to \nsay we don't care about people who are losing their mortgages because \nwe think there are some commonsense changes to a bill? That isn't quite \nright.\n  You hear the reference that people vote or the committee voted or \nthat there wasn't an amendment. The fact is, on voice votes if you do \nnot vote, you are not recorded because there is not a recorded vote. \nBut that doesn't mean you agree to bring the bill to the floor. We all \nknow that.\n  The fact is, and you have heard me say it many times in this body, if \nyou are born today you inherit $400,000 worth of unfunded liabilities. \nThere is a lot of things we do wrong on our side of the aisle, I will \nadmit that, and have done wrong on our side of the aisle, both in the \ntenor of how we approach things and in how we characterize things. But \nthe best way to right what we are doing wrong is start doing it right. \nThe fact is, it is no legacy that we should leave to the next two \ngenerations that they are born into the world with a stone around their \nneck. The culture and methodology the Senate--I asked the President of \nthe Senate a moment ago: What does unanimous consent mean when we bring \nup these bills? It is the rules of the Senate, I was told. The rules of \nthe Senate are, you get no opportunity to amend.\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional 3 minutes for me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. You get no opportunity to debate, you get no opportunity \nto amend, you have no opportunity to vote. So, if you truly object to a \nbill or a component of a bill you are told: Stuff it. What you think \nabout it doesn't matter, let alone the very real loss of the American \npeople not hearing a full debate about these issues.\n  We have plenty of time to debate them. We have quorum calls much too \nmuch. We should have two or three bills on the floor at the same time. \nI am willing to debate and lose, but I am not willing to give consent I \ndisagree with and imply to the people I represent, in my oath to the \nConstitution, that it doesn't matter. It does matter. It matters \nimmensely.\n  The future is at risk. We are on an unsustainable course, and we are \nseeing some of that played out in the mortgage market today. We are \nseeing some of that played out with the value of the dollar today. We \nare seeing some of that played out in the confidence of the American \npeople, not only in the future and what they see, but in how they view \nus. We do, in fact, have an obligation to secure the future, and we do, \nin fact, have an obligation to make tough choices, priorities. Those \npriorities ought to be framed in the light of what the everyday \nAmerican family has to do to frame their priorities.\n  Instead, what we have the habit of is not making any priorities at \nall because we take it all. We don't choose. We choose to do it all, \nknowing that the consequences of that choice bear on two generations \nfrom us. We will long be gone, but the legacy we leave will deny the \nvery essence of this country. The essence of this country is one \ngeneration sacrificing for the future, for the next. The legacy we are \nleaving is exactly the opposite.\n  So I beg some patience on the part of my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle that, in fact, if we disagree on a bill going by UC, it \ndoesn't necessarily mean we disagree with the intent. It does mean that \nwe think it can be improved or we think it can be held more accountable \nor, as the case of the SBA bills I am holding now, one of them is \natrocious in terms of the money it is losing for the American people. \nYet we are supposed to agree with those bills without amending or \nvoting or debating.\n  I will be back to talk later in our time, and at the present time I \nyield.\n  Mr. CORNYN. If the Senator will yield for a quick question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I wanted to ask the distinguished Senator, earlier before \nhe was able to come to the floor, there was a unanimous consent request \noffered with regard to the ALS registry, and I, on his behalf, lodged \nan objection, although I have no personal objection. I just want to ask \nthe distinguished Senator from Oklahoma if it is his understanding it \nwas on his behalf?\n  Mr. COBURN. Absolutely. There is no question. I thank you for \ncovering for me in that regard.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I understand why we find ourselves in this \nterrible posture today and why some people are calling this Congress \nthe broken Congress, the dysfunctional Congress. If you look at the \nchart that was alluded to a moment ago about the last 31 days of the \nSenate, we have had 15 days of the last 31 days actually in session. We \nhave had 10 rollcall votes. We have had 10 rollcall votes in the last \n31 days. As a matter of fact, we should be having rollcall votes now on \nthe farm bill, which is the bill I thought was before the Senate. But, \ninstead, our colleagues from the other side of the aisle decided to put \non this show for the American people to try to portray themselves as \npassing legislation, although they knew it could not be done in the \nmanner in which they proposed--while we should be passing the farm \nbill.\n  Let me talk for a moment about the opportunities that they have \nsquandered by their mismanagement of the calendar over this last year. \nI asked the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, if he would agree to a \nunanimous consent request, and also the majority leader, to help fund \nour troops who are in harm's way during a time of war. They objected to \nthat.\n  As a matter of fact, Republicans attempted to call up the Veterans \nappropriations bill before the Veterans Day holiday, and the Democrats \nobjected to bringing up that bill. Just to be clear, this is the \nappropriations bill that funds veterans affairs and military \nconstruction and is important not only to keeping our commitments to \nour veterans but to maintaining a decent quality of life for the \nfamilies who are left behind while their loved one is in harm's way in \nIraq or Afghanistan and other dangerous places across the world.\n  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle blocked that \nappropriations bill like they blocked the emergency funding for the \ntroops that is needed in order to avoid the 100,000 notices to civilian \nemployees of the Department of Defense that they are going to be laid \noff. They are going to get those notices before Christmas that they are \ngoing to be laid off by mid-February unless Congress does the job it \nshould have done a long time ago. That is not even to mention--which I \nwill mention--the funding necessary for the Department of Defense to \noperate in Iraq and Afghanistan to root out al-Qaida and other foreign \nfighters, Islamic extremists who are trying to kill American\n\n[[Page S15170]]\n\nsoldiers and who, if given an opportunity to reorganize themselves in \nIraq, would use that as another launching pad to carry out murderous \nattacks against Americans and our allies.\n  Just to be clear, the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, asked me \nabout a meeting where the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State \nwere present. I explained, as I have just explained here today, what \nthe situation would be like if we failed to act, and as a result of \ntheir objection, we are not acting on a timely basis.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthe Deputy Secretary of Defense to the Republican leader that is dated \nDecember 7, 2007, signed by Gordon England to the Honorable Mitch \nMcConnell.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  Deputy Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 7, 2007.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader, 10 U.S.C. 1597(e) provides that the \n     Department of Defense ``. . . may not implement any \n     involuntary reduction or furlough of civilian positions . . . \n     until the expiration of the 45-day period beginning on the \n     date on which the Secretary submits to Congress a report \n     setting forth the reasons why such reduction or furloughs are \n     required . . .''. In accordance with this statutory \n     requirement, I am providing a report on potential furloughs \n     within the Department of the Army, the Marine Corps, and the \n     Combatant Commands.\n       As you are aware, the FY 08 DoD Appropriations Act did not \n     provide funds to the Department for the Global War on Terror \n     (GWOT). In my November 8, 2007 letter to the Senate and House \n     Appropriations Committee leadership, I emphasized that \n     without this critical funding, the Department would have no \n     choice but to deplete key appropriations accounts in order to \n     sustain essential military operations around the world.\n       Without GWOT funding, only operations and maintenance (O) \n     funds in the base budget are available to cover war-related \n     costs. O funds also cover salary costs for a large number \n     of Army and Marine Corps civilian employees.\n       The Army and Marine Corps currently estimate that the \n     fiscal demand on O funds to cover both normal operating and \n     GWOT costs will result in depletion of the Army's O funds \n     by about mid-February and the Marine Corps O funds by about \n     mid-March 2008. As a result, Army civilian employees, who are \n     paid from Army O accounts and Marine Corps civilian \n     employees, paid from Marine Corp O accounts, will at those \n     times be subject to furlough. Affected employees are located \n     throughout the United States and overseas.\n       The furlough will negatively affect our ability to execute \n     base operations and training activities. More importantly. it \n     will affect the critical support our civilian employees \n     provide to our warfighters--support which is key to our \n     current operations in both Afghanistan and Iraq.\n       Accordingly, the Department will issue potential furlough \n     information to about 100,000 affected civilian employees next \n     week. Specific furlough notices will be issued in mid-\n     January. The Department will also be notifying appropriate \n     labor organizations.\n       While these actions will be detrimental to the nation, \n     there are no other viable alternatives without additional \n     Congressional funding. Your support in providing these needed \n     funds would be greatly appreciated.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as the letter makes clear, while the \nDepartment of Defense has the ability to fund the troops in the field \nuntil mid-February--around March for the Marine Corps--this comes at \ngreat expense to those in the Department of Defense, both in and out of \nuniform. The only reason the Department of Defense can basically rob \nPeter to pay Paul in terms of paying its bills is because other \nactivities will not be funded, to include training, repair of \nequipment, and salaries. This letter makes clear that under the current \nlaw, furlough notices must soon be issued, potentially right around the \ntime Christmas hits.\n  This is not any way to run the business of our Nation. Unfortunately, \nbecause of the way our colleagues have led the Senate, we have \nsquandered a tremendous opportunity to solve the problems the American \npeople sent us here to solve.\n  We have had 66 votes on cloture motions--in other words, efforts to \nforce legislation down the throat of the minority without an \nopportunity for debate or amendment. That is a guaranteed recipe for \nfailure. As everyone in this body knows, under the rules of the Senate, \nneither the majority nor the minority can have their own way without \nbipartisan cooperation. That is the way to get things done. But, rather \nthan get things done for the American people, what we have seen is a \n``my way or the highway'' approach on the part of the leadership on the \nother side of the aisle. That is the reason we have had 63 votes, 63 \nvotes so far this session, on the war in Iraq, with various attempts on \nthe other side of the aisle either to attach strings to that money or \nto impose arbitrary deadlines on our commanders in the field or what I \nwould submit is basically to insist on surrender dates.\n  These are the same folks who called the surge a failure before it \neven started. They have said they supported the troops but yet, when it \ncomes time to show their support by making sure they have the funding \nfor the equipment and the training, to pay salaries, and to maintain a \ndecent quality of life for their loved ones who are left behind, \ninstead of acting on that stated support for the troops, have failed to \nact.\n  I know the other side of the aisle has given us a copy of various \nunanimous consent requests to give us fair notice of their intention to \nask for unanimous consent, and we have done the same.\n  On behalf of this side of the aisle, I would ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 2363, \nwhich is funding for military construction and veterans affairs.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third time \nand passed and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table and that \nany statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am disappointed to hear the objection. \nThis is the same Veterans appropriations bill and Military Construction \nbill that was passed this summer by the Senate and this summer as well \nby the House. Why is it that it has been delayed all this time? This is \nfunding for the very veterans who have sacrificed so much and given so \nmuch in the service to this country who are being told: No, we are \ngoing to hold that money back because essentially you are part of our \npolitical plans to put together a huge Omnibus appropriations at the \nend of the year and try to force the President and the minority to \naccept bloated Washington spending, when, in fact, there is no \nobjection to passage of that Veterans bill or Military Construction \nbill, and it should be passed today by unanimous consent without \nfurther delay.\n  Mr. President, I have one other unanimous consent request I would \nlike to offer. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of H.R. 3997, a bill to provide tax relief for \nour troops. I further ask that the amendment at the desk, which is the \ntext of S. 2340 and provides for full funding of our troops, emergency \nfunding for our troops, be agreed to and that the bill, as amended, be \nread a third time and passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I regret the obstruction on the part of \nthe majority. This provision, the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Tax \nRelief Act, would ensure that our military members are treated fairly \nunder our own tax laws. It would make clear that combat pay can be \ntreated as income for purposes of qualifying for the earned-income tax \ncredit. It would also make improvements to the rules for mortgage bonds \nfor veterans, clarify rules regarding survivor and disability payments, \nand continue to provide pay and benefits to National Guard and Reserve \nmembers called to Active Duty. I have already mentioned the component \nof it that would provide full funding on an emergency basis to our \ntroops who are currently fighting and, unfortunately, some being \nwounded and dying in service to their country and protection of our \nfreedoms, which has now been objected to once again.\n  I will finish my remarks for this period where I started and say that \nwe have squandered our opportunities to govern. The only way you can \ngovern\n\n[[Page S15171]]\n\nin the Congress is by building a governing coalition, Democrats working \nwith Republicans to try to solve the Nation's problems. When one side \nor the other tries to jam their agenda down the throat of the other \nside, it does not work, and exhibit A is the dismal record of this \nbroken Congress during this last year.\n  I see why our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are getting \nnervous, why their desperation to pass legislation is beginning to \nshow, because they realize they had the opportunity to lead, they \nrealize they had the opportunity to govern, but they have squandered \nthat opportunity. So now, in the last week and a half before the \nChristmas recess, they are out here trying to act as if the minority \nhas obstructed them, when, in fact, if they had only met us halfway and \nworked with us to solve some of the big issues that confront our \ncountry in a bipartisan and constructive way, we would have met them \nhalfway and we would have solved many of those problems.\n  Mr. GREGG. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will.\n  Mr. GREGG. I was wondering, is it not true that in this Congress, \nnone of the appropriations bills, which is the business of actually \noperating the Government--appropriations bills being the bills which \nfund things like education, things like health care, things like taking \ncare of roads--none of the appropriations bills have passed the \nCongress in time to meet the fiscal year?\n  Mr. CORNYN. The distinguished Senator from New Hampshire is exactly \ncorrect. My recollection is only 1 out of the 12 appropriations bills \nhas actually been signed by the President, and that was after the \nfiscal year ended, meaning that essentially Congress is doing what no \nbusiness, what no family could get away with; that is, basically to pay \nthe bills on a timely basis. So it is another example of this broken \nCongress and squandered opportunity to work together to do our basic \nduty.\n  Unfortunately, I think what we have seen now is an unfortunate game \nbeing played out where, rather than pass those bills on an individual \nbasis, there is going to be an attempt to roll them into a giant \nOmnibus appropriations bill, which someone observed the other day is \nLatin for ``hold on to your wallet.'' The President has insisted that \nhe is going to hold the line, as he well should, on wasteful Washington \nspending which would require tax increases on the American people at a \ntime when the economy is entering into a flat period. It is exactly the \nwrong time--if there is ever a right time--to raise taxes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Would the Senator yield for an additional question through \nthe chair.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator has pointed out that we passed none of the \nobligations for operating the Government prior to the beginning of the \nfiscal year. As the Senator pointed out, we have only passed 1 of those \nbills out of the 12. We are now almost 3 months into the fiscal year. \nThat happens to be the worst record in the history of the Congress, I \nbelieve.\n  That dysfunction of this Congress was not necessary, was it? Did we \nnot vote I think almost 60 times on issues involving Iraq, on \nrepetitive issues involving Iraq, to the point where the Democratic \nleaders have essentially said: We are going to ignore the operation of \nthe day-to-day business of the Government in order to call up 60 votes, \nmany of which were simply political votes, and use up the entire \ncalendar of the Congress in order to make political points, when they \nknew they were not going to be able to do a great deal in this area \nother than what they should do, which is fund the troops in the field?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the Senator from New Hampshire is \nabsolutely correct.\n  I would further say in response to his question, you know there is a \nmarked contrast to the tone that was set at the very beginning of this \nCongress with the new majority in charge. The Senator from Illinois, \nMr. Durbin, who was on the floor earlier, said:\n\n       I think the people across America said to us in this last \n     election, we want you to compromise, we want you to find \n     solutions, we do not want you to play to a draw with nothing \n     to show for it.\n\n  Well, that is in the Congressional Record on January 4, 2007. I \nagreed with that statement then. But, as I say, it stands in marked \ncontrast to what we have seem demonstrated this last year.\n  The Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, who was on the floor earlier, \non that same date said:\n\n       All too often we in Washington get lost in the world of \n     Washington, the focus on getting something done, something \n     done for the American people gets lost.\n\n  Well, I wish they had heeded their own advice because what we have to \nshow for this last year is very little, indeed. Failing to take care of \nour most basic responsibilities, as the Senator from New Hampshire has \npointed out, to fund the Government on a timely basis--the fact is, we \nfind ourselves in a terrible position now, with just a few days \nremaining until the Christmas break to get that work done.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator would yield further for a question?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would.\n  Mr. GREGG. My first two questions were sort of to lay the predicate \nfor this question, which is that the other side of the aisle has spent \na lot of time saying the minority is obstructing, the Republicans are \nobstructing. Yet was it not by conscious choice that they decided to \ncreate a legislative calendar which was totally dominated by their \ndesire to make political points over the issue of how the war in Iraq \nwas proceeding rather than to take up the appropriations bills, which \nare the proper order of the Congress, one of the first responsibilities \nof the Congress? The Republican side of the aisle has not resisted \ngoing to appropriations bills; it has been the other side of the aisle \nwhich has refused to bring them up.\n  So this allegation of obstruction is really a bit of a straw dog, is \nit not? Are they not in the position of basically having created the \nproblem and then trying to claim the problem is created by us when, in \nfact, the problem was created by the fact that they refused to take up \nthe business of the Government, and now, in the 11th hour 49th minute, \nthey have decided to turn to the business of the Government and they \nhave chaos on their hands as a result of their own management?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I agree again with the statement made and \nrespond in the affirmative to the question propounded by the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire. This Congress has spent 11 months holding Iraq \npolitical votes that have had no chance of becoming law.\n  We have had 63 votes thus far this session. In the meantime, while \nthe majority has been fiddling, the business of the American people has \nnot been done. I think about the issues besides those of national \nsecurity that cry out for solutions, things such as border security and \nimmigration reform. Couldn't we have used some of this time more \nconstructively to solve one of the biggest domestic issues confronting \nthe country today? How about energy policy? We have an energy bill that \nraises taxes on domestic producers and encourages our dependence on \nforeign oil, when we could have worked together to pass an energy \npolicy that would have prepared us for the future. We have not done \nthat. Health care, which is a tremendous concern of my constituents in \nTexas and elsewhere, we could have acted to deal with the health care \naccess cost and quality crisis in this country, but we have not.\n  I know there are other colleagues who wish to speak.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I wish to follow up on the exchange \nbetween the Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator from Texas in a \ndifferent context. I am sure the theatrics of this morning are \nentertaining for a few. But for me, they are illustrative of how a \nbroken Congress has real ramifications for the people of the State of \nGeorgia. I hold this seat in the Senate because a majority of Georgians \nsent me here to vote on their behalf and act on their behalf. But the \nway in which this session has been managed, the way in which certain \npieces of legislation have been managed, the way in which we even are \ndebating this morning in 3 hours of morning business when we should be \non the farm bill is causing\n\n[[Page S15172]]\n\npain and suffering to the people I represent. I wish to put meat on \nthose bones.\n  First, I wish to talk about the veterans bill mentioned by the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas, a bill nobody here really objected to \nbut some objected to and kept it from coming to the floor. It still has \nnot come. It has been objected to this morning. What is the \nramification of that on Georgians? The VA hospital in Atlanta, GA, on \nClaremont Road is a great VA hospital that has been there for years. It \nhas been in terrible need of repair. Three years ago, the Congress \nauthorized and appropriated the money to remodel all the floors of the \nVA hospital in Atlanta, where today hundreds of veterans of Operation \nIraqi Freedom, all the way back to the Korean war, are being attended \nto. In the last 3 years, three of those floors were redone, but they \ndidn't get the other three done, and they are waiting to be done.\n  The money, $20.552 million, is in the bank, but the authorization \nthat was passed 3 years ago has expired. As the Chair knows, we don't \nappropriate without an authorization. We are not supposed to. And if we \ndon't have an authorization, the money is frozen. The ramifications of \nholding the veterans bill to real Americans, real Georgians, real \nheroes who served this country in uniform is that those floors set to \nbe remodeled in a hospital for veterans sit there unremodeled. The new \nequipment, new technology, everything that is in there for veterans is \nheld. The money is in the bank, already appropriated. All we to have do \nis the authorization. It is in a bill nobody objects to when you talk \nto them. But continuously it is objected to on the floor of the Senate.\n  I wish to talk about the ramifications of messaging. There is a new \ntechnique we are using now. Instead of sending back a conference report \nto which a point of order can be raised--I know that is technical \njargon--you send a message. You either have to vote up or down. You \ndon't have a chance to amend or to make a point of order. Let's take \nthe Energy bill going back and forth akin to a ping-pong ball. Most \nrecently it came to us as a message, unamendable and no point of order, \nand we can't debate the dirty little secret that the renewable \nportfolio standard in the Energy bill benefits certain parts of the \nUnited States and is punitive to others. I happen to represent one of \nthose States to which it is punitive. How punitive is it? It is so \npunitive that by 2020 it will have cost the ratepayers in the State of \nGeorgia to the Southern Company and to the EMCs in our State $8.2 \nbillion. So the tactic being used does not allow me to make that point \non the floor or make a point of order or bring it to debate but asks \nall of us to agree to a proposition that would impose that much damage \non the people I represent. That is the ramification of a broken \nCongress on real people, real Georgians.\n  I understand the omnibus bill is coming to us as a message as well. \nThere is an amendment in the omnibus bill which is punitive to the \nState of Georgia. It has been put in outside the process of the \ncommittee system and outside the process of debate. I am not going to \nhave a chance to even raise a point of order on that particular \namendment. In fact, as the Senator from New Hampshire observed, we \ndidn't pass but one appropriations bill by the time the new fiscal year \ntook place. We have been going back and forth because, instead, we \nspent most of the year debating 62 separate votes on whether to \nwithdraw our troops from Iraq. In fact, I find it sad that in the 6 \nmonths that debate has been going on, the surge has worked by \neverybody's definition. Progress in Iraq has been of a tremendous \nadvantage. The men and women who have sacrificed and accomplished it \nand are fighting there today are looking at us playing games with the \nmoney to fund the military. It is not only wrong, it is sad. It is time \nwe had an appropriations process that worked in the Senate, not one \nthat is broken.\n  It is time we looked at ideas such as Senator Domenici's biennial \nbudget, where you appropriate in odd-numbered years and you do \noversight in even-numbered years. Wouldn't it be fun to see an even-\nnumbered year election for Congress or President where the debate \nwasn't on what I was going to appropriate to make you happy but instead \nthe savings I was going to find to make our country run better? \nSenator Domenici, who is leaving us at the end of next year, has a \ngreat proposition. It ought to go. We ought to be appropriating money \nby the time the fiscal year starts.\n\n  The real effect on real Georgians with the process now is that in \nDecember of 2007, in the first quarter of the fiscal year 2008, we have \nGovernment appropriations policy based on an appropriations bill passed \nin 2006. The body of knowledge doubles every 7 years. We are still 2 \nyears behind on our appropriations process. Why? Because of the \ndilatory tactics, because of thematic debates, and all because one side \nwants to leverage against another, to the detriment of real people.\n  Lastly, I wish to talk about the real damage of a broken Congress on \nthe appointment process. In today's Executive Calendar, there is a list \nof any number of appointees to any number of positions in the \nGovernment--judicial appointees, Department of Homeland Security \nappointees, Tennessee Valley Authority appointees, hazardous and \nchemical waste oversight board appointees. All those appointees have \ncome out of committee; some of them from the committee I am on, \nEnvironment and Public Works. They have testified before the committee. \nThey have been subjected to questions. They have been thoroughly \nvetted, and they have been voted out of committee; in the case of EPW, \nvoted out unanimously.\n  Last Thursday, there was a move to pass this list, still on the \ncalendar, by unanimous consent. Remember, all these appointees have \ngone through the committee process. They have been vetted. They have \nbeen voted on. They have testified. They have subjected themselves to \nall the questions we could possibly ask. Yet there was an objection \nlast week. So what is the pain and suffering to the American people? In \nthose four States where judges were asked to be approved, they continue \nto have a backlog of criminal cases, a backlog of critical cases.\n  To me and the Members of this body who represent areas that are \nserved by the Tennessee Valley Authority, Congress finally fixed the \nTVA 2 years ago, got it under new management, into a good system, ran \nit like a business, appointed a significant board, and now it is time \nto reappoint three of those members or reappoint two and add one new \none from Georgia, I might add. What happens? Somebody says: I object. \nWe are objecting to the American people's business, are objecting to \nthe progress of what this Government was set up to do.\n  The broken Congress of 2008 has real consequences, not for me but for \nthe people of my State. I will stay until Christmas or New Year's and \nrepeat what I have said until somebody throws the light switch and \nunderstands the games we are playing don't affect us; they affect the \npeople who sent us. In the case of the four examples I have given, they \naffect them negatively.\n  To that point, I would like to make two unanimous consent requests. \nThe first one is going to be with regard to the TVA board. I wish to \nrepeat one thing I said. They all were approved unanimously. Two of \nthem are reappointments. They are all fine people. TVA has reduced its \ndebt under new management. Congress worked hard to pass this 2 years \nago. It is time to have these people seated and working.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session \nto consider the following nominations: Calendar Nos. 404, 405, and 406; \nthese are three nominations to be members of the board of directors of \nthe Tennessee Valley Authority. I ask consent that these pending \nnominations be confirmed en bloc, the motions to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that the President be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action. I finally ask consent that the Senate then resume \nlegislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, on behalf of majority leader, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations to \nthe judiciary: No. 373, John Tinder to the U.S. Circuit Court for the \n7th Circuit;\n\n[[Page S15173]]\n\nNo. 392, Amul Thapar, to be U.S. district judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Kentucky; No. 395, Joseph Laplante, to be U.S. district \njudge for the District of New Hampshire; and No. 396, Thomas Schroeder, \nto be U.S. district judge for the Middle District of North Carolina.\n  I ask consent that these pending nominations be confirmed en bloc, \nthe motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, and the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action. I further ask that the \nSenate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. On behalf of the majority leader, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I understand the Senator from Washington is acting on \nbehalf of her leader. I respect that. But the point I have tried to \nmake in my speech I want to end with. These are seven individuals, four \nof whom in the judiciary in four States could be processing criminal \ncases, taking appeals, making the justice system of the United States \nwork. We all know the backlog in the courts. The Presiding Officer is a \ndistinguished attorney. I have heard him talk about that very question. \nThen the three that were objected to on the Tennessee Valley Authority \nwere approved unanimously. All we are saying to one of the biggest \nproviders of electrical energy in the United States of America that was \nreformed by this Senate less than 18 months ago is: You are not \nimportant enough for us to approve what has already been passed by \nunanimous consent in committee.\n  I submit that a broken Congress has real consequences. This Congress \nis broken, and the consequences are negative on the people of my State \nof Georgia and the people of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia and the \nSenator from Texas for their leadership. With that leadership comes a \nvery clear voice about the problems this current Congress is facing. \nThey are problems that are historic in character. I was once in the \nmajority. It was the minority who said: We can do better and, \ntherefore, we should run the Congress. In the last election, the \nAmerican people listened and they changed the Congress. While I was \nchairing the Veterans' Affairs Committee at that time, we lost the \nCongress--we, the Republicans--by a reality of dropping to 32 percent \nin the minds of Americans as to an effective and responsible Congress. \nThe minority played on that. They became the majority. They took over \nthe leadership. They made a great deal of promises. Here we are in the \neleventh and a half hour headed toward the twelfth hour of this session \nof Congress. They have not accomplished it. They have dropped below 11 \npercent in favorable rating among the American people.\n  The American people do want to see us get along. At the same time, \nthey want their Government to function in a timely and responsible way. \nThat is exactly what this Congress has failed to do.\n  I come to the floor to speak about two issues specifically. The \nassistant majority leader came to the floor earlier today and asked \nunanimous consent that S. 1233 and S. 1315 be allowed to come to the \nfloor under unanimous consent or to come to the floor with debate and \nfinal passage. The reason he had to do that was before the Thanksgiving \nrecess, I came to the floor and objected to the movement of those \nbills. The Senator from Oklahoma also now objects to the movement of \nthose bills. I think it is very important that not only does the record \nbear why we objected but the American people clearly understand why we \nare objecting, because these are veterans bills.\n  These are bills that deal with critical needs of America's veterans. \nI was once chairman and ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, and I am not going to suggest that I need to add credentials \nto my record as supporting America's veterans. My responsibility is to \nmake sure the services to our veterans get delivered in a responsible \nand timely way, that the truly needy service-connected and poor veteran \ngets served, and that the needs of those coming in out of Afghanistan \nand Iraq, who then become veterans out of our active service, are met \nin an immediate way. That is the responsibility of this Congress. It is \nnot to keep adding and adding and adding new programs that may or may \nnot be necessary and adding and adding and adding billions of dollars \nthat anyone in service to veterans can say is at best questionable. It \nis for those reasons that I objected to those bills.\n  Now, let me break down why because there are some very real issues \nhere.\n  S. 1233 is an important piece of legislation that a majority of those \nof us who supported the legislation to begin with agreed to. It is \ncalled the Veterans Traumatic Brain Injury and Health Programs \nImprovement Act of 2007. Any bill with that title would capture your \nimagination. One of the great concerns we have today is the traumatic \nbrain injuries our men and women in service are coming out of Iraq \nwith, especially because of the types of bombs that are being used over \nthere. Oftentimes, this kind of injury does not show up in a veteran \nuntil he or she becomes a veteran.\n  If you look down through the priorities of that bill, you look at \nincreased veterans' travel benefits--yes, rural veterans coming to \nveterans centers to be served; a major medical facilities project; \nadding to the expanded services of veterans health care; professional \nscholarship programs; extended time for preferred care; help for low-\nincome veterans; traumatic brain injury program enhancement; assisted-\nliving pilot program enhancement--all of those very valuable and very \nmeaningful, strongly supported by the Veterans' Affairs Committee and \nstrongly supported by this Senate.\n  But what happened at the last minute was that a Senator on the other \nside added a new program. They said: We are going to allow Priority 8 \nveterans to become eligible for the full service of health care under \nthe veterans health care system. What is a Priority 8 veteran? A \nPriority 8 veteran is one who has no service-connected disability or \ninjury or health care concern. Did they serve? Yes, they served. Did \nthey sustain any injury or physical needs as a result of their service? \nNo. Are they at the poverty level or below? No. They are above it. And \nin most instances--in fact, in a high percentage of them--through their \nown employment, they have health care.\n  So for a good number of years, because of costs, we who watch the \nveterans issues and Presidents and Secretaries of the VA have said we \nwill not serve them. They will not be eligible for the full benefits. \nThis President, President Bush, said: I will make them eligible, but \nthey need to pay a small fee, a couple hundred bucks a year, to have \naccess to the greatest health care program in the world. The minority \nat that time, the Democrats, said: No. They get it free of charge or \nthey don't get it.\n  Well, all of a sudden into this very valuable bill they parachuted \nPriority 8 veterans. What does that do? Well, if you go talk to the \nSecretary of the Veterans' Administration, they are going to tell you \nthat it might cause a substantial problem. Why? Because all of a sudden \nin this health care system there could be 1.3 million more Americans \neligible for health care--not planned for, not anticipated, not \nbudgeted for, but parachuted in, I have to believe all in the name of \ntrying to show a concern for veterans and to demonstrate that maybe we \nare a little more sensitive than the other side.\n  What does that mean? Well, it also means the potential of between \n$1.2 billion more expended in 2008 and up to $8.8 billion more by 2012. \nDid they fund it? No. Have they stuck it in the bill? Yes. Are they \ntrying to create a priority? Yes. Are they trying to create a new \nexpenditure? Yes. And I said: No. Let's serve our poor and our needy \nand our disabled first and our traumatically brain injured and our \npost-traumatic stress syndrome veterans. Let's serve them now. Let's \nput money into the bill to do that.\n  So the Senator from Texas talked about the VA-MILCON bill that is \nright at the desk right now, sent out by the ranking minority member of \nthe VA-MILCON Subcommittee, on which I serve, of Appropriations, \nSenator Hutchison. We are trying to get a vote on it. That bill--that \nbill alone--has nearly $8 billion worth of new spending in it for \nveterans. That is a near 17.5-\n\n[[Page S15174]]\n\nto 18-percent increase over last year. I believe it can be said, other \nthan defense, to be the largest increase in a budget of all of \nGovernment for this year. But the money I am talking about, the new \nmoney for Priority 8, is not even in that one. All of this new money \nfor veterans needs that is in the bill that we are being told cannot be \npassed, that we keep trying to get a vote on, does not even include the \n$1.5 billion to $8 billion necessary to fund this new program for \nveterans who are not needy, who are not service connected, and who have \nnot been eligible for a good number of years.\n  That is why we are saying no. You take Priority 8 out of this, and \nthe Veterans Traumatic Brain Injury and Health Programs Improvement \nAct, S. 1233, could pass, and it would pass on a voice vote because the \nSenate--Democrats and Republicans--have always supported our veterans. \nBut we will not nor will I allow us to get caught in the game of first \nyou argue on the other side that we have a war nobody likes and a \nPresident who is not managing it well, and then on the other side you \nare saying we are not taking care of our veterans. I reject that, and I \nreject it totally for these reasons.\n  While I was chair and ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, and throughout the Bush administration, we have increased \nthe funding for veterans on an annualized basis anywhere from 10 to 12 \npercent. When I talk about the appropriations bill that is at the desk \nfor veterans being a historically large increase, well, the one the \nyear before was a historically large increase. We have never ducked our \nresponsibility to veterans. But we must prioritize, and we must focus \non the truly needy, and we must focus on those who are coming out of \nIraq and Afghanistan and traumatic brain injury and all of those who \ncontinue to suffer today. That is the first bill, and it will continue \nto be objected to until they take out those kinds of add-ons.\n  Let's talk about the second bill. The second bill is S. 1315. Now, \nthat is an interesting bill because if you look at it on its face \nvalue, you say: Yes, that makes some sense. We are going to give a \nveterans' benefit enhancement to a certain class of veteran. Let me \ntell you who that veteran is.\n\n  The bill includes roughly $900 million in new entitlement spending on \nan array of veterans' benefits, but what is interesting is, it is \nmoving money away from poor, elderly, disabled and wartime U.S. \nveterans. It is taking effectively $2,000 annually from our veterans \nand moving it over to a veteran who does not even live in the United \nStates and is not a citizen of the United States--a Filipino veteran.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Why I object to this--and I call this bill the ``Robin \nHood in reverse'' bill--is quite simple. If any of you have watched the \nKen Burns PBS series ``The War,'' there is one whole segment of that \nabout the war in the Philippines and the Filipinos who came forward to \nfight with Americans and even serve in American uniforms in defense of \ntheir land and ours during World War II. They did not become American \ncitizens. They were Filipinos, and they have always received benefits. \nBut this bill now reaches in and takes money away from our veterans, \nour poor veterans, because of a court case and is giving it to them.\n  Here is my problem. First of all, they do not live in this country, \nand they are not U.S. citizens. They are currently receiving benefits. \nBut for the average U.S. veteran, their benefits, right now under law, \ncannot exceed $10,929 a year. That is roughly 24 percent of the average \nU.S. household income. But this benefit which is in this bill gives to \na veteran--a non-U.S. citizen, living in the Philippines--100 percent \nof the average household income in the Philippines. They are taking \nthat money away from our veterans to do it. That is the ``Robin Hood in \nreverse'' effect. At least Robin Hood, when he took money, left it in \nNottingham. He spread it out amongst his own. Here we are taking money \nfrom our own and sending it all the way to the Philippines.\n  Now, let me say, and let me be very clear, Americans have treated \nFilipino veterans fairly. After the war, the United States provided \n$620 million--or $6.7 billion in today's dollars--to repair the \nPhilippines. The United States provided $22.5 million--$196 million in \ntoday's dollars--for equipment and construction. We have a hospital in \nthe Philippines, and Filipino veterans legally residing in the United \nStates--in the United States--are fully eligible for all VA veterans' \nbenefits based on their level of service. Survivors of Filipino \nveterans who died as a result of their service are eligible for \neducational assistance and all kinds of programs.\n  That is why I object. First of all, because we are taking money away \nfrom ours, but also because we have been more than generous since that \nwar ended to our comrades, the Filipinos, who fought side by side with \nAmerican men and women, who were in the Philippines at the time, after \nwe were able to reclaim the Philippine Islands. So we have done \nwonderfully by them, and we have been very supportive of providing them \nwith programs.\n  Remember, the average U.S. veterans' benefit--24 percent of U.S. \naverage household income--is limited. Yet we are taking that money away \nfrom them now, giving it to Filipino veterans who are non-U.S. \ncitizens, and increasing their benefit to over 100 percent of the \naverage household income in the Philippines. U.S. dollars spent in the \nPhilippines at that amount lifts--there is no question about it--lifts \nthat Filipino dramatically. The question is, Is it fair? Is it \nequitable? My answer is, It is not. I offered to say, yes, we can bump \nthem a little bit, but let's take the rest of this money and put it \ninto educational benefits for our veterans coming out of Iraq and \nAfghanistan. The answer in the committee was no.\n  So that is why these bills are in trouble on the floor. They have \nloaded them up. They are too heavy. The tires are blowing out from \nunder the trucks of these bills simply because too much is too much. In \nthe instance of this, Disabled American Veterans--that great \norganization which is a loud spokesperson for our veterans--is saying: \nWhoa, wait a moment here. Enough is enough, and this is too much. They \nthemselves oppose this legislation as it is currently written.\n  So here we have a funding bill on the floor with a 17.5- to 18-\npercent increase over last year's funding for veterans, and we are not \nallowed to vote on it. We have funding at the highest level ever for \nAmerica's veterans, as we should and as we must, but these bills take \nus well beyond it in an unfunded environment or in one instance \nreaching in the pocket of our poor and disabled veteran and taking that \nmoney out and putting it into the pocket of a veteran living in the \nPhilippines, who never became an American citizen, and who never came \nto this country, who has chosen to stay in his homeland. We now give \nthem benefits, but this is a benefit well beyond what is even currently \nbeing offered to our own. Those are the fundamental reasons why we have \nobjected.\n\n  I was pleased when the Senator from Texas said to the Senator from \nIllinois, the assistant majority leader: No. Yes, we will object, and \nwe are not embarrassed about doing it, because there have to be \npriorities to our funding, especially at a time when the VA budget that \nis at the desk is the largest increase of a veterans' budget, to my \nknowledge, ever. We are proud of that, but there is a point when enough \nis, in fact, enough.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, how much time remains in morning business \non our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-three minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, in a moment I am going to yield and ask \nunanimous consent that the Senator from Alabama be recognized for up to \n10 minutes, followed by the Senator from Wyoming, Dr. Barrasso, for up \nto 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Would the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request \nfor material to be inserted in the Record?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that minority views \non S. 1233 and minority views on S. 1315 be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S15175]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Minority Views\n\n\n                                S. 1233\n\n       The underlying legislation provides many important \n     provisions that will improve the health care services and \n     benefits available to America's veterans. I am particularly \n     pleased that Title I takes many important steps towards \n     improving the care provided to those veterans suffering with \n     a traumatic brain injury.\n       However, in a few areas, I believe the legislation not only \n     fails to improve the current benefits and health care system \n     available for veterans, it in fact dilutes certain benefits \n     available for service-connected veterans and may undermine \n     the access and quality of care provided to the current users \n     of VA's health care system.\n       Let me explain my concerns.\n     Repeal of the Regulation Concerning the Enrollment of \n         Priority 8 Veterans\n       The underlying legislation repeals a regulation issued by \n     former Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Anthony J. Principi \n     concerning enrollment priorities. That regulation prohibited \n     enrollment into VA's health care system by any veteran in \n     Priority 8 status who had not enrolled prior to January 17, \n     2003. At the time Secretary Principi announced the new \n     regulation, a VA news release stated:\n       VA has been unable to provide all enrolled veterans with \n     timely access to health care services because of the \n     tremendous growth in the number of veterans seeking VA health \n     care. . . .\n       In order to ensure VA has capacity to care for veterans for \n     whom our Nation has the greatest obligation--[those with] \n     military-related disabilities, lower-income veterans or those \n     needing specialized care like veterans who are blind or have \n     spinal cord injuries--Principi has suspended additional \n     enrollments for veterans with the lowest statutory priority. \n     This category includes veterans who are not being compensated \n     for a military-related disability and who have higher \n     incomes.\n       Since that decision was rendered, many Veterans Service \n     Organizations and individual veterans have advocated re-\n     opening the health care system to all veterans. However, none \n     has advocated abolishing the priority system developed under \n     the Eligibility Reform Act of 1996, which was the basis for \n     Principi's decision in 2003. Continuing that trend, the \n     underlying bill does not repeal the eligibility \n     prioritization structure created under the 1996 law.\n       Given that the statutory priorities for health care \n     enrollment still exist, it would be reasonable to presume \n     that the majority had made a determination that VA was now \n     providing all currently enrolled veterans with timely access \n     to quality health care. And therefore the conditions which \n     drove Secretary Principi's earlier decision (an inability to \n     provide enrolled veterans with timely access to health care \n     services) no longer existed. The record, however, does not \n     suggest that such a conclusion has been reached by the \n     majority.\n       Instead, the record shows many Senators expressing concerns \n     about service members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan \n     facing--what are often described as--lengthy waiting times \n     for care. In the face of such assessments, I do not \n     understand how the majority could suggest that opening up the \n     health care system to hundreds-of-thousands--if not \n     millions--of new patients is wise policy.\n       Moreover, it appears that the provision in this bill would \n     open VA to new enrollees on the day the legislation is signed \n     into law. There is no plan required to ensure that the \n     enrollment process would be orderly and executed in a way \n     that would minimize its effect on current patients. Nor is \n     there any requirement that the necessary funding be available \n     prior to its implementation. Instead, VA would simply open \n     the doors and wait to see who arrives. I believe that is \n     irresponsible and unfair to the current enrollees.\n       That is not just my view. Rather, my opinion echoes that of \n     the Disabled American Veterans who, while commenting on the \n     issue of re-opening VA to priority 8's, stated that ``without \n     a major infusion of new funding, enactment of this bill [S. \n     1147] would worsen VA's financial situation, not improve it, \n     and would likely have a negative impact on the system as a \n     whole.''\n       To address my concerns, I offered an amendment during the \n     Committee's consideration of the legislation. My amendment \n     would have required Secretarial certification of three facts \n     prior to enrollment being deemed ``open.''\n       First, the Secretary would have had to certify that quality \n     of care and access thereto for enrolled veterans in Priority \n     groups 1-6 would not be adversely affected by the newer \n     patients. Because current law treats those veterans as a \n     higher priority, I believe that VA must demonstrate \n     conclusively that it is already offering high quality, timely \n     care to our service-connected and lower income veterans. As \n     I've already stated, recent observations and statements by \n     some Senators suggest otherwise.\n       Second, the Secretary would have had to certify that troops \n     returning from Iraq and Afghanistan were provided timely, \n     high quality health care already and that such timeliness and \n     quality would not suffer because of newer enrollees. In my \n     view, VA's health care system was created primary for the \n     purpose of caring for ``he who shall have borne the battle.'' \n     Congress should ensure that this unique group of veterans is \n     not unduly burdened by any new influx of higher income \n     veterans with no military-related disabilities.\n       Finally, my amendment would have required that the \n     Secretary certify to Congress that VA had the capability to \n     see a large influx of new patients. My amendment asked for an \n     assessment as to whether VA had the physical infrastructure, \n     human resources, and medical equipment to treat any new \n     influx of veterans.\n       I recognize that many Senators believe that money is the \n     only obstacle to providing all veterans with health care \n     through VA. However, any money provided for new patients \n     would be used to buy new staff, new equipment, and new space. \n     Therefore, I felt it was important to know whether each of \n     those three goods or services was possible to obtain.\n       The issue of whether VA has the capability to hire new \n     staff alone should give any Senator pause in supporting the \n     expansion in this legislation. It is widely known that the \n     nation is struggling to provide a stable supply of primary \n     care physicians and nurses to provide basic health care \n     services in non-VA facilities. This issue was made clear in a \n     July 2007 report from the Health Research Institute of \n     PricewaterhouseCoopers which showed that the United States \n     will be short nearly one million nurses and 24,000 physicians \n     by 2020. In that environment, simply finding new staff to \n     hire will be a challenge for any health care system, \n     including VA.\n       Further, assuming the requisite staff can be found, I \n     remain skeptical that VA has the necessary clinical space in \n     which to provide more primary and specialty care services. I \n     am also equally skeptical that many VA facilities could open \n     the additional operating rooms, post-surgical recovery units, \n     and intensive care units that would be required with a large \n     increase in patients.\n       My amendment failed in Committee. Still, while the answers \n     to the questions may not be required by law prior to opening \n     the health care system to all veterans, I continue to believe \n     it would be a mistake to proceed without the knowledge set \n     forth in my amendment. As such, I oppose Section 301 of the \n     bill.\n\n\n                                S. 1315\n\n       In view of these findings, I introduced S. 1290 to overhaul \n     the statutory scheme regarding SAAs to help eliminate \n     redundant administrative procedures, increase VA's \n     flexibility in determining the nature and extent of services \n     that should be performed by SAAs, and improve accountability \n     for any activities they undertake. I am pleased that S. 1315 \n     includes provisions that would require VA to coordinate with \n     other entities in order to reduce overlapping activities and \n     to report to Congress on its efforts to establish appropriate \n     performance measures and tracking systems for SAA activities. \n     However, I remain concerned that S. 1315 would leave in place \n     the inflexible statutory provisions that mandate what \n     activities SAAs must perform, how those functions must be \n     carried out, and how VA must pay for them. As VA stated in \n     response to-GAO's findings, ``amending the agency's \n     administrative and regulatory authority to streamline the \n     approval process may be difficult due to the specific \n     approval requirements of the law.'' Thus, I believe that, in \n     order to effectively update and streamline this process, VA \n     should be provided with the authority to contract with SAAs \n     for services that it deems valuable and to determine how \n     those services should be performed, evaluated, and \n     compensated.\n       Finally, I wish to draw attention to the funding provision \n     in section 302 of the Committee bill, which would provide $19 \n     million in mandatory funding to pay for SAA services for each \n     fiscal year hereafter. To the contrary, my bill (S. 1290) \n     included a funding provision--similar to legislation that the \n     Senate passed in 2006--that would provide a $19 million \n     spending authorization for SAAs. This funding mechanism \n     would, for now, continue to allow some funding to be drawn \n     from mandatory spending accounts and would begin to \n     transition SAA funding to a discretionary funding model. By \n     relying on discretionary--rather than mandatory--funding, VA \n     and the SAAs would have to justify budgeting and funding \n     decisions based on need and performance outcomes, as with any \n     private-sector business or good-government business model.\n     Section 401\n       Section 401 of S. 1315 would expand benefits to certain \n     Filipino veterans residing both in the United States and \n     abroad. I support improving benefits for Filipino veterans \n     who fought under U.S. command during World War II. However, I \n     believe the approach taken in this bill with respect to \n     special pension benefits for non-U.S. citizen and non- U.S. \n     resident Filipino veterans and surviving spouses is overly \n     generous and does not reflect wide discrepancies in U.S. and \n     Philippine standards of living.\n       Pension benefits for veterans residing in the United States \n     are paid at a maximum annual rate of $10,929 for a veteran \n     without dependents, $14,313 for a veteran with one dependent, \n     and $7,329 for a surviving spouse. When viewing these amounts \n     in relation to U.S. average-household income of $46,000, we \n     find that the maximum VA pension represents anywhere from 16 \n     to 31 percent of U.S. household income. In contrast, when \n     measured against the Philippine average\n\n[[Page S15176]]\n\n     household income of $2,800, the special pension for Filipino \n     veterans in S. 1315 represents anywhere from 86 to 161 \n     percent of Philippine household income.\n       I think it is a mistake, and grossly unfair to U.S.-based \n     pension recipients, to pay a benefit to veterans in the \n     Philippines that far exceeds the relative value of the same \n     benefit provided in the United States. Providing benefits for \n     Filipino veterans in the name of equity should not be done in \n     a manner that, in my opinion, creates a dramatic inequity for \n     our U.S. veterans.\n       Furthermore, the offset that S. 1315 uses to ensure that \n     the bill is in compliance with Congressional budget rules \n     would have the effect of reducing pension amounts to elderly, \n     poor, and disabled veterans predominantly residing in the \n     U.S. The extra pension amounts were established as a result \n     of a 2006 decision of the Court of Appeals for Veterans \n     Claims in Hartness v. Nicholson. In my opinion, these extra \n     payments for certain categories of veterans were never \n     contemplated by Congress and, therefore, are not justified. \n     However, if presented with the choice of whether to provide \n     extra pension assistance to low-income veterans in the U.S. \n     or to provide extra pension assistance in the amounts \n     contemplated in section 401 of S. 1315, I would recommend to \n     my colleagues that they choose the former.\n     Sections 205, 701, 702, and 802\n       I also wish to comment on four additional provisions that \n     were adopted as amendments at the Committee's June 27, 2007, \n     markup. In doing so I want to make it clear that my comments \n     have nothing at all to do with the substance of the proposed \n     policy changes contained in these provisions. Rather, my \n     comments will focus on the manner in which the policy changes \n     in each provision are proposed to be financed; whether the \n     proposed financing method is in consort with the spirit of \n     sound budgeting principles; and whether the financing method \n     may potentially result in an unwieldy and inequitable outcome \n     for veterans.\n       Each of the four provisions proposes to authorize the \n     expenditure of discretionary appropriations as an ``overlay'' \n     for the purpose of supplementing entitlement programs for \n     veterans. Thus, beneficiaries of certain housing and auto \n     grant programs, and burial-related programs, would be \n     ``entitled'' to the amounts specified in the provisions, but \n     only to the extent that annual appropriations bills provided \n     the necessary discretionary funding that was in addition to \n     the funding provided in regular mandatory entitlement \n     spending.\n       The problem with creating ``hybrid entitlement'' programs--\n     one part funded on a mandatory basis, the other funded \n     through an annual discretionary appropriation--is both the \n     ensuing problems that would exist in administering the \n     programs and the implications such a model would have on how \n     Congress controls spending of taxpayer dollars. We have \n     budget rules referred to as Pay-As-You-Go or ``PAYGO'' that \n     require the Congress to pay for new entitlement spending \n     through a decrease in other entitlement spending, an increase \n     in revenue, or a combination of both. Such a construct was \n     created in order to keep-budget deficits from growing. Yet \n     the four provisions in question adopt none of these \n     approaches.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. To be clear, we have had objections from the majority, \nfrom our Democratic friends, to legislation that is vitally important \nto our veterans and to our active-duty military: the Veterans' \nAdministration and military construction funding bill that was passed \nby both Houses of the Congress last summer and which has been held up \nand held hostage to the political games here in Washington, as well as \nthe emergency troop funding that is needed to fund ongoing operations \nin Afghanistan and Iraq, which we have discussed as well. This is a \npersonal issue, as 1.7 million veterans live in my State in Texas. We \nhave 15 major military bases where military families live and work. One \nout of every 10 active-duty military members who wears the uniform of \nthe United States calls Texas home, and we have guards and reservists \nwho are also serving valiantly in Iraq and elsewhere.\n  The bill which has been blocked by the majority would provide $20 \nbillion in military construction funds important for our troops and \nquality of life for our military families, and it is important to my \nState of Texas because of our support for the troops and military \nfamilies. It contains almost $90 billion for our veterans, which \nincludes their health care, upgrading facilities, money to hire \nadditional claims processors so veterans don't have to wait so long to \nget the benefits to which they are entitled. As I said, there are about \n1.7 million veterans in Texas and they need these funds, and they \nshouldn't be held hostage to the political games here in Washington \nwith regard to an omnibus appropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we should be frank as to where we are \ntoday. The situation is not good. Yes, we do have too much partisanship \nin this body, and we need to move beyond it. But I wish to ask a couple \nof questions. I think we might as well talk about it directly and \nhonestly: Has this Congress performed well this year? I say we have \nnot. We passed only one appropriations bill, and it is almost \nChristmas. They all should have been passed before the end of the \nfiscal year, September 30. Only one has been passed. No wonder the \npolling data shows Congress has the lowest respect of the public in our \nhistory. I know that in this last election, my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle campaigned strenuously: Elect us and we will do \nbetter. Elect us and we will balance the budget and we will be fiscally \nresponsible; the Republicans aren't fiscally responsible. We will do \nthings in a better way, and we will run the Senate in a better way. For \nthe majority, I have to say it is incontrovertible that that has not \noccurred. In fact, we are about to vote--perhaps, because who knows \nwhat may happen in the last hours--but the momentum is in place and the \ngoal is to bring forward an omnibus bill that has all but one \nappropriations bill in it, no telling what other legislation in it. It \nis going to be hundreds, perhaps 1,000-plus pages. It is going to be \ndropped here. It is going to make this Agriculture bill look like a \ndime novel. They are going to say: Vote for it. It is going to be over \nbudget and it is going to try to put constraints on our military \ncommanders in Iraq, telling them how to deploy our troops. It is not \ngoing to be accepted by the President. It is not going to be accepted \nby the American people.\n  So we are in a big deal. We are heading to a real collision course, \nand my colleagues on the other side are trying to blame people on this \nside for it. I don't think that is legitimate; I really don't.\n  Senator Cornyn has shown at great length how little has been done \nthis last month. We have only had 10 votes. Is that right, Senator \nCornyn? In the last 31 days, 10 votes. Why is that? Is this hard to do? \nIt is not hard to have votes. You can have 10 votes a day. We have had \ndays where we have had 40 votes or more a day. We are not having votes \nbecause the majority party, led by the majority leader, Senator Reid, \ndoesn't want to vote. Senator Reid is a good friend and a person I like \nand respect, but he has a group of people there and they don't want to \nvote, because votes define you. You can talk all kinds of platitudes, \nbut when a vote comes up, are you going to vote for money for our \nsoldiers or not? Are you going to vote to tell General Petraeus how to \ndeploy his troops or not? Are you going to vote to fund Defense? Are \nyou going to vote to crack down on illegal immigration or not? So they \ndon't want to vote. That puts them on record.\n  They are trying to move all of this pork, all this funding, all of \nthose appropriations bills in one colossal package, and they want to \nhave the absolute minimum number of votes to avoid being on record on \nimportant issues--issues that Americans care about; issues that are \nimportant to America.\n  But I will tell my colleagues the big deal. The big deal in this--and \nwe might as well be honest about it--what are we going to do about our \ntroops who are right there on the eve of Christmas serving us in harm's \nway?\n  Let me read an e-mail given to me by a father-in-law of a soldier in \nIraq. It was sent in October. You know, we have had a tremendous \nreduction in violence in the last several months. Things have gone \nbetter than I would have thought possible in June. I believe General \nPetraeus's strategy is working in a way that I didn't think would be so \npositive. There is a long way to go, though, and this e-mail indicates \nthat it is still tough.\n  He talks about his staff sergeant, a man of the highest character, \nwho was killed by a sniper:\n\n       The loss affected us all significantly. He was a ranger and \n     a jump master that constantly led his men from the front. \n     The men performed heroically and magnificently. After he \n     was hit, myself and our medic were attending to him within \n     seconds. We were receiving fire from multiple locations \n     and the boys were hitting them back hard. We did get the \n     sniper and he is no longer a threat to\n\n[[Page S15177]]\n\n     any of our forces. Still, more are out there, \n     unfortunately. Four days later we had another one of our \n     leaders hit by an IED.\n\n  He goes on to say this:\n\n       I have been reading in the newspapers and trying to figure \n     out why some political powers are openly encouraging the \n     enemy to embolden themselves and display the disdain to \n     attack us daily. If all these presidential candidates would \n     admit to the public what they already know, this would be \n     easier. They voted for us to be here. They authorized the \n     President to use force.\n\n  And so forth.\n  I want to say our men and women are there. They are serving us. We \nhave seen tremendous progress, and we don't need to tell General \nPetraeus, who is doing a fabulous job, how to deploy his troops. The \nPresident cannot and will not accept that. We need to fund them. \nGeneral Petraeus promised that in March he would be back before this \nCongress and hopefully, he implied, to announce further reductions in \nour troops. Let's do this. Let's don't have this gimmick in which all \nthe appropriations bills are put into one, the supplemental for our \ntroops is put into it, and try to put the President in a position where \nhe is forced to veto legislation that ought not to be. We ought to take \ncare of our soldiers first, get that done, and we can fight over these \nother matters at some time.\n  I know other people are here who wish to speak. I will offer this \nunanimous consent request for S. 2400.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Armed \nServices be discharged from further consideration of S. 2400, the \nWounded Warrior Bonus Equity Act, and that the Senate proceed to its \nimmediate consideration. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read \nthe third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would \nsimply indicate that the wounded warriors legislation has already \npassed the Senate once. I am wondering, since it is included in the \nDepartment of Defense reauthorization legislation that will be coming \nto us--the conference report will be coming to us shortly--I am \nwondering if my friend will amend his unanimous consent request to \nindicate that when we receive the conference report on the Department \nof Defense reauthorization, that it will be agreed to by unanimous \nconsent.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I probably misspoke a little bit. This \nis not the wounded warrior legislation you are talking about; it is the \nWounded Warrior Bonus Equity Act that has been filed. It is S. 2400. It \ndeals with a situation in which persons who have been promised bonuses \nto enlist and reenlist and then have been discharged due to injuries \nsustained in the line of duty, the Dole-Shalala Commission raised the \nquestion of whether those promises were being honored because these \nbonuses are dispensed over a number of years. They have been injured, \nsome have been in combat, and they have not received their full bonus. \nThis would move that bill forward. It is different than the bill which \nthe Senator referred to. It has bipartisan support. Senator Casey, the \nPresiding Officer, Senators Clinton, Dorgan, Lautenberg, Martinez, \nMurkowski, Sanders, Wyden, Webb, Lieberman, Ensign, Collins, and McCain \nare in support of it. For some reason, there is a hold on it. I renew \nmy unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, again reserving the right to object, I \nwould indicate we certainly will work together with the Senator from \nAlabama. We have placed our troops and veterans as our highest \npriority. But given the time at the moment, I would, on behalf of the \nmajority leader, object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will yield the floor in 1 second, but \nfirst I need to say we are not in a good position today. This Congress \nhas not performed well. We have passed only one appropriations bill. We \nhave had only 10 votes in the last 31 days. That is not a good \nperformance. I have been prepared to move forward on this legislation \nand I hope others will. I am disappointed that we have continual \nobjections to that end.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, may I ask how much time remains on this \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fourteen minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nremaining be evenly split between the Senator from Wyoming and the \nSenator from Oklahoma and the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I will ask for unanimous consent today \nto call up legislation that I introduced last month and seek debate and \na vote on that bill today.\n  Before I make that request, I wish to make a brief comment about what \nI have seen during this morning's debate.\n  Prior to joining the Senate, I served as a member of the Wyoming \nState senate. I served as the transportation committee chairman. I \nserved on the health committee and the minerals committee.\n  Legislation in the Wyoming legislature needs to be on a single \nsubject. We are prohibited from considering legislation that includes \nmore than one subject. As a result of the procedural requirements \nthere, amendments to bills are narrowly targeted and need to be on the \nsingle issue of that bill. The system works well there and we get our \nwork done.\n  The Senate, of course, works very differently. Comprehensive \nlegislation often contains multiple topics. They are packaged together \nand brought to the floor for a single vote. Under the rules of the \nSenate, Members are allowed, and it is their right, to offer amendments \nto these large bills, such as the ones on the desk today that contain, \nclearly, more than one topic.\n  The process is challenging, but this body has agreed to do it that \nway. Regrettably, the majority party has tried repeatedly to alter that \nprocess and deny Members the right to offer amendments. Whether it is \nfilling the tree, objecting to the consideration of amendments, \nrefusing to bring bills to the floor or filing cloture motions, the \nmajority party has abused its rights and is attempting to muzzle \ndebate.\n  Fortunately, the Senate doesn't give unfettered power to any one \nparty or any one individual. The Senate has learned over history that \nattempting to deny the minority their rights is not democratic and will \nnot be supported by Members.\n  I was sent to be a voice for the people of Wyoming, and I take that \nresponsibility very seriously. I encourage the majority leadership of \nthe Senate to develop a process that allows Members to call up bills, \nhave them debated, amended, and voted on by this body. The Senate would \nbenefit from this and this is exactly what the public expects us to be \ndoing.\n  I now turn to legislation that discourages States from issuing \ndriver's licenses to illegal immigrants. I introduced the bill November \n13, 2007. It is S. 2334. This bill requires States to prove lawful \npresence before granting a driver's license. It requires States to \ncheck the Social Security numbers against the registry before offering \na driver's license. States that do not comply with this would lose 10 \npercent of their Federal transportation funds, and those funds would \nthen not go back to the Federal Government but would be redistributed \nto the other States that are in compliance with the law.\n  This is an issue that is vital to our national security. It is also \nan issue the Senate hasn't yet taken up. I believe issuing driver's \nlicenses to illegal immigrants is an unacceptable and avoidable threat \nto our national security. We have a duty and the time is now to start \nthis discussion.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. 2334, a bill to withhold 10 percent of \nthe Federal funding apportioned for highway construction and \nmaintenance from States that issue driver's licenses to individuals \nwithout verifying the legal status of such individuals.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read the third time and \npassed; that\n\n[[Page S15178]]\n\nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; and that any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, this is a \nvery important issue we need to have a thorough debate on. At this \nmoment, on behalf of the majority leader, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I am disappointed with the objection.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, we are 2 days away from the expiration of \nthe continuing resolution--our second one. We had difficulty as a party \nwhen we were in the majority with getting the bills done on time. It is \ndifficult to move things through this body. That is not necessarily \nalways the majority's fault, but it requires that we work together. One \nway to take the pressure--the crash pressure in coming up against a \npoint where everybody ends up losing is to have an automatic CR so we \ndon't have that problem. There has been a bill offered that says if we \ncannot get our work done, there is an automatic CR, that the Government \ncontinues to run at the rate it was, or at the lower of the Senate- or \nHouse-passed bills. It takes us away from the idea of playing chicken \nand protects the American people and those employed by the Federal \nGovernment. I think it is common sense. It is something we ought to do. \nIt takes the pressure off both sides so we are not running down to the \nend and looking at bills that nobody knows what is in them, thereby \ndoing a grave injustice to the rest of the American people. I think it \nis an idea whose time has come.\n  On the basis of that, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed \nto the immediate consideration of S. 2070, the Government shutdown \nprevention bill. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read the \nthird time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, that tells us something. That tells us we \nare going to get a bill that none of us knows what is in it because we \nare going to run it up against a deadline--the deadline was September \n30, we know that. We need a way to relieve the pressure. This bill \nrelieves it; otherwise, we are going to do a great and harmful \ninjustice to the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, it is obvious by now we are not going to be \nable to conclude some of our business through the process of getting \nconcurrence from the other side. There are two emergency matters that \ndo cry out for treatment quickly and, therefore, I will propound two \nemergency unanimous consent requests.\n  The first has to do with border funding. Twice this year, the Senate \noverwhelmingly--in fact, in 1 day--unanimously approved $3 billion for \nincreased border fencing, 23,000 additional Border Patrol agents, 300 \nmiles of vehicle barriers, 700 linear miles of fencing, 105 ground-\nbased radar and camera towers, 4 unmanned aerial vehicles, and \nincreased the detention capacity to 45,000. Twice that was passed, but \nit is still not law. We are coming up to the end of the year. It has to \nbe done.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. 2348, the Emergency Border Funding Act, \nand I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read the third time and \npassed; that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, as my \nfriend indicated, this has been included in the Department of Defense \nreauthorization and Homeland Security budget. I wonder if my friend \nwould be willing to amend his unanimous consent request to indicate \nthat--because it is included in the conference report we will be \nreceiving shortly--we have unanimous consent to pass the conference \nreport for the Department of Defense authorization when the Senate \nreceives it.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if that is a unanimous consent request, since \nwe obviously have no idea what that conference report is, whether it \nincludes anything else, obviously we cannot do that. If that is a \nunanimous consent request, obviously, we cannot agree and I will \nobject.\n  The question is, Is there objection to the unanimous consent I \npropounded?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Reserving the right to object, because we will shortly \nbe passing this legislation, at this time, I will object to this \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, it is certainly nice to have an assurance \nthat we will soon be passing it, with only a few days remaining in the \nsession. Obviously, we need to pass it. The reason for my request was \nin the event it is not done later. I think we are tempting fate.\n  The other request I will make relates to another emergency matter. \nLast August, in a bipartisan fashion, we filled a very dangerous hole \nin our terrorist surveillance capabilities by passing the Protect \nAmerica Act, which updated our Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act by \ngiving our law enforcement professionals the tools they need to keep up \nwith modern technology to monitor terrorists overseas. That act expires \nin February. We are not here that many days between now and then. \nObviously, the terrorist threat continues; it is not going to expire. \nWe need to permanently extend this critical law enforcement tool to \nmake sure our American telecommunications companies, which bravely \nanswered the call to help their country when asked to do now, do not \nhave to respond to frivolous lawsuits as a result of their patriotism.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in seeing to it that the Protect \nAmerica Act can be passed and made permanent.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of a bill to make permanent the Protect America \nAct, the text of which is at the desk, and that the bill be read the \nthird time and passed and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Reserving the right to object, as our friend indicated, \nwe are working together on that issue in a bipartisan way. It will be \nresolved before February. At this time, on behalf of the majority \nleader, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, again, I appreciate the assurance that this \nwill be done by February 1, when it has to be done, or all of the \nauthority to collect this intelligence expires. It has to be done. I \nthink we are in session maybe 1 or 2 weeks, potentially, when we come \nback before that date. If we don't do it, our country is in grave \njeopardy. I would have thought perhaps a better way to resolve that is \nto do it now so we don't have to wait again until the very last minute \nto accomplish something that is so important for the security of our \ncountry.\n  I yield the remaining time to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. 2318, a bill that provides \npermanent relief from the alternative minimum tax, which extends the \n2001 tax cuts and the 2003 capital gains dividends tax relief, and that \nthe bill be read the third time and passed.\n  I further ask that the bill be held at the desk until the House \ncompanion arrives, and that all after the enacting clause be stricken \nand the text of the Senate-passed bill be inserted, and the House bill, \nas amended, be read the third time and passed.\n\n[[Page S15179]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Reserving the right to object, as my colleague knows, \nwe all agree we need to stop the tax increases on middle America. We \nare committed to that. At this time, on behalf of the majority leader, \nI object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am disappointed, and I think the \nAmerican people are going to be disappointed if we don't deal with the \nalternative minimum tax, which, of course, was targeted at the ``rich'' \nwhen it was passed but which now affects 6 million taxpayers and which, \nif we don't act, will affect 23 million middle-class taxpayers next \nyear.\n  My distinguished colleague didn't mention the capital gains and \ndividends tax relief, which has been so important as a stimulus to the \neconomy, which has resulted in 50 months of uninterrupted job growth \nsince we passed that legislation. I hope we will continue to work on \nthat.\n  Unfortunately, given the compression of time due to the squandering \nof opportunities earlier this year to act on this important \nlegislation, I am afraid we are not going to get it done before we \nbreak for Christmas. The IRS is going to have to send out notices to \nmany new taxpayers of their increased tax bill under this AMT, unless \nwe act promptly.\n  I yield the floor and yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/12/senate-section/article/S15179-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3671\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to speak in support of a \nprovision in the bill that the amendment before us is going to strike, \nthe Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network, which is included in the \nunderlying bill of the Agriculture Committee.\n  This network is a critical service to help American families, \nparticularly rural families. I oppose the amendment offered by the \nsenior Senator from New Hampshire that would strike this measure.\n  Without a doubt, farmers and ranchers face unique challenges in \nproviding food and fuel for this country. Farming is one of the most \nstressful and dangerous occupations in the United States. There are \nenvironmental, cultural, and economic factors that put farmers and \nranchers at a higher risk for mental health problems.\n  Stress in agriculture contributes to rates of depression and suicide \nthat are double the national average. This is true even in good times \nfor farmers. As a farmer myself, this troubles me.\n  It also concerns me when rural residents, especially those involved \nin agriculture, are disproportionately represented among the uninsured \nof the United States. One-third of the agricultural population lacks \nhealth insurance coverage for behavioral health conditions. With the \nrising cost of health care and many farmers and ranchers in business on \ntheir own, the\n\n[[Page S15180]]\n\ncost of health care can be too much to handle.\n  We have a long way to go to make sure there is parity in our health \ncare system. Those suffering from mental health problems do not always \nenjoy the same benefits of treatment because health coverage \ndiscriminates against illness of the mind.\n  On top of the risk and cost to farmers and ranchers, access to \nbehavioral health care is more limited in rural areas. There are fewer \nprofessional providers, and there is a stigma on this type of care, \nespecially among rural Americans. This is why the Farm and Ranch Stress \nAssistance Network is needed. It is included in the farm bill because \nwe need to provide better mental health care for people in rural areas.\n  I will be the first to admit that things are looking good for \nagriculture right now because prices, particularly of grain, are good. \nWe are developing and strengthening our safety net for producers. The \nrenewable energy progress that we have made has helped rural economies. \nBut just because that is a reality today does not mean that it will \ncontinue forever.\n  Our farmers and ranchers will face challenges that are out of their \ncontrol. They will face instances of terrible weather and disaster. \nThey will see droughts and low prices. Good times do not last forever, \nand that is when our farmers and ranchers will need the support that \nthis provision of the bill gives.\n  One of the most challenging factors that we farmers face is not being \nable to predict outcome. We are forced to take risk. We face severe \nconsequences when we are wrong.\n  I remember the agriculture depression of the 1980s and what a toll it \ntook on farmers in my State. I wondered if things would be different if \nthe Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network had existed prior to the \nbeginning of that depression.\n  This network may support a crisis telephone hotline that farmers can \naccess. Our rural residents and family farmers should have access to \nconfidential and highly trained professionals during these tough times. \nThe network could provide counseling services while working with \nextension offices to reach farmers.\n  Finally, the Senator sponsoring the amendment should be aware that \nthis network is simply authorized in the underlying bill. We are not \nadding mandatory money for the program. We are simply providing \nauthority to develop this network with dollars that may be appropriated \nlater on.\n  So this amendment will not save money. Rather, what the amendment \nwill do is do away with much needed support for those who work hard \nevery day to put food on our plates, fiber for our clothing, and fuel \nfor our economy.\n  So let's not eliminate this essential program without taking into \naccount the bad years that could lie ahead. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I have yielded back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 minutes to \nrespond to the Senator from Iowa who referred to me in his comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I find it extremely unique that the Senator \nfrom Iowa would take the position that he needs a program to be \nauthorized but that we should not vote against it on the basis of it \nspending money because he doesn't ever expect to fund it. That, on the \nface of it, does not pass the laugh test. If you are authorizing a \nprogram, creating a program, you expect at some point to fund the \nprogram and spend money on the program. That is a totally disingenuous \nargument, in my humble opinion, to make that representation.\n  I suggest if the Senator from Iowa believes the stress program is an \nimportant program, that is fine. We will have a vote. I happen to think \nthe stress program is a reflection of a farm bill that has gone wild in \nthe area of spending money--American taxpayers' money. The American \ntaxpayers are the ones who are going to be under stress.\n  There are a lot of industries in this country that have stress. The \nAmerican farmer today is doing pretty well, as was acknowledged by the \nSenator from Iowa. In fact, they had a 44-percent increase in farm \nincome just this last year. That is pretty good.\n  Stress may be there. I do not deny that farming is an intense and \ndifficult process. I used to work on a farm. There can be a lot of \nstress in farming. But I don't think we need to set up a special \nprogram with the Federal Government to create a network and a concept \nfor stress, and then we will authorize it, and then we will fund it. \nThis authorization is open ended, which means any amount of money can \nbe put in this bill in later years to fund it.\n  There are a lot of industries which have stress. We do not create a \nstress program for the capital markets industry which today is \nsuffering from a meltdown. Are we going to have a stress program for \nBear Stearns? We don't create a stress program for all the companies in \nthis country that have basically been under stress by foreign \ncompetition. Do we have a stress program for those? Do we have a stress \nprogram for the person who runs the local restaurant? Do we have a \nstress program for the person who runs a local gas station? All of \nthese are entrepreneurial undertakings, and entrepreneurship involves \nstress, but we don't need to create a stress network to address it.\n  This is a creation of an earmark, pure and simple, in a bill filled \nwith earmarks. And it seems to me, adding a new program--remember, \nthere are 51 new discretionary programs put into this bill--51, and \nthis is just 1 of them.\n  I recognize the Senator from Iowa is totally committed to the \nfarmers, and there is probably nobody in this Congress who has done \nmore for the farm community than the Senator from Iowa--both Senators \nfrom Iowa, but certainly the Republican Senator from Iowa has done an \nimmense amount.\n  This is a bridge too far; this is a farm tractor too far. The simple \nfact is, we do not need a stress program for farmers, and we do not \nneed an authorization which is open ended and which will be funded. \nThere is no question, you do not put an authorization in unless it gets \nfunded.\n  I have serious reservations about this from, first, the concept of \ncreating the program and, second, the concept of funding the program. I \nhave expressed my reservation. I offered an amendment. We will vote on \nit. I presume we will lose because we always lose these votes. But as a \npractical matter, the American people should know this program, in my \nhumble opinion, is not of value and is inappropriate in this context.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to talk about \ntwo amendments to the farm bill proposed by the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  These amendments would have devastating impacts on farmers in my home \nState of Washington, and I urge my colleagues to oppose both of them.\n  The first would strike the badly needed agriculture disaster \nassistance trust fund and direct the money to other sources.\n  Under my colleague's amendment, most of that money would go to reduce \nthe deficit, and some would help low-income residents with their \nheating bills.\n  The second would strike the Market Loss Assistance Program for \nasparagus growers.\n  Our farmers are the backbone of our Nation. But farming is a \ndifficult business.\n  One bad storm can wipe out a whole crop or a whole herd--and take \nyour livelihood with it.\n  That is the position that some of the farmers in my home State are in \nnow. And that is why it is so important that we have a safety net ready \nto help them.\n  Last week, I spoke on the Senate floor about the storms that had \ndevastated western Washington.\n  Winds and dangerous floods and mudslides washed out roads and homes \nand cut off power to thousands.\n  Thousands of people are still coping with the damage, and our \nagriculture producers in southwest Washington were hit especially hard.\n  We won't know the full impact of this storm for some time.\n\n[[Page S15181]]\n\n  But we are already starting to hear reports about lost livestock, \npoultry, farm buildings, and equipment.\n  Some reports say that producers lost thousands of animals--and that \nnumber may still grow.\n  The agriculture disaster trust fund in this farm bill ensures that we \nhave a permanent pool of money to help farmers after natural disasters, \nsuch as the storms in Washington State.\n  I appreciate the work of the Finance and Agriculture Committees to \nadd this important program. And I want to thank Senators Harkin and \nChambliss for their leadership on this bill.\n  I wish this program were already in place.\n  If it were, farmers in Lewis and Grays Harbor--two of the counties \nhit hardest by the flooding--would be able to apply for Federal aid to \nrebuild their herds.\n  For example, the Livestock Compensation Program in the trust fund \nwould pay 75 percent of the value of the dead animal.\n  Without a permanent disaster assistance program, we are left to \nprovide this kind of help on an ad hoc basis. A trust fund would ensure \nthat money is always there when it is needed.\n  Our farmers shouldn't have to depend on political whim when disaster \nstrikes.\n  And that is why the amendment to strike this fund would be such a bad \nidea.\n  Now I strongly support the LIHEAP program. I think it is critical, \nespecially as we head into the winter months. But I think we can find a \nbetter solution that doesn't eliminate this trust fund.\n  And so I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment by Senator \nGregg.\n  Secondly, I would like to take a few minutes to talk about the \namendment to strike the market loss help for asparagus growers, another \nprogram that is vital in my home State.\n  Historically, asparagus has been a major crop for Washington State \nfarmers. In fact, it was the first crop harvested in Washington.\n  But our asparagus farmers are hurting now because of competition from \ngrowers in Peru.\n  The Andean Trade Preference Act has allowed Peruvian asparagus to \nflood the market.\n  And unlike most free-trade agreements, the act went into effect \nwithout a transition period to allow U.S. producers to prepare or \nadapt.\n  Over the Thanksgiving recess, I visited with a number of farmers in \nYakima, WA, who told me about the devastating impact this trade \nagreement has had.\n  The numbers speak for themselves.\n  In 1990, the value of the crop was approximately $200 million. Its \nvalue now is down to $75 million.\n  Before the act, more than 55 million pounds of asparagus were canned \nin Washington State--roughly two-thirds of the industry. But by 2007, \nall three asparagus canners in Washington had relocated to Peru.\n  I have fought to help our U.S. growers. I have tried to get them \ntrade adjustment assistance and other help.\n  And over the past several years, I have secured funding for research \non a mechanical harvester to make this labor-intensive crop less \nexpensive to produce.\n  And most recently, I worked with my colleagues from Michigan and \nWashington to include the market loss program for asparagus growers in \nthis farm bill.\n  I appreciate the leadership of Senators Harkin and Chambliss on this \nissue as well.\n  This program would provide up to $15 million nationwide to help U.S. \nfarmers who still grow asparagus despite foreign competition.\n  I hope this program will help growers in my State continue to invest \nin asparagus.\n  We modeled this after a similar program for apples and onions, which \nI helped add to the 2002 farm bill.\n  I remember hearing from apple growers about the effects of Chinese \nimports on our markets.\n  That program provided over $94 million for our Nation's apple \ngrowers, and it has proven to be a big help to our apple industry.\n  I would note to my colleague from New Hampshire that his State \nreceived over $1 million from the apple program.\n  Striking the market loss program from the farm bill would be a step \nin the wrong direction for our asparagus industry.\n  And it would have serious impacts on farmers in my home State.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment as well.\n  ``No'' votes on both of these amendments will support the struggling \nasparagus industry.\n  And they will help our farmers and ranchers when disaster strikes.\n  These programs are too important to our farmers to be cut.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Gregg amendment \nNo. 3672.\n  This amendment irresponsibly strips $15 million in funding for an \nasparagus market loss program to help asparagus producers who have lost \na significant amount of their market share because of the Andean Trade \nPreference Act.\n  Thanks to the great work of Senator Stabenow, along with Senators \nHarkin and Chambliss, the Senate Ag Committee approved this important \nfunding to help assist asparagus producers in California, Michigan, and \nWashington who have lost significant market share as a result of the \nAndean Trade Preference Act.\n  The U.S. asparagus industry was and continues to be hurt by the \nAndean Trade Preference Act's, ATPA, extended duty-free status to \nimports of fresh Peruvian asparagus. The ATPA eliminated U.S. tariffs \non Peruvian asparagus imports beginning in 1990.\n  Unlike most free-trade agreements, the ATPA provided no transition \nperiod to allow domestic asparagus producers to prepare or adapt to a \nmarket that would be flooded with an unlimited quantity of zero tariff \nasparagus from Peru.\n  Following the enactment of ATPA, imports of processed asparagus \nproducts surged 2400 percent from 500,000 pounds in 1990 to over 12 \nmillion pounds in 2006.\n  As a result, domestic asparagus acreage has dropped 54 percent from \n90,000 acres in 1991 to under 49,000 acres today.\n  Michigan has lost 20 percent of its asparagus acreage.\n  Washington State's asparagus acreage decreased from 31,000 acres in \n1991 to 9,300 acres in 2006, and producers in the State have seen the \nvalue of their crop drop from $200 million in 1990 to $75 million \ntoday.\n  And farmers in my State of California have lost nearly half of their \nasparagus acreage since 1990, dropping from 36,000 acres before the \nATPA, to 22,500 acres today.\n  Many of my colleagues may be asking what the market loss program will \nprovide to asparagus producers. This asparagus program is modeled after \na 2002 program for onion and apple producers that provided $94 million \nin assistance when the apple and onion markets were flooded with cheap \nChinese imports.\n  Market loss funds will be used to offset costs to domestic asparagus \nproducers to plant new acreage and invest in more efficient planting \nand harvesting equipment.\n  I find it particularly interesting that Senator Gregg has put forward \nan antimarket loss program amendment that would help farmers in my \nState. As a result of the 2002 farm bill, apple producers in his State \nof New Hampshire received more than $1 million in assistance.\n  Where was Senator Gregg and his amendment to strike when the Senate \napproved a market loss program for apple and onion producers as part of \nthe 2002 farm bill?\n  I urge the Senate to reject this amendment.\n  The amount in funding for the market loss program is a small \npercentage of the losses incurred as a result of the ATPA and will go a \nlong way toward maintaining domestic asparagus production and helping \nour producers who have lost thousands of acres.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on amendment No. \n3671, offered by the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, that is the stress program; correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. I think we just had our 2 minutes of debate. I suggest \nboth sides yield back time and go to a vote.\n\n[[Page S15182]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. GREGG.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to the vote on amendment No. \n3672, offered by the Senator from New Hampshire. The Senator from \nMichigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank Senator Harkin and Senator \nChambliss and all those involved in putting together the bipartisan \nfarm bill. I ask for a ``no'' vote on the Gregg amendment. This would \neliminate $15 million, a small amount in the farm bill but incredibly \nimportant to asparagus growers across the country. This would eliminate \nthe Asparagus Market Loss Program that would compensate American \nasparagus growers across the country for losses to their industry as a \nresult of the Andean Trade Preferences Act that was passed back in \n1990. Since that time, we have seen no transition period and imports of \ntariff-free processed asparagus have surged 2,400 percent. We have seen \nmajor losses for asparagus growers, and I add this was based on a \nprogram passed in the last farm bill for apples and onions, where cheap \nChinese imports were harming domestic growers and, in fact, the State \nof the author of the amendment received over $1 million in that program \nfor apples. We are simply asking that asparagus growers receive the \nsame kind of assistance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this is a new program. It is a new \nmandatory program. It is $15 million. It is not a lot of money but I \nthink it would be nice if the Senate would make a statement once in a \nwhile it is going to be fiscally responsible.\n  This asparagus program is not needed. It is the result of a 1990s \ntrade agreement, the claim is made, but that is 20 years ago almost \nthat agreement was reached. What has happened is the American consumer \nhas benefited from that agreement and now, because the American \nconsumer has benefited from the agreement, we basically want to raise \ntaxes on the American consumer to make them pay because they didn't pay \nat the shop when they bought the asparagus.\n  It makes no sense at all. This is a brand-new $15 million program in \nthis bill for asparagus. The bill is replete with these types of \nprograms. I think we ought to make a statement, at least for once, that \nwe are going to be fiscally responsible. I hope people will vote for \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, in consultation with the ranking member, \nSenator Chambliss, I am going to repeat for the benefit of Senators a \nunanimous consent that was entered into last night and try to clarify \nit a little bit. There was one small change, and that was to add \nSenator Sanders into this debate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following disposition of \nthe Gregg amendment, which we just did, that Senator Harkin be \nrecognized to call up an amendment, and once reported by number, the \namendment be set aside; that Senators Alexander, Bingaman, Salazar, and \nSanders be recognized, 10 minutes for Senator Bingaman, 10 minutes for \nSenator Salazar, 10 minutes for Senator Sanders, and 30 minutes for \nSenator Alexander; that the Senate then debate the following amendments \nfor the time\n\n[[Page S15183]]\n\nlimits specified under a previous order and in the order that is \nlisted.\n  First, it would be the Alexander amendments 3551 and 3553, 60 minutes \nequally divided; the Gregg amendment No. 3673, 2 hours equally divided; \nDorgan-Grassley amendment No. 3695, 2 hours equally divided; Sessions \namendment No. 3596, 40 minutes equally divided; Klobuchar amendment No. \n3810, 60 minutes equally divided; Coburn amendments 3807, 3530, and \n3632, 90 minutes equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, under the previous unanimous consent \nagreement, I ask that the amendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Tuesday, November 13, \n2007, under ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. HARKIN. Now we can go to the Alexander amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                      Amendment Nos. 3551 and 3553\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I have up to 30 minutes to describe these two \namendments, and then other Senators have time, I assume, to oppose the \namendments. What I will do is--\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Will the Senator from Tennessee yield for a question?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Yes.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I had understood that the order we were \nfollowing would be to consider Alexander amendment 3553 with 10 minutes \nof debate time. If I can get 10 minutes before turning to the other \namendments. That is how I had come here to the floor to deal with the \nissue of 3553.\n  Parliamentary inquiry: What is the order of continuing on 3553?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The understanding of the Chair on the order is \nthat there is an hour equally divided, of which 10 minutes is provided \nfor the Senator from Colorado, but no speaking order has been assigned.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, if I could ask my friend from Tennessee \nto note the absence of a quorum for a minute so we might talk about how \nwe might move forward.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues from Colorado and \nVermont.\n  I say to the Senator from Iowa, what I will do is I will use a few \nminutes, maybe 5 or 10, summarizing the two amendments I have offered \nwhich I talked some about yesterday. Then I will yield the floor and \nsit down and allow the Senator from Colorado and the Senator from \nVermont to use their 10 minutes each. Then Senator Harkin may want to \nuse his 10 minutes. Then I will come back at the end. I probably will \nnot use all of my time.\n  Mr. President, I offer two amendments. They are at the desk. The \nfirst one has to do with land grant university research funding, to try \nto get back on track a terrific program the Congress passed in 1998 to \nproperly fund value-added research for our land grant universities \nacross this country. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2 is to amend the amendment of the Senator from Colorado, which \nis a part of the bill, so that we would limit 100 kilowatt wind towers \nto farm areas and not residential areas. Those are the two amendments.\n  I wish to begin by summarizing the land grant university research \namendment. What amendment 3551 does is it adds $74 million over the \nlast 3 years of the farm bill for agricultural research at land grant \ncolleges.\n  In my opinion, having been president of a land grant university, the \nUniversity of Tennessee, I believe our land grant colleges and \nuniversities are our secret weapon in value-added products; in other \nwords, taking soybeans and turning them into milk and creating higher \nincomes for farmers and more jobs in the United States.\n  Let me take an example, one which I used yesterday. Those who live in \nthe Southwest, which I do not, are apparently very familiar with the \nguayule plant. I might call it a weed. That might not be a friendly \ndesignation, but it looks like a weed to me. The University of Arizona \ndiscovered--one of our land grant universities, as a part of the \nprogram I am seeking to get back on track--that it could use this plant \nto develop nonallergic latex to go into rubber gloves. Why is that \nimportant? Because according to OSHA, allergic reactions from latex \nrubber affect 10 percent of the Nation's health care workforce. So we \nhave not only helped health care through the land grant universities, \nwe have helped create incomes in the Southwest where this is grown. We \nhave helped grow jobs in the United States as well.\n  There are examples of that all through our country. That is why the \nCongress, in 1998, created a program which is called the Future \nAgriculture and Food Systems Program. That very simply did, through the \nDepartment of Agriculture, which we do through many other parts of \ngovernment, grants of research offered to land grant universities in a \ncompetitive way, not just doled out, not just pork, in a competitive \nway to try to help them create value-added products.\n  The program has worked for a couple of years since 1998. It didn't \nwork so well in other years. I summarized that yesterday. The bottom \nline is, both appropriators and authorizers during this time got away \nfrom the idea of competitive, peer-reviewed grants and began to earmark \nand designate their favorite universities for some of the money. Then \non another occasion in 2005, the Congress, looking for a way to bring \nthe budget under control, saw this as a pot of money that could be used \nand took the money from agricultural research and used it to do a \nbetter job of balancing the budget.\n  There was a 2-year period, in 2001 and 2002, when under this program \nthere were 183 grants to 71 of the 76 land grant universities, one in \nevery State. Out of that came this research and a variety of other \nproducts.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to get this program back on track. \nIt was first authorized in 1998, had a couple of problems, but here is \nwhat my amendment would do. My amendment would add $74 million in the \nlast 3 years of the farm bill. The House, in its version of the farm \nbill, has added $600 million in those 3 years. So the conferees could \nlook at those two amounts of money and come to a reasonable adjustment \nand get the program back on track, competitively awarded grants for \nland grant colleges and universities, our secret weapon in raising farm \nincomes.\n  How do we pay for it? The $47 million in funding over the last 3 \nyears of the farm bill is fully offset by striking section 302 from the \ntax title. I described that yesterday. I will be glad to describe it \nagain, if I need to. But it is fully funded.\n  Let me go to my second amendment, No. 3553. It affects the so-called \nsmall wind tax credit. The small wind tax credit in the bill allows up \nto $4,000 for someone to put a 100-kilowatt wind turbine in either a \nfarm or rural area or residential area. Since this is a farm bill and \nnot a residential bill, what my amendment would do is limit the ability \nof this subsidy to go to wind turbines to farms and rural businesses as \ndefined in the Internal Revenue Code. If I could put it in plain \nEnglish: It will be very difficult for Members of the Senate to go home \nand explain to their neighbors, whether they are in Tennessee or \nColorado or Mississippi, why they passed a law saying we are going to \ntake some of your tax money and give it to your neighbor so he or she \ncan put up a 12-story tower in his or her front yard next to you. I \ndon't think that is an appropriate use of our tax money. I don't \nbelieve it is a wise way to create electricity. It doesn't show the \nkind of common sense we need to show in creating clean energy.\n  The example I used yesterday, and which I could go into more detail \nlater, is the $5 million tax credit in this bill\n\n[[Page S15184]]\n\nfor these kinds of towers would create only about 12 megawatts of \nelectricity. That is a pretty puny amount of electricity. Common sense \nsuggests it would be much wiser to use the $5 million to buy $2 energy-\nefficient light bulbs and give them to people in residential areas. \nThat would save 8 times as much energy as these turbines would produce.\n  There are other reasons the turbines are not necessary. One is that \nthe wind industry is heavily subsidized already. For example, wind \nenergy will receive $11.5 billion over the next 10 years from the \nproduction tax credit. By fiscal year 2009, the Federal tax subsidy for \nwind energy will be the largest subsidy for energy which is an \nastonishing figure when you take into account that wind provides \nless than 1 percent of the electricity we use. According to the Energy \nInformation Administration, in the year 2020, it will provide not much \nmore than that. Here we have billions and billions already going to \nsubsidize wind power. That amount is half as much as all of the \nsubsidies for oil and gas, and it is totally disproportionate to the \nvalue of the energy we get.\n\n  I stand as a Senator who is very concerned about clean air and \nclimate change. Since I arrived in 2003, I have had in place--first \nwith Senator Carper, then with Senator Lieberman--a climate change/\nclean air bill that would put caps on utilities which produce one-third \nof the carbon in the United States. That bill also included stricter \nstandards than now exist in law on mercury, on sulfur, and on nitrogen. \nI was the sponsor in the last Congress of the solar tax credit which I \nbelieve is important. In the hearing the other day we had on climate \nchange, I proposed and the committee adopted, a low-carbon fuel \nstandard. I voted for, and hope to be able to vote for again in final \npassage of the Energy bill, the fuel efficiency standards which were in \nthe Senate-passed Energy bill.\n  The Oak Ridge National Laboratory has testified that is the single \nmost important thing we can do to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. \nBut I believe we should use common sense. I don't believe using tax \ndollars to give your neighbor up to $4,000 so he or she can create up \nto a 12-story tower in a residential neighborhood makes much common \nsense. My appeal is as much to common sense as anything else.\n  My hope is the Senate would agree that it will be fine if we want to \nsubsidize the building of even such large wind turbines in rural areas, \nbut it is not all right to subsidize the building of those wind \nturbines in residential areas. My amendment would also make clear that \nnothing we did in this bill overrode local zoning ordinances that \npeople use to decide what sort of towers they want to permit.\n  That concludes my remarks. I will listen to my colleagues from \nVermont and Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise to speak against the Alexander \namendment No. 3553. I do so with some regret because he and I have \nworked on so many matters together in a bipartisan spirit. But on this \nparticular amendment, he is simply wrong for two reasons. First and \nforemost, the amendment would strike a blow against what we are trying \nto do to create a new clean energy future by crippling our attempts to \nmove forward with a new agenda on wind power.\n  Second, it would bring the Congress into an intruding position on \nmatters that ought to be about land use at the local and State level, \nin the traditions of this country. So for those two reasons, I am going \nto ask my colleagues to join in opposition to the amendment.\n  The small wind power microturbine tax credit we are proposing as part \nof the farm bill brought forward in a bipartisan way from the Finance \nCommittee is a provision that enjoys tremendous bipartisan support. On \nthe Republican side, Senators Smith, Craig, Murkowski, and Coleman have \nall been champions of the small wind energy tax credit; on the \nDemocratic side, Senator Sanders, Dorgan, Feinstein, Kerry, Wyden, \nStabenow, and Johnson have all been supporters and cosponsors of the \nunderlying legislation, S. 673. That group of Senators shows the kind \nof bipartisan support we have for small wind power in America.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a letter sent to \nSenator Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley from a number of \norganizations, including the Tennessee Environmental Council, in \nsupport of this tax provision.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 November 8, 2007.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Finance, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Finance, Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley: As \n     leading farm and rural economic development organizations, we \n     strongly support a federal investment tax incentive for small \n     wind systems. Small wind systems offer farmers and rural \n     Americans the ability to generate their own clean, fuel-free, \n     and reliable power for on-site use and provide independence \n     from unpredictable fossil fuel prices. We congratulate and \n     support the Senate Finance Committee on recently including an \n     incentive for small wind systems in the tax title of the 2007 \n     Farm Bill.\n       There is currently no federal support for small wind \n     systems. However, solar photovoltaics, which compete in the \n     same market as small wind, receive a 30% investment tax \n     credit under current law. The Finance Committee Chairman's \n     Mark would provide for a 30% investment tax credit capped at \n     $4,000 per system to help provide on-site power for homes, \n     farms, and small businesses. Small wind systems are growing \n     in popularity as the cost of energy and concerns about global \n     warming continue to rise, but the high up-front cost of a \n     system is often prohibitive to consumers. An investment tax \n     credit would greatly help those who depend on small wind \n     systems for personal energy independence.\n       The provision included in the Senate Finance Committee \n     Chairman's Mark would cost only $5 million over 10 years, but \n     could spur 40% annual growth in the industry. Moreover, small \n     wind is an American-dominated industry--98% of the small wind \n     turbines sold in America last year were built by American \n     companies. That means that the jobs and economic growth \n     created by an investment tax credit will be overwhelmingly \n     American.\n       We look forward to supporting your efforts to help farmers \n     and rural Americans achieve personal energy independence. \n     Thank you for your continued support.\n           Sincerely,\n       National Farmers Union.\n       American Corn Growers Association.\n       Nebraska Farmers Union.\n       Tennessee Environmental Council.\n       Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.\n       American Agriculture Movement.\n       Rocky Mountain Farmers Union.\n       Environmental Law & Policy Center.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. The Alexander amendment, the way it would strike out the \nsmall wind tax credit provision of this legislation, would cripple the \nwind power potential for our country in a way that is not healthy as we \nembrace this agenda. We are dealing with technology that has been \naround for a long time. Certainly, as we are moving forward with the \nhope and vision that 25 percent of our energy from this country comes \nfrom renewable energy resources, we know there are many components of \nthat portfolio. One of them is wind. Tremendous wind power is being \ndeveloped around our country, and I will speak about that. But we know \nwe can do much more with small wind microturbines. Here is what they \nwould look like on a farm.\n  This is a picture of a farm that shows an old-style windmill, \nwindmills such as we have seen out on the plains and the prairies for \ngenerations. It used to be for many years the only way we could \ngenerate power to pump water for cattle out on the range. These \nwindmills were converted over to become electrical generators. Now with \nthe new technology being developed at the National Renewable Energy \nLaboratory through their wind technology center, we have developed new \nwind microturbines that can produce a good amount of energy with very \nsmall turbines in place. This picture shows some of those wind turbines \nin operation.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Tennessee would essentially say we \nare going to limit where we can allow these small wind microturbines to \ngo up. For example, if you happen to have a rural residence such as \nthis residence, which is typical of many places throughout the West, \nthis residence which could power its domestic electrical needs off of a \nwind turbine in the way this house does would not be allowed to do \nso. The $4,000 tax credit would not be allowed to provide the\n\n[[Page S15185]]\n\nelectrical generation needs we want to accomplish for that house.\n\n  Another example is this rural residence which is out on a hillside. \nThe rural residents of this house, out on a hillside, would not be able \nto take advantage of the tax credit we are providing in this \nlegislation.\n  It goes beyond just rural residences out there in the country. In \naddition to that, when we think about industrial or business places of \nuse, this shown in this picture is an example of a Wal-Mart, which is \nlocated outside of Denver, CO, in Aurora, CO, where Wal-Mart has \nembraced using renewable energy to power much of its facility. One of \nthe sources for that wind power for this Wal-Mart in Aurora, CO, is a \nwind turbine, a small wind microturbine.\n  Our legislation would provide the tax credit to allow this kind of a \nwind microturbine to be incentivized to go into that place. So what my \nfriend attempts to do here, in my view, would unnecessarily narrow what \nwe are trying to do, which is to expand the places where we can use \nwind power in the form of small wind-power turbines throughout the \nUnited States. So I hope on that basis alone my friends in the Senate \nwill vote in opposition to his amendment.\n  Second, what we are trying to do here is incentivize the creation of \nsmall wind-power turbines for the people and for the businesses of this \ncountry. The amendment which my friend has proposed in part is based on \nhis concern that he does not want to see a lot of wind turbines in \nurban or suburban areas. He does not want us to go back to places such \nas Knoxville or Oak Ridge, TN, and go to those communities and say we \nsomehow are enabling those wind-power turbines, those small \nmicroturbines, to go up in those communities. That has never been a \nprovince of the Senate. The province of the Senate has been to set out \nnational policy. It is up to those local communities and cities and \ncounties and States to determine what their local land use policy is \ngoing to be. Nothing we do in the Senate ultimately is going to disrupt \nor interrupt whatever they may be doing at the local level in terms of \ntheir local land use ordinances.\n  We have seen, most recently with respect to what has happened with \nthe South phone tower dispersion, is that throughout the country it is \nstill very much controlled by what happens at the local land use level. \nI urge my friends to vote in opposition to Alexander amendment No. \n3553.\n  I would finally say, on the whole concept of wind, on which we have a \ngenuine policy disagreement, there is indeed tremendous opportunity for \nus to do much more with wind. In my State alone, 2 years ago, before we \npassed the 2005 Energy Policy Act, there was almost zero electricity \nbeing generated from wind power. Today, my State is on the verge of \nproducing 1,000 megawatts of power from our wind-power facilities that \nhave been constructed throughout the State. Now, 1,000 megawatts of \npower may not seem like a lot to a lot of people, but I think it is a \nlot. It is a lot for the State of Colorado. Mr. President, 1,000 \nmegawatts of power is the equivalent of the amount of electrical power \nthat will be generated from three coal-fired powerplants--that is three \ncoal-fired powerplants. We are able to do that with our large wind-\npower generators in my State.\n  We ought to be able to deploy the technology we have for small \nmicroturbines to allow people who want these small microturbines to \ngenerate the renewable electricity for their places of business.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on Alexander amendment No. 3553.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me begin by concurring with much of \nwhat Senator Salazar has said. I have a lot of respect for Senator \nAlexander. I have worked with him on some issues, and I look forward to \nworking with him on other issues. But, unfortunately, on this one he is \ndead wrong, and the amendments on wind energy he has brought forth \nshould be soundly defeated in a tripartisan vote.\n  Let me begin by quoting from an AP article that appeared on the front \npage of Vermont's largest newspaper, the Burlington Free Press, this \nmorning and in papers throughout the country. Here is what the article \nsays: ``Ominous Arctic melt worries experts.''\n\n       An already relentless melting of the Arctic greatly \n     accelerated this summer, a warning sign that some scientists \n     worry could mean global warming has passed an ominous tipping \n     point. One even speculated that summer sea ice would be gone \n     in five years.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Ominous Arctic Melt Worries Experts\n\n                          (By Seth Borenstein)\n\n       An already relentless melting of the Arctic greatly \n     accelerated this summer, a warning sign that some scientists \n     worry could mean global warming has passed an ominous tipping \n     point. One even speculated that summer sea ice would be gone \n     in five years.\n       Greenland's ice sheet melted nearly 19 billion tons more \n     than the previous high mark, and the volume of Arctic sea ice \n     at summer's end was half what it was just four years earlier, \n     according to new NASA satellite data obtained by The \n     Associated Press.\n       ``The Arctic is screaming,'' said Mark Serreze, senior \n     scientist at the government's snow and ice data center in \n     Boulder, Colo.\n       Just last year, two top scientists surprised their \n     colleagues by projecting that the Arctic sea ice was melting \n     so rapidly that it could disappear entirely by the summer of \n     2040.\n       This week, after reviewing his own new data, NASA climate \n     scientist Jay Zwally said: ``At this rate, the Arctic Ocean \n     cold be nearly ice-free at the end of summer by 2012, much \n     faster than previous predictions.''\n       So scientists in recent days have been asking themselves \n     these questions: Was the record melt seen all over the Arctic \n     in 2007 a blip amid relentless and steady warming? Or has \n     everything sped up to a new climate cycle that goes beyond \n     the worst case scenarios presented by computer models?\n       ``The Arctic is often cited as the canary in the coal mine \n     for climate warming,'' said Zwally, who as a teenager hauled \n     coal. ``Now as a sign of climate warming, the canary has \n     died. It is time to start getting out of the coal mines.''\n       It is the burning of coal, oil and other fossil fuels that \n     produces carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, \n     responsible for man-made global warming. For the past several \n     days, government diplomats have been debating in Bali, \n     Indonesia, the outlines of a new climate treaty calling for \n     tougher limits on these gases.\n       What happens in the Arctic has implications for the rest of \n     the world. Faster melting there means eventual sea level rise \n     and more immediate changes in winter weather because of less \n     sea ice.\n       In the United States, a weakened Arctic blast moving south \n     to collide with moist air from the Gulf of Mexico can mean \n     less rain and snow in some areas, including the drought-\n     stricken Southeast, said Michael MacCracken, a former federal \n     climate scientist who now heads the nonprofit Climate \n     Institute. Some regions, like Colorado, would likely get \n     extra rain or snow.\n       More than 18 scientists told the AP that they were \n     surprised by the level of ice melt this year.\n       ``I don't pay much attention to one year... but this year \n     the change is so big, particularly in the Arctic sea ice, \n     that you've got to stop and say, `What is going on here?' You \n     can't look away from what's happening here,'' said Waleed \n     Abdalati, NASA's chief of cyrospheric sciences. ``This is \n     going to be a watershed year.''\n       2007 shattered records for Arctic melt in the following \n     ways:\n       552 billion tons of ice melted this summer from the \n     Greenland ice sheet, according to preliminary satellite data \n     to be released by NASA Wednesday. That's 15 percent more than \n     the annual average summer melt, beating 2005's record.\n       A record amount of surface ice was lost over Greenland this \n     year, 12 percent more than the previous worst year, 2005, \n     according to data the University of Colorado released Monday. \n     That's nearly quadruple the amount that melted just 15 years \n     ago. It's an amount of water that could cover Washington, \n     D.C., a half-mile deep, researchers calculated.\n       The surface area of summer sea ice floating in the Arctic \n     Ocean this summer was nearly 23 percent below the previous \n     record. The dwindling sea ice already has affected wildlife, \n     with 6,000 walruses coming ashore in northwest Alaska in \n     October for the first time in recorded history. Another \n     first: the Northwest Passage was open to navigation.\n       Still to be released is NASA data showing the remaining \n     Arctic sea ice to be unusually thin, another record. That \n     makes it more likely to melt in future summers. Combining the \n     shrinking area covered by sea ice with the new thinness of \n     the remaining ice, scientists calculate that the overall \n     volume of ice is half of 2004's total.\n       Alaska's frozen permafrost is warming, not quite thawing \n     yet. But temperature measurements 66 feet deep in the frozen \n     soil rose nearly four-tenths of a degree from 2006 to 2007, \n     according to measurements from the University of Alaska. \n     While that may not sound like much, ``it's very \n     significant,'' said University of Alaska professor Vladimir \n     Romanovsky.\n\n[[Page S15186]]\n\n       Surface temperatures in the Arctic Ocean this summer were \n     the highest in 77 years of record-keeping, with some places 8 \n     degrees Fahrenheit above normal, according to research to be \n     released Wednesday by University of Washington's Michael \n     Steele.\n       Greenland, in particular, is a significant bellwether. Most \n     of its surface is covered by ice. If it completely melted--\n     something key scientists think would likely take centuries, \n     not decades--it could add more than 22 feet to the world's \n     sea level.\n       However, for nearly the past 30 years, the data pattern of \n     its ice sheet melt has zigzagged. A bad year, like 2005, \n     would be followed by a couple of lesser years.\n       According to that pattern, 2007 shouldn't have been a major \n     melt year, but it was, said Konrad Steffen, of the University \n     of Colorado, which gathered the latest data.\n       ``I'm quite concerned,'' he said. ``Now I look at 2008. \n     Will it be even warmer than the past year?''\n       Other new data, from a NASA satellite, measures ice volume. \n     NASA geophysicist Scott Luthcke, reviewing it and other \n     Greenland numbers, concluded: ``We are quite likely entering \n     a new regime.''\n       Melting of sea ice and Greenland's ice sheets also alarms \n     scientists because they become part of a troubling spiral.\n       White sea ice reflects about 80 percent of the sun's heat \n     off Earth, NASA's Zwally said. When there is no sea ice, \n     about 90 percent of the heat goes into the ocean which then \n     warms everything else up. Warmer oceans then lead to more \n     melting.\n       ``That feedback is the key to why the models predict that \n     the Arctic warming is going to be faster,'' Zwally said. \n     ``It's getting even worse than the models predicted.''\n       NASA scientist James Hansen, the lone-wolf researcher often \n     called the godfather of global warming, on Thursday was to \n     tell scientists and others at the American Geophysical Union \n     scientific in San Francisco that in some ways Earth has hit \n     one of his so-called tipping points, based on Greenland melt \n     data.\n       ``We have passed that and some other tipping points in the \n     way that I will define them,'' Hansen said in an e-mail. ``We \n     have not passed a point of no return. We can still roll \n     things back in time--but it is going to require a quick turn \n     in direction.''\n       Last year, Cecilia Bitz at the University of Washington and \n     Marika Holland at the National Center for Atmospheric \n     Research in Colorado startled their colleagues when they \n     predicted an Arctic free of sea ice in just a few decades. \n     Both say they are surprised by the dramatic melt of 2007.\n       Bitz, unlike others at NASA, believes that ``next year \n     we'll be back to normal, but we'll be seeing big anomalies \n     again, occurring more frequently in the future.'' And that \n     normal, she said, is still a ``relentless decline'' in ice.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. In other words, what the scientists are telling us is \nthe problem of global warming may be even more severe than they had \npreviously told us. It seems to me what we should be doing in the \nSenate is become more aggressive, more bold in combating greenhouse gas \nemissions and not support amendments that slow down the growth of such \nsustainable energies as wind. That is what, unfortunately, the \nAlexander amendment would do.\n  In contrast to the direction Senator Alexander wants us to go, let me \nquote from a BBC article that appeared the other day. This is what that \narticle says:\n  Wind ``could power all UK homes.'' All UK homes could be powered by \noffshore wind farms by 2020 as part of the fight against climate \nchange, under plans unveiled.''\n  What they are doing in the UK, at the highest levels of Government, \nwith support of the Tory Party--the conservative party--in the UK, is \nthey are developing plans that would significantly increase the number \nof wind turbines. Some 7,000 wind turbines could be installed by the \nyear 2020 to provide all the homes in the UK with electricity. They are \ngoing forward rapidly, boldly with wind, and we are talking about how \nwe can cut back efforts toward sustainable energy.\n  I fully appreciate that my good friend from Tennessee has concerns \nabout wind energy. He may not want a wind turbine at his home or on his \nproperty, and that is his right. We support that right. But I would \nrespectfully request he not make that decision for the rest of America.\n  Wind energy is one of the fastest growing renewable technologies \ntoday and benefits families in my own State of Vermont and all across \nour country. I believe rural America and individual communities across \nthis country deserve the opportunity to decide for themselves whether \nto pursue wind energy. Some may like it; some may not. That is a \ndecision for them and not the Federal Government. I would hope some of \nour conservative friends who talk about all of the vices of a big \nFederal Government might want to heed that thought.\n  The truth is, today millions of rural Americans, in fact, want to \npursue sustainable energy. They should be allowed to do so, and they \nshould be able to utilize the support provisions in this farm bill that \nprovide incentives for them to produce electricity that is renewable, \nthat is cost effective, and does not emit carbon. That is what they \nwant to do. That is what we need. We should support that effort.\n  Apparently, one of those people--and I applaud him for this--is the \nformer Republican President of the United States of America, George \nH.W. Bush, who, in his summer home at Kennebunkport, ME, has recently \ninstalled a 33-foot tall windmill that can produce 400 kilowatts a \nmonth. I applaud former President Bush for pointing out to the country \nthe importance of small wind turbines in providing electricity for \nhomes. I hope all over this country people emulate what the former \nRepublican President has done.\n  There is enormous potential for wind technology in the United States. \nWe have a huge renewable resource base in our country, and yet only \nabout 3 percent of the Nation's electricity supply came from \nnonhydroelectric renewable energy sources in the year 2006.\n  Other countries have already made significant strides toward using \nrenewable energy. I point out that Denmark meets roughly 20 percent of \nits electricity needs with wind alone, while Spain is at 9 percent, and \nGermany and Portugal are at 7 percent. Despite having a much more \nrobust wind resource than any of these countries, the United States \nmeets less than 1 percent of its electrical needs with wind power \ntoday.\n  We can do better. We must do better. The Federal Government, through \ntax credits and other incentives, including small wind turbines, must \nhelp move our country in that direction.\n  Today, most wind turbines are currently located on mountain tops, \nmountain passes, and the Great Plains from North Dakota to Texas. That \nis not nearly good enough. Wind is the cheapest renewable energy, and \nit should be growing by leaps and bounds. We have to move forward in \nmaking that happen.\n  As a nation, we can--in fact, we must--do a better job of exploiting \nthe freely available renewable resources that exist across our country. \nSmall-scale rural wind turbines should be aggressively promoted as one \nof the solutions. We can no longer afford to ignore the rapidly \nmaturing renewable technologies that can help address the critical \nchallenges of energy independence, global warming, and high energy \nprices.\n  It should be heartening to know that new investments in renewable \ngenerating capacity in the United States has been accelerating in \nrecent years. This is largely due to tax credits from States and the \nFederal Government. Wind power has been at the forefront of that \ngrowth. The year 2006 was the largest on record in the U.S. for wind \npower capacity additions, with over 2,400 megawatts of wind added to \nthe grid. That is a good start, but we need to go a lot further than \nthat.\n  I recently talked with a manufacturer of small residential-scale wind \nturbines to find out about the potential of this technology. What he \ntold me was that with support from the U.S. Department of Energy's \nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory we are developing wind turbines \nall over this country where there is a reasonable amount of wind. \nClearly, wind is not available all over the country. But everybody who \nis serious about this issue understands that the solution to global \nwarming and the solution to sustainable energy, electricity generation, \nis going to require a mix of technologies. In some areas wind is \nstrong, in some areas the Sun is strong, and so forth.\n  But in areas such as the State of Vermont, I am told that an average \nhome can produce 40, 50, 60 percent of its electricity from a small \nwind turbine, which is becoming less and less expensive. They are now \non the market for some $12,000--$12,000--including installation. If we \ncan provide the type of tax credits and other incentives for these wind \nturbines, we can have a payback period in a reasonable period of time \nwhich will lower the cost of electricity for millions of Americans, \nbreak our dependency on Middle East oil, and stop the emissions of \ncarbon\n\n[[Page S15187]]\n\ninto the atmosphere, which is causing global warming.\n  I have a lot of respect for my friend from Tennessee, and I know his \nconcern is aesthetics, how these things look--that is one of his \nconcerns--but let me say a word about aesthetics. I also am concerned \nabout how things look. I am concerned when extreme weather disturbances \nsuch as Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana and caused massive damage. That \nis an aesthetic concern I have. If we do not get a handle on global \nwarming, we are going to see more and more extreme weather disturbances \nwhich can impact hundreds of millions if not billions of people.\n  Drought is an aesthetic issue. Seeing lakes dry up, and the \nrepercussions of that, of flooding, and the impact that global warming \nwill have on the loss of clean drinking water, and the desperation \npeople will experience as a result of that, is also an aesthetic issue.\n  So I can understand that people have differences of opinion about how \nthings look. I do not like the look of global warming, and I think we \nshould reject soundly Senator Alexander's amendment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sixteen minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I will take just a few of those, unless the Senator \nfrom Iowa wishes to speak now.\n  I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Colorado, and I know \nthe Senator from Vermont as well has strong and deeply held views on \nthis subject. So do I. I would only respond in these ways: I don't \nthink it is necessary to destroy the environment in order to save the \nenvironment. I think there are more sensible ways to save the \nenvironment than to use tax dollars to encourage people to put up 12-\nstory white towers of red lights in their own neighborhoods.\n  There is some talk about Congress interfering with land use. Well, \nwhat happens here is that when the Congress gives out tax money--my tax \nmoney, your tax money--and says you can use it for this purpose, people \ndo it. So the Congress is distorting land use decisions, in effect. So \nit is the other side that is interfering with local land use decisions.\n  Maybe we have different conceptions of what the word ``small'' means. \nA 100-kilowatt tower is--can be 12 stories high. So we are not talking \nabout your grandmother's windmill that snuggles up cozily next to the \nbarn; we are talking about your neighbor in New Jersey or Tennessee or \nVermont who comes in and says: Hey, I have a great idea. I am going to \nput up a 12-story tower in my front yard with your tax money. Now, if \nthat person wants to do that and local ordinances permit that, then \nthat is not the business of the Federal Government. We don't need to be \nencouraging it in residential areas. All I am saying is this is a farm \nbill, and what I am trying to say is we should limit these subsidies to \nrural areas.\n  The Senator from Colorado said this would be a crippling blow to the \nwind effort. I believe that suggestion, if I may respectfully say, is \noverblown. The biggest--through the renewable electricity production \ntax credit alone, the U.S. taxpayer will spend $11.5 billion on wind \nenergy over 10 years, between 2007 and 2016. This doesn't begin to \ncount other Federal, State, or local subsidies for wind. So without \nthis subsidy, we are spending $11.5 billion for wind.\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, by the year 2009 this \nwind subsidy and the production tax credit that is already in the law \nwill be the single largest Federal tax expenditure for energy in the \nUnited States. Yet it only produces seven-tenths of 1 percent of the \nelectricity we use. To put it in a little perspective--and I mentioned \nthis yesterday--according to the same Joint Tax Committee, all the \nsubsidies we give to oil and gas through taxes, according to the Joint \nTax Committee, are $2.7 billion in the year 2009. The wind subsidies \nare $1.3 billion. Well, we use oil and gas. We use about 25 percent of \nall of the oil and gas in the world in this great big economy of ours. \nWe don't use much of it to make electricity, but we have a $2.7 billion \ntaxpayer investment in that, and that is debated here. But nobody seems \nto notice that we are spending $1.3 billion--nearly half as much--on \nthese large wind turbines, and they are not producing much power--not \nmuch power at all.\n  Just so everyone understands, half of our electricity is produced by \ncoal. Eighty percent of our carbon-free electricity is produced by \nnuclear power. I didn't hear my friends on the other side say a word \nabout nuclear power.\n  Climate change is an inconvenient truth, Al Gore said. I am not one \nof those who believe that just because Al Gore said it means it is \nwrong. I believe climate change is a very serious problem for our \ncountry and our world. I am working hard to change that through low \ncarbon fuel standards, through putting caps on utilities, and through \nsponsoring solar energy. But why would we make such an extraordinarily \ndisproportionate investment in wind turbines when they produce so \nlittle energy and, according to the Energy Administration, are likely \nto produce so little?\n  So the only other points I would make are these: The Senator from \nVermont mentioned the relentless melting of the Arctic. We agree. We \nneed to deal with climate change. But I would suggest that conservation \nand nuclear power are the way to deal with climate change in this \ngeneration. That may be an inconvenient truth as well, but that is the \nway to do it.\n  As I mentioned earlier, just spending the $5 million that is \nallocated for these big residential wind turbines and farm wind \nturbines, just spending that on efficiency lightbulbs would save eight \ntimes as much energy. That would make more common sense to me.\n  The Senator from Vermont also pointed out that the UK--the United \nKingdom--might power all of its houses with wind power. I read that \narticle too; I believe it is the same article. But they are planning to \ndo that with large wind turbines way out in the ocean where you won't \nbe able to see them very easily. If they do have all of their power \nfrom wind power, I don't think I would want to live there because my \ncomputer and my lights and my air-conditioner and my heater would only \nwork when the wind blows. Wind can't be stored in any effective way \ntoday, so it only works when the wind blows. It is not possible for it \nto be used as a base power of electricity. It is not a good peaking \npower.\n  So what we are doing with these extraordinary subsidies for wind is \nwe are encouraging people to build large wind turbines in areas where \nthe wind doesn't blow just so they can make some money on it because of \nall of these huge generous subsidies, and we are deluding ourselves \ninto thinking we are dealing with climate change when, in fact, we are \nignoring the real solutions to climate change, which are conservation, \nNo. 1, and--in this generation, at least--nuclear power, No. 2.\n  So that is my reason for making this amendment. This is a farm bill. \nIf we are going to subsidize wind turbines in the farm bill, let's do \nit on farms. Let's not take my tax money and your tax money and give it \nto your neighbor and say: You can put up a 12-story white tower next \ndoor, and we would like to encourage you to do that in your residential \nneighborhood. I don't think that makes common sense. Once it starts \nhappening, neighborhood after neighborhood after neighborhood, I think \na lot of taxpayers are going to be calling their U.S. Senator and \nsaying: You did what? You did what? Why didn't you vote for \nconservation support? Why didn't you vote to have clean coal \ntechnology? Why didn't you vote to build more nuclear powerplants, \nwhich are the real way to do carbon-free energy? Why are you pretending \nto solve climate change by putting up 12-story towers or encouraging \nthem to be put up in my neighbor's front yard?\n  So I hope my colleagues will recognize that the wiser vote today is \nfor the Alexander amendment because that will make possible new \nsubsidies, in addition to all of the other subsidies, for wind turbines \nin rural areas. They call them small, but they are up to 12 stories \ntall. It will make it clear that there is no interference with local \nland use rules about what kind of towers may go up and down.\n  Of course, the other amendment I proposed would help get the research \nprograms back on track at our land grant universities which have been \nso valuable in helping raise farm incomes and creating jobs in this \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S15188]]\n\n  I thank the President, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me speak briefly in opposition to \none of the amendments the Senator from Tennessee has offered. It is \namendment No. 3551.\n  I think one of the most important things we can do in order to \nencourage development of renewable resources is to encourage \nconstruction of power lines to bring the power from where it is \nproduced to where it is needed. Many of the best areas for development \nof wind and solar power are in remote parts of our country. That is in \nthe upper midwest Plains States or in the desert southwest in \nparticular. Lack of transmission from these remote locations is \nseriously hampering the great potential for the generation of \nelectricity from these resources.\n  Power lines to such places are expensive and often face local \nopposition from landowners and residents across whose lands the lines \nhave to be built. The farm bill, section 12302, attempts to address the \nproblem by creating a tax incentive to encourage farmers and ranchers \nand landowners to allow transmission lines to be built across their \nproperty. Landowners receive a payment whenever they agree to the \nsiting of a transmission tower on their land, and these payments are \ncurrently taxable. Section 12302 would make those payments tax exempt \nif the power that is carried on the lines comes primarily from a \nrenewable generator that is eligible for the renewable production tax \ncredit. Senator Alexander's amendment here would strike that section. \nThe cost of that section, as I have been advised, is $91 million over 5 \nyears--a little less than $20 million per year.\n  It is clear from reports of the Western Governors' Association and \nmany others that we are going to need substantial construction of new \ntransmission lines throughout the West in the next several years if we \nare going to increase use of renewable energy. Transmission lines have \nmore benefit than just to the generator. They enhance the reliability \nof the transmission system. They help break bottlenecks that make \ngeneration more expensive than it needs to be. They also can enhance \nlocal economies by opening areas that have been closed to development. \nMy own view is that this tax exemption would help to encourage farmers \nand ranchers to seriously consider the siting of transmission lines in \nlocations where it makes sense.\n  Senator Alexander argues that wind power receives enormous subsidies \nunder current law and under the Energy bill that is being debated. It \nis difficult, of course, to look into the future, but if you look at \nthe last 5 years, according to a GAO report issued this year, the \nDepartment of Energy received $11.5 billion in funding for electricity-\nrelated research and development, and $6.2 billion of that went to fund \nnuclear power research and development and $3.1 billion went to fund \nfossil fuel generation. Mr. President, $1.4 billion went to all \nrenewables--not just wind but all renewables combined. GAO also \nestimates that during that same period, fossil fuels received about \n$13.7 billion in tax expenditures, and renewables, about $2.8 billion. \nWhen new nuclear power facilities are built--and there are some now on \nthe verge of being built--they will receive very generous tax credits \nas well under current law. I have supported those tax credits.\n  I believe, as the Senator from Tennessee said, that nuclear power is \nan essential part of the solution to global warming and a central part \nof the solution to our future energy needs, but I believe alternative \nrenewable power also fits in that category. For decades now, fossil \nfuel generation and nuclear power have received the lion's share of \nFederal support. If renewables are to take their rightful place in the \nmarket, we need to be providing support to them on an equal footing. I \nbelieve that an exemption extended to farmers and ranchers, who deserve \nadequate compensation when their land is used, is good public policy.\n  I know the Senator from Tennessee is proposing that the funds \ninvolved here would be shifted over to a land grant research program \nthat Senator Alexander wants to fund. That is a good program. I \nunderstand the managers of the bill are working on funding for this \nprogram to be included in--increased funding for this program to be \nincluded in the managers' amendment. I would argue that there are \nbetter places to look for paying for that program than from the \nincentives for farmers and ranchers to engage in such a worthwhile \npurpose. So I would urge a ``no'' vote on that amendment by the Senator \nfrom Tennessee.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from Idaho?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I would like to conclude my remarks, if \nthat would be all right.\n  Mr. CRAIG. May I ask how much time remains in opposition to the \nAlexander amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico controls 4 \nminutes. The Senator from Colorado controls 1 minute.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, just a few remarks.\n  I appreciate the comments of the Senator, who is chairman of the \nEnergy Committee, and I appreciate his support for nuclear power, which \nis 80 percent of our carbon-free electricity in America even though it \nis only 20 percent of our electricity.\n  I will discuss briefly his point on my amendment that would seek to \nrestore funding to the program for land grant universities. If the \nmanagers are able to find some extra money, that would be terrific, but \nit ought to be in addition to the $74 million I have proposed. The \nHouse proposes to spend $600 million over the last 3 years in the farm \nbill. I am proposing to spend $74 million.\n  Second, one of the problems with the section I am seeking to strike \nis that it appears to apply retroactively to transmission towers. I see \nno reason for that. A larger problem is that wind doesn't need more \nsubsidies. The Senator talked about subsidies to other forms of energy \nfor research and development. I have yet to hear anybody contradict the \nfact that the taxpayer, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, \nwill spend $11.5 billion on wind energy over the next 10 years, which \ntoday produces less than 1 percent of our electricity, and only when \nthe winds blows.\n  Even if you have wind turbines all over America, you still need \nnuclear plants, conservation, coal plants, and a base load of \nelectricity. There is a long list of Federal subsidies for wind energy \nand, in addition, clean, renewable energy bonds, the Department of \nDefense energy incentive program, et cetera, including State programs. \nWhat is happening is that we are encouraging people to build wind \nturbines, as they have on Buffalo Mountain in Tennessee, in places \nwhere the wind doesn't blow, just to make the money the Federal \nGovernment provides in subsidies.\n  Finally, I think the greatest, most specific argument against the \nidea of giving tax breaks to landowners, where you are going to build \nnew transmission lines, is this: This would mean the Tennessee taxpayer \nwould be taxed to pay for transmission lines in New Mexico or South \nDakota, or the Georgia taxpayer would be taxed to pay for transmission \nlines in Pennsylvania or Virginia. Transmission lines should be paid \nfor by the utility that builds them and the ratepayer who benefits from \nthat, not by the general taxpayers. So if all of the other reasons go \nto the side, the major reason in support of this amendment is that it \nis inappropriate for us to require taxpayers in Maryland, Tennessee, \nand Texas to pay for utilities' transmission lines in New Mexico, South \nDakota, and Illinois. They should pay for them themselves.\n  Mr. President, that concludes my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n5 minutes in opposition to the Alexander amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, how much \ntime remains, or how much time does the Senator from Iowa have on this \namendment?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Five minutes remains in opposition.\n\n[[Page S15189]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time does Senator Bingaman have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That includes his time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield that time to the Senator from \nIdaho.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, it is rare that I disagree with my friend \nfrom Tennessee, especially on energy issues. We are very much in \nconcert on how we not only deal with climate change, in many instances, \nbut how we build a full energy portfolio for our country that makes us \nincreasingly independent of foreign nations and oil-producing nations.\n  One of the ways to do it, in my opinion, is to promote all sources of \nenergy. While there are wind turbines going up in Idaho and in \nlocations that I don't necessarily care for, I have very much supported \nwind, I will continue to support wind, and I support small wind. I say \nthat in respect to the provision within the bill and in opposition to \nwhat the Senator from Tennessee is trying to do. Not only is it \nimportant that we produce as much as we possibly can because, clearly, \nour Nation is rapidly growing in deficit as it relates to energy \nproduction in nearly all segments. I agree you don't produce \nelectricity when the wind doesn't blow; but when it does, you do.\n  I will give you an example of a small company in Idaho that a few \nyears ago, with little Federal assistance, built an obscure building \nout on the high deserts of Idaho, tapped underground water and brought \nin some electrolysis equipment, put up small wind turbines, exactly the \nkind the Senator from Tennessee is talking about. Those turbines \nproduce 25 percent of their electrical needs. When you add that 25 \npercent wind turbine capability to their online use of electricity, \nthey produce hydrogen in a profitable way that users of hydrogen in the \nBoise Valley are no longer trucking it in from Seattle, WA. They simply \npull their truck out to the hydrogen facility and leave it there to be \nfilled by this small hydrogen-producing company that uses electrolysis \nmachines that are literally off the shelf, that are already being made \nand built into small business America. What made the difference for \nthat company, what made it profitable, was to gain 25 percent of its \nenergy base from wind, with the small turbine he is talking about.\n  If you don't want a wind turbine in your front yard in an urban area, \nplanning and zoning will take care of that. That is a local decision to \nbe made. If you don't want them in certain places in your State, then \nwhether it is county planning and zoning or municipal planning and \nzoning, that, too, can take care of it.\n  America is rapidly adjusting to where the wind isn't and where the \nwind is. Wind isn't everywhere, but in certain segments of the Midwest, \nupper Midwest, and the West there are wind troughs, if you will, where \nthe wind blows in a sustained way to make wind turbine generation \nprofitable, adding to our overall energy base. I hope we will oppose \nthe Alexander amendment.\n  Along with many others, I have changed my mind over the years in \nrapidly encouraging all kinds of clean energy production. Wind \ncertainly is clean, hydro is clean, and photovoltaic is clean. We need \nall of the rest, but we need to get increasingly a cleaner energy \nportfolio. Wind assists us in doing that. It is not the cure-all. And I \nagree with the Senator from Tennessee that nuclear, without question, \nis the base-loading generation capability that is clean, that is in our \ncurrent technology base that, thank goodness, America has awakened to \nand we are beginning to see that happening. We are seeing the licensing \nof new nuclear reactors and we will be able, within the decade, to see \nmultiple reactors coming on line to produce large volumes of energy. \nBut there is no doubt that conservation, supplementation by wind, and \nall other sources remain important pieces of that total package.\n\n  I oppose the Alexander amendment. I hope we can support small wind \ndevelopment along with large wind development. Is it pricey? Yes, it \nis; it is not inexpensive. I believe right now we are spending upward \nof a billion dollars a day offshore to foreign nations to buy their \noil. The more money we can keep onshore for America, American \nenterprises, and the consumer, we ought to be doing. This is one way to \ndo it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The sponsor has 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. We yield back our time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee and all \nthe Senators speaking on that amendment, for or against it.\n  Under the unanimous subsequent request, we will turn to the Gregg \namendment No. 3673. There will be 2 hours evenly divided. I say to the \nSenators, if you are opposed or for the Gregg amendment No. 3673, which \nwould cap noneconomic damages in OB/GYN medical malpractice lawsuits, \nif Senators want to speak on that, we are on it now, with 2 hours \nevenly divided. Hopefully, we can reduce that time. I ask Senators to \nplease come to the floor if they want to speak.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3673\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the chairman \nof the Agriculture Committee. I will speak on our amendment dealing \nwith how we get more doctors to be able to care for women in rural \ncommunities. We have a real crisis in rural America today. There is a \nsignificant shortage of doctors who deliver babies. This is purely a \nfunction of one fact, and that is that the trial lawyer bar has been so \naggressive in pursuing doctors who deliver babies with lawsuits, they \nhave essentially created a cost of liability insurance for doctors who \ndeliver babies--OB/GYNs--that is so high that a doctor practicing in a \nrural community who is there to help women having children, deliver \nthose babies safely, that type of doctor cannot make ends meet. That \nsounds unusual, but that is a fact.\n  In order for a doctor to generate enough income to simply pay the \nliability insurance, which is generated by the large number of lawsuits \nfiled against doctors in this country by the trial bar, it is necessary \nfor an OB/GYN--a doctor who delivers babies--to have a very large \nbasically urban or suburban clientele. When you get into rural America \nand you don't have a lot of people per square mile, where you have \npeople who work on farms and those farms take up a fair amount of \nacreage, then you don't have the population base necessary for these \ndoctors to practice and generate enough income to pay the liability \ninsurance.\n  What we are proposing in this amendment is a very narrow proposal. It \ndoesn't say that doctors who are incompetent, or doctors who, \nunfortunately, make a mistake won't be sued. It doesn't say that at \nall. It simply says that in the area of rural America where we need to \nattract doctors so women have adequate health care, especially if they \nare having children, in those parts of the country--from the standpoint \nof population, a small part of the country--we are going to have a \nspecial consideration that allows doctors to be able to afford their \nliability insurance.\n  We are going to follow what has happened in the law that has been set \nup in Texas and California, two States which have confronted this issue \nof liability insurance for doctors and have come up with a plan that \nhas alleviated the cost of the insurance so doctors are able to \npractice in those States. It essentially says that in the area of \neconomic recovery, you can recover every expenditure, every loss you \nhad, if you were injured as a result of malpractice on the part of a \ndoctor delivering a baby in a rural area.\n  But in the area of pain and suffering, where so much of the huge \nawards occur, and where you have had these real decisions that have \nbeen in the numbers that are multiple millions, that won't happen any \nlonger. We are going to limit recovery in the pain and suffering area \nto what has been the standard in Texas and California, which is \n$750,000 per incident. The practical effect of this is very simple. It \nwill mean doctors who wish to practice in rural America, who wish to \ndeliver\n\n[[Page S15190]]\n\nbabies for farm families and for other families who live in rural \nAmerica will be able to pursue those practices and still make a living, \nsomething they cannot do in many parts of this country today, so women \nin these communities will not have to drive for miles and miles to get \nadequate health care, especially when they are having children.\n\n  I know in my State of New Hampshire, if you get north of the White \nMountains, one of the prettiest parts of this world, we have a very \ndifficult time attracting obstetricians. In fact, right now, I don't \nthink there is anybody practicing obstetrics up there because of the \nfact the population base is so small it cannot support those practices \nat a level that allows doctors in that region to be able to pay their \nmalpractice insurance. So women in that part of New Hampshire often \nhave to drive all the way to Hanover, NH, to Dartmouth-Hitchcock, which \nis a superb hospital, or down to Laconia, which has a superb hospital. \nBut they literally have to drive through the mountains 2 to 3 hours to \nget to those facilities. It can be extremely difficult in the middle of \nwinter to drive those roads. In the summer, obviously, it is not fair \nto ask people to drive those long distances.\n  This is a very significant issue for rural America and for farm \nfamilies in America. That is why I have offered it on the farm bill.\n  The other side of the aisle, for whatever reason--I know the reason, \nwe all know the reason, the trial bar--has decided to resist this \namendment aggressively. They have demanded we have 60 votes before we \ncan adopt this amendment. They have basically said: We don't care that \nwomen in America who live in rural America are not able to get adequate \nhealth care. What we care about is the trial lawyer bar, and that is \nunfortunate. But that is a reflection of the politics of our time.\n  The single largest contributing group to the Democratic Party today \nis the Trial Lawyers Association. Those trial lawyers contribute to the \nDemocratic Party for a reason: They want them to support their agenda. \nThere is a simpatico there. Their agenda is supported essentially by \nthe Democratic leadership in this Congress and in prior Congresses. The \ntrial bar agenda includes not allowing any opening on the issue of \nlimiting liability relative to doctors--any opening. Even something as \nreasonable as this which is so needed from the standpoint of health \ncare policy, which is so needed from the standpoint of good care of \nchildren and mothers in a prenatal state, so needed in the basic \nfairness for American citizens is resisted, not because it is not a \ngood idea but because they see it as an opening, a slight crack in that \ndoor of their ability to bring these massive lawsuits for other people \nwho practice obstetrics across the country or for basically against the \nmedical community generally. They do not want any crack in that door to \noccur, even if the crack in the door is meant to give American women \nwho live in rural communities, whose families work on farms, the \nopportunity to be assured decent health care, especially when they are \nin the process of having and raising a child.\n  It truly is unfortunate we have reached that point in this Congress \nwhere very reasonable public policy, which is to make it possible for \nmore doctors to practice in rural America, is resisted in a knee-jerk \nway which has no relationship to making our country stronger, our \npeople more healthy, and especially giving people who work in farm \nAmerica a better opportunity to live a quality life, especially if they \nare having children.\n  This is not an attempt in any way to limit the ability of women who \nare having children and find there is some negligent event occurring as \na result of a doctor's care to get a recovery. This amendment does not \nhave that impact. Recovery is in here. It tracks what happens if you \nlive in Texas. It tracks pretty much what happens if you live in \nCalifornia. So it is not an attempt to do some draconian effort to \nbasically shut down lawsuits against doctors who may practice and make \nmistakes in rural America. Just the opposite. It leaves those lawsuits \non the table. It makes them possible. It gives adequate and fair \nrecovery that is allowed for people in two of our most popular States.\n  What it does do and what it is almost guaranteed to do is to bring \nmore doctors into rural America.\n  It is interesting to look at the Texas experience because prior to \nTexas passing its law, which basically tracks this language, they had a \nvery serious, basically a crisis in the area of having OB/GYNs practice \nin Texas. Now they have a massive backlog of OB/GYNs who want to move \nto Texas to practice. They actually have the opposite situation. They \nnow have a situation where doctors see Texas as a good place to \npractice. So health care, for women especially of childbearing age, is \nimproving dramatically because there are a lot more doctors available.\n  Their biggest problem right now is making sure the doctors who want \nto come into their State have the quality and ability to do the job \nright. So they have a big backlog now. That is a complete shift from \nwhat happened during the period prior to their passing the law. That \napplies to everybody, but in the OB/GYN area, they lost 14 doctors, 14 \nobstetricians during the period 2003, but since they passed their law, \nthey have gained almost 200 obstetricians in the State. That is a big \ndifference. That means a lot of people are seeing doctors who were not \nable to see them before.\n\n  We ought to give that same opportunity to rural America, generally, \nand especially to farm families. That is why I have offered this \namendment.\n  It is not a big amendment in the sense of dramatic health care \nchanges for the world or for the United States, generally, but it is a \nbig amendment if you are a woman whose family works on a farm and you \nwant to have a child because--hopefully, if this amendment is adopted--\nyou are going to be able to see a doctor without having to drive 4 or 5 \nhours maybe through a snowstorm, and that is important. It is important \nto that person, and it should be something we would do as a matter of \ndecency and fairness and especially as a matter of good public policy \nrelative to health care in this country.\n  I hope people will support this amendment. I understand the other \nside of the aisle wants to debate a little while longer. That is fine. \nI understand they want 60 votes. That seems highly inappropriate to me, \nbut that was the agreement that was reached between the leadership.\n  As I said, I am not trying to stop this bill. It does seem to me \nthere ought to be 60 Members of the Senate to stand up and say enough \nis enough; we have done enough kowtowing to trial lawyers on this \nissue. It is time to do something for the women who live and work in \nrural America and make sure they have adequate access to health care, \nespecially to doctors who can care for them in those important and \nspecial years when they are having children.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following Senators be \nadded as original cosponsors to amendment No. 3673: Senator Alexander, \nSenator Allard, Senator Cornyn, Senator Corker, Senator Dole, Senator \nHutchison, and Senator Voinovich.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Judd Gregg,\n     Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gregg, The American College of Obstetricians \n     and Gynecologists (ACOG), representing 51,000 physicians and \n     partners in women's health care, strongly supports your \n     Amendment 3673 to H.R. 2419, the Healthy Mothers and Healthy \n     Babies\n\n[[Page S15191]]\n\n     Rural Access to Care Act. We commend your continued \n     leadership and efforts to resolve the medical liability \n     crisis facing this nation and to protect access to health \n     care for our nation's women and children.\n       As you well know, the medical liability environment is \n     driving good doctors out of practice or out of their home \n     states. And when ob-gyns discontinue the practice of \n     obstetrics, refuse high-risk patients, or reduce their \n     surgical practice, women's health care suffers. This has been \n     a problem in the rural areas of several states--including \n     West Virginia, Ohio, Nevada, Missouri and Michigan--which had \n     some of the highest base rate premiums for ob-gyns in the \n     country last year.\n       Perhaps most troubling is the effect of the crisis on young \n     physicians. A 2006 survey of doctors in their fourth year of \n     ob-gyn residency, the last year before they enter patient \n     care, confirmed that a state's liability climate has a \n     powerful impact on where and how they will practice. A third \n     of residents indicated they had been warned or advised to \n     leave their current location because of liability concerns \n     and nearly half were already considering limiting the type \n     and scope of their practice. Residents named 7 states they \n     would avoid altogether: Florida, Pennsylvania, New York, \n     Nevada, Illinois, New Jersey and West Virginia.\n       ACOG is deeply committed to resolving the medical liability \n     crisis and supports federal legislation to enact reforms such \n     as the ones that have been so effective in Texas and \n     California. ACOG supports, in particular, provisions in your \n     amendment which would cap non-economic damages, limit the \n     number of years a plaintiff has to file a health care \n     liability action, allocate damages in proportion to a party's \n     degree of fault, and place reasonable limits on punitive \n     damages.\n       Your amendment is critically important to help solve the \n     medical liability crisis. We urge the Senate to move quickly \n     to enact legislation that will provide relief to physicians \n     and ensure continued availability of quality health care for \n     our patients.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Kenneth L. Noller,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                December 11, 2007.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gregg, The organizations below are pleased to \n     support Amendment 3673 to H.R. 2419, the Healthy Mothers and \n     Healthy Babies Rural Access to Care Act. Thank you for \n     continuing to highlight the crisis created for ob-gyns and \n     all our specialties by unavailable and unaffordable medical \n     liability insurance.\n       Clearly, America's medical liability crisis does not affect \n     just one specialty or one type of patient, but we strongly \n     believe that every attempt must be taken to pass legislation \n     and raise public awareness of this crisis. We are fully \n     committed to focusing the Nation's attention on the need to \n     solve this crisis, and to work with you to identify a \n     successful strategy that will help get comprehensive medical \n     liability reform legislation signed into law.\n       If you have any questions, or need additional information, \n     please contact Tara Straw.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Academy of Dermatology Association, American \n           Association of Neurological Surgeons, American \n           Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons, American College \n           of Emergency Physicians, American College of \n           Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American \n           Gastroenterological Association, American Society of \n           Cataract and Refractive Surgery, American Urological \n           Association, Congress of Neurological Surgeons, \n           National Association of Spine Specialists.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             College of American Pathologists,\n\n                                                   Northfield, IL,\n                                                December 11, 2007.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     Senate Office Building,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gregg: As the United States Senate considers \n     S. 2302, the Food and Energy Security Act of 2007, the \n     College of American Pathologists (CAP), representing 16,000 \n     board-certified physician pathologists, supports your \n     amendment based on legislation you introduced, the Healthy \n     Mothers and Healthy Babies Rural Access to Care Act, S. 244. \n     Your amendment addresses the medical liability crisis facing \n     rural obstetricians and the women they serve. It also \n     represents a good first step towards comprehensive liability \n     reform for all physicians.\n       Pathologists work closely with their obstetrician \n     colleagues in caring for women's health care needs, including \n     providing Pap tests and laboratory tests conducted on \n     newborns. We witness the effects of exorbitant insurance \n     costs on obstetricians in our own communities when they are \n     forced to scale back their practices. In fact, an estimated 1 \n     out of 7 obstetricians nationwide have stopped delivering \n     babies altogether.\n       The CAP believes the medical liability crisis requires a \n     national solution designed to help patients, not lawyers. \n     Your amendment's $750,000 cap on non-economic damages, which \n     includes a $250,000 cap for rural obstetricians, is a \n     thoughtful reform that will help ensure that women have \n     access to affordable quality care while preserving their \n     right to seek redress in the courts.\n       Again, the College of American Pathologists supports your \n     amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       John Scott,\n                             Vice President, Division of Advocacy.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield the floor and yield to the Senator \nfrom Colorado on my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank Senator Gregg from New Hampshire \nfor his amendment. This is a commonsense amendment, and I think it is \nentirely appropriate to have it on the agriculture bill because it is \none that will make a difference in rural America.\n  I support the amendment which is called the Healthy Mothers and \nHealthy Babies Access to Care amendment, that contains measures for \ntargeted liability reform directed at curtailing the number of \nfrivolous lawsuits that are filed every year against obstetricians and \ngynecologists, especially those in rural areas, such as many parts of \nmy State of Colorado.\n  This amendment would help those who are in the business of protecting \nour mothers and children. The OB/GYN community has seen more litigation \nin the past few years than any other health care profession. The \nMedical Liability Monitor estimates that medical malpractice rates for \nOB/GYNs have increased as much as 500 percent between 1999 and 2004 for \ncertain areas of the country. In 2004 alone, there was an increase of \nabout 130 percent in areas that did not have liability protection.\n  Every year, fewer and fewer OB/GYNs are entering the health care \nindustry, and every year more and more of them leave their practices \nbehind and leave their patients without access to health care or \ndiminished access.\n  What does it say that OB/GYNs are afraid to practice their \nprofessions, as my constituents have expressed to me? We need to cut \ndown on the frivolous lawsuits against OB/GYNs so they can get back to \ntaking care of mothers and sisters and daughters and wives in rural \nareas.\n  The Gregg amendment would provide for unlimited economic damages and \nprovide a stacked cap model that would keep noneconomic damages at or \nbelow $750,000. The $750,000 cap stacked model would provide that there \nwould be up to $250,000 from a decision rendered against a health care \nprovider, $250,000 from a decision rendered against a single health \ncare institution, and $250,000 from a decision rendered against more \nthan one health care institution for each or $500,000 for all.\n  Those of you who come out of more urban areas may say that does not \nseem like much. But if you are a practicing physician in a rural area \nor a hospital in a rural area, $500,000 is a lot of money. If you have \na large metropolitan hospital, it is chump change, but in rural \nAmerica, it does make a difference.\n  It also provides punitive damages to be the greater of twice the \neconomic damages awarded, or $250,000.\n  This amendment also guarantees that lawsuits are filed no later than \n3 years after the injury and extends the statute of limitations for \nminors injured before age 6.\n  This language also intends to maximize patient recovery of payment by \nfocusing on attorney payment regulations. It also establishes standards \nfor expert witness rules, promotes fairness in the recovery of health \nbenefits, and it attempts to prevent double recovery.\n  This language also raises the burden of proof for the award of \npunitive damages and protects providers from being a party in liability \nsuits for FDA-approved products.\n  Last, it keeps a focus on the patient by attempting to curtail \nfrivolous lawsuits.\n  In my State of Colorado, tort reform laws were enacted beginning in \n1986. At that time, I happened to have been in the State legislature \nand carried much of the legislation that brought about a tort reform \nagenda for the State of Colorado.\n  Colorado created caps for noneconomic damages. They are considered to \nbe among the most reasonable in the country. Frankly, many OB/GYNs see \nthe tort reform laws in Colorado as beneficial to their practice and \ncite this as a reason to move their practice to Colorado.\n  However, although they find practicing in Colorado to be preferable,\n\n[[Page S15192]]\n\nproblems for OB/GYNs still exist in our rural areas. That is why I am \nhere to support the Gregg amendment, even though in Colorado we have \ndone a lot to try to reduce the burden of frivolous lawsuits it has \nlittle impact because practitioners in the rural areas have to go into \nour neighboring States and practice in those neighboring States. As a \nresult, they get impacted when they go over to those States, even \nthough we have a favorable environment in the State of Colorado.\n  It is not always easy to get across a mountain in a snowstorm, such \nas we had in the last few weeks, so you go to patients in Utah, for \nexample, or maybe New Mexico, if you are on some of the border \ncommunities.\n  Many physicians who serve in most rural areas of Colorado live in \ntowns bordering other States. Because of the reduction in the OB/GYN \nworkforce, it is now necessary for them to travel to patients to ensure \nmothers in rural areas receive treatment. It often involves crossing \nState lines so they may serve patients in rural areas of Wyoming, \nNebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah. They are all \nneighbors of the State of Colorado. In many cases, the laws in these \nStates do not protect the physician to the extent those in Colorado do \nand at the very least increase costs for physicians.\n  Rural patients in this country need access to care and treatment, \nplain and simple. If we continue to let trial lawyers create an \nenvironment where physicians cannot afford malpractice insurance, we \nrun the risk of leaving our rural mothers without access to the doctors \nthey need. So even though we have favorable tort reform provisions in \nColorado which help reduce frivolous lawsuits, our neighbors do not, \nand it is having an impact especially in the rural communities of \nColorado that border our neighboring States. The fact is, it makes it \nmore difficult to attract doctors who want to practice obstetrics in \nthose small communities.\n\n  In Texas, a good example where the legislation most recently went \ninto effect, amazing things have happened since September of 2003. They \nhave added nearly 4,000 doctors, insurance premiums have declined, and \nthe number of lawsuits filed against doctors has been cut in half. I \nabsolutely believe a focus needs to be made on liability lawsuits, \nespecially in the area of OB/GYN practice. And we saw similar results \nwhen the legislature of the State of Colorado passed legislation \nreducing the liability burden that is brought by frivolous lawsuits. So \nI have seen it happen in my own State as well as the State of Texas.\n  I will continue to do my best to ensure that women and their \nchildren, especially those in rural areas, have access to quality \nhealth care and that frivolous lawsuits do not continue to line the \npockets of the plaintiff's bar. For these reasons, I lend my support to \nSenator Gregg as we move forward on the passage of his amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have 10 minutes \nfrom the opposition's time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I was listening to this debate and was \nlooking forward to these amendments on the farm bill, and all of a \nsudden I am hearing about pregnant women, and having babies, and suing \ndoctors, and I am thinking: What bill are we on? Why on Earth do we \nhave an attack on women in this farm bill? And it is an attack on women \nin rural areas when you say we are going to have tort reform and we are \naiming it at the women in rural America because we don't like the fact \nthat they may sue if there is malpractice.\n  Men often say, well, they are doing things to help women. Watch out \nwhen that happens. Men come to this floor and say: Oh, we are going to \ntake care of the women. This doesn't take care of women. This puts them \nat risk. And they say: Oh, many more doctors will come to work in the \nrural areas if we limit liability.\n  But look at Texas. What my friend from Colorado mentioned about Texas \nis untrue. We have the statistics. There are no more doctors in rural \nTexas after they passed this bill. What has happened is that women have \nhad their rights taken away from them.\n  Now, again, my friends on the Republican side couch this as an attack \non the trial lawyers. Oh, the trial lawyers are evil, and all that. \nWatch out when people say lawyers are evil because when they are in \ntrouble, the first thing they do is call the best lawyer in town. I \nhave seen it myself, right here in the Senate. So watch out when you \nsee a blanket attack on all lawyers. I have to tell you, when a Member \non the other side gets in trouble, the first thing they do is call the \nbest lawyer in town, but they want to take away the rights of women to \nsue in a tragic situation.\n  There are numerous examples that I can talk about, but one example \ncame to my attention for these purposes, just to show people on both \nsides of the aisle some of the terrible things that do happen in these \nchildbirths.\n  I am a grandmother, twice, and I have to tell you that in both \ncases--and even when I became a mom, twice--all very difficult; \npremature births, problems, long labors, concerns, breach babies. These \nare hard and difficult things. And OB/GYNs are my heroes. They are my \nheroes. Doctors are my heroes. But doctors make, sometimes, terrible \nerrors, and they have to be held accountable or they will just go on \nand do it again and again.\n  Now, why would we, on a farm bill, attack the women of rural America \nand take away their rights? Let's talk about this particular case of \nDonna Harnett. She happened to be in Chicago. Her doctor decided her \nlabor was not progressing quickly enough, so he prescribed a drug to \nhelp induce more contractions. Later, when her labor was not \nprogressing, her doctor broke her water, found it was abnormal, and \nrather than consider a C-section, the doctor decided to continue to \nadminister the drugs in hopes that the labor would progress.\n  Six hours later she had not delivered. Her son's fetal monitoring \nsystem began alarming, indicating the baby was in serious respiratory \ndistress. The doctor finally decided, after all those hours, it was \ntime to perform an emergency C-section, but it was another hour before \nDonna was taken into the operating room. During that time, the doctor \nfailed to administer oxygen or an IV to help the baby breathe. After \nthe baby was born, he remained in intensive care for 3 weeks, and she \nlater learned he had suffered substantial brain damage and cerebral \npalsy as a direct result of the doctor's failure to respond to \nindications of serious oxygen deprivation and delivery in a timely \nmanner.\n\n  In addition to all that, her doctor told her not to have any more \nchildren because she had a problem with her DNA, indicating the fact \nthat the child was disabled was in her DNA. And, he said: Any of your \nfuture children would similarly have mental and physical disabilities.\n  Clearly, he was protecting himself in that situation and putting the \nblame on her. Since then, Donna has given birth to three healthy sons.\n  She sued the doctor responsible for Martin's delivery, and she \nreceived a settlement. That settlement is helping her cover the costs \nassociated with Martin's care that are not covered by health insurance, \nsuch as the used wheelchair-accessible van she purchased for $50,000 \nand the $100,000 she spent renovating her home to make it accessible \nfor her loving son. Martin is now 11. He will be at risk for health \ncomplications, including a terrifying incident in August when he almost \nbled to death because his trachea tube had rubbed a hole through an \nartery. But he survived, and he is able to laugh and to love and to \nattend school in his community.\n  Now, how would she be able to afford to take care of Martin if she \nwasn't able to have justice? Donna said:\n\n       If there had been caps on the recovery system when my son \n     was injured, it would have torn our family apart and Martin \n     would be in an institution. Instead, he is able to live at \n     home with us where we can take care of him and make sure he \n     is happy.\n\n  Why on Earth do Senators in this body want to tell a woman like that: \nToo bad, no help, sorry. It is wrong. I have seen it in my own State. \nIt is wrong. It tears families apart. Everyone here says: Oh, we are so \nfamily friendly. We have family values. Well, I would like to think we \nhave family values that extend to a woman such as\n\n[[Page S15193]]\n\nDonna, to a mother such as Donna, to a loving family such as her \nfamily, who, yes, wanted to buy a van so it was possible for her to \ntake her son in and to give her son a decent life.\n  You know, I don't want to be a party to a Senate that would tell a \nwoman such as Donna that she is just going to have to suffer for the \nmistakes of a physician. And let me be clear: I am a fan of physicians. \nI trust doctors. But, yes, they make mistakes. And when they make \nmistakes, they have to be held accountable, just as we all do if we are \ndriving and we make a mistake. To put a cap on this and tell a woman \nsuch as Donna: Sorry, your son is your problem, when, in fact, the \nproblem was created by medical malpractice, is an outrage--an outrage.\n  Anyone who votes for this amendment is saying to the women in rural \nAmerica: You don't matter. So they can couch it as an attack on trial \nlawyers, they can do that all they want, but it is about the woman, the \nmom, who has been mistreated in this fashion.\n  If we want to deal with issues such as malpractice insurance, count \nme in. If we want to make sure some made-up case is thrown out of \ncourt, I am with you. And, by the way, there are already laws to cover \nthat. But don't come here and say how wonderful you are being to the \nwomen of rural America by imposing a cap on what they could collect \nwhen they are damaged, when they are made sterile by a mistake, when a \nchild gets brain damage because of a mistake, because of a mixup. That \nis not right.\n  And don't say: Oh, it is worth doing because you will get more \ndoctors to come into rural America. It isn't happening. The Texas \nstatistics are there, and I will share them with you. In 2003, when \nTexas passed its law, 152 Texas counties had no obstetrician. Today, 4 \nyears after passage, the number hasn't budged, with 102 Texas counties \nhaving no obstetrician. The fact that some rural counties lack OB/GYNs \nis not a function of malpractice premiums. It is a function of \npopulation. The doctors practice where the patients are. So anyone who \nstands up here and says: Oh, this is great because so many more doctors \nwill come into rural America, the facts don't show that.\n  I can tell you because now that I am of the age of a grandmother, \nwhere I see so many of these births with my friends' kids, I can tell \nyou that these births are complicated. We want the best people taking \ncare of our women, whether they are in rural America or urban America \nor wherever they are. And if there is a tragic mistake, such as the one \nI related to you--a doctor just ignoring what is happening to the \npatient, refusing to do a cesarean, depriving the child of oxygen, and \nthen turning around and telling the mother: Oh, it is your fault, it is \nin your DNA, it wasn't anything I did--and then going and telling a \njury, well, even if you find in favor of this woman, you cap what she \ncan get--You are consigning that family to a life of tragedy, because \nthe mother in the case I talked about wouldn't be able to have the \npeople in her home to help her with her son. And she had three other \nhealthy babies. How dare that physician try to pin his malpractice on \nher, tell her she better not have any more kids. She had three more \nhealthy kids.\n  So I stand here, Mr. President, as a Senator but also as a mom, \nhaving had two extremely difficult births, where the doctors I had, the \nsame practice for both my kids, were wise, they were strong, they were \nsmart, and they handled it right. Having seen my own family experience \ndifficult births, I can tell you that you want the best handling it. \nYou don't want to put a cap on damages so that people who are less than \nthe best can go into this area and think: Well, I am protected. If I \nmake 10 mistakes, I can afford it because there is a cap on it. So big \ndeal. Disaster.\n  And to do this on the farm bill, it borders on the humorous, if it \nwasn't so serious. Maybe we want to have an amendment about birthing \ncalves on the farm bill or something like that. But what are we doing \nhere? Taking an amendment that doesn't belong here and saying rural \nwomen are going to be picked on. That is what they are doing. I am just \nin disbelief that this is even before us. I hope we have a very strong \n``no'' vote and put this baby to bed, because this comes up again and \nagain.\n\n  As I say, in my own State, I have met with parents who are just at \ntheir wits' end because of this travesty and they have a one-size-fits-\nall cap. I have met with parents whose child was born, there was \nmalpractice, and the child is blind, the child is deaf, the child is \nsitting in a wheelchair. The mother and the father love that child. \nThey are driven into poverty because the insurance will cover just so \nmuch.\n  We say we are for families? How can we say we are for families and \nmean it and then tell the women of rural America: Too bad, you cannot \nget what you deserve if a doctor makes a tragic--indeed, an \nunbelievably tragic--mistake. You have to care for a child for the rest \nof that child's life in the most loving way you can, but we are going \nto put a cap on what you are going to be able to spend on that child.\n  This is not the America I know. This is not a farm bill that should \nbe turned into tort reform, some ideological quest by some of our \ncolleagues. This is not an attack on lawyers; this is an attack on \nwomen.\n  I thank you for the opportunity to speak against this amendment, and \nI am looking forward to voting against it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time be equally divided until we go to the \nnext speaker.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the \namendment that is pending because I do believe that if we can have some \nmalpractice reform, we can get more OB/GYN doctors, pediatricians, and \ndoctors in general, in our rural areas.\n  As I travel in my State, I hear the complaints, and have for the last \nnumber of years, about lack of health care in our rural areas. It is \none of our largest issues in this country today. I want to talk a \nlittle bit about our situation in Texas because the amendment before us \nis modeled somewhat on the law that did provide medical malpractice \nreform in Texas.\n  Before 2003, according to the Texas Department of Health, 158 \ncounties had no obstetricians, 24 counties had no primary care \nphysicians at all, and 138 counties had no pediatricians. Texas ranked \n48 of the 50 States in physician manpower for our population. Why were \nwe having such trouble? Because the cost of providing health care \nbefore 2003 was unsustainable, largely due to increased litigation \nactivity which drove the medical malpractice insurance rate so high \nthat doctors were being driven out of Texas. In fact, the insurance \ncompanies also left Texas because the claims were so high.\n  In 1991, Texas averaged 13 claims per 100 physicians. By 2000, Texas \naveraged 30 claims per 100 physicians. Of these claims, there was a \ndisproportionate growth in noneconomic damages, damages such as pain \nand suffering. It was this growth, in contrast to awards of economic \ndamages such as lost wages and medical care costs, that really spurred \nthe increase in the medical malpractice premium. In 1991, noneconomic \ndamages averaged 35 percent of total verdicts. By 1999, they averaged \n65 percent. So the noneconomic damages--the pain and suffering \ndamages--really doubled just in that 8-year period, not even taking \ninto account the economic damages, which are certainly warranted \ndamages when there is any kind of malpractice.\n  From 1999 to 2003, the average malpractice premium increase in Texas \nwas almost 74 percent. The Texas Medical Liability Trust, which covered \nabout one-third of the State's doctors in 2003, increased rates by \n147.6 percent between 1999 and 2003. We are talking 4 years. In the Rio \nGrande Valley, physicians in general surgery and OB/GYN practices \nranked sixth and seventh in the Nation for the highest premiums in \n2002. The impact of litigation on Texas's health care system was \nundeniable and unsustainable.\n  Medical liability reform came about in 2003. There were bold changes \nin the tort system in an attempt to restore access to care. We have \nseen a dramatic change.\n\n[[Page S15194]]\n\n  According to the Texas Medical Board, physician applications for \nState licensure have doubled from 2003 to 2007. The Texas Medical Board \nreports that since passing liability reform in Texas, Texas has \nexperienced a gain of 195 OB/GYNs, 505 pediatricians, 169 orthopedic \nsurgeons, 554 anesthesiologists, 36 neurosurgeons, 497 emergency \nmedicine physicians, and 37 pediatric cardiologists. Prior to reform, \nTexas had five liability carriers. Since reform, Texas has added 3 new \nrate-regulated carriers and 13 new unregulated insurers. The five \nlargest insurers announced rate cuts in 2005, with an average premium \nreduction of 11.7 percent. These reductions produced $48 million in \nannual premium savings.\n  Medical liability reform does work. We have attempted, on the floor \nof the Senate, for many years to have a national medical liability \nreform, even just focusing it on OB/GYN doctors and emergency room \ndoctors because there are shortages all over the country of these kinds \nof services. There are shortages of physicians who are willing and able \nto perform these services because of the high medical malpractice \ninsurance rates.\n  Everyone in our country, and certainly in the Senate, wants to make \nsure that if there is a medical error that causes an injury to a baby, \nto a mother, to anyone who is getting health care, certainly there \nshould be penalties. There should be payment for economic damages. \nThere should be payment for loss of wages and payment for pain and \nsuffering. But if you have lawsuits where the pain and suffering start \ndriving it rather than the economic damages and it starts to encroach \non the ability of doctors, even if they have a clean record, to afford \nthe rise in liability premiums, then I think we have to take a look.\n  It is particularly acute in our rural areas, where we have so many \nfarmers, which is, I am sure, why Senator Gregg brought forward this \namendment. I think it would be a great amendment to the farm bill to \nprovide better access to health care for our farmers in this country. \nThat is why, I am sure, Senator Gregg chose this bill, because we have \nnot had the opportunity to address medical malpractice reform since we \nmade the attempt last year in the Senate, which was utterly \nunsuccessful, to be honest.\n  Because the problem has gotten worse in many States and because the \nrecord in Texas after medical liability reform has caused so much \nbetter care, more access to care, and more satisfaction with care in \nTexas since the reform, I would like to see that model able to be \nreproduced around our country and especially in our rural areas, which \nis the subject of the bill before us today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment offered by Senator \nGregg, among others. It is certainly not within the jurisdiction of the \nSenate Agriculture Committee, on which I have the honor to serve, but \nis within the jurisdiction of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which I \nhave the honor to chair. It is something that should be looked at \nthere. It would be like putting a Defense amendment on the Agriculture \nbill.\n  But far worse than just the question of where the jurisdiction is and \nwhy this amendment makes no sense here, it would limit the legal rights \nof what rural women and children are eligible to receive when they are \nseverely injured in our health care system. It does not provide \nprotection for rural women and children. In fact, it leads to a lower \nstandard of care by treating them differently than all other patients \nin the country. I am certainly not going to vote for something like \nthis and go home to my State, which is a very rural State, and tell the \nwomen and children: I voted to make you a second-class citizen. The \namendment will overturn our State laws regarding the statute of \nlimitations. It would limit the legal rights of our most vulnerable \ncitizens.\n  I am always surprised at the other side when I hear, depending on \nwhat the issues are: We have to protect the States. We have to protect \nour State laws. We can't have the Federal Government trample on the \nState laws. However, if it is something the major insurers want: Of \ncourse we will override State laws concerning the statute of \nlimitations, we will limit the legal rights of our most vulnerable \ncitizens.\n  Nothing remotely related to this novel legal treatment of severely \ninjured rural women or children has even been debated or discussed in \nthe Judiciary Committee. I suspect because nobody would take it \nseriously if you said we have to protect insurance companies, so we \nhave to cut the legs out from under rural women and children.\n  The amendment does nothing to protect rural victims of medical \nmalpractice. It does nothing to prevent the serious injuries of \nmalpractice in the first place. Caps on damages, such as the one in the \npending amendment, would arbitrarily limit the compensation that the \nmost seriously injured patients are able to receive. This says nothing \nof what it does to State legislators, which is trample State \nlegislators by telling them that an amendment debated for a matter of \nminutes on the floor, in our judgment, is so much better than the laws \nof your State.\n  The central truth of the troubles of malpractice insurance is that it \nis a problem in the insurance system and industry, not in the tort \nsystem. High malpractice insurance premiums are not the direct result \nof malpractice lawsuit verdicts. There have been enough studies to \nprove that conclusively. Rather, they are the result of investment \ndecisions by the insurance companies that resulted in business models \ngeared to ever-increasing profits, as well as the cyclical hardening of \nthe liability insurance market.\n  Instead of blaming lawyers or, worse yet, blaming the victims of \nmedical malpractice, we should look at the special treatment Federal \nlaw currently bestows on the insurance industry. They have a blanket \nexemption from Federal antitrust laws. Most people don't realize that. \nWe assume the law applies to everybody in this country, but antitrust \nlaws do not apply to these insurance companies.\n  Our antitrust laws for everybody else are the beacon of good \ncompetition practice, and when our antitrust laws are followed, \nconsumers benefit. How? They get lower prices, they get more choices, \nand they invariably get better services. But when the insurance \nindustry operates outside of the structure of antitrust laws, and they \ndo not have to face any competition, then they are allowed to collude \nand they can set rates. When they do, our health care system, our \nphysicians and our patients all suffer.\n  Earlier this year I introduced the bipartisan Insurance Industry \nCompetition Act, S. 618, along with Senators Specter and Lott and Reid \nand Landrieu. It would assure that malpractice insurers and others \ncould not artificially raise premiums and reduce benefits through \ncollusion. This is a responsible solution to ensure competitive \npricing--putting the burden on rural victims of medical malpractice is \nnot.\n  If you were to try to put the burden on the rural victims, the women \nand children of rural America, for somebody else's medical malpractice, \nthat is not the way to solve the problems.\n  Arbitrarily capping damages available to rural women and children \ndoes nothing to solve the flawed medical malpractice insurance market. \nIt is a boon to companies that operate outside the antitrust system and \ncan collude to set rates anywhere they want.\n  I would suggest we do a thoughtful, collaborative consideration in \nthe Judiciary Committee where this discussion belongs, get a sensible \nsolution that is fair to patients and can support those in our medical \nprofession who want to practice quality health care.\n  This partisan amendment does not do this. It is not designed for a \ncreative solution to a serious problem. Anyone who wants to vote for \nit, I hope they are prepared to go home and tell their State \nlegislature: We walked all over you in hobnailed boots, you are \nirrelevant, we are the Senate. One hundred people here know far better \nthan the legislatures in all your States.\n  That is not the way to do it. That is not the way to bring things \nabout. So if you want real consideration of this, let's do it along \nwith raising the issues of why should the insurance companies be able \nto collude, why should they be outside the antitrust laws, why should \nthey be able to meet behind closed doors and do whatever they want to \nset our rates? That is what I ask.\n\n[[Page S15195]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Gregg's \namendment. This is a frustrating issue because there are many factors \nthat contribute to the lack of physicians who serve rural areas of \nAmerica. We cannot escape the fact that rural areas of America are hard \nhit by this, especially by a critical lack of OB/GYN physicians.\n  We have an opportunity to try to address that problem. The cost of \nproviding service in those areas is disproportionately high, in large \nmeasure, because of the cost of our liability system.\n  We can argue what the best way is to address the cost of the \nliability system. It might be easy to blame insurance companies, but \nthere is no question we ought to look for commonsense approaches to \ndeal with this problem; otherwise, we are not going to increase the \ncoverage and the number of physicians who are practicing in rural \nAmerica.\n  We have heard about the impact of State regulation from Senator \nHutchison, who spoke about her experience and her State's experience. \nMany States have taken action to put commonsense controls in place on \nthe overall cost of the liability system, by not limiting physical or \neconomic damages for those who are harmed in malpractice cases, but by \nsimply putting commonsense limits on noneconomic damages.\n  There are many States that have taken this approach, and it is \nimportant to note this amendment would not affect those States that \nhave enacted their own set of laws. This amendment targets States that \nhave made no attempts to address the problem. It targets rural areas of \nthe country where it is most needed, to help those rural areas get \nbetter access, better service, to OB/GYN physicians.\n  While it may be frustrating, as Senator Leahy noted, to see an \ninsurance company that has made a bad investment decision--I am not \nhappy about that, he is not happy about that, that it might have an \nimpact on insurance costs--it is far worse to look at a rural part of \nAmerica, a rural county, a rural city, a rural town, that has no access \nto the health care physician services it needs because of spiraling \nliability costs in the system.\n  I think this amendment is a good-faith effort to begin to address \nthat problem.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3822\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to take another moment to address a second \namendment Senator Gregg has offered. It is amendment No. 3822.\n  Mr. President, in the last few days, the morning temperature in \nManchester, NH, has been about 8 degrees; home heating oil costs are \n$3.27 per gallon. These are simply the cold, hard facts of winter in \nNew England, 8 degrees and $3.27 per gallon.\n  As we continue debate this week on a comprehensive energy bill, I \nhope we keep those numbers in mind. I hope we take a hard look at \nprograms such as LIHEAP, low-income fuel assistance, that can make a \ndifference for families in New Hampshire and across the country.\n  The Federal Government has limited power to have an immediate impact \non energy prices, whether it is a gallon of oil or a gallon of heating \noil or natural gas that might heat hospitals. Congress is in a poor \nposition to have an affect on the laws of supply and demand, but we can \nhelp those who are most in need during a tough, cold winter; that \nprogram, as I indicated, is LIHEAP.\n  Simply put, LIHEAP funding works. It is administered by the States \nand local agencies that know and understand the people who need the \nassistance, and they deliver it in a very effective way. Congress \npassed the precursor bill to LIHEAP back in 1980, and in 2006, we \nallocated over $3 billion for LIHEAP.\n  Last year, under the continuing resolution, LIHEAP funding was \nroughly $1 billion less, and, unfortunately, the Department of Health \nand Human Services has only been able to release 75 percent of each \nState's allocation.\n  I know the Presiding Officer, Senator Sanders from Vermont, has \nworked on this issue. We signed letters together in the past, letters \naddressed to President Clinton, letters addressed to President Bush, \nletters addressed to conferees and appropriators.\n  Now we have in front of us an amendment offered by Senator Gregg, and \none offered by Senator Sanders as well, that would try to address the \nproblem by adding to this farm bill nearly $1 billion in additional \nfunds for LIHEAP.\n  If we look at some of the unnecessary funding in this farm bill, it \nbecomes clear to Americans that we absolutely have the resources and \nthe capacity to make those allocations under the current budget \nframework.\n  I am pleased to join Senator Gregg as a cosponsor to his amendment \nthat would appropriately fund this program. This has been a bipartisan \nissue, both in the House and in the Senate. I have worked with \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to make this kind of funding a \nreality, and I think it is a tribute to LIHEAP that the program has \nbeen able to maintain bipartisan support through the years.\n  We are pursuing a number of different ways to add these critical \nLIHEAP funds to this farm bill, as well as any appropriations \nlegislation we consider in the coming week, and, quite frankly, the \npeople at home do not care how we go about it. They understand it has \nbeen awfully cold in New England the past week, and heating oil still \ncosts well over $3 per gallon.\n  We need to get the job done. I am pleased to support the amendment \nand I hope it is adopted by my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the rural \naccess to care amendment sponsored by Senator Gregg. It is amazing in a \nState such as New Hampshire, that could not be more different than the \nState I reside in, Tennessee, that we have a very similar problem.\n  I commend his efforts on this agriculture bill, one that affects so \nmuch of rural America, to, in a very surgical and thoughtful way, deal \nwith the issue of access to care.\n  As you might imagine, I spent an inordinate amount of time, in the 2 \nyears prior to being here, in all 95 counties in my State. What was \nmost stunning was to see the statistics and talk to young women as it \nrelated to their access to obstetrical care.\n  The fact is we have 91 of 95 counties in our State that are \nconsidered to be rural counties. The number of OBs in those rural \ncounties from 1997 to the year 2003 dropped from 179 OBs to 103 during \nthat period of time.\n  In our State, more than 30 of our 95 counties have very inadequate \naccess to obstetrical care. In 15 of those counties, we have no \nobstetrical access. I know the Senator from Vermont, the senior \nSenator, talked a little bit about the insurance companies and the role \nthey have played. I respect greatly his views and certainly his \nknowledge on this subject.\n  But what I found was this: We have young mothers-to-be in our State \nwho lack the ability to access OB care because of the fact that \nmalpractice insurance costs so much in that particular field of care, \nand, therefore, they have been driven out, if you will, of the rural \ncounties in the State of Tennessee.\n  The fact is this amendment only focuses on rural counties. It only \nfocuses on OB care. It does not in any way affect those States that \nhave chosen to go ahead and address this issue themselves. I wish to \napplaud him in being so thoughtful and so surgical in his approach to \nthis very pressing issue that, if you will, pits these young mothers-\nto-be against those who are against any kind of malpractice caps.\n  The fact is this only addresses noneconomic damages. It does not in \nany way affect economic damages. It does not keep families from getting \nthe most complete care necessary if something bad were to happen. I \nfully support this. I wish to thank Senator Gregg for offering this \namendment. I urge my colleagues to support it also.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator would suspend, I wish to ask how much time \nis remaining on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 36 minutes 48 seconds, the \nminority has 20 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I assume in a quorum call the time is taken from both?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Only by consent.\n\n[[Page S15196]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the quorum call is put in now, might I ask the Chair \nto whom does the time run against?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is charged to the Senator who makes the \nsuggestion there is an absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I think it is only fair to ask unanimous \nconsent any time under this quorum call be equally allocated to both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We have a little over half an hour of time left on this \nside, about 20 minutes on the other side on this amendment. For those \nSenators, this is the medical malpractice amendment by Senator Gregg \nfrom New Hampshire. By consent, we had 2 hours of debate. The clock is \nrunning. If any Senators wish to speak on this amendment, they better \nhurry over here.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Gregg amendment \nNo. 3673. He has entitled this amendment the Healthy Mothers and \nHealthy Babies Rural Access to Care Act. The reason it is called \n``rural access to care'' is so he can fit it into the farm bill because \nit doesn't have much, if anything, to do with the farm bill. It is a \nbill related to medical malpractice. It is an issue which Senator Gregg \ndutifully brings before the Senate as often as possible. I respect him \nfor his point of view. I disagree with his point of view. But I think \nit must be clear to those who are following the debate what is involved \nin this bill and this amendment.\n  This is a farm bill that comes up once every 5 years. Senators Harkin \nand Chambliss have worked hard to put together a bill dealing with \nfarmers and ranchers, nutrition programs, so many other items. Some on \nthe Republican side of the aisle have insisted that is not enough. They \nwant to bring in a lot of unrelated issues and debate them on the farm \nbill. They were given permission to do so, and Senator Gregg has done \njust that.\n  This amendment is important to understand. What Senator Gregg is \nsaying is, there is one class of people in America who will be limited \nif they are victims of medical malpractice. This class of people in \nAmerica who will be limited in recovering for the damages sustained by \nthem and their family, this class of people that will be limited are \nthe women of America. Women of America will be the only ones limited in \nrecovering in court if they or their children are injured in \nchildbirth. What is the justice in that? No limitations on men for \nprostate surgery but limitations on women delivering babies? I don't \nunderstand his logic, and I don't think anyone, particularly if they \nhappen to be a woman, can understand why he decided to single out women \nin America and restrict their recovery in court if they are innocent \nvictims of medical malpractice. That is what he does.\n  The Senator argues that we have to address the high cost of medical \nliability insurance and the risk of being sued. That is the reason he \nwants to limit the right of women in America to go into a courtroom and \nargue they were either hurt or their children were hurt or killed in \nthe course of childbirth.\n  He claims his amendment will help ensure that rural women don't have \nto drive long distances to see a ``baby doctor.'' But it is \ninteresting, this amendment is patterned after a Texas law that did not \nbring more baby doctors to rural areas. I am sure the Senator from \nTexas, who will speak after me, will address this.\n  In 2003, Texas passed its law. At the time it passed, there were 152 \ncounties in that State without an obstetrician, no doctor to deliver a \nbaby. Today, 4 years after the passage of this Texas law limiting the \nright of recovery for women who were injured as a result of \nmalpractice, the number has not changed. In Texas, 152 counties still \nhave no obstetrician.\n  The fact that some counties don't have an obstetrician may not be as \nmuch about medical malpractice premiums as it is about population. \nAccording to the American Medical Association, the number of OB/GYNs \nnationwide has risen from around 39,000 in the year 2000 to over 41,000 \nin 2004. So there are more obstetricians practicing. But that hasn't \nchanged the circumstances in rural Texas because the doctors who are \npracticing medicine involving the delivery of babies are practicing in \ncities and suburbs. The Gregg amendment doesn't even address that \nreality.\n  Supporters of proposals such as the Gregg amendment like to argue \nthat escalating malpractice premiums justify their effort to limit the \nright of patients who have been injured to seek compensation. We have \nhad this argument before over several years. There is no doubt about \nit--and I don't argue--medical malpractice premiums went up \ndramatically. But as so many States have addressed this issue, we have \nseen a change.\n  During the third quarter of 2003, malpractice premiums were 28 \npercent higher than the year before. But by 2004, malpractice premiums \nincreased only 6 percent. In 2005, they did not increase at all. In \n2006, they actually dropped 1 percent. In 2007, they dropped 3 percent. \nMalpractice premiums are going down. Yet Senator Gregg or another of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle dutifully offers this \namendment or some variation of it every year without acknowledging the \nreal changes taking place.\n  Despite all the talk about frivolous lawsuits being filed against \nmedical professionals, medical malpractice payments by insurance \ncompanies have remained steady when adjusted for medical inflation. And \nthe number of paid medical malpractice claims per physician in America \nhas actually declined. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the \nnumber of paid malpractice claims for every 1,000 physicians decreased \nfrom 25.2 in 1991 to 18.8 in 2003.\n  Malpractice premiums are going down. The number of claims being filed \nper physician is declining. The number of paid malpractice claims is \ngoing down significantly.\n  But even if malpractice premiums were still going up--which is not \nthe case--the Gregg amendment does not require insurance companies to \nlower them. The Gregg amendment says: We will deny to women the \nopportunity to recover in court for injuries to them or their babies, \nand we are hoping the insurance companies will show mercy and reduce \npremiums as a result. There is no linkage between the Gregg amendment \nand actually bringing down malpractice premiums.\n  This amendment limits the damages that can be recovered by victims. \nKeep in mind, these are victims who have legitimate claims in court. \nThey are the ones Senator Gregg would deny recovery for the actual \ndamages they have incurred.\n  Now, I will concede he allows some damages to be incurred--medical \nbills and the like. But he will even, I think, acknowledge there is a \nlimitation on noneconomic damages of, I think--I read quickly through \nthis--I think in this year's version it is $250,000.\n  Now, if we want to turn this farm bill into a discussion on health \ncare, the issue we should be focusing on is one I think we all agree \nhas to be taken seriously. It is patient safety, medical errors. Dr. \nCarolyn Clancy, director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality, has called medical errors by doctors and hospitals ``a \nnational problem of epidemic proportions.''\n  Senator Gregg's amendment does not address this. He does not address \none of the causes of injuries to innocent patients who go to a doctor \nfor what are supposed to be routine medical procedures and have a very \nbad result. He does not address the medical errors that trigger medical \nmalpractice lawsuits.\n  A far-reaching study of the extent and cost of medical errors in our \nhospitals was published in the Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation in 2003. The authors of the study analyzed 7.45 million \nrecords from about 20 percent of U.S. hospitals.\n  They found that injuries in U.S. hospitals in the year 2000--just 1 \nyear--led to approximately 32,600 deaths, 2.4 million extra days of \npatient hospitalization, and additional costs of 9.3 billion. That did \nnot include adverse drug reactions or malfunctioning medical devices.\n\n[[Page S15197]]\n\n  The authors concluded that medical injuries in hospitals ``pose a \nsignificant threat to patients and incur substantial costs to \nsociety.''\n  What does the Gregg amendment do about patient safety and medical \nerrors? Nothing.\n  Here is what it does. It applies an arbitrary one-size-fits-all cap \non noneconomic damages in malpractice cases won by the patients. What \nare noneconomic damages? Pain and suffering, disfigurement, physical \nimpairment, and scarring. How do you put a price on that?\n  If a person is going to be incontinent for the rest of their life, if \nthey are scarred in the face or another part of their body, if they are \nin pain and unable to function, is that worth something? In the mind of \nSenator Gregg, it is only worth $250,000--no matter what. That is it. \nIf your pain is going to be with you for a year, 5 years, 10 years, or \n20 years--the same amount, $250,000.\n  It would reduce the statute of limitations within which an injured \npatient can bring a lawsuit. It is more restrictive than the majority \nof the States in the Union, cutting off claims for injuries or \ndiseases. If you do not file the claim on time, Senator Gregg says: \nSorry. Bad luck. Sorry that this poor woman is not going to have a \nchance to recover, but that is the price she is going to have to pay \nfor his reform.\n  It would allow a reduction of damage awards because of other health \nor accident insurance the patient might have. Imagine for a minute that \nyou have been wise enough, thoughtful enough, to buy health insurance \nto cover yourself and your family. Your wife goes in to deliver a baby. \nThe doctor makes a serious error. The wife is injured. The baby is \ninjured, and the baby dies.\n  Now there are medical bills. Well, it turns out you had health \ninsurance. According to Senator Gregg, we should give to the offending \ndoctor or hospital credit for your wisdom in buying health insurance. \nIn other words, they do not pay for the medical bills if you paid for \nthem yourself through your own health insurance. Does that make sense? \nIs that fair that the hospital or doctor guilty of malpractice would \nprofit because the victim had health insurance?\n  His amendment makes it harder for patients to pursue punitive \ndamages, and it would limit how much can be awarded--even when a \nwrongdoer is found to have acted with malicious intent.\n  His amendment would allow insurers to string out damage payments over \na long period of time, meaning the insurers could keep the interest on \nthat money for themselves.\n  It would preempt State laws on lots of issues, including whether \npatients' insurance coverage affects payments, how soon victims are \ncompensated, and, of course, statutes of limitations.\n  The amendment only applies to lawsuits involving OB/GYNs in rural \nareas. Women living in rural areas are the ones on whom Senator Gregg \nhas focused. They are the only group of Americans he wants to deny an \nopportunity in court for full compensation for their damages. I am sure \nthe women of America will be grateful. I do not think, if they read \nthis bill closely, they will believe it is fair or just. I do not.\n\n  Why would we want to treat rural mothers differently than those \nliving in the suburbs or cities? This amendment is the wrong solution \nto the wrong problem on the wrong bill. Congress should not decide what \ninjured patients should receive. We have a system called a justice \nsystem. We have judges, and we take an average group of people in \nAmerica--your neighbors and friends--11 or 12, and they sit in the jury \nbox to listen to the deliberations and decide what is fair.\n  I think that system has worked pretty well. And over the years, we \nhave said we will allow the States to write the laws about how these \nlawsuits will be conducted. Over the years, there have been problems \nwith malpractice premiums, problems with patient safety, and the States \nhave responded to it, including my State of Illinois, by changing State \nlaw. I believe the majority of States have already changed their \nmalpractice statutes.\n  That is the proper and appropriate way to approach this issue. \nSenator Gregg wants to federalize this. He wants to make it a Federal \nmatter. He wants Congress to preempt the decisions of the States, and \nhe wants his law to preempt the decisions of a jury. He believes his \nwisdom on what a person should be entitled to recover in a lawsuit \nshould be trumping the wisdom of a judge and a jury.\n  I guess I have more trust in those judges and juries. They do not \nalways come in and award for the plaintiff. Before I came to Congress, \nI used to handle these lawsuits. I spent a number of years defending \ndoctors and hospitals, and a number of years suing them for medical \nmalpractice.\n  They talk about frivolous lawsuits. I want to tell you, we fought \nlong and hard before we took a case in my office involving medical \nmalpractice. They are complicated and expensive and went on for a long \ntime. I was not going to take a case that I did not think I could win. \nIt was not fair to the doctor. It was not fair to the plaintiff. It \nsure was not fair to my family and my law practice. So we did not file \nanything we knew to be frivolous, just to make noise. We made a point \nof not doing that.\n  In this situation, for Senator Gregg to decide that a class of \nAmericans--women in rural areas--are going to be denied their recovery \nin court, they are going to be treated differently--well, certainly \nthis is a worthy topic for the Judiciary Committee and others to debate \nat some time about patient errors and medical safety, about malpractice \nand premiums. But to do it on a farm bill?\n  We just had a debate earlier about how much money we are going to \ngive to people who grow asparagus. Yes, that was one of the amendments. \nNow we switch from that issue to a question about whether a mother who \nis giving birth to a child--where the doctor does not show up on time \nor does the wrong thing and the child is injured or dies--whether that \nmother can go to a court and receive compensation.\n  I think this is an amendment that should be defeated. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in voting against this amendment--to join me in \nsupporting the basic concept that the States have been the source of \nstatutory regulation of medical malpractice claims, to join me in \nsaying it is not fair to pick out one class of people in America--in \nthis case women living in rural areas--and to say they cannot have \ntheir day in court, to join me in saying we should be working together \nto reduce medical errors and make it safer to go to a hospital, make it \nsafer to go to a doctor.\n  I respect the medical profession. I cannot tell you how many times in \nmy life I have relied on a doctor or a hospital for care for a member \nof my family and was thanking God every moment that they were as good \nas they are, doing as much work as they do, having studied as hard as \nthey did. But, please, this is a piece of legislation proposed by \nSenator Gregg which has not been thought through. It is not fair. It is \nnot fair to the women who would be discriminated against by this \nlegislation. It certainly is not fair to their families if a tragic \nconsequence of medical malpractice means that a baby or a mother is \ngoing to be disfigured, face pain and suffering for a lifetime, to say \nthat no matter how long it goes, no matter what happens, we cannot \nallow them more than $250,000.\n  That, to me, is unreasonable. It is unfair. And it has no place on \nthis bill. I urge my colleagues to defeat the Gregg amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to the senior \nSenator from New Hampshire for bringing this important amendment to the \nSenate floor.\n  We just heard from the distinguished assistant majority leader, who \nis one of the best lawyers we have in the Senate. But I want to offer a \ndifferent perspective; that is, it does not do pregnant women a lot of \ngood to be able to sue for unlimited damages if they are injured in a \nmedical liability case if they cannot find a doctor to take their case \nor to deliver their baby.\n  Really, what this amendment goes to is, how do we increase access to \nhealth care and how do we deal in an area where I know there have been \ncomplaints that it only addresses pregnant women and their ability to \nfind doctors? The fact is, if we could get agreement on the other side \nof the aisle, I think this should be extended to cover\n\n[[Page S15198]]\n\nall doctors and hospitals and all types of cases.\n  But, as the Senators know, there are issues of germaneness that mean \nthere is only a limited ability to deal with a part of the universe of \nthe problem, and that is why Senator Gregg has offered this \nlegislation--which is called Healthy Mothers Access to Rural Care--on \nthis particular bill.\n  This legislation, as Senator Durbin noted, is modeled after recent \nreform efforts that have taken place in my State, my home State of \nTexas. I would like to talk a little bit about the dramatic \nimprovements in access to care that this commonsense legislation has \nprovided.\n  This is the subject of an interesting story in the New York Times, \ndated October 5, 2007. The title of the story--apropos of my comments a \nmoment ago--is ``More Doctors in Texas After Malpractice Caps.''\n  I would say to the distinguished Senator from Illinois, this is not \nabout denying people access to the courts and recovery. There is \nunlimited ability to sue for and recover economic losses as a result of \na medical liability incident. But it does place reasonable caps on \nnoneconomic losses, specifically pain and suffering.\n  The good news is, we do not have to guess as to whether this approach \nworks. We know because it has worked in that laboratory of democracy \nknown as the great State of Texas.\n  As I mentioned, this article highlights some of the successes of this \nlegislation passed a few short years ago in Texas. For example, it \nsays:\n\n       In Texas, it can be a long wait for a doctor: up to six \n     months.\n       [But] that is not for an appointment. That is the time it \n     can take the Texas Medical Board to process applications to \n     practice.\n\n  In other words, there have been so many doctors moving to Texas who \nwant to get a Texas medical license because of these reforms that the \nnumber of doctors has increased dramatically, and, thus, access to care \nhas increased dramatically throughout the State.\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       Four years after Texas voters approved a constitutional \n     amendment limiting awards in medical malpractice lawsuits, \n     doctors are responding as supporters predicted, arriving from \n     all parts of the country to swell the ranks of specialists at \n     Texas hospitals and bring professional health care to some \n     long-underserved rural areas.\n\n  This is particularly important, as the article says, in high-risk \nspecialties such as obstetrics and gynecology and neurosurgery and \nother areas where it is hard to find doctors to come to practice \nbecause of skyrocketing medical malpractice rates.\n  Well, this reform, in Texas, 4 years ago, and what this amendment \nproposes are specifically designed to deal with those skyrocketing \nmalpractice rates by providing some reasonable limits on recovery for \nnoneconomic damages. It is fallacious to say it denies people access to \nthe courthouse or recovery. It doesn't do that at all. This article \ngoes on to say:\n\n       The influx, raising the State's abysmally low ranking in \n     physicians per capita, has flooded the medical board's \n     offices in Austin with applications for licenses, close to \n     2,000 at last count.\n       It was hard to believe at first; we thought it was a spike,\nsaid Dr. Donald W. Patrick, executive director of the medical board and \na neurosurgeon and lawyer. But Dr. Patrick said the trend--licenses up \n18 percent since 2003--has held, with an even sharper jump of 30 \npercent in the last fiscal year, compared with the year before.\n\n  The article continues to talk about the experience of a pediatric \nneurosurgeon--a high-risk specialty:\n\n       Dr. Timothy George, 47, a pediatric neurosurgeon, credits \n     the measure in part with attracting him and his long sought-\n     after specialty last year to Austin from North Carolina. \n     ``Texas,'' he said, ``made it easier to practice and easier \n     to take care of complex patients.''\n\n  Why would we want to make sure there are more pediatric neurosurgeons \nor specialists with that kind of ability and training and skills, to \nmake that available to more children who need that skill? That is what \nthis amendment would provide.\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       The increases in doctors--double the rate of the population \n     increase--has raised the state's ranking in physicians per \n     capita to 42nd--\n\n  Up from 48th in 2001--\n\n     according to the American Medical Association. It is most \n     likely considerably higher now, according to the medical \n     association, which takes two years to compile the standings.\n       The Texas Medical Board reports licensing--\n\n  More than 10,000 new physicians since 2003, up from roughly 8,000--\n\n     in the prior 4 years. It issued a record 980 medical licenses \n     at its last meeting in August, raising the number of doctors \n     in Texas to 44--\n\n  Almost 45,000--\n\n     with a backlog of nearly 2,500 applications.\n\n  It is another example of people voting with their feet when we allow \nconditions to exist that allow doctors to practice their profession in \na reasonable environment rather than appear as a victim of the \nlitigation lottery. They are going to come, and more doctors--more \nhigh-risk specialties mean more patients are going to get access to the \nkind of health care they need.\n  We know the opponents of some of this have basically said: Well, \npeople are going to be hurt if you limit noneconomic caps. The fact is \nthe people who are going to be hurt are the patients who are not going \nto be able to get the doctors. Of course, we can't forget our friends, \nthe trial lawyers, who usually take 40 to 50 percent of every award in \na medical malpractice case. I submit that is part of the resistance we \nhave here, because trial lawyers who specialize in these kinds of cases \ndon't want to get hit in the pocketbook. They don't care as much about \naccess to health care as they do their own pocketbook.\n\n       In some medical specialties--\n\n  This article goes on to say--\n\n     the gains have been especially striking.\n\n  For example, an increase of 186 obstetricians, 153 orthopedic \nsurgeons, and 26 neurosurgeons.\n  This is the reason why physicians and health care providers have \nfound it a better place to practice their profession and why access to \ncare has increased as a result.\n  This article goes on to say there was an average 21.3 percent drop in \nmedical malpractice insurance premiums, not counting rebates for \nrenewal.\n  Justice requires that we embrace a national reform, particularly in \nlight of the fact that the American taxpayer, the Federal taxpayer, \npays roughly 50 percent of every health care dollar in America today. \nThis is no longer an isolated issue that can be handled or should be \nhandled State by State. We ought to look at the reality, and that is \nthat we need a Federal and national solution too. We are doing fine in \nTexas because we passed this reform 4 years ago. But shouldn't we make \nsure that more Americans--particularly more pregnant women--have \ngreater access to health care as a result of this commonsense reform?\n  As a matter of principle, those who have been wrongly injured deserve \ntheir day in court. No one is suggesting we ought to close or bar the \ncourthouse door. If a doctor is at fault, he or she should be held \nfully accountable. But we should also at the same time take care not to \ndestroy our health care system in order to protect unlimited damages \nand the lawyers who bring those lawsuits.\n  The Texas approach has proven successful. This bill would simply give \nthe same boost to all Americans, particularly those most in need--\nparticularly rural patients and more particularly pregnant women who \nneed access to an obstetrician and gynecologist to take care of their \nbaby. It would be a shame if our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle continue to block, as they have done time and time again, \ncommonsense reform legislation that is guaranteed and proven to give \ngreater access to health care and doctors and to make sure all \nAmericans have access to the best health care possible.\n  I urge all of our colleagues to stand up for better access to rural \nhealth care, particularly in obstetrics and gynecology, by passing this \nimportant amendment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wanted to speak for a few minutes on the \nGregg amendment simply because I have unique personal experience with \nit. I am now somewhere close or over having delivered 4,000 children. \nThe last one was an 8 pound, 9 ounce healthy baby, no problems that we \nknow of. I also just signed a check to pay for my malpractice \ninsurance,\n\n[[Page S15199]]\n\nwhich next year will come to about $3,000 per baby I deliver--$3,000 \nper baby, per case. Now, that is excessive because I don't deliver that \nmany babies anymore. But on average, it is $300 to $400 to $500 for \nevery baby that is delivered in this country in terms of malpractice \ninsurance.\n  Why is it important to fix this problem, not just for OB/GYNs but for \nall doctors? Well, there are a couple of reasons. The cost of defensive \nmedicine today on the basis of the litigious aspect of medical \nmalpractice causes us to spend $600 per person per year on tests nobody \nneeds, except the doctor needs to be able to say he went the extra mile \nin case they get sued. That comes to about $150 billion a year of tests \nthat were ordered. That doesn't include the cost of the malpractice \ninsurance, which the year before last in Oklahoma rose 98 percent--a 1-\nyear rise. There are significant problems with the tort system in \nOklahoma that show the excessive costs. But more importantly, what \nabout the women and children? The heck with the money. What about the \nwomen and children? What happens?\n  Well, we know we are not filling the spots for the OB/GYN residencies \nin this country anymore because you can't afford to pay the loans and \nget a job and earn enough and then pay for your malpractice to be able \nto pay off your loan and make a living. So people are opting not to go \ninto obstetrics and gynecology. Why do they do that and what is the \nresult of that? The result is we have fewer trained specialists to \nactually offer care. Who suffers the most--women in the large cities or \nwomen in the smaller rural cities? The reason this is offered on this \nbill is because it has tremendous direct application to the women who \nlive in rural America. Access is denied. We are now talking an hour, 2-\nhour, 3-hour drives for OB care in Oklahoma because we don't have the \navailable people who will do this service.\n  There are two other points I want to make as we consider this, \nthinking only about the women and children. One is that because of the \ntort system we have, if you are a woman who has a C-section--not \nbecause you can't physically deliver a baby, but because you had a sign \nthat your baby may be in trouble--the next time you come to have a \nbaby, there is an almost 80-percent chance that you could deliver that \nbaby naturally, without having to undergo surgery. But because of the \nlitigious environment, we now have hospitals all across the country \nthat forbid vaginal delivery after cesarean section--not because it is \nthat unsafe but because the risks associated with the procedure in \nterms of the legal consequences make it financially not a risk that \nhospitals want to take, let alone whether the doctor is capable of \ndoing it and managing that patient at all.\n  So what does that mean? It means we expose women to a major surgical \nprocedure, not because they need it but because the trial bar has \nforced them to do it. We are now making decisions not based on medical \nindications; we are making decisions based on legal implications. That \nis the wrong way to practice medicine.\n  Finally, the third point I will make is as we see this shortage of \navailable obstetrical care in the rural areas, we say: We are going to \ngive you care, but then we give you somebody who is great in terms of \ncaring for you, and has some knowledge, and has some capability, but \nisn't a fully trained physician. We give you a nurse-midwife. But if \nyou get in trouble, you are still going to have to have somebody come \nin. Well, what do we know about that? What we know is that time makes a \nsignificant amount of difference when we have a baby in trouble. So \nwhat we are going to do is we are going to continue to increase the \ncosts of complicated deliveries, with children who get injured, when \nthe whole goal of the tort bar in the first place was trying to prevent \nthat, because we don't intercept and we don't interrupt a process that \ncould have made a major difference in that child's life.\n  In my hospital, you can't deliver a baby unless you have the ability \nto do an operative procedure to handle every complication of \nobstetrics. But that is not true around the country anymore because we \nhave decided we are going to do it in a less cost-efficient way.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. On both sides.\n  Mr. COBURN. I am happy with that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. So our point is this: This isn't a perfect bill to be \ntalking about this issue, but it truly has impact to our agricultural \ncommunities. They are the ones who live in the rural areas. What we \nhave done is we have moved away from the ball where we now practice \nlegal medicine, rather than medicine. We are offering a care that is \nnot as good as what it could have been. We are putting women through \nprocedures that they don't have to go through with a tremendous \nincrease in cost, all because we can't say there ought to be some type \nof limitation so we can rebuild the medical structure.\n  If we really believe in women and children, we will grant the same \nequality in the rural areas that we grant around the rest of this \ncountry by making sure they have competent, well-qualified, certified \nobstetricians and gynecologists to take care of them at this great time \nof their life.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from \nMassachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 17 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Madam President, I came over to speak on an extremely important issue \ndealing with the public safety of employer-employee cooperation.\n  First, I listened with interest to our colleagues talk about the \nissues of malpractice and the costs to the health care system. The fact \nis we have had in the Judiciary Committee extensive hearings on this \nissue, and the root cause of the increases are not so much the problems \nwith the doctors and the patients, it is the insurance industry in and \nof itself that has made poor investments. As a result of poor \ninvestments, they have raised the tariff on the various doctors and \ncommunities. This has been well documented. I wish to have material \nprinted at the appropriate place in the Record about these issues. It \nis a serious issue--malpractice insurance--but it is important that we \nfind out the real reasons for that. It does appear to me we are not \ngetting the full story, certainly here on the floor of the Senate this \nafternoon.\n  Today's vote on the Gregg malpractice amendment is a test of the \nSenate's character. In the past, this body has had the courage to \nreject the simplistic and ineffective responses proposed by those who \ncontend that the only way to help doctors is to further hurt seriously \ninjured patients. Unfortunately, as we saw in previous debates on this \nissue, congressional Republicans are again advocating a policy which \nwill benefit neither doctors nor patients, only insurance companies. \nCaps on compensatory damages and other extreme ``tort reforms'' are not \nonly unfair to the victims of malpractice, they do not result in a \nreduction of malpractice insurance premiums.\n  We must not sacrifice the fundamental legal rights of seriously \ninjured patients on the altar of insurance company profits. We must not \nsurrender our most vulnerable citizens--women and newborn babies--to \nthe avarice of these companies. The idea of denying pregnant women \nliving in rural areas the same legal rights as pregnant women living in \nurban areas is truly absurd. It is a transparent gimmick designed to \nmake this amendment appear relevant to a totally unrelated farm bill.\n  This bill contains most of the same unreasonable provisions which \nhave been decisively rejected by a bipartisan majority of the Senate \nmany times before. The only difference is that previous proposals took \nbasic rights away from all patients, while this bill takes those rights \naway only from women and newborn babies who happen to live in rural \ncommunities. That change does not make the legislation more acceptable. \nOn the contrary, it adds a new element of unfairness.\n  This legislation would deprive seriously injured patients of the \nright to recover fair compensation for their injuries by placing \narbitrary caps on\n\n[[Page S15200]]\n\ncompensation for non-economic loss in all obstetrical and gynecological \ncases involving women in rural areas. These caps will hurt patients who \nhave suffered the most severe, life-altering injuries.\n  They are the children who suffered serious brain injuries at birth \nand will never be able to lead normal lives. They are the women who \nlost organs, reproductive capacity, and in some cases even years of \nlife. These are life-altering conditions. It would be terribly wrong to \ntake their rights away. The Republicans talk about deterring frivolous \ncases, but caps by their nature apply only to the most serious cases \nwhich have been proven in court. These badly injured patients are the \nlast ones we should be depriving of fair compensation.\n  A person with a severe injury is not made whole merely by receiving \nreimbursement for medical bills and lost wages. Noneconomic damages \ncompensate victims for the very real, though not easily quantifiable, \nloss in quality of life that results from a serious, permanent injury. \nIt is absurd to suggest that $250,000 is fair compensation for a child \nwho is severely brain injured at birth and, as a result, can never \nparticipate in the normal activities of day to day living; or for a \nwoman who lost her reproductive capacity because of an OB/GYN's \nmalpractice.\n  Caps are totally arbitrary. They do not adjust the amount of the \ncompensation ceiling with either the seriousness of the injury, or with \nthe length of years that the victim must endure the resulting \ndisability. Someone with a less serious injury can be fully compensated \nwithout reaching the cap. However, a patient with severe, permanent \ninjuries is prevented by the cap from receiving full compensation for \ntheir more serious injuries. The person with a life-altering injury may \nonly be permitted to receive a relatively small portion of the \ncompensation to which he or she is entitled.\n  The proponents argue that they are somehow doing these women and \ntheir babies a favor by depriving them of the right to fair \ncompensation when they are seriously injured. It is an Alice in \nWonderland argument which they are making. Under their proposal, a \nwoman in a rural county whose gynecologist negligently failed to \ndiagnose her cervical cancer until it had spread and become incurable \nwould be denied the same legal rights as a man living in the same \ncounty whose doctor negligently failed to diagnose his prostate cancer \nuntil it was too late. Is that fair? By what convoluted logic would \nthat woman be better off? Both the woman and the man were condemned to \nsuffer a painful and premature death as a result of their doctors' \nmalpractice, but her compensation would be severely limited while his \nwould not. She would be denied the right to introduce the same evidence \nof medical negligence which he could. She would be denied the same \nfreedom to select the lawyer of her choice which he had. She would be \ndenied the right to have her case tried under the same judicial rules \nwhich he could. That hardly sounds like equal protection of the law to \nme. Yet that is what the advocates of this legislation are proposing.\n\n  Consider another real world example of how this bill would work. A \nwoman visits her OB/GYN to be treated for infertility. She is given a \nmedication which causes her to experience severe complications. A man \ngoes to his doctor with an infertility problem. His doctor also \nprescribes medication, and he too experiences serious complications. \nBoth suffer permanent injuries as a result, and each sues the \npharmaceutical company which manufactured the two drugs. The woman's \nnoneconomic compensation will be arbitrarily limited to $250,000 no \nmatter how devastating her injuries and she will be unable to recover \npunitive damages even if the court determines that the drug company \nacted ``recklessly.'' In contrast, there will be no legal limitations \non the compensation which the man is able to recover, and he can \nreceive punitive damages if the drug company in his case is found to \nhave acted ``recklessly''. How do the sponsors justify treating two \npatients with similar injuries so differently based solely on their \ngender?\n  Of course, this bill does not only take rights away from women. It \ntakes them away from newborn babies who sustain devastating prenatal or \ndelivery injuries as well. These children face a lifetime with severe \nmental and physical impairments all because of an obstetrician's \nmalpractice or a defective drug or medical device. This legislation \nwould limit the compensation they can receive for lost quality of life \nto $250,000--$250,000 for an entire lifetime. What could be more \nunjust?\n  This is not a better bill because it applies only to patients injured \nby obstetrical and gynecological malpractice. That just makes it even \nmore arbitrary.\n  The entire premise of this bill is both false and offensive. Our \nRepublican colleagues claim that women and their babies in rural areas \nmust sacrifice their fundamental legal rights in order to preserve \naccess to OB/GYN care. The very idea is outrageous. It is based on the \nfalse premise that the availability of OB/GYN physicians depends on the \nenactment of draconian tort reforms. If that were accurate, states that \nhave already enacted damage caps would have a higher number of OB/GYNS \nproviding care. However, there is in fact no correlation. States \nwithout caps actually have 28.2 OB/GYNs per 100,000 women, while states \nwith caps have 27.9 \nOB/GYNs per 100,000 women. No difference.\n  And that is only one of many fallacies in this bill. If the issue is \ntruly access to obstetric and gynecological care, why has this bill \nbeen written to shield from accountability HMOs that deny needed \nmedical care to a woman suffering serious complications with her \npregnancy, a pharmaceutical company that fails to warn of dangerous \nside effects caused by its new fertility drug, and a manufacturer that \nmarkets a contraceptive device which can seriously injure the user. Who \nare the authors of this legislation really trying to protect.\n  In reality, this legislation is designed to shield the entire health \ncare industry from basic accountability for the care it provides to \nwomen and their infant children. It is a stalking horse for broader \nlegislation which would shield them from accountability in all health \ncare decisions involving all patients. While those across the aisle \nlike to talk about doctors, the real beneficiaries will be insurance \ncompanies and large health care corporations. This legislation would \nenrich them at the expense of the most seriously injured patients; \nwomen and children whose entire lives have been devastated by medical \nneglect and corporate abuse.\n\n  In the last few years, the entire nation has been focused on the need \nfor greater corporate accountability. This legislation does just the \nreverse. It would drastically limit the financial responsibility of the \nentire health care industry to compensate injured patients for the harm \nthey have suffered. When will the Republican Party start worrying about \ninjured patients and stop trying to shield big business from the \nconsequences of its wrongdoing? Less accountability will never lead to \nbetter health care.\n  In addition to imposing caps, this legislation would place other \nmajor restrictions on seriously injured patients seeking to recover \nfair compensation. At every stage of the judicial process, it would \nchange long-established judicial rules to disadvantage patients and \nshield defendants from the consequences of their actions.\n  (1) It would abolish joint and several liability for noneconomic \ndamages. This means the most seriously injured people may never receive \nall of the compensation that the court has awarded to them. Under the \namendment, health care providers whose misconduct contributed to the \npatient's injuries will be able to escape responsibility for paying \nfull compensation to that patient. The patient's injuries would not \nhave happened if not for the misconduct of both defendants, so each \ndefendant should be responsible for making sure the victim is fully \ncompensated.\n  (2) The bias in the legislation could not be clearer. It would \npreempt state laws that allow fair treatment for injured patients, but \nwould allow state laws to be enacted which contained greater \nrestrictions on patients' rights than the proposed Federal law. It is \nnot about fairness or balance. It is about protecting defendants who \nprovide negligent care.\n\n[[Page S15201]]\n\n  (3) This bill places extreme restrictions on the right of injured \npatients to present expert testimony to help prove their cases. It \nestablishes arbitrary requirements that would make it virtually \nimpossible to qualify many of the most obviously accomplished medical \nexperts as witnesses. Without the ability to present highly relevant \nexpert testimony, the patient's right to her day in court will in many \ncases be a hollow one.\n  (4) The amendment preempts state statutes of limitation, cutting back \nthe time allowed by many states for a patient to file suit against the \nhealth care provider who injured him. Under the legislation, the \nstatute of limitations can expire before the injured patient even knows \nthat it was malpractice which caused his or her injury.\n  (5) It mandates that providers and insurance companies be permitted \nto pay a judgment in installments rather than all at once. Delaying \npayment amounts to a significant reduction in the award. If the patient \ndoes not receive the money for years, he in reality is getting less \nmoney than the court concluded that he deserved for his injuries.\n  (6) It places severe limitations on when an injured patient can \nreceive punitive damages, and how much punitive damages the victim can \nrecover. This is far more restrictive than current law. It prohibits \npunitive damages for ``reckless'' and ``wanton'' misconduct, which the \noverwhelming majority of States allow.\n  (7) It imposes unprecedented limits on the amount of the contingent \nfee which a client and his or her attorney can agree to. This will make \nit more difficult for injured patients to retain the attorney of their \nchoice in cases that involve complex legal issues. It can have the \neffect of denying them their day in court. Again the provision is one-\nsided, because it places no limit on how much the health care provider \ncan spend defending the case.\n\n  If we were to arbitrarily restrict the rights of seriously injured \npatients as the sponsors of this legislation propose, what benefits \nwould result? Certainly less accountability for health care providers \nwill never improve the quality of health care. It will not even result \nin less costly care. The cost of medical malpractice premiums \nconstitutes less than 1 percent of the Nation's health care \nexpenditures each year. For example, in 2003, health care costs totaled \n$1.5 trillion, while the total cost of all medical malpractice \ninsurance premiums was $8.2 billion. Malpractice premiums are not the \ncause of the high rate of medical inflation.\n  A study by the Institute of Medicine at the National Academy of \nSciences determined that as many as 98,000 patients die in hospitals \neach year as a result of medical errors. That is more than die from \nauto accidents, breast cancer, or AIDS each year. These disturbing \nstatistics make clear that we need more accountability in the health \ncare system, not less. In this era of managed care and cost controls, \nit is ludicrous to suggest that the major problem facing American \nhealth care is ``defensive medicine.'' The problem is not ``too much \nhealth care,'' it is ``too little'' quality health care.\n  Republicans in Congress and other supporters of caps have argued that \nrestricting an injured patient's right to recover fair compensation \nwill reduce malpractice premiums. But, there is scant evidence to \nsupport their claim. In fact, there is substantial evidence to refute \nit.\n  Caps are not only unfair to patients, they are also an ineffective \nway to control medical malpractice premiums. Enacting malpractice caps \nhas not lowered insurance rates in the states that have them. There are \nother much more direct and effective ways to address the cost of \nmedical malpractice insurance that do not hurt patients.\n  The claims regarding the recent malpractice reform in Texas has also \nbeen misleading. Prior to Proposition 12, 152 counties reported having \nno actively practicing OB/GYN doctors and 2 years after implementation, \n152 counties still remain without doctors. In fact, it has not made \ncare available to women residing in rural counties. Even more \ndisturbing, the quality of care has diminished in urban areas and \naccording to the Texas Medical Association, the physician organization \nof the state, the practice of ``defensive medicine'' has not diminished \nand is likely on the rise.\n  If a Federal cap on noneconomic compensatory damages for rural \nobstetrics and gynecological patients were to pass, it would sacrifice \nfair compensation for injured patients in a vain attempt to reduce \nmedical malpractice premiums. Doctors will not get the relief they are \nseeking. Only the insurance companies, which created market \ninstability, will benefit.\n  Doctors and patients are both victims of the insurance industry. \nSpikes in premiums have much more to do with the rate of return on \ninsurance company investments than with what is actually taking place \nin operating rooms or in courtrooms. Excess profits from the boom years \nshould be used to keep premiums stable when investment earnings drop. \nHowever, the insurance industry will never do that voluntarily. Only by \nrecognizing the real problem can we begin to structure an effective \nsolution that will bring an end to unreasonably high medical \nmalpractice premiums.\n  I want to quote from the analysis of Weiss Ratings, Inc., a \nnationally recognized financial analyst conducted an in-depth \nexamination of the impact of capping damages in medical malpractice \ncases. Their conclusions sharply contradict the assumptions on which \nthis legislation is based. Weiss found that capping damages does reduce \nthe amount of money that malpractice insurance companies pay out to \ninjured patients. However, those savings are not passed on to doctors \nin lower premiums. Weiss is not speaking from the perspective of a \ntrial lawyer or a patient advocate, but as a hard-nosed financial \nanalyst that has studied the facts of malpractice insurance rating. \nHere is their recommendation based on those facts:\n\n       First, legislators must immediately put on hold all \n     proposals involving noneconomic damage caps until convincing \n     evidence can be produced to demonstrate a true benefit to \n     doctors in the form of reduced med mal costs. Right now, \n     consumers are being asked to sacrifice not only large damage \n     claims, but also critical leverage to help regulate the \n     medical profession--all with the stated goal that it will end \n     the med mal crisis for doctors. However, the data indicate \n     that, similar state legislation has merely produced the worst \n     of both worlds: The sacrifice by consumers plus a \n     continuing--and even worsening--crisis for doctors. Neither \n     party derived any benefit whatsoever from the caps.\n\n  Unlike the harsh and ineffective proposals in Senator Gregg's \namendment, these are real solutions which will help physicians without \nfurther harming seriously injured patients. Doctors, especially those \nin high risk specialties, whose malpractice premiums have increased \ndramatically over the past few years do deserve premium relief. That \nrelief will only come as the result of tougher regulation of the \ninsurance industry. When insurance companies lose money on their \ninvestments, they should not be able to recover those losses from the \ndoctors they insure. Unfortunately, that is what is happening now.\n  This amendment is not a serious attempt to address a significant \nproblem being faced by physicians in some states. It is the product of \nparty caucus rather than the bipartisan deliberation of a Senate \ncommittee. It was designed to score political points, not to achieve \nthe bipartisan consensus which is needed to enact major legislation. \nFor that reason, it does not deserve to be taken seriously by the \nSenate. It should be soundly rejected.\n  Public safety workers are on the front lines of our efforts to keep \ncommunities in America safe. They are on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a \nweek doing back-breaking, difficult work. They never blink, they never \nfalter. They do their duty and they do it well.\n  When the devastating fires raged in southern California, they battled \nthe blazes. When the I-35 bridge collapsed in Minneapolis, they were \nthe first on the scene. When the massive tragedy hit New York City on \n9/11, their heroic work inspired the Nation and restored our spirit.\n  Just last week in Everett, MA, a tanker truck hauling 10,000 tons of \nfuel suddenly exploded on the highway. Forty cars caught fire.\n  It took more than 3 hours to put out the flames. But because the \npolice, firefighters, and emergency medical technicians responded so \nquickly, no one was killed in the accident. Words cannot begin to \nexpress our gratitude.\n  These heroic men and women have earned our thanks and respect, and\n\n[[Page S15202]]\n\nthey have also earned the right to be treated with dignity. That is why \nit is a privilege to join with Senators Harkin and Gregg on this \nbipartisan public safety cooperation amendment to the farm bill, to \nguarantee that all firefighters, police officers, emergency medical \npersonnel, and other first responders have a voice at the table in the \nlife-and-death discussions and decisions about their work. It will \nensure that they are treated fairly. It will help them keep our \ncommunities safe. It is no wonder that this amendment has received such \nstrong, bipartisan support. It passed the House of Representatives with \n314 votes.\n  The amendment guarantees that every first responder will have the \nsame basic right that most other workers in the public sector already \nenjoy--the right to collective bargaining. Many first responders \nalready have this fundamental right.\n  Every New York City firefighter, emergency medical technician, and \npolice officer who responded to the disaster at the World Trade Center \non 9/11 was a union member under a collective bargaining agreement. So \nwere the 7,000 firefighters who responded to the crisis in California. \nThey were able to respond more efficiently and effectively to the \ncrisis because they had a voice on the job. Many other first \nresponders, however, are not so fortunate. Twenty-nine States and the \nDistrict of Columbia guarantee all public safety workers the right to \ncollective bargaining. But 21 States--this chart reflects it--still \ndeny some or most or even all such workers this fundamental right. \nTheir first responders don't have a voice in policies that affect their \nsafety and livelihoods. That is both illogical and unfair.\n  We see all too often how dangerous these jobs can be. In 2005, 80,000 \nfirefighters were injured in the line of duty; 76,000 law enforcement \nofficers were assaulted or injured; and almost 300 of these public \nsafety employees paid the ultimate price. First responders face chronic \nlong-term health problems as well. The brave men and women who \nresponded at Ground Zero now suffer from crippling health problems, \nsuch as asthma, chronic bronchitis, back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, \ndepression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.\n  These men and women are profiles in courage. They walk into the \nfires, wade into floods, and put their lives on the line to protect our \nhomes and families. They know what they need to have to be safe on the \njob. They deserve the right to have a say in the decisions that affect \ntheir lives.\n  The amendment grants these basic rights in a reasonable way that \nrespects existing State laws. States that already grant collective \nbargaining to public safety workers are not affected by the bill. \nStates that don't offer this protection can establish their own \ncollective bargaining systems or ask the Federal Labor Relations \nAuthority for help. That amendment sets a standard. Each State has full \nauthority to decide how it will provide these basic rights.\n  These rights for first responders are not just important for the \nworkers, they are key to the safety of our communities and our Nation. \nIn the post-9/11 era, first responders have an indispensable role in \nhomeland security. It is vital to our national interest that the \nessential services they provide are carried out as effectively as \npossible.\n  As study after study shows, cooperation between public safety \nemployers and employees improves the quality of services and reduces \nfatalities. That is why strong, cooperative partnerships between first \nresponders and the communities they serve are essential to public \nsafety. As Dennis Compton, the fire chief of the city of Phoenix, has \nsaid:\n\n       When labor and management leaders work together to build \n     mutual trust, mutual respect, and a strong commitment to \n     service, it helps focus [a] fire department on what is truly \n     important . . . providing excellent service to the customers.\n\n  Our families, communities, and farms, deserve the best public safety \nservices we can possibly provide. It starts with the strong foundation \nthat collective bargaining makes possible.\n  We cannot call these brave men and women heroes in a time of crisis \nbut turn our backs on them today. We need to act now to make these \nbasic rights available to all of America's first responders. It is a \nmatter of fundamental fairness, an urgent matter of public safety.\n  The best way to give our heroes the respect they deserve is by \nsupporting this amendment. I urge them to do so.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, let me go through some charts.\n  This chart is on California wildfires, farmland, crops, and \nlivestock. This is Riverside County. I think all Americans remember \nthese extraordinary fires that dominated the national news and \nnewspapers and were so devastating to scores of families out West not \nmany weeks ago. Riverside County lost $15 million in crop and farm \nproducts. The fire scorched over 900 acres of farmland. There was \nbetween $10 million and $15 million in damages to the avocado farms in \nVentura County.\n  These men and women who fight these fires understand how to be \neffective and how to preserve both life and the farms in those \ncommunities. That is what this is all about--that they have a voice in \nthe development of the policies, about how they are going to proceed. \nNobody who watched and listened to those extraordinarily brave \nfirefighters doubted the extraordinary competency and commitment these \nindividuals have. They serve, and serve our country very well.\n  This is an indicator that firefighter fatalities are on the rise. All \nof us have seen the growth of fires. This is a rather awesome chart. \nFirefighter fatalities are on the rise. The red line indicates this. So \nwe are asking more and more of them each year. This chart says that \nevery year firefighters put their lives on the line to ensure our \nsafety. In 2005, 80,000 firefighters suffered injuries and 115 died in \nthe line of duty. This year, approximately 100 firefighters will pay \nthe ultimate price while on duty.\n  Again, the point we are underlining here is that firefighters must \nhave a voice in the development of policies, whether it is in the \nagriculture area or other areas. We need to give the first responders a \nvoice in the development of safety measures and how to use equipment \nand use it effectively. You will have a more efficient kind of effort \nin terms of controlling fires, and it increases the safety and \nproductivity of the firefighters.\n\n  These law enforcement officers are at risk on the job. In 2005--this \nlegislation would apply to first responders here--76,000 law \nenforcement officers were assaulted or injured on the job and 157 died \nin the line of duty. Injuries and assaults have increased by 21 percent \nin the last 10 years. These jobs are becoming more hazardous. We have a \nresponsibility to do everything we can to work with these first \nresponders to help them do the job they can do and should do.\n  This chart shows that 9/11 firefighters enjoyed collective bargaining \nrights. I don't think any American who witnessed that extraordinary \ntragedy of\n9/11 and witnessed those extraordinary men and women, those \nfirefighters who lost their lives in the line of duty on September 11--\nthey were union members with collective bargaining rights. They were \nprepared to do their jobs, and they did it like no others. They \ninspired a nation with their courage. Many are faced, as I mentioned, \nwith many of the lung diseases, carpal tunnel syndrome, and bad backs. \nThey need to be able to have those particular health care needs met and \nattended to.\n  Finally, the Cooperation Act protects the rights of dedicated public \nsafety workers. This is a chart that tells what this legislation does \nand what it doesn't do.\n  First, it establishes the right to form a union and bargain over \nworking conditions. It gives workers a voice in the working conditions, \nwhich is so important in terms of both the efficiency and effectiveness \nof their work. They would have the right to sign legally enforceable \ncontracts and resolve stalled disputes through mediation or \narbitration. There is a specific prohibition in terms of striking, but \nthey can solve this through mediation. That is how disputes will be \nsolved. It doesn't take away the authority of the State and local \njurisdictions. It doesn't require any specific method to certify \nunions. It doesn't interfere with State right-to-work laws. It doesn't \ninfringe on the rights of volunteer firefighters.\n  This is legislation which has been carefully considered and reviewed.\n\n[[Page S15203]]\n\nThere are, at last count, more than 60 Members of our body, Republicans \nand Democrats, who have indicated support for the legislation. As we \nhave seen and mentioned earlier, when we saw these devastating fires \nthat went across the country and ravaged the farmland of this Nation \nand we saw the extraordinary work of so many first responders, it \nreminded us of our responsibility to make sure these extraordinary men \nand women who exhibited such extraordinary courage will be treated \nfairly and equitably. By doing so, they will be able to do their job \nand protect America's families and the farmland in our country more \neffectively.\n  Madam President, I withhold the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 \nadditional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, today I join my colleagues to address \nan issue that is crippling America's health care system; that is, out-\nof-control medical malpractice costs.\n  Wyoming, my home State, has been listed by the AMA as one of 19 \nmedical liability crisis States. A few years ago, one of at the time \nonly two companies selling liability insurance in the State decided to \nleave, leaving over 300 physicians scrambling for liability coverage. \nWyoming is losing obstetricians and gynecologists, emergency room \ndoctors, and even general practitioners, and we are losing them because \nthey cannot afford to pay the high cost of their liability premiums.\n  You may ask what is special about Wyoming in the sense that they pay \nexorbitant malpractice premiums and why is it so different from all of \nthe doctors in the neighboring States. It is because all of the States \nbordering Wyoming have enacted liability insurance reform. Wyoming is \nthe only State that has not. It is the ``hole in the doughnut,'' \nsurrounded by the other States that have reform.\n  Providers in Wyoming fear being sued, and to compensate they spend \nmillions and millions of dollars on what is called defensive medicine, \nordering tests each year, and patients and taxpayers pick up the tab.\n  This liability crisis is especially unfair to rural women and \nchildren, and it is so much unfair to them because they are losing \naccess to local doctors when they need them the most.\n  Rural and frontier States such as Wyoming are disproportionately \nimpacted when a local physician who delivers babies decides to leave \nthe State. We lost our only obstetrician/gynecologist in Wheatland, WY. \nHe delivered babies in three counties. Wyoming is a very large State. \nThere are only 23 counties. Many of the counties are larger than some \nof the States on the east coast, and he delivered babies in three \ncounties. He left when his malpractice premiums went over $100,000 a \nyear.\n  Pregnant women in Newcastle, WY, needed to travel over 80 miles to \nhave babies delivered when practicing physicians in that community were \nnot able to afford the cost of their liability insurance. In my own \ncommunity in Casper, Dr. Hugh DePalo, who was born and raised in \nCasper, WY, and loved the community and wanted to live there and give \nback to all the people in the community, had his premiums increased 300 \npercent in 1 year.\n  Some Wyoming hospitals are paying malpractice insurance premiums that \nexceed the amount they receive for delivering a baby. Wyoming \ngynecologists/obstetricians and family physicians who deliver babies \npay $20,000 to $30,000 more each year for their insurance than their \ncounterparts in surrounding States, and that is because the State to \nthe south, Colorado, has instituted a $250,000 cap on noneconomic \ndamages.\n  This is not just a financial issue, it is a recruitment issue as we \ntry to recruit physicians in the State. We set up the Wyoming Family \nPractice Program, where we train young physicians to deliver babies. \nThey are very capably trained, and yet they leave the State. The No. 1 \nreason people decide where they want to practice is based on where they \ntrain, but still they leave because the malpractice premiums are so \nmuch lower in the surrounding States. Why? Because the surrounding \nStates have passed liability reforms that are so needed and are part of \nthis bill.\n  This body has a responsibility to act immediately to protect access \nfor women who are having babies in rural communities. We should set \nreasonable limits on noneconomic damages, we should provide for quicker \nreviews of liability cases, we should assure that claims are filed \nwithin a reasonable time limit, and we should educate people that \nfrivolous lawsuits only add to the overall cost of their health care.\n  That is why I support Senator Gregg and the position he has taken \ntoday. His amendment would adopt a new liability model for \nobstetricians and gynecologists based on the highly successful stacked-\ncap approach. One might say: How successful is it? A large, full-page \nstory says:\n\n       After Texas caps malpractice awards, doctors rush to \n     practice there.\n\n  Of all the specialities of the physicians rushing to practice in \nTexas, the No. 1 speciality represented in new applicants was \nobstetrics and gynecology, those very people who are so needed in rural \ncommunities to deliver babies.\n  I thank Senator Gregg for his efforts. I encourage Members to vote \nfor the amendment. We need to help ease the struggle rural women face, \nrural women who are seeking access to capable physicians, not just for \nthemselves but also for their babies.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3695\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 hours of debate equally \ndivided on the Dorgan-Grassley amendment.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for a \ncouple minutes for informational purposes without taking away time from \neither side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, we are about to begin 2 hours of debate \non the Dorgan-Grassley amendment No. 3695. I have been in discussion \nwith my ranking member, Senator Chambliss, about getting a couple or \nthree votes stacked. I hope sometime during this debate my colleagues \nwill yield me a little bit of time to announce we might have a consent \nagreement for two or three amendments that would occur as soon as the \ndebate has ended on the Dorgan-Grassley amendment or time is yielded \nback. That is what we are working on right now. Hopefully, in the next \nseveral minutes, we will have some information about when those votes \nmight occur.\n  We are trying to work out this agreement. I am certain either Senator \nDorgan or Senator Grassley, one of the debaters, will yield us a minute \nat some point during the debate to line up two or three amendments.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the end of the debate on the Dorgan-\nGrassley amendment, or time being yielded back, the Senate proceed to \nvote on or in relation to Alexander amendments Nos. 3551 and 3553.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I think the issue is as to what time \nthose votes will take place. As I understand the unanimous consent \nrequest, it is following the debate on the Grassley-Dorgan amendment \nthat we go to votes on the two Alexander amendments.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is right.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. At whatever time that might be.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If we use all time, those two votes will occur, \nobviously, at about 6:20 p.m. If time is yielded back, it could be a \nlittle bit earlier than that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Reserving the right to object, so we can give our \ncolleagues further information about where we are going, is it the \nchairman's intention to move ahead then with debate on additional \namendments, hopefully maybe the Coburn amendments and the Sessions \namendment that might be voted on tonight, along with the Gregg \namendment?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend, yes. In speaking with the majority \nleader, the majority leader said this is going to be a late night. We \nhave a number of amendments on both sides that I think we can debate \nand we can vote on this evening. I say to my friend, yes, I hope we can \nvote on the Coburn amendments, the Sessions amendment, the Gregg \namendment, and the Alexander\n\n[[Page S15204]]\n\namendments, and there may be a couple on our side we are trying to get \ncleared for short debates and votes yet this evening.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I rise with my colleague from Iowa, \nSenator Grassley, and others who will be here to discuss the Dorgan-\nGrassley-Ben Nelson, et al, amendment we put together to this bill. Let \nme make a couple points. First of all, I don't think there is anybody \nin this Chamber who can claim they have a stronger record for farm \nprograms than I do, having been in Congress a good long while. Family \nfarms are very important to me. I believe it is an important element of \nthis country's economy and culture to have the yard lights dotting the \nlandscape of America, people living on the land trying to raise a \nfamily, raise a crop, and produce some livestock. That is very \nimportant. I have spent a lot of time supporting family farming in this \ncountry.\n  The legislation brought to us by the Agriculture Committee is a good \nbill. I applaud my colleagues, Senator Harkin and Senator Chambliss, \nand my colleague, Senator Conrad, for his work, and so many others. \nThis is a good piece of legislation. It improves slightly the safety \nnet so when there is trouble and tough times, family farmers understand \nthere is a safety net. It provides a disaster title for the first time \nin a long time, so when there is a natural weather disaster or natural \ndisaster hitting family farmers, they can rely on this disaster title.\n  There are a lot of provisions that are good in this bill, including \nsome improvement with respect to the issue of payment limits. They \neliminated the three-entity rule. That is a step forward. I appreciate \nthat. I like what has been done, and I want to improve it because there \nare a couple things that can be done that should improve it, in my \njudgment. These deal with the issue of payment limits.\n  Let me start with this proposition: Does anybody in this Chamber \nbelieve and want to stand up and say: Do you know what we ought to do \nwith the farm program? Let's give farm program benefits to people who \ndon't farm. Does anybody want to stand up and say, yes, that is our \npolicy, that makes a lot of sense? Let's provide farm program checks to \npeople who don't farm.\n  It is happening today. It will happen under this bill unless we make \nthis correction. My colleague from Iowa and my colleague from Georgia \nmissed all the applause I was giving them. They have done a great job. \nI have applauded this bill coming out of the committee. I said I want \nto improve it because this committee didn't finish the work on payment \nlimitations.\n  Two things: No. 1, we ought to limit farm program payments to those \nwho are farming. We ought not be sending farm program checks in the \nmail to people who never farmed and will never farm. Yet that is \nhappening and will continue to happen. No. 2, there ought to be some \nreasonable limit on payments.\n  My colleagues, Senator Grassley and Senator Nelson from Nebraska and \nothers, have joined me in saying that limit ought to be $250,000 per \nfarm. That is a reasonable limit, a very reasonable limit.\n  Let me describe how it works. We still have some holes we need to \npatch. The Houston Chronicle described it--cowboy starter kids they \ncalled it. We have a situation in which if land had certain base acres \nfor a crop, you didn't have to raise that crop or produce that crop. \nYou didn't have to plant the crop at all in order to get a check. Down \nin Texas, they have what are called cowboy starter kits. You can have \n20 acres of land or maybe 10 acres of land that were used to produce \nrice 20 years ago and divide it up--have a house on an acre, run a \nhorse on the other 8 or over 10, hay it once a year, and you get a farm \nprogram payment, despite the fact you have never farmed and never will \nfarm and that land hasn't produced a rice crop for 20 years.\n  Is that reasonable? I don't think it is reasonable. It will give rise \nto the kind of stories we have heard repeatedly, stories that describe \nwho is getting the benefits of the farm program payments we thought \nwere supposed to be going to help family farmers through tough times. \nThen we have someone with a cowboy starter kit on 10 or 20 acres who \ngets a payment who has never farmed and never will farm on land that \nisn't producing a crop.\n  The proposal Senator Grassley and I offer today says let's not do \nthat. Let's say, if you get a payment, you have to be farming, No. 1. \nAnd No. 2, there ought to be a limit. I normally wouldn't use a name \nsuch as this, but I am doing it because this was in the San Francisco \nChronicle. This was a story in the San Francisco Chronicle, and it \nshows payments. This is California. We could do this for a lot of \nareas. This shows payments to 20 individuals and farm businesses, among \nthe top 20 finishers from 2003 to 2005. Constance Bowles from, San \nFrancisco, $1.21 million; George Bowles, same family, $1.190 million. \nThat is $2.3 million to these folks.\n  As I indicated, this is a San Francisco Chronicle story and is an \nexample of what is happening to undermine this farm program. Let me \nread from the San Francisco Chronicle:\n\n       A prominent San Francisco patron of the arts, Constance \n     Bowles--heiress of an early California cattle baron, widow of \n     a former director of UC Berkeley's Bancroft library--was the \n     largest recipient of federal cotton subsidies in the state of \n     California between 2003 and 2005, collecting more than $1.2 \n     million, according to the latest available data.\n       Bowles, 88, of San Francisco, collected the $1.2 million in \n     mostly cotton payments through her family's 6,000-acre farm, \n     the Bowles Farming Co., in Los Banos [California]. She could \n     not be reached for comment.\n       Another family member, George ``Corky'' Bowles, who died in \n     2005, collected $1.19 million over the same period. George \n     Bowles once ran the farm but lived on . . . Telegraph Hill. A \n     collector of rare books and 18th century English porcelain, \n     he served as a director of the San Francisco Opera and \n     trustee of the Fine Arts Museum.\n       The farm is now run by Phillip Bowles, who also lives in \n     San Francisco. He told KGO television that he's no fan of \n     subsidies, but if the big cotton growers in Texas get them, \n     so should he. Many of these businesses are getting 20 to 30, \n     sometimes 40 percent of their gross revenues directly from \n     the government, Phillip Bowles told KGO. I don't have a good \n     explanation for that. Somebody else might, but it beats me.\n\n  Well, if we want this sort of thing to continue, then let's not pass \nthis amendment. This is a very simple amendment Senator Grassley and I \noffer, which says, A, you ought to be a farmer if you are going to get \na farm program payment. That is, you ought to have some active \ninvolvement in the farm. Our definition doesn't require you to live out \nthere, but it requires you to have some active involvement. That is No. \n1.\n  That is so reasonable that I guess I would like somebody to stand up \nand say, you know what, we don't think the farm program is just for \nfarmers. We give educational loans here in this country. We appropriate \nmoney for them. We won't let you get an education loan if you are not \ngoing to go to college. There are subsidized home loans. You don't get \na home loan unless you are going to buy a home. We are going to give \nassistance in the form of farm program paychecks, or checks to people \nwho don't farm? That doesn't make any sense at all.\n  Now, some will say, well, we have corrected all that. No, they \nhaven't. They haven't. Let me explain why. They intended to, or they \nwanted to correct it. There was going to be an amendment passed that \nwould correct it, but it was not offered and not voted on. But one of \nmy colleagues said, we have a $200,000 limitation on payments and \nSenators Grassley and Dorgan are saying $250,000. Well, that is a \nlittle too clever. The payment limitation means you still get the loan \ndeficiency payment under the commodity loans--you still get unlimited \npayments for all of the production, for the largest farm in America, \nyou get a price support in the form of an LDP under every single bushel \nof product you produce. It doesn't matter how big you are. You can farm \nin four States, if you want to, but you are going to get a support \nprice under everything you produce.\n  Does that make any sense to anybody? You have a payment limitation \nwithout a limit? That is not a payment limitation. That is unlimited \npayments in the LDP for the biggest farms in America, for every single \nthing they produce.\n  Senator Grassley and I offer a very simple proposition, and that \nproposition is a $250,000 payment limit and\n\n[[Page S15205]]\n\nthat you have to be involved in farming in order to get it.\n  Now I showed this San Francisco article. This is California, but I \ncould show this for many States. But when one operation gets over $35 \nmillion in 5 years, I say that is farming the farm program. When 75 \npercent of all payments go to 10 percent of the farmers receiving \ncommodity subsidies, you know what is happening. Much of that is going \nto the biggest farmers, the biggest corporate farms in the country, big \nagrifactories, and it is producing the revenue by which they buy out \nthe land and bid against family properties for their property right \nnext door. It is happening all over the country.\n  If one believes that is what we should do, then God bless you, you \nshould not vote for this amendment of ours. But I believe this country \nhas benefitted by the network of family producers out in the country. \nSome say, well, that is hopelessly old fashioned. You don't understand \nthat in our part of the country we have people who have millions and \nmillions of dollars of revenue and they are important to the economy as \nwell. If you want to farm two or three counties, you ought to be able \nto do that. I just don't think the Federal Government has the \nresponsibility to be your banker.\n  I believe, and when I came here I believed it and I still believe it, \nthat a farm program ought to be a safety net that says to family farms, \nwhen you run into trouble, you have a safety net--a bridge over \ntroubled times. We want to do that because farming is different. But \nproviding a safety net for families is very different than providing a \nset of golden arches for the biggest corporate agrifactories in this \ncountry.\n  I don't need four reasons or three reasons or even two reasons, just \ngive me one good reason we ought to collect taxes from hard-working \nAmericans and say we are going to transfer that money to some corporate \nagrifactory that gets $30 million in 5 years. Give me one good reason \nto do that. I don't think it exists.\n  Let me end where I began. I am a strong supporter of family farming, \na strong supporter of agriculture. I like what this committee has done. \nI appreciate very much the work of Senator Harkin and Senator \nChambliss. I want to improve this bill.\n  Let me conclude with something a rancher and a farmer just west of \nBismarck, ND wrote once. He is a guy who is a terrific writer and he \nasked the question--and I have asked it before on the floor of the \nSenate, and it describes why I support family farming and why this \namendment is necessary--What is it worth? What is it worth for a kid to \nknow how to weld a seam? What is it worth for a kid to know how to \nteach a calf to suck milk from a bucket? What is it worth for a kid to \nknow how to grease a combine? What is it worth for a kid to know how to \nbutcher a hog? What is it worth for a kid to know how to plow a field? \nWhat is it worth for a kid to know how build a lean-to? What is it \nworth for a kid to know how to pour cement?\n  You know something, farm kids know all of those things, and the only \nuniversity in America where they teach it is on the family farm. \nFortunately, in World War II, we sent millions of them from American \nfarms all across the world. They could fix anything. What is it worth \nto have all that knowledge? You learn that on family farms across this \ncountry. That is why family farming is so important. I say, today let's \nstand up for a good safety net for family farmers. Let's not ruin the \nfarm program. And we will, as sure as I am standing here, ruin the farm \nprogram and ruin the opportunity to enact a good farm program in the \nfuture, unless we do what we know is necessary.\n  We have a farm program that is designed to be a safety net and to \nhelp family farmers through tough times, but we cannot do that by \npretending this circumstance doesn't exist, whereby in the current farm \nprogram we give farm program benefits to people who have never farmed \nand never will, and we provide farm program benefits to the tune of \nmillions of dollars to the biggest corporate agrifactories in this \ncountry. That is not what I came to Congress to do.\n  I hope we can stand up today on behalf of family farmers and say you \nmatter, and we are going to manifest that in the vote on this \namendment.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, what time do we have on Dorgan-\nGrassley?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents have 46 minutes, and the \nopponents have 60 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield myself 14 minutes, as Senator Dorgan did.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I think everybody in this body would \nagree we need to provide an adequate safety net for our family farmers, \nand I think I ought to be totally transparent with the taxpayers who \nmight be listening, as well as my colleagues. I want you to know that I \nfarm in a crop share--in Iowa, we call it a 50-50 arrangement--with my \nson. If we get farm payments, I get 50 percent of those payments. So I \nhave received farm payments and presently do. That is assuming prices \nare low enough so you do receive those payments. Right now, they aren't \nthat low.\n  We are talking about an adequate safety net. In recent years, \nhowever, assistance to farmers has come under increased scrutiny by \nurban communities and the press. The largest corporate farms are \ngetting the majority of the benefits of the farm payment program, with \n73 percent of the payments going to 10 percent of the farmers. With a \nsituation such as that, we could lose urban support for the safety net \nfor farmers.\n  Government payments were originally designed to benefit our small- \nand medium-sized farmers, but instead, now, as you can see, the vast \nmajority of them are going to the smallest percentage of the farmers--\nthe biggest farmers. Unlimited farm payments have placed upward \npressure on land prices and have contributed to overproduction and \nlower commodity prices. Increased land prices and cash rents are \ndriving family farmers and young farmers from the business of farming. \nI have mentioned this before in other debates. Land in Iowa generally, \nbut I will use as an example land near my farm in New Hartford, IA, has \nskyrocketed and is selling anywhere between $4,000 and $6,000 an acre. \nIn my home county, the value of an acre is up 64 percent since 2000.\n  Anybody listening might say, well, why is that bad for farming? Well, \nfamily farmers don't buy land one day and sell it the next. You buy it \nfor the long haul. Sometimes farms have been in what we call century \nfarms, for well over 100 years. So this doesn't put income in farmers' \npockets. It does give them value. And if they were to die, I suppose \ntheir heirs would get a lot of money.\n  Across the State of Iowa, the average land value per acre rose 72 \npercent in the last 6 years. All these figures I am citing have \nsomething to do with the inability of young people to get started \nfarming. When the average age of farmers is 58 in my State, we ought to \nstart thinking about what we can do to make sure that young people, the \nnext generation of farmers, can get started.\n  My State isn't the only one where this is occurring, an increase in \nland values. In a report published by two agricultural economists at \nKansas State University, land values have increased 64 percent since \n2002. This trend is occurring in many other States as well. The average \nof typical cash rents per acre in Iowa rose 25 percent in the same \nperiod of time. Because if you can't buy land, and you want to farm, \nyou rent land. How are family farmers and young farmers going to \nsurvive with prices like this? How can they even get started?\n  This brings to mind a conversation I had within the last week with a \nyoung farmer near my home. He knows who gets these big payments in the \nState of Iowa, and he said, so-and-so--and I am not going to give the \nnames out--just bought 600 acres of land. Why don't you guys do \nsomething about subsidizing these big farmers to get bigger? Now, this \nsame young farmer would say to me, any farmer can get bigger all they \nwant to. That is their business. That is entrepreneurship. But should \nwe be subsidizing the biggest farmers to get bigger? He says, if you \nwant to do something to get young people started--this young farmer \nsaid to me--put\n\n[[Page S15206]]\n\na cap on what they are getting paid from the Federal Treasury. In other \nwords, 10 percent of the biggest farmers getting 73 percent of the \nbenefits out of the farm program is just plain bad policy.\n  I have been hearing directly from producers for years what former \nSecretary Johanns heard in his farm bill forums held across the 50 \nStates. Young farmers can't carry on the tradition of farming because \nthey are financially unable to do so because of high land values and \ncash rents. If that was the market, okay. But if it is being influenced \nby subsidies for big farmers to get bigger, they would say it is wrong. \nThey would also say it is wrong when you have 1030 exchanges, when it \nis cash free, as having something to drive up the value of land as \nwell.\n  Professor Terry Kastens, of Kansas State University, came out with a \nreport on this subject. The report states that since the 1930s, \ngovernment farm program payments have bolstered land values above what \nthey otherwise would have been. Dr. Neil Harl, an Iowa State University \nemeritus professor, worked with Professor Kastens on this subject, and \nhe determined that:\n\n       The evidence is convincing that a significant portion of \n     the subsidies are being bid into cash rents and capitalized \n     into land values. If investors were to expect less Federal \n     funding--or none at all--land values would likely decline, \n     perhaps as much as 25 percent.\n\n  That would give young farmers better opportunities to buy or cash \nrent for less in order to get started farming. And that is necessary, \nbecause the average age of farmers in the Midwest is about 58 years.\n  The law creates a system that is clearly out of balance. If we look \nat the results posted here, it emphasizes what I have already said: Ten \npercent of the farmers get 73 percent of the benefits out of the farm \nprogram, and the top 1 percent gets 30 percent.\n  Senator Dorgan and I have offered this payment limits amendment which \nI believe will help revitalize the farm economy for young people across \nthis country. This amendment will put a hard cap on farm payments at \n$250,000. For a lot of farmers in my State, they say: Grassley, that is \nridiculously high. But we have to look at the whole country, so this is \na compromise.\n  No less important, we tighten up the meaning of the term ``actively \nengaged,'' a legal term in the farming business. What that means is \nthat people have to be farming, because if we are providing a safety \nnet to someone in farming, I think they should be required to actually \nbe in the business of farming, sharing risks and putting their money \ninto the operation.\n  I wish to make a very clear distinction here. Some Members of the \nSenate have advocated that the Dorgan-Grassley amendment is not as \ntough as what is in the Senate Agriculture Committee bill or some say \nit might be too tough. I want to say why this is not true, and I have a \nchart here to bring this to your attention. We have to compare apples \nto apples. That is what my chart does. Saying that the committee has a \nhard cap on payment limits of $200,000 is not accurate. They only have \na hard cap on direct payments and counter cyclical payments. Let me \nremind my colleagues, we have direct payments, we have loan deficiency \npayments, and we have countercyclical payments. Out of those three, the \nbill before us that we are amending has a hard cap on direct payments \nand countercyclical payments, not on loan deficiency payments. The \nDorgan-Grassley amendment actually caps direct payments and \ncountercyclicals at $100,000.\n  In addition, the amendment will cap marketing loan gains at $150,000. \nWhile the committee--this is the loophole, this is the weakness of the \nargument that this bill tightens things up--it leaves loan deficiency \npayments unlimited. This actually weakens current law. So while the \ncommittee took some correct steps by closing the loopholes I have \nadvocated against by including the ``three entity rule'' and by \nincluding direct attribution, it also takes a step in the wrong \ndirection by making payments virtually unlimited. This whole debate is \nabout good policy. Fixing one problem but leaving other doors open does \nnot do any good.\n  I also wish to make a clarification for some of my colleagues. I have \ngotten quite a few questions about how the payment cap will actually \nwork. We set nominal limits at $20,000, $30,000, and $75,000 \nrespectively, then we allow folks to double. So a single farmer who \nwould get $20,000 in direct payments can actually double to $40,000. We \nset it at $20,000, so if they want to attribute the payments to a \nhusband and wife separately, they can. So a husband can have $20,000 \nattributed to him and $20,000 to the wife, for a total of $40,000, just \nlike a single farmer. One more clarification: If a farmer is working \nwith his two sons, each would be eligible for the $40,000 individually.\n  I wish to address some of the falsities my colleagues have raised \nsince the payment limit debate. They have argued that this is not \nreform because it targets crops but not the Milk Income Loss Contract \nProgram or conservation. To say that we do not have payment limits on \nthese two programs is hogwash. The Milk Income Loss Contract Program \nhas probably the strongest payment limits of any program. What came out \nof the Agriculture Committee includes caps on programs such as EQIP, \nthe Conservation Reserve Program, and Conservation Security Program. \nWhether those caps are at appropriate levels is something that can \nlegitimately be debated but should not detract from what we are doing \non commodities through Dorgan-Grassley.\n  Now, our amendment produces some considerable savings. We think there \nis money needed in some programs that are not adequately funded to help \nsmall businesspeople, conservationists, and low-income people through \ncommodity programs. We support beginning farmer and rancher programs \nand the rural microenterprise program. We also provide funds for \norganic cost share programs and the Farmers Market Promotion Program.\n  A large priority of mine has always been seeing justice is done for \nthe Black farmer discrimination case against the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture. This will double the amount provided by the committee for \nlate filers under the Pigford consent decree who have not gotten a \nchance to have their claims heard. It is time to make these farmers \nright who were discriminated against.\n  We support the Grassland Reserve Program, the Farmland Protection \nProgram, and finally, while the Agriculture Committee makes significant \ncontributions to the nutrition and food assistance programs, they were \nnot able to go far enough in light of the tight budget constraints. So \nDorgan-Grassley adds money in those areas.\n  The 2002 bill has cost less than expected. But this was not because \nof the payment limit reform in 2002. In actuality, we increased the \nnominal payment cap, and it continued the generic certificate loophole. \nInstead, what has happened is that we have had some good years in \nagriculture and prices have been high. That is why it cost us less to \nhave a safety net over the last 5 or 6 years, not because reforms were \nput in, in 2002. I worked with Senator Dorgan on a similar measure in \n2002, and it passed with bipartisan support, 66 to 31. Unfortunately, \nit was stripped out in conference. I voted against the farm bill \nbecause of that.\n  Let me remind this body that the Senate Agriculture Committee, out of \nconference, set up a commission called the Commission on the \nApplication of Payment Limitations for Agriculture. That is this report \nright here. They did this during conference as a sop to Dorgan and me.\n  Is my 14 minutes up? I ask for 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. This Commission was set up as a sop to Dorgan and \nmyself. We didn't get what we wanted, and consequently, you know, let's \nhave a commission study it.\n  The Commission ended up, in this report, recommending the very \nmeasures which we have included in this bill. So they want a study? The \nstudy says what we said in 2002 that the conferees didn't think we \nought to do. And we have had all the eggheads and farmers in this \ncountry study the problem we presented in 2002, and they gave us the \nresults we have here.\n  The report said also that the 2007 farm bill is the time for these \nreforms. You might remember the last time we had a vote on payment \nlimits was in a budget bill a couple of years ago. Many\n\n[[Page S15207]]\n\nof our colleagues said they agreed with what we were trying to do, but \nthey said the budget was not the right time; it needs to be done on the \nfarm bill. To all of our colleagues who said: Wait for the farm bill, \nwe are waiting. You have your opportunity. It is 2007. We have the farm \nbill here.\n  By voting in favor of this amendment, we can allow young people to \nget into farming and lessen the dependence on Federal subsidies. This \nwill help restore public respectability for the Federal farm program \nand keep urban support for the farm program so we can continue to have \na stable supply of food for our consumers.\n  I call upon my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment, and \nI reserve the remainder of time for our side.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Arkansas, Mrs. \nLincoln.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I rise today in opposition to the \nDorgan-Grassley amendment before us. But before I explain why, I do \nwant to say I have tremendous respect for my colleagues from North \nDakota and Iowa. They are hard-working men who are interested in \nworking hard to get things done. I very much appreciate that. I hope \nthey can see the success they have already had from the hard work they \nhave put in since 2001 and what has come to fruition--the underlying \nbill that came out of the Senate Agriculture Committee.\n  We worked very hard on that bill in the Senate Agriculture Committee. \nWe came out with a very balanced bill. It is a bill that, frankly, has \nmore reform, more substantive reform than any farm bill we have ever \ndone. I hope those two Senators--as I said, I have tremendous respect \nfor them and the hard work they bring to this body--I hope they do \nrecognize the success they have had since 2001 in moving forward in \nreform.\n  I also come to the floor here to oppose this amendment because, \nunfortunately, it is going to probably have some very dire unintended \nconsequences from the remaining part of this amendment that is not \nincluded in the underlying bill.\n  I just have to answer a couple of the questions my colleagues have \nbrought forward.\n  The Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, mentioned land values. I have \napproached almost every Member in this body to discuss the farm bill. \nIt is critically important to a small rural agricultural State such as \nthe one I represent, Arkansas. Agriculture is the basis of our economy. \nIn my discussions with Senator Grassley, he mentioned his concern about \nland values. I went back to do my research, and I found a study done by \nIowa State University that gives us six reasons why those land values \nare out of whack, and not one of those top six reasons is farm \npayments. So I have a little concern in terms of blaming land values on \nfarm payments. There are multiple things there that we can see that \nwould cause concern.\n  I also would like to touch on a few of the realities for the hard-\nworking men and women who produce our food in this country, to respond \nto some of the other criticisms I have heard and dispel a few of those \nmisrepresentations of farming that are out there.\n  The most often used--and it was used by my colleague here today--the \nmost used misrepresentation I encounter is the argument that a \ndisproportionate share of farm payments go to the top 10 percent of \nfarms in terms of size. I have heard it reported at 75 percent of the \npayment, 80 percent--sometimes they even use the number 90 percent. \nHonestly, it seems to change depending on the day or the source, and \nthat is why I thought I would bring a few charts of my own to clarify \nthe issue and set the record straight.\n  My first chart includes excerpts from a speech by the famed \nagricultural economist from Kansas State University, Barry Flinchbaug. \nHere is what he has to say about the distribution of farm payments \naccording to farm size: These programs are designed for the medium-size \nfarmers. They have done what they were supposed to do. We have 2.1 \nmillion farms. Small farms make up 84 percent of that, ``small'' being \ndefined as gross sales of less than $100,000. They produce 21 percent \nof the food supply, but they receive 30\\1/2\\ percent of the payments. \nMedium-sized farmers, on the other hand, make up 12.2 percent of the \nfarms, and they produce 28 percent of the domestically grown food \nsupply, and they receive 42.7 percent of the payments. Big farms with \nsales of more than $500,000 make up more than 3.8 percent of the \nfarmers. They produce half of the food supply, and they receive 27 \npercent of the payments.\n  I think if we just look at this we will realize those that are \nproducing 78 percent of the commodities are only getting 58 percent of \nthe payments.\n  My second chart brings this point home a little bit more and \ncertainly in living Technicolor. As you can see, my source here is the \nDepartment of Agriculture's Economic Research Service. We are pleased \nto bring this. I know the pie chart Senator Grassley used probably uses \nthe definition of a farmer which even Senator Lugar earlier--I think \ntoday or even yesterday, perhaps--agreed is completely out of whack. If \nwe are going to include an FHA student who earns $1,000 or more selling \na calf as a farmer, then we have a problem in terms of the definition \nof a farmer. Unfortunately, that puts us out of whack in some of the \nstatistical dealings that we have to get a good, clear picture of what \nwe are up against.\n  I am going to go into some details on this chart, but I will first \npoint out that the chart shows farmers today receive a portion of farm \nbill benefits that closely matches their percentage of total \nproduction. As you can see here by the red line, which indicates the \npercentage of Government payment, and the green line, which represents \nthe percentage of production, they are almost identical in many ways. \nIn fact, you will see the only discrepancy that exists is that the \nfarmer who produces 78 percent of the products, combining the nonfamily \nfarmers and the large family farms, receives only 58 percent of the \ntotal farm program.\n  Now, remember, those are family farmers who are producing not just \nfood source but a safe and abundant and affordable food supply and \nfiber, not to mention the fact that they are doing it in an \nenvironmentally responsible way, respectful to all of the different \nregulations that we impose. Other countries do not do that.\n  I will be the first to say I think that is a good deal. I think in \nthis country, to be able to be reassured that we are going to get a \nsafe food supply, that it is going to be done with respect to the \nenvironment, that it is going to be done with respect to water and \nwater resources and clean water and clean air, all of those things, \nthat is very reasonable. It is a good investment. It is a good return \non that dollar.\n  When you see, in that blue line--and that represents the percentage \nof farmers in a certain category, the percentage of farmers that \naccounts for the 78 percent of that production in this country, who \nare, in fact, that mythical and demonized 10 percent of the farmers our \ncritics like to refer to.\n  So if 10 percent are producing 78 percent of the food source that we \ntake for granted so often, then why should we not want our program to \nfollow the crops? As you can clearly see, 10 percent receive only 58 \npercent of the total farm program payment. I think all of these numbers \nand certainly the charts make this point very well.\n  The bottom line is, the payments follow production. That is what we \nwant to see. We want to see an efficiency in that what we are striving \nto do--and that is to provide a domestically produced, safe, abundant \nand affordable supply of food and fiber--is done.\n  That is what the insurance of our farm program is there for. And this \nreflects the fact that is exactly what those dollars are doing. They \nare a good investment, and they are returning on that investment to the \nAmerican people.\n  Now, the other issue that was brought up in terms of my colleagues \nabout the marketing loan cap, I am still a little bit confused on what \nthe Dorgan-Grassley proposal does in terms of doubling those payments. \nI am not sure if that means they are capped at $250,000 or if it is at \n$500,000 if your wife or spouse is considered actively engaged in \nfarming. But I think many of us have asked those questions, and we are \nstill a little bit confused.\n\n[[Page S15208]]\n\n  But when we talk about the cap, I would simply remind my colleagues, \nthe current law marketing loan is uncapped. The President's proposal is \nuncapped. And the reason is, because we understand that in some of our \ncrops they cannot use the disaster assistance, which we have plussed up \nabout $5 billion, the crop insurance program is not as detailed to \ntheir needs and concerns because, quite frankly, it is hard to find a \nreasonable crop insurance plan that will, at a reasonable cost, protect \nyou against the kind of risks that you have.\n  So that marketing loan is key. It is key because it allows them to \nremain competitive. So when they hit those troubled shoals they can use \nthat marketing loan to buy themselves time in the marketplace to be \nable to market their crops.\n  We have found in years past that when we tried to cap the marketing \nloan, what happens is particularly farmers in my area who do have \ndifficult times with crop insurance and have a very difficult time \nbeing able to access disaster assistance end up forfeiting their crops. \nSo it goes to Government forfeiture and then the Government gets left \nholding the bag. The taxpayer gets left holding the bag. That is not \nwhat we want to see happen. We want these farmers to use the market, \nand we want to provide them the kind of tools that allow them to use \nthe market, and that is what the marketing loan does, particularly for \ngrowers of southern commodities.\n  So it is not capped in underlying or existing law. It is not capped \nin the President's proposal. I think that is because people realize \nthat Government forfeiture of those crops is unreasonable.\n  I feel as if I have come down here and spoken so many times. I have \naddressed the issue, particularly, of the Dorgan-Grassley amendment and \nthe overall farm bill numerous times recently because I believe so \nstrongly that the reforms already incorporated in the underlying bill \nare more significant than any reform effort that we have ever \nundertaken in farm policy.\n  We have made huge strides. I think both of these gentlemen will \nrecognize that. They certainly have to me in some circumstances. But as \na consequence of enacting the provisions of the Dorgan-Grassley \namendment, it is going to be devastating to some.\n  The amendments that are not already included in the underlying bill \nthat are in this amendment would be devastating to the hard-working \nfarm families, particularly in my State but in other Southern States \nwhere we grew those commodities that are grown in the controlled \nenvironment, which results most devastatingly in the outsourcing of a \nsignificant amount of America's agricultural production. Eighty-five \npercent of the rice that is consumed is grown in this country. Over \nhalf of that is grown in my State of Arkansas. If we outsource those \njobs in rural America, if we outsource the production of that \nunbelievable staple commodity, it is not going to go somewhere else in \nthis country. It is going go to our two biggest competitors more than \nlikely. It is going to go to Vietnam and Thailand.\n  When you look at the lack of restriction and the techniques that are \nused in their growing processes, you are going to realize it is not \nsomething we want to do, to outsource what we already have, and that \nis, a safe production of a staple food source, not just for us but also \nin terms of what we do globally.\n  Let me reiterate what outsourcing would mean. It means importing rice \nfrom those places like I mentioned, where there is no environmental \nregulation between sewer water or regular water on crops that are grown \nthere. Is that what American families want? Is that what American \nmothers want in terms of looking at what they are going to do when they \nserve that rice cereal to that new infant who is just learning to eat \nsolid foods?\n  Are they going to want to be reassured that what they are dealing \nwith is a domestic product that has been regulated in how it was grown \nby American standards? Are they going to want to give that up and just \nlook to the consequences of what might happen in terms of imported \ncommodities?\n  I would argue that is a price far too high for us to pay. I think the \nAmerican people are very serious about wanting a safe and affordable \nfood supply. We should be very grateful for the wonderful bounty that \nour farmers and ranchers provide this Nation. We should support them \nwith a modest safety net so they can continue to provide this Nation \nand the world with this incredible safe, abundant, affordable supply of \nfood and fiber on the globe.\n\n  It is disappointing to me that some in the Chamber and those in the \nmedia and special interest groups would take this for granted. You \nknow, if we look at what this costs us, the investment it makes, 15 \npercent of this bill is in the commodity's title. One-half of 1 percent \nof the entire budget goes to this insurance policy of assuring \nAmerica's families they are going to get a safe food supply.\n  It is also disappointing that some in this Chamber would speak about \nthe dangers of poisoned food entering the country and jobs leaving the \ncountry and not make the connection to this vital piece of legislation \nproviding this great country of ours with both safe food and jobs in \nrural America.\n  Now, I know agricultural policy is not the most glamorous issue to \nsome Members. I know I probably bored some of my colleagues to tears \ndiscussing the intricacies of this farm bill, and the ramifications of \nthis amendment particularly. So if my colleagues take nothing else away \nfrom my remarks today----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. If the Senators take nothing else away from my remarks \ntoday, please hear this: We have included the most significant reform \nin farm program history in the underlying bill. In the great balance \nand the productive piece that we produced out of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee that was passed by unanimous consent, not one dissenting \nvote, and I challenge anyone to say that is not the case, that this is \nnot the most significant reform that we have ever provided in a farm \nbill. It is.\n  We also were very cautious not to get so close to the line that we \nend up outsourcing our food supply. I think that is very important to \nAmerica's families across this great country. No American wants our \ncountry to rely on foreign sources of food like we do foreign sources \nof oil. We did not get there overnight, but we are there.\n  We depend on foreign oil right now. And, unfortunately, if this \nhappens, we are going to see 10 to 15 years from now that we are \nbecoming dependent on foreign countries for our food source. If we do \nnot have the courage to inform the American people of that fact, then \nwe should be ashamed of ourselves.\n  I urge each of you and your staffs to take a moment and look at this \nbill and the reforms that we have made. They are significant, and they \nshould be enough for critics of farm policy, who, I suggest to you, \nwill never be satisfied. Those who condemn us, those who condemn us for \nnot taking the extra amount in terms of the reform that Senators \nGrassley and Dorgan want to take, will never be happy with any amount \nof reform. They will only be happy when we eliminate the safety net \nthat we provide farmers, but in a slightly different way.\n  A vote against the Dorgan-Grassley amendment is still a vote for the \nmost significant farm program reform in the history of our country.\n  I would like to take a moment and walk through the reforms included \nin the bill. I will wait for a later moment to do that. I certainly \nwant to encourage my colleagues to vote against the Dorgan-Grassley \namendment.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, earlier the Senator from Iowa, \nChairman Harkin, announced a unanimous consent on two votes on \namendments of Senator Alexander following the debate on this particular \namendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent, as we have agreed, that after the two \nAlexander votes, that Gregg amendment No. 3673 come up for a vote, and \nthat prior thereto there be 15 minutes of debate equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I would add to that, that the Gregg vote on amendment \nNo. 3673 requires a 60-vote margin.\n\n[[Page S15209]]\n\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I want to thank Senator Lincoln for \nher articulate and effective explanation of the difficulties in the \nDorgan-Grassley amendment. I absolutely am confident that it will \nundermine the traditional agricultural safety net for farmers in the \nSoutheast.\n  There are a lot of reasons for that. I cannot say for sure what it is \nlike in other areas of the country. Apparently, the amendment would not \nhave the same effect in every area, at least in the same percentage of \nfarmers. But since the 2002 bill, input costs to produce agricultural \nproducts have increased, particularly in the Southeast and particularly \nfor cotton, one of our most significant cash crops.\n  The cost of nitrogen, potassium, phosphate, and diesel fuel have \nrisen dramatically. I do not mean a little bit; some of them have \ndoubled during this time. However, support payments have remained \nlevel.\n  As a result, the safety net already has, in effect, been cut in half. \nThe committee-passed bill essentially continues the 2002 structure of \nhaving a safety net that is half of what it was a few years ago.\n  Producer groups in the Southeast understand the Federal budget \nreality is not something they want to deny. And the lack of \navailability of new funding impacts our ability to provide increases in \nthe safety net as we would normally expect to occur. But they are \nunited in their concern and opposition to any effort to further reduce \nthe safety net. The Grassley-Dorgan amendment would not impact \nproducers in the Midwest, it appears. Crops such as corn and wheat are \nnot expensive commodities to produce. As a result, payments do not have \nto be as high to support farmers in those areas when prices fall.\n  Crops grown in the Southeast, such as cotton and peanuts, are high-\nvalue commodities that cost a great deal to produce. For example, \ncotton currently costs approximately $450 to $500 to plant and harvest \nper acre. That is a lot of money. In Alabama, the average Statewide \nyield is approximately 700 pounds per acre from year to year. However, \nwith current market conditions, producers are barely able to break even \nwith the safety net currently in place. Any further attempt to limit \npayments will practically destroy agricultural production of high-value \ncommodities in the Southeast.\n  I suggest our colleagues take note of what the farm bill did. Before, \nwhen you actually compute the support payment levels, they were \n$360,000. Now, with the changes in amendments and loophole closings \nthat have occurred, it has dropped to $100,000. Multiple payments are \nno longer effective, and a decreased limit has the potential to be very \nharmful.\n  Let me share this thought with my colleagues. My family on my \nmother's and father's sides are farmers. They have been in rural \nAlabama for 150 years. I know something about farming, but there is \nmore to farming than just the farmer. My father, who had a country \nstore when I was in junior high school, purchased a farm equipment \ndealership. There are a lot of other people who support agriculture \nthan just the farmers. To be effective, make a living, and farm in \nagriculture in Alabama and throughout the Nation, you have to be \nengaged in a large-scale operation with expensive equipment. You have \nto invest a tremendous amount of money in bringing in a crop. If crop \nprices fall, you can be devastated. As Senator Lincoln said, who is \ngoing to fill the gap? It is not going to be somebody here. It is going \nto be somebody else around the world who is receiving far more \nsubsidies than our people.\n  There is the farm equipment dealer. There is the fertilizer dealer. \nThere are the seed people. There are the people who labor at harvesting \nand the people who process the cotton, the soybeans, the peanuts and \nconvert them to marketable products. That whole infrastructure, the \nbankers who loan the money, the businessman in town, the hardware store \nthat supplies their needs, is dependent on the farmer. In Alabama, as \nin most areas of the country, farmers are larger. They have far more at \nrisk. If they go under, not only do they go under, but entire \nindustries go under. We have cut this to effectively reduce the abuses \nin the system. I thank the committee for doing so, and I oppose the \nDorgan-Grassley amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Earlier, I asked unanimous consent to include the \nGregg amendment to be voted on following the two Alexander amendments. \nIn my request, I asked for 15 minutes of debate equally divided. I now \nask unanimous consent that 15 minutes be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I yield to the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am pleased to come to the floor today \nto join my colleagues, the Senator from Alabama and the Senator from \nArkansas, in a strong appeal to our colleagues to vote against the \nGrassley-Dorgan amendment. As Senator Lincoln so eloquently stated, \nthis underlying bill is the single largest reform to the farm program \npractically in the last two decades, if not forever. We have made \nsignificant underlying reforms to try to limit and streamline subsidies \nand to make it fair. But as the Senator from Alabama said, our rural \nareas, particularly in the South and Southeast, need this bill to \ncontinue to grow and prosper. There are parts of the country that are \ndoing very well. But in rural America, there are still difficulties. We \nhave over 200,000 farmers in Louisiana.\n  I respect the two Senators offering this amendment. They truly are \ntwo of the most respected in this Chamber. But I have to say, perhaps \nit would be easy for me to support an amendment such as this if the \ncrop in my State was getting two or three times the price it once did.\n  The fact is, rice and cotton are not in the best shape. We are being \npressed by imports. We have different rules and subsidies. With all due \nrespect to other Senators, corn has done very well lately. A couple of \nyears ago it was selling on the market for $2.10 a bushel. Today the \ncommodities rate is $4.33. So people growing corn are doing very well. \nI have some of them in my State as well. But because of the ethanol \nsubsidies, because of what we have done on the fuel business, corn is \ndoing well. We are happy for that. But rice, soybeans, and cotton \nfighting for markets, fighting against unfair trade practices. This \namendment will do them great harm.\n  Senator Lincoln has done an excellent job representing Southern \nfarming on the Agriculture Committee. She has, with our support, put \nforward some reforms to reduce the cost to taxpayers. But we can't do \nanymore. Asking us to do it is not right. For Georgia and for Alabama \nand for Louisiana and parts of Texas, this is as far as we can go. I am \nsaying to our farm guys, we help you with subsidies for ethanol. We \nknow farmers growing corn are making a boatload of money. We are happy \nfor that. But we cannot accept this amendment. I urge our colleagues to \nreject it. Let's move forward together on reform for the taxpayers and \nfor our rural areas.\n  On another note, our sugar farmers have not had a loan increase in 25 \nyears. Now with this administration supporting huge imports from \nMexico, we are at a great transitional time for sugar. This is not the \ntime to cut them anymore. For rice farmers, which Senator Lincoln spoke \nabout--she is from a rice farming family herself; she most certainly \nknows what it means to walk the rice rows--the current this amendment \nwould unfairly penalizes producers of rice. Any further cuts to our \nrice industry would be detrimental.\n  I am pleased that with Senator Lincoln's assistance, we were able to \nput in extra help for some of our specialty crops. Sweet potatoes we \ngrow a lot of, and we are proud of that crop and others. But this is \nnot insignificant business. This is billion-dollar business. It is \nimportant to Louisiana. We need to hold the line with the reform.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on Dorgan-Grassley. We have given \nenough from our region. We want to support reforms. We have supported \nreforms. But enough is enough.\n  I am happy corn is now at $4.33 a bushel. I wish my sugarcane farmers\n\n[[Page S15210]]\n\nand rice farmers were getting two or three times what they were getting \na couple years ago, but they are not. Let's hold the line and vote no \non the Grassley-Dorgan amendment.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I yield 5 minutes to my colleague from Georgia, \nSenator Isakson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I thank my colleague, Senator Chambliss.\n  Mr. President, I have great respect for Senator Grassley and Senator \nDorgan. But I have respect for a lot of other people. One of them was \nmy predecessor, a guy by the name of Zell Miller. From doing a little \nresearch about the 2002 farm bill, Zell stood on this floor and spoke. \nHe made a statement I think is worth repeating. He said: This amendment \nsays to those of us in the South one thing--hold on, little catfish, \nwhile we gut you.\n  It should not go without notice the two sponsors of this are from the \nMidwest. Everybody on the floor talking right now is from the greater \nSoutheast. This is a punitive amendment to a bill they contend on the \none hand doesn't constitute reform, but it is probably the most \nremarkable reform in farm policy in the United States in the history of \nthe Senate. We are moving in the right direction, but we are moving \nthere without destroying family farms. We are moving there without \nplaying favorites in agriculture.\n  Supporters of this amendment say these payments go to the few and to \nthe big. I couldn't disagree more. This amendment punishes the farmer \nand his family who depend solely on the farm for their livelihood. Why \nshould we take the greatest, most abundant food supply in the world and \ntry to mess it up. That is exactly what this amendment would do. Don't \nlet these big numbers fool you. These farmers each year take risks \nequal or greater than those of their brethren in any other business. In \nfact, just alone, the equipment a farmer buys today in most cases \nexceeds the cost of the home that most other Americans buy.\n  Some argue it is wrong for these payments to go to a small number of \nbig farms. But it is these very farms that are producing the vast \nmajority of our agricultural products. We should be supporting those \nwho are fueling the economic engine of our country. Why should anyone \nwant to punish family farmers who have made very large investments in \norder to become competitive in an international marketplace? Why are we \ngoing to hurt farmers who are trying to provide a decent living for \ntheir families in the face of tremendous challenges and soaring costs \nof production? They do not deserve this kind of treatment. With much of \nour Nation's farmland in a drought and input costs at record highs, why \nshould anyone want to limit assistance during this time, at a time when \nour farmers need our help and need it most?\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Dorgan-Grassley amendment. Let's \nunify America in our ag policy, not have sectional differences, \ncertainly not have sectional penalties. Let's not allow one part of the \ncountry to be gutted to the benefit of another.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues from Louisiana, \nAlabama, Arkansas, and Georgia for stepping up and making a lot of \ncommon sense in their comments. All of us are appreciative of the work \nSenator Dorgan and Senator Grassley have done over the years in this \nbody. They have both been very supportive of agriculture. I \nparticularly am appreciative of that as the ranking member of the \nSenate Agriculture Committee. I have been to Iowa. I know the kind of \nfarming they do there. It is different from the way we farm Georgia. I \nhave been to North Dakota. I have seen the way their farms operate in \nNorth Dakota. It is different from the way we operate in the Southeast. \nThere are reasons why policies have to be different for different \nsections of the country.\n  I wish to talk for a minute about this claim that all these farmers \ngetting payments are big farmers. The proponents of the Dorgan-Grassley \namendment claim that 10 percent of the farmers are getting 70 to 80 \npercent of the program payments. They characterize these farmers as \nmegafarmers and corporate farmers. Both Senator Grassley and Senator \nDorgan talk about megafarmers and corporate farmers as opposed to \nfamily farmers they want to assist with farm programs. I wish to \nexplain that the farmers in the States of all my colleagues fall within \nthis 10-percent category, and they are ordinary farmers with average \nsize operations. They have families to support, and they are a vital \ncomponent of rural communities. Most of all, those 10 percent feed this \ncountry.\n  I wish to make it clear, particularly to those who are considering \nsupporting Dorgan-Grassley, why an overwhelming majority of the farmers \nin your State would fit within the category of being in the top 10 \npercent of payment recipients. In order to compare apples to apples, I \nasked USDA to provide me with the attribution data for the 2005 direct \npayments. I asked for the data in an attributable form because I wanted \nthe information to reflect what the universe of payees would look like \nbased upon the committee-supported bill which requires direct \nattribution. The data from USDA is pretty interesting. It provides \nclarity as to the size of farming operations that comprise the top \nrecipients.\n  In 2005, if a farmer received 1 penny more than $10,000 in direct \npayments, they would have been considered to fit within the largest 12 \npercent of producer recipients, exactly the category Senator Grassley \nreferred to. Some of you might ask: How many acres does a farmer have \nto farm to reach $10,000? Critics consider them to be megafarmers, but \nthe facts do not support this claim and here is why.\n\n  According to the USDA attribution data, direct payments average \n$23.02 per acre nationally, which means if a farmer has 511 base acres, \nthey reach the $10,000 level. Now, I will be honest with you. Maybe it \nis a good bit different in the Southeast from the way it is in the \nMidwest. But if you try to farm 500 acres in the Southeast and feed a \nfamily of four, you simply cannot do it. In areas where covered \ncommodities are produced, there are few farmers who would consider \nthemselves anything but a small farmer with this amount of acreage. Yet \nthe critics are not interested in telling you these small farmers fit \nwithin the category Senator Grassley referenced on the floor recently, \nwhen he claimed we have 10 percent of the large farmers in America \ngetting 70 percent to 80 percent of all the money.\n  To better understand how so many typical farmers fall within this \nsmall percentage of payment beneficiaries, you must understand the \nentire universe of program participants. If one operator rents seven \nseparate tracts from seven separate landowners, on a 75 percent-25 \npercent crop share arrangement, we end up with eight individuals \nreceiving program benefits--one operator and seven landowners.\n  Each of these eight individuals counts as a program recipient. But \nsince the operator is on a 75-25 percent crop share arrangement, he or \nshe ends up with 75 percent of the acres and production, while all \nseven landowners account for 25 percent of the acres and production on \ntheir respective farm. Or another way to look at it, the individual \noperator accounts for 75 percent of the program payments but only 12 \npercent of the universe of individuals represented in that scenario. I \nfail to see why this is being represented as inappropriate or unfair. \nIt is only logical that the operator, as a program recipient, who \naccounts for 75 percent of the acres and production, receives more than \nany of the other seven individual landowners, who each account for only \n25 percent of the acres and production on their respective farm. This \nsimply reflects the one individual operator receives payments in a \nhigher proportion than the other seven individuals due to his level of \nproduction and risk.\n  Now, there has been conversation and statements made tonight about \nthe fact we did not make real reforms.\n  Let me tell you where the heart of the difference is between the \nGrassley-Dorgan proposal and the underlying bill. The heart of the \ndifference is in what we call the definition of an ``actively engaged \nfarmer.''\n  Under current law and under the language in the base bill, \nindividuals or entities must furnish a significant contribution of \ncapital or equipment or land and personal labor or active personal \nmanagement in order to be actively engaged in farming. So a farmer who \nqualifies for payments must put at risk money, he must furnish land, he \nmust furnish equipment or he has to be\n\n[[Page S15211]]\n\ndirectly involved in the management of the operation.\n  Under the Grassley-Dorgan amendment, that definition is changed so \nthat for an individual to be considered actively engaged in farming, \nthey must furnish a significant contribution of capital or equipment or \nland and personal labor and active personal management.\n  So what that means is any young farmer--as Senator Grassley referred \nto--who has a difficult time getting into the farming business, if he \nwants to come in and start farming, that young farmer, in order to \nqualify for payments--remember, this is the person who is going to be \nout there driving the tractor; this is the person who is going to be \ngetting dirt under his or her fingernails--they have to come up with \nmoney, they have to come up with equipment or he has to come up with \nland, and he has to be the guy who is making all the decisions on the \nground out there. He cannot have anybody helping him with it, so to \nspeak, who gets payments that help that young man along.\n  Which young farmer in America today can step right out of school, \nstep right out of high school or college, for that matter, who has the \nability to come up with capital, who can come up with the $250,000 \ncombine, who can come up with a $150,000 tractor, who can come up with \neven a used planter that is going to cost several thousand dollars? Who \nhas the ability to do that?\n  Well, the arrangement we have that is available to a young farmer \nunder the base bill and under current law is that when a young man or a \nyoung woman wants to get involved in farming--a lot of the time it is \nwith their family, sometimes it is without--they have the ability now \nto enter into a crop share or a landlord-tenant arrangement with a \nlandowner who oftentimes is in the retiring years of wanting to slow \ndown his farming operation or maybe completely get out of it and let \nsomeone else get into it. But if he has land, he has equipment he is \nwilling to put into a partnership, a landlord-tenant arrangement, then \nthat young farmer has an opportunity today he simply would not have if \nthe Dorgan-Grassley amendment passes.\n  It is pure and simple. So when we say we are going to be taking care \nof young farmers by putting a $250,000 cap on the payment limits any \nfarmer can receive and, thereby, we are going to allow young farmers to \ncome into an agricultural operation, we are kidding ourselves, and we \nare not being straightforward because that simply is not giving that \nyoung farmer any additional advantage.\n  Now, there has been conversation about abuses of the program and that \na lot of people who are not farmers--who may live in Los Angeles or may \nlive in Washington or may live in New York--are getting payments. That \nis true.\n  This is my third farm bill. I have tried in every farm bill to try to \nmake sure that young man whom we talked about who is getting dirt under \nhis fingernails, whether it is a young farmer or an older farmer, is \nthe one who gets the benefit--I emphasize that, the benefit--of these \nsafety net programs.\n\n  We have sought to do that again. We have modified the language in \nthis bill. For example, Senator Dorgan has referred to what we commonly \ncall the ``cowboy starter kit,'' where we have base acres on a piece of \nfarmland that all of a sudden is turned into a subdivision or into a \ndevelopment of some sort, and payments are made on those base acres.\n  Well, we have taken those base acres out of eligibility for farm \npayments with language we have directly put into the bill because what \nwe say is that in order for base acres to qualify, a farmer has ``to \nuse the land on the farm, in a quantity equal to the attributable base \nacres for the farm and any base acres for peanuts for the farm under \npart III, for an agricultural or conserving use, and not for a \nnonagricultural commercial, industrial, or residential use. . . .''\n  So when we talk about the ability of somebody to own base acres and \nto take that land and develop it or maybe carve a 10-acre tract out of \nthere and still get payments on those base acres, you are not going to \nbe able to do that under this farm bill.\n  We went a little bit further because in the committee I had a dialog \nwith Senator Nelson and Senator Salazar relative to an amendment which \nthey had designed to prevent commodity program payments on land that is \nno longer a farming operation or used in conjunction with a farming \noperation. We have agreed to accept some additional language relative \nto the amendment they proposed and we took in the committee.\n  The amendment requires the Secretary to reduce base acres for covered \ncommodities for land that has been developed for commercial or \nindustrial use, unless the producer demonstrates that the land remains \ndevoted exclusively to agricultural production, or for land that has \nbeen subdivided and developed for multiple residential units or other \nnonfarming uses, unless the producer demonstrates the land remains \ndevoted exclusively to agricultural production.\n  So we are taking the ability away from a commercial developer to ever \nget any farm payments. I do not know who these particular individuals \nare who have been referred to as the examples of who ought not to get \npayments who have gotten payments, but I do recognize there have been \nabuses, and we have sought to correct that. We have sought to correct \nthat, and we are going to make sure any payments that go on base acres \nunder the bill go to a farmer or an individual who is using that land \nfor agricultural purposes and not for any commercial development or \nresidential development purposes.\n  Are we going to cure all the problems? Look, I wish I thought we \ncould. I know with any program that is of this size there is going to \nbe some abuse somewhere along the way. We do not have a Federal program \nin place today that is not being abused and that you cannot single out \n1 or 2 or 10 individuals, particularly where we have an expenditure of \nbillions and billions of dollars. But we are certainly doing our best \nto address the issue, to try to correct the abuses that have taken \nplace.\n  In this particular instance, we truly have made real reforms that I \nthink are going to close every loophole we know is out there today when \nit comes to making sure payments go to folks who deserve the payments \nand that the payments are at a level that is reasonable when it comes \nto making sure we have a close watch on the taxpayer dollar.\n  I wish to close this portion of my comments by saying we will detail, \nas Senator Lincoln said earlier, some of the specific reforms. But I \nwill highlight one.\n  I was involved in the writing of the 1996 farm bill, as was Senator \nGrassley, as was Senator Lincoln. In that farm bill, which was enacted \n5 years ago, we had a payment limit cap of $450,000. In the last 5 \nyears, from 2002 to the language that is included in the base bill we \nare talking about today, we have reduced that $450,000 down to \n$100,000. Now, that is a $350,000 reform. Senator Grassley takes it up \nto $250,000, but that is not apples and apples. But the fact is, we \nhave made real reforms in the dollar amount that folks are eligible to \nreceive from $450,000 down to $100,000.\n  We have also made other significant changes, such as elimination of \nthree entity, as well as the requiring of attribution to every farmer \nin America who is going to be receiving payments under this farm bill.\n  With that, I will reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3825 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending second-degree amendment to Gregg amendment No. 3673 be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself a few minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will do it for the sole purpose of \ncommenting on a couple things the Senator from Arkansas brought up. One \nwas the statement where if our amendment is adopted, Senator Dorgan and \nI would be working to eliminate farm program payments altogether. I \nwish to make clear I am a believer in a safety net for farmers. We are \ngoing to maintain that safety net. So I hope people will ignore that \nsuggested goal.\n  I think it is important to understand that farm programs have been \naround since the 1930s. They have been around\n\n[[Page S15212]]\n\nas a safety net because farmers are at the beginning of the food chain \nor, you might say, at the bottom of the food chain. We have a situation \nwhere farmers for input, for producing a crop--producing the food our \nconsumers eat--pay what is charged for those imports. They might \nbargain a little bit, but they don't have control; they have to buy the \nimports or they aren't in farming. When they sell their products, they \nhave to sell what the market bears for the day they choose to sell. \nThey might choose a different day to sell, but eventually, whatever \nthey sell for is what the market is there; a farmer is not bargaining \nfor that market. So smaller farmers don't have the ability to withstand \nthings beyond their control, such as a natural disaster or domestic \npolicy such as, let's say, Nixon freezing beef prices, ruining the beef \nfarmers, or stopping the exports of soybeans so that they fall from $13 \na bushel to $3 a bushel. Those are things a farmer doesn't have \nanything to do with. So we have a safety net to help medium- and small-\nsized farmers get over humps and things they don't control, whereas \nlarger farmers, the farmers whom we are putting a $250,000 cap on--the \nlarger the farmer, the more staying power they have. Now, I admit they \nare affected by the same policies I have referred to, but they have the \nability to withstand that to a greater extent than smaller farmers. \nAlso, as I stated in my opening remarks, when you subsidize big \nfarmers, it helps them to get bigger, and it makes it more difficult \nfor people to stay in farming.\n\n  A second thing I wish to give a retort to is the use of quotes from \nan article that says the largest farms in America produce 78 percent of \nthe commodities, but only get 56 percent of the farm program payments. \nWell, the safety net wasn't set up to match the food source. It wasn't \ndeveloped to follow the crowd. It was set up to protect small- and \nmedium-sized farmers from things beyond their control, and to maintain \nthe institution of the family farm because it is the most efficient \nfood-producing unit in the entire world. I would compare it to \ncorporate farms on the one hand; I would compare it to the political \nState farms of the old Soviet Union as an example. The family farm has \na record of being the most productive. That is to the benefit of the \nfarmer and the entire economy. It is to the benefit of the consumer.\n  I am not advocating that there is anything wrong with large farms or \nlarge farms expanding; we just shouldn't subsidize them to do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. How much time remains on the two sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 25 minutes 50 seconds on your side, \nand 10 minutes 42 seconds on the other side.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my intention would be to use some time and \nthen perhaps yield to my colleague from Georgia, and then I would \nprefer that we be able to close since it is our amendment, and then we \nwould be done with the time. If that would be satisfactory to my \ncolleague from Georgia, the ranking member, I would proceed on that \nbasis.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Certainly, Mr. President. That is fine.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me begin, as a couple of my colleagues \nhave--more specifically, my colleague from Arkansas--I have great \nrespect for Senator Lincoln, Senator Pryor, Senator Chambliss, and \nothers here who may disagree with Senator Grassley and myself. I very \nmuch respect their position and do not in any way denigrate a position \nor a philosophy or a policy choice they have made. I do think, however, \nthis is a real choice and an important choice, and I come at it from a \ndifferent perspective. I believe very strongly if we do not do the \nright thing, one day we won't be talking about a farm program because \nthere won't be a farm program.\n  The fact is most people in this country don't farm. Only a small \npercentage of people live out in the country, out on the farm, under a \nyard light, trying to raise a family, trying to raise a crop against \nall the odds. They put a seed in and in the spring they hope it grows \nand they hope it doesn't rain too much, they hope it rains enough; they \nhope it doesn't hail; they hope crop disease doesn't come; and they \nhope that at the end of the summer, perhaps during the harvest season, \nthey get in and harvest that land and they have a crop that comes out \nof the ground. Then they hope if they were lucky enough to get through \nall of that and get a crop and drive it to the country elevator, that \nthey might get a decent price for it. They live on hope. The only way \npeople living on a farm in the country can exist is living on hope. \nThey are eternal optimists, believing that if they put a crop in in the \nspring, that putting that seed into that soil is going to somehow \nsprout into something bigger, and that at the end of the growing \nseason, they have an opportunity to make a decent living. That is what \nit is about--because farmers live on hope--but because, in most cases, \nwhen international wild price swings occur and the bottom falls out of \nthe grain market, if we don't have a safety net across those price \nvalleys, so those family farmers get economic leverage, the opportunity \nto make it from one side to the other, they get wiped out. The same is \ntrue when a natural disaster comes along.\n\n  There are some big enterprises that have the economic strength to get \nthrough it. Perhaps when price declines, when disasters hit, they can \nget through it, but the family farmer doesn't. They get washed away, \ncompletely washed away. Then you have the auction sale. You have the \nyard sale, the auction sale, and that family farmer is gone. It goes on \nall across this country.\n  This country decided to do something very important. It decided to \nsay it matters that when you fly across this country tonight, that you \nare able to look down and see people populating the prairies, \npopulating the rural areas with yard lights and family farms. Look down \nsometime and see where they all live. Fewer and fewer of them live out \nin the country. There are fewer and fewer neighbors. But we are trying \nand struggling mightily to say to family farmers, when you are out \nthere trying to run a family farm and raise a family and raise a crop, \nif you run into trouble, if you run into a tough patch, we want to help \nyou. That is what this safety net is about.\n  Now this safety net has grown into a set of golden arches for some. \nSome of the biggest corporate agrifactories in the country suck \nmillions of dollars out of this program. Some of them are farming the \nfarm program--millions and millions of dollars. Is that what we believe \nthis safety net should be about? Is it, really? Does anyone here \nbelieve that those who have never farmed and are never going to farm \nshould receive a farm program payment? Is there anybody who believes \nthat? Because that is what is going to happen. It is what is happening \nnow.\n  According to some pretty good research that has been done on who \nreceives and would receive the payments under the current system, there \nare what they call ``down south cowboy starter kits.'' I described that \nbefore. It is somebody who subdivides some land that used to produce a \ncrop and still gets a direct payment on a crop that is not produced \nanymore. So they subdivide it and build a house on part of it and run a \nhorse on another and hay it once a year, and lo and behold, someone who \nhas never farmed and never will, living on ground that has not produced \na crop for 20 years, is going to go to the mailbox some day and open up \nan envelope from the Federal Government and it is going to say: \nCongratulations. You get a farm program payment. That is exactly what \nhappens today, and it is what is going to happen with this bill.\n  I support the farm bill that came out of this committee, but I want \nto improve it because there is a glaring hole. The hole is that under \nthis bill, non-farmers could get farm program payments, and the hole \nthat is there is an unlimited opportunity to get loan deficiency \npayments on the LDP or the marketing loan portion. My colleague will \nsay: Well, we have a $200,000 cap on farm program payments. But that is \nnot true; they don't have a $200,000 cap. They have a $200,000 cap on \nthe direct payment and the countercyclical payment, but the third \npiece, the marketing loan and the loan deficiency payment, is \nunlimited--no cap at all. The biggest farm in the country, on every \nsingle bushel of commodity they produce, will get a price protection in \nthe form of a safety net from the American taxpayer. I don't think that \nadds up.\n\n[[Page S15213]]\n\n  I described a few moments ago a wonderful--apparently a wonderful \nwoman in San Francisco, a patron of the arts. I had a picture I decided \nnot to use because I don't think it is fair to her, but she was in the \nSan Francisco Chronicle; they did run a picture of her. Her name is \nConstance Bowles. She was the largest recipient of farm program funds \nin San Francisco. She received $1.2 million, her husband received $1.1 \nmillion. Another fellow still runs the 6,000 acres. He is receiving \nmoney. He says: Well, I don't know why I am getting this money, but if \nthey are--if cotton and rice folks in Texas are going to get it, then I \nthink I ought to get it as well. I don't know. Do people think this is \nwhat we ought to be doing? Do you think this represents a safety net? \nIt doesn't look like it to me. It looks like a glaring loophole.\n  The committee made some improvements. I said that when I started. The \nthree-entity rule is gone. That was something that was abusive, and \nthat is gone. I think that is progress. But I am telling my colleagues \nmore needs to be done, because if we pass this bill as is, people who \nhave never farmed and never will, will still receive farm program \npayments. For land that hasn't produced a crop for 20 years, they will \nstill be able to get farm program payments. In my judgment, that is not \nreform.\n  I believe when we read stories--and we will--when we read stories \nthat operations--the big corporate agrifactory gets $35 million in 5 \nyears, I think a lot of the American people reasonably will ask the \nquestion: What does this have to do with the safety net to help family \nfarmers through tough times? Again, if we are for change and reform in \na constructive way that says let's do the right thing, then we will \npass the amendment I have offered with Senator Grassley, Senator Ben \nNelson from Nebraska, and others, because we think it is the right \nthing to do.\n  Someone said during this debate: This will injure the safety net. No, \nno. Exactly the opposite. This is the one thing we can do that will \npreserve and strengthen the safety net. If we don't do this, we won't \nhave a safety net at some point in the years ahead. It will all be gone \nbecause the American people will say: If you can't do it right, we are \nnot going to let you do it at all. That is why I believe this is \nimportant.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nArkansas, Mr. Pryor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Lincoln). The Senator from Arkansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, as many others have said today, it is \ndifficult for me on a personal level to speak against this amendment \nbecause I have such great respect for the two sponsors of the \namendment. However, let me say this to my colleagues who are here, or \nthe staff watching on C-SPAN 2 right now, for the Senators and staff \nwho are looking at this amendment and thinking about previous votes \nthey have made on this same subject and wondering what the differences \nmight be between this and other votes they have cast, there is one \nmajor difference and that is the context of this vote. The context of \nthis vote is in a reform bill. Previous votes have been, as we have \ntalked about earlier, in budget bills, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. \nThis one is in an agriculture reform bill.\n  The farmers in our section of the country have given up a lot. What \nwe have given up goes into nutrition programs, goes into conservation, \ngoes into energy, rural development, and new programs for specialty \ncrops. When we talk about adjusted gross income, the hard cap in this \nbill that came out of committee, the three-entity rule reform, all are \nmajor gives by farmers in our section of the country.\n  Quite frankly, if this amendment is adopted, I believe it will \ndestroy the American cotton and rice industry. We will continue to use \ncotton and rice, but it will increase our trade deficit. We will import \nit from other parts of the world. Our food and fiber will be grown in \ncountries that do not have our same standards on the environment or on \nlabor or in many other areas. So I have to ask my colleagues: Do we \nthink that is good public policy?\n  I called a friend of mine this weekend. In fact, it was on December \n9. I called him and I said: Hey, are you all set up to go duck hunting, \nbecause I want to take my 13-year-old down there and go duck hunting. \nHe said: Not yet, because we are still working the fields. They are \nstill working on December 9 in the rice fields in Arkansas. Now, the \nrice is gone, but they have to maintain the levees. They have to do all \nkinds of things. I don't even know what they do. But the truth is my \nfriend, and farmers all over this country, cotton and rice farmers, \nhave huge investments they have made. They have business plans. They \nhave bought combines. They have bought other very expensive pieces of \nfarm equipment. They would have to totally reconfigure their fields. \nThey would have to destroy a very elaborate and very expensive levee \nsystem.\n  It is not fair for us to go through these reforms we have already \ndone and now to ask our rice farmers to do this.\n  So when I think about my friend, I think about what he would have to \ngo through--in fact, he is the hardest working person I know--I think \nabout the impact it is going to have on rural communities and about the \nfact that we are talking about food security and protecting the \nintegrity of the American food supply, and we are talking about \nimporting more rice and cotton, et cetera.\n  It is hard for me to understand why the Senate would want to do that. \nI have to remind my colleagues of a quote that our colleague in the \nHouse made, Marion Berry. He said:\n\n       If you like importing your oil, you will love importing \n     your food.\n\n  I hear the arguments my colleagues are making about the so-called \ncowboy starter kit. I have heard about that. It is a funny story, but \nit makes you mad as a taxpayer. The fact is, the USDA today can fix \nthat problem. It should have already been fixed, but for whatever \nreason, they have not fixed it. They have the authority to fix that \ntoday.\n  Now, I have heard the other side say they are concerned about money \ngoing to people who don't farm. There is one key thing that my other \ncolleagues need to understand, and that is that they may not be \nfarming, but the land is being farmed. The land is being farmed. They \nshare the risk in that crop. And I heard Senator Grassley say a few \nmoments ago that he and his family, and folks all over his State, enter \ninto these rent-type agreements. Well, so do we. But the way this \namendment is structured would absolutely destroy our cotton and rice \nfarmers in our part of the country.\n  In closing, this is difficult for me, but I am telling you, if this \namendment is adopted, I cannot support this bill. It is very hard for \nme to come to the Senate floor and say I cannot support a farm bill, \nwhich is so critical to our State. If this amendment is adopted, I \ncannot support the farm bill.\n  With that, I ask my colleagues to look at this very closely. I thank \nSenators Chambliss and Lincoln for their leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). Who yields time? The Senator \nfrom Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have 5 minutes remaining under the control \nof the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. How much on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 17 minutes.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I yield half of the 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Arkansas, Mrs. Lincoln.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. First of all, I want to correct something. Senator \nGrassley had some concerns about my comments earlier, and they may have \nbeen misinterpreted. Senator Grassley is a champion for his farmers, no \nquestion about it. I have no doubt about that. I didn't say it would \neliminate the subsidy program. What I said the amendment would do is \neliminate our ability as farmers in southern States in terms of being \nable to mitigate our risks without that marketing loan, uncapped as it \nis in current law. I wanted to make sure he knows.\n  Madam President, I want to take a few minutes to walk through some of \nthe reforms in this bill that people should be proud of. Over the past \n5 years, I ever consistently heard press accounts unfairly \ncharacterizing farm programs. All too often, the accounts are very \nmisleading--and that is a nice\n\n[[Page S15214]]\n\nway of saying it. However, as members of those States, we rely on a \nstrong farm safety net. I paid close attention to that criticism. I \nhave taken it personally because I believe it unfairly calls into \nquestion the character and integrity of my farmers, the hard-working \nfarm families I am proud to represent in the Senate. Largely because \nthey are hard working, they are salt-of-the-Earth people, and they go \nby the rules. The fact is, they may farm something different, and they \nmay farm a little differently than others, but they are still the hard-\nworking farm families of this country.\n  We have eliminated today in the underlying Senate Agriculture \nCommittee bill some of the often cited loopholes, the so-called three-\nentity rule, and banned the use of generic certificates, which \nproducers use to make their entire crop eligible for the marketing loan \ncap in less transparent ways. We have been asked to be transparent, and \nthat is what we have done.\n  For reformers, the underlying bill also creates direct attribution of \nprogram benefits to a ``warm body'' by requiring the Secretary to track \npayments to a natural person regardless of the nature of the farming \noperation earning these payments.\n  Folks also wanted to dramatically lower the overall level that an \nindividual farmer can receive. That is what we have done.\n  I thank you for the opportunity to be here and represent those great \nfarmers. I want to say to all of my colleagues that a vote against the \nDorgan-Grassley amendment is still a vote for the most significant \nreform in the history of our farm bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, how much time is left on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 17 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Madam President, one of the things I think we have to remember is \nthere is reform in the bill that the committee has presented to the \nSenate--reform that probably should have been done a long time ago.\n  I pointed it out in my opening remarks and in closing I want to kind \nof emphasize that there are limits put on in the bill that sound very \nreasonable. But I have to tell you there is one gigantic loophole you \nhave to consider, and out of the three forms of payments--direct \npayment, loan deficiency payment, and countercyclical payment--the caps \nthat are in the bill, adding up to $200,000, are for countercyclical \nand direct payments.\n  So if you don't have a cap on loan deficiency payments, that means \nthe payments farmers can receive are unlimited and, from that \nstandpoint, when loan deficiency payments are considered, there is not \na hard cap. Now, the adjective, ``hard,'' is applicable to Dorgan-\nGrassley, and it is very important because we have had caps on farm \nprograms for, I will bet, three or four decades. They have been \nineffective caps because there has been legal subterfuge to get around \nit.\n  The underlying bill, as well as our amendment, takes care of some of \nthat legal subterfuge. But we maintain one for loan deficiency payments \nwithin this bill. So you, consequently, don't have a hard cap. Some \npeople would say you don't have a cap at all. I will not go that far. \nBut it is one gigantic opportunity for people to get payments that are \nreally not limited. And it is particularly important for big farmers \nbecause the loan deficiency payment is paid out so much per bushel for \nwhat the market price is under the target price. So the more bushels \nyou produce, the larger the farm, the more deficiency payments you are \ngoing to get. Consequently, we are trying to stop subsidizing farmers \nfrom getting bigger.\n  But when the loan deficiency payment is left out, you are going to \ngive these farmers the same opportunity they have under existing law to \nuse a legal subterfuge that basically makes the limits less meaningful. \nSo I hope you will consider whether you think, when we have a cap, it \nought to be an effective cap and, in the words of Dorgan-Grassley, a \nhard cap. It is very important that we do that.\n  Remember the background for the farm safety net. It is to help \nmedium- and small-sized farmers, to protect them against things beyond \ntheir own control. And natural disaster is a natural one to speak about \nbecause floods and hail and windstorms and inability because of a wet \nspring to get the crop in, et cetera, et cetera, are all natural \ndisasters that a farmer cannot do anything about. Only God can do \nsomething about natural disasters.\n  Then there are political decisions. I keep mentioning them because \nthey ruined so many farmers in the 1970s. Nixon put a freeze on beef \nprices, and the President also put a limit on exports of soybeans so \nthe price would plummet when it was very high in the early 1970s. And \nthere is international politics: the cost of energy, what OPEC does--\nall of that is beyond the control of the small- and medium-sized \nfarmers.\n  But the larger you get, the more staying power you have in it, and we \ndon't need to have a safety net so strong that it subsidizes big \nfarmers to get bigger, and 10 percent of the biggest farmers are \ngetting 73 percent of the benefits out of the farm program.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Senator Grassley said a little earlier that the \npayment limit provision increased the land prices or contributed to the \nincrease in land prices in his State. I simply say that I understand \nthey have risen 64 percent from 2000. I remember very well, in 2002, \nwhen we were drafting the farm bill, the price of corn was $1.90 a \nbushel. Today, the price is $3.16 a bushel in Iowa, and in Texas it is \nabout $3.85 a bushel. It is pretty easy to see why the price of land in \nthe midwestern part of the United States increased. It has nothing to \ndo with payment limits and everything to do with crops.\n  By contrast, in the mid-1950s, cotton was selling at 55 cents a \npound. Today, a pound of cotton is selling somewhere in the range of 62 \ncents, and it is up. That is a pretty drastic contrast.\n  My colleagues have said it is their position that farmers simply get \ntoo much money, and we need to cap payments. I think it is interesting \nto note that we tried to put a cap on conservation payments, and we \nwere stymied from doing it in the committee.\n  There is nothing in the Grassley-Dorgan amendment to put any payment \nlimit on the conservation payments that are made. The conservation \npayments that are made, I daresay, are virtually all of the payments to \nwhich the Senator from North Dakota referred. I urge colleagues to vote \nno on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 12 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, to suggest that perhaps we believe that \nfarmers were getting too much money, nothing could be further from the \ntruth. A whole lot of farmers are not getting enough help when they \nneed it. The reason is because we don't have enough money in the farm \nprogram to provide a decent safety net. We have money leaking out the \nback door in the form of millions of dollars of payments to big \ncorporate agrifactories. I have some examples. We have all heard these \nand read about them.\n  Constance Bowles, a prominent San Francisco art collector, from 2003 \nto 2005 received $1.2 million. Her husband received an equivalent \namount during that period. Mark Burkett, a bonafide farmer, received \npayments for corn, wheat, cotton, peanuts, and sorghum from 2003 to \n2005 totaling $1.8 million. Tommy Dildine collected $1.04 million. By \nthe way, his wife Betty received exactly the same amount down to the \npenny. That is just over $2 million for that couple. I could go on.\n  Is this a safety net helping family farmers? I don't think so. There \nis nothing, as I indicated previously, in this legislation that stops \nsome of the practices I described earlier.\n  My colleague said this issue of cowboy starter kits--I am tired \nhearing about cowboy starter kits. The USDA can shut that down. Yes, \nthey can, but they won't. Why wouldn't we shut down a loophole that \nsays somebody\n\n[[Page S15215]]\n\nwho has never farmed and never will farm and living on land that hasn't \nproduced a crop for 20 years ought to open the mailbox and get a check \nfrom the Federal Government, a farm program payment? Why wouldn't we \nclose that loophole? Why? Because this bill doesn't go far enough and \nwon't close it and those who are opposing us on the floor of the Senate \ntoday don't want it closed.\n  There are a lot of reasons to support family farming. Some say it is \nhopelessly old-fashioned, that farming has gone a different direction; \nit is mechanized, it is big, these are big operators farming from \nCalifornia to Maine. I believe it is not hopelessly old-fashioned to \nthink we can keep families on the farm putting in a crop and \ncontributing more than a crop, but contributing to building \ncommunities. They are the economic blood vessels that flow into our \nrural communities in our country.\n  There is a songwriter, a farmer, a rancher from North Dakota named \nChuck Suchy. He sings a song about ``Saturday Night at the Bohemian \nHall,'' where all the neighbors, all the farmers in the region gather \nand talk about the weather, they talk about their crops, and they talk \nabout their families. It is an unusual culture and one that is \nimportant to this country. Some say that is yesterday, it is certainly \nnot tomorrow. I, for one, hope we can construct a farm bill that is \nabout tomorrow and that says to family farmers living on the land: We \ncare about you. You are out there alone trying to make it against the \nodds. So we have a safety net. But some of my colleagues believe that \nsafety net should be a set of golden arches, providing millions to the \nbiggest agrifactories in this country. That is not what the farm \nprogram was designed to do.\n  When we do a program here, it doesn't mean it has to be perverted. We \ndon't need snow removal in Hawaii, we don't need beachfront restoration \nin North Dakota, and we don't need to pervert a farm program by \nallowing millions of dollars--and, by the way, since the year 2000, \n$1.3 billion has been spent by this Federal Government in crop \nsubsidies to people who are not farming--$1.3 billion. What might that \nhave done in the form of health care for children who don't have health \ncare or strengthening education so that when kids walk through a \nclassroom door, we can believe they are walking into one of the best \nclassrooms in the world? What might that have done in a whole range of \nareas where we could have improved life? What might that have done had \nthat money gone in to strengthening the farm program itself or \nproviding a disaster provision 2, 3 years ago for a farm program that \ndoesn't have it?\n  Madam President, how much remains on my time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Again, I know some think it is hopelessly old-fashioned \nto talk about family farms. I don't. I know some farms have been very \nsuccessful and they have grown, and I don't mean at all they should be \npenalized. That is not my intention. We only have a certain amount of \nmoney, and we ought to provide the best safety net and farm program we \ncan up to a certain amount of production because that is the money we \nhave. But we ought not dissipate our energy, strength, and money on \npeople who are not farming and they go to their mailbox and open a \ncheck, and they get a farm program payment even if they don't farm. \nThat does not make sense to me.\n  Let me tell a story about a young man named Waylon. I was invited to \nthe White House to the East Room some while ago when they brought in \nsome youngsters who were heroes and the President presented these \nyoungsters with medals. One of them was a North Dakotan. Twelve-year-\nold Waylon was on the farm with his brother and sister. His parents \nwent to a neighbor farm for a moment to see the neighbors. It was \nwinter, and in North Dakota in the winter, the stock pond was frozen. \nThey were playing on the ice. This 12-year-old boy and his brother and \nsister were playing on the stock pond ice and his sister fell through \nthe ice. It cracked and she fell through the ice and was drowning.\n  Waylon, age 12, sent his brother to go 1 mile to fetch his parents. \nHis 6-year-old brother went off to fetch the parents. Waylon, age 12, \nmeanwhile lay on his belly with his winter clothes on and cowboy boots \ntoward the edge of the hole on the ice where his sister was drowning.\n  Some while later, about 20 minutes later, his parents came rushing \ninto the yard, driving into the yard. What they saw was a 12-year-old \nboy in this area where the ice had broken who couldn't swim, who broke \ninto that ice trying to find his sister who was drowning. What his \nparents saw was a young 12-year-old boy with his sister's head in the \ncrook of his arm. He was treading water as fast as he could tread still \n20 minutes later.\n  He was given a medal for heroism at the White House along with some \nother boys. I asked young Waylon: How did you do that? He said I \nwatched ``GI Joe'' and I learned safety tips. He said: I kicked as hard \nas I could. He kicked so hard that his cowboy boots came off. On that \nday, a 12-year-old boy who couldn't swim reached out his hand for his \nsister who was drowning.\n\n  That same type of love, that kind of commitment, that outreach of a \nhand, not just from that 12-year-old boy, but from a country to farmers \nall across this country to say, let us help you when you are in \ntrouble--that is the instinct of this country and why we created a \nsafety net in the first place, to reach out our hands to say we want to \nhelp, you are not alone when prices collapse, when disease comes, when \nit hails, when it rains, when it rains too much, when it doesn't rain \nenough. This country has said we want to help because we believe family \nfarmers are important to this country. We want people on Saturday night \nto come to the Bohemian Hall and swap stories about the weather, the \ncrops, and their neighbors. We want that. The way you get that, it \nseems to me, is to preserve a safety net. We will not preserve a safety \nnet for family farmers by deciding we ought to give millions and \nmillions of dollars to the biggest agrifactories in this country that \nare farming the farm program.\n  When we give $1.3 billion in farm program payments to people who are \nnot farming--let me say that again--when we send checks to the \nmailboxes of people who are not farming to the tune of $1.3 billion and \ncall it a safety net in a farm program, I am saying it is a perversion \nof what we ought to do as a government to help family farmers in the \nfuture.\n  This ought not be a difficult choice. The committee made some \nimprovements in this bill; yes, they did. But without this amendment, \nwe will still have people who are not farming now and have never farmed \nin the past and will never farm in the future living on land that has \nnot produced a crop for 20 years, and they are going to continue to get \nfarm program payments. If you don't believe that is wrong, then vote \nagainst this amendment.\n  Senator Grassley and I believe there is a much better way. We don't \ndo it by suggesting anybody at all should ever be penalized. We just \nbelieve we should use the resources we have to provide the best safety \nnet we can to those family farms out there struggling to try to make \nends meet during tough times. That is why we have a farm program. It is \nwhy we designed a safety net. It has not worked as well as any of us \nwould have liked.\n  I would like to improve the safety net, but we can't improve the \nsafety net if we are using this precious money to send it to Telegraph \nHill in San Francisco to somebody who gets $2.4 million with her \nhusband, a patron of the arts, who gets money from the farm program and \nwhose brother now runs the farm and says: I don't know why we get this \nmoney, but if they get it down in Texas, we ought to get it here in San \nFrancisco.\n  I am telling you, the American people expect more from us. Let me \nfinish by saying this again. I deeply respect my colleagues who \ndisagree with me. I respect my colleagues who have spoken in support of \ntheir bill and against this amendment. But I say to them, if they are \nfor constructive change, if they are for reform that the American \npeople understand makes sense, then they have to support this amendment \nand believe let's at least do the right thing.\n  This is a good bill that came out of the committee, but it needs to \nhave this hole plugged. To have a bill come out of the committee and \nhave loan deficiency payments or the marketing\n\n[[Page S15216]]\n\nloan be totally unlimited for the biggest farm in America for \neverything they ever will produce, that is wrong. It is a hole big \nenough to drive a truck through. If we can fix that, I say we have done \na good day's work and done something very important for family farmers \nin the future.\n  One of my colleagues says, if we do this, he won't vote for the bill. \nI am going to vote for the bill one way or the other because this bill \nis an advancement in public policy. But Senator Grassley has said it \nwell, my colleague Ben Nelson and others believe as I do that we should \ndo this, we should have done this 6 years ago. And by the way, we had \n66 Senators vote for this approach the last time we wrote a farm bill, \nand it got dropped in conference. My hope is we will at least have 60 \nvotes tomorrow in support of change, constructive reform that the \nAmerican people want. If you went to a cafe anyplace in this country, \nset this out and said: What do you think we should do? I tell you it \nwill be 99 percent saying fix this, fix this, do this in support of the \nAmerican taxpayers, and do this in support of family farmers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3551\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is now 2 \nminutes for debate equally divided prior to vote on amendment No. 3551, \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask the manager of the bill if he \nwishes us to begin our 1-minute discussion?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Go ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, this is a wonderful opportunity to \ntake wasteful Washington spending and turn it into higher farm family \nincome by using our secret weapon, land grant universities' competitive \ngrants to create value-added agricultural products to get that program \nback on track. It is fully paid for, $74 million, by striking a \nprovision that uses taxpayers' dollars so taxpayers in Virginia and \nGeorgia, for example, will pay for transmission lines in Tennessee and \nother States. Those should be paid for by utilities.\n  The group that hopes Senators vote ``yes'' includes the National \nAssociation of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges, the National \nCoalition for Food and Agricultural Research, the National Association \nof Wheat Growers, and the National Cattlemen's Beef Association.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I hope the Senate will reject these \nAlexander amendments. The first one on transmission easement payments, \nagain, if we want to encourage the building of renewable energy \nresources, they are going to take place in rural areas. These easements \nthey have to get have to take place on farms and rural areas.\n  I was pleased the Finance Committee in their tax package provided \nthis income exclusion for transmission easement payments because it can \nhelp support transmission access development and it does it for \nrenewable energy. So this is part of the tax package that came from the \nFinance Committee supported both by the Finance Committee and the \nAgriculture Committee.\n  If you want renewable resources built in rural America, then this \namendment should be defeated because it will slow it down and stop it \nfrom happening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, the words I would like my colleagues \nto remember are ``farms, yes; residential, no.'' If the Alexander \namendment is adopted, there would be subsidies for wind turbines up to \n12 stories tall in agricultural areas, but there would be no subsidies \nfor wind turbines in residential areas. This is called ``small wind.'' \nTwelve stories is not very tall, but I would not want to go home and \nexplain to my constituents why I took their tax dollars and helped a \nneighbor build a 12-story-tall wind turbine with flashing lights in a \nresidential neighborhood.\n  Farms, yes; residential, no. I ask for a ``yes'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I ask my colleagues to vote no on the \nAlexander amendment. The Alexander amendment would essentially strip \nout what came out as a bipartisan supported amendment from both the \nFinance Committee and the Agriculture Committee. It is a step in the \nright direction in terms of moving forward with small wind \nmicroturbines that are very essential to our renewable energy future. \nThis is something which is part of our whole renewable energy agenda.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Alexander amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: What is the proper \norder for the 2 minutes? Is there a tradition or an order on the 2 \nminutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no order of speakers. There is 2 \nminutes equally divided.\n  Mr. GREGG. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If no one yields time, the time will be charged equally to both \nsides.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, obviously the Senator from New Hampshire \ndoes not want to explain his amendment. I will. This is a medical \nmalpractice amendment on a farm bill. This amendment picks a class of \nAmericans who will be denied their day in court and restricted in what \nthey can recover if they are victims of medical malpractice.\n  The people who will be denied their day in court, a class, women, \nwomen living in towns of 20,000 of population or less, and their \nchildren, those are the only people who will be denied the right to go \nto court.\n  If you think this is wise policy for America, to say to victims of \nmedical malpractice who live in small towns they cannot go before the \ncourt and jury for fair compensation for their injuries, then I assume \nyou will support this amendment.\n  But if you believe the medical malpractice does not belong in the \nfarm bill, should not specify one class of Americans to be \ndiscriminated against and that we should give those victims a chance \nfor their day in court, please vote no.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator \nfrom Illinois in going first. Let me simply make this point. This is \nnot a complicated amendment. In rural America today, there is a \ndistinct lack of obstetricians. Women who are going to have children \nare having a very serious problem finding doctors who can take care of \nthem.\n  That is because of the cost of malpractice insurance. This bill \ntracks the Texas experience and the California experience and is a very \nreasonable approach. You have a simple choice in this bill on this \namendment. You can vote for women who need decent health care when they \nare having children or you can vote for trial lawyers. That is the \nchoice. I would appreciate it if people voted for women. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the managers have made a lot of progress on \nthis bill today. The end is in sight. We are going to have a couple \nmore votes tonight. There will be a little more debate tonight.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be debated \ntonight for the time limits specified in the order listed and that all \nother provisions of the previous order remain in effect regarding time \ndivision and intervening amendments: Sessions amendment No. 3596, 20 \nminutes evenly divided; Coburn amendment No. 3632, 20 minutes evenly \ndivided; that the Klobuchar amendment be debated tonight for whatever \ntime she may consume of her 30 minutes--she has 30 minutes; whoever \nopposes the amendment will have 30 minutes; they are going to debate \npart of that time tomorrow--Senator Klobuchar will use whatever time \nshe feels appropriate tonight within her 30 minutes but the vote occur \nin relation to the amendment during Thursday's session; that upon the \nconclusion of the debate with respect to the Klobuchar amendment, the \nSenate proceed to vote in relation to amendment No. 3596 and then \namendment No. 3632--I am sorry, the debate on the Klobuchar amendment \nwill begin after we complete the votes tonight on the two amendments I \nmentioned--that the following two amendments be debated during \ntomorrow's session: Senator Brown will have 60 minutes on amendment No. \n3819, evenly divided; Senator Tester will have 60 minutes evenly \ndivided on amendment No. 3666.\n  So in effect, we are going to have debate for a relatively short \nperiod of time, and they will yield back their time if they wish. We \nwill have two votes. Senator Klobuchar will start her debate tonight \nand use whatever of her 30 minutes she desires, and then tomorrow we \nwill have a number of\n\n[[Page S15218]]\n\namendments, but locked in is the Brown amendment and the Tester \namendment, as I outlined.\n  I have spoken to Senator Harkin. He, of course, is in touch often \nwith Senator Chambliss. There is every possibility we could finish this \nbill tomorrow.

Mr. President, I will attempt to complete my remarks in \nless than the 10 minutes I have.\n\n\n                   Modification to Amendment No. 3596\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to amend my \namendment. We got a score today that indicated it would cost $1 million \nover 10 years. This would be an offset for that. So I send this \nmodification to the amendment to the desk and ask unanimous consent \nthat I be allowed to amend the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we have not \nseen the modification.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I renew my unanimous consent request \nthat I be allowed to modify my amendment to allow for an offset for the \n$1 million cost over 10 years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The modification is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment, add the following:\n       (j) Offset.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act or an amendment made\n\n[[Page S15219]]\n\n     by this Act, for the period beginning on October 1, 2007, and \n     ending on September 30, 2011, each amount provided to carry \n     out administration for a program under this Act or an \n     amendment made by this Act is reduced by an amount necessary \n     to achieve a total reduction of $1,000,000.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will try to be succinct.\n  Crop insurance is a critical part of farm policy in America. It is \nnot working perfectly. A number of farmers do not like it and do not \ntake it out. Many do take it out and are not happy with the way it \nworks.\n  We spend a lot of money on it. The Federal Government contributes 58 \npercent of the premiums for crop insurance, totaling $3.2 billion a \nyear.\n  One of the goals of crop insurance was to eliminate ad hoc individual \ndisaster relief bills when farm disasters occur. Yet, since 2002, we \nhave averaged $1.3 billion in additional disaster relief to \nagriculture. So it has not met that goal.\n  In 1999, the Alabama Farmers Federation, now affiliated with the \nNational Farm Bureau, had a study of crop insurance. Farmers \nrecommended--these were farmers--they recommended we adopt a system in \nwhich farmers, if they chose, could take the subsidy from the Federal \nGovernment, plus their own premium, and pay that into a farm disaster \nsavings account and draw on that account if a disaster occurred--but \nonly if they voluntarily chose to do so.\n  I have studied that. I believe it is a good policy. I talked to \nSecretary Johanns when he was Secretary of Agriculture a few months \nago. He tells me he thought it would be particularly good if we moved \nforward in this way as a pilot program.\n\n  So I have offered this amendment which would call on the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture to create farm savings accounts for insurance \npurposes, which would allow the Federal contribution to Federal crop \ninsurance to go into that account, along with the farmer's \ncontribution, but only for 1 percent of the farmers in America. That \nwould limit it to a number of 20,000. Then we would try it out and see \nhow it works. I think it could work very well for quite a number of \nfarmers; I don't know how many. It certainly will not eliminate the \nneed for crop insurance. Most farmers, I am sure, would want to have \ncrop insurance.\n  Under my amendment, farmers would have to have catastrophic \ninsurance. Their crop insurance numbers would be a smaller amount to \ntake care of the more routine financial losses that farmers incur. I \nthink it is a good program. It has been thought out pretty carefully. \nWe have worked with the Department of Agriculture, the Alabama Farm \nBureau, the Farmers Federation. They support it strongly. The National \nFarm Bureau has not taken a position. So I think it is the kind of \nlegislation we ought to consider, and I urge my colleagues to do so.\n  In a few years, we will see how it is working. If it is not working, \nso be it. If it is working, we might want to make it permanent. So I \nask my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor, reserving the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, we are constantly coming to the floor \nor going into committees and talking about the fact that when it comes \nto the complicated programs we deal with, it is critically important \nthat Members, as well as our staffs, think outside the box and come up \nwith new ideas, new concepts that make sense, where we can take \nbureaucratic programs and streamline them, make them better, make them \neasier, make them more, in this case, farmer friendly. For that reason \nI compliment the Senator from Alabama. I think he has come up with an \nexcellent idea. It has the potential for providing something similar to \nan idea that was prevalent in the House several years ago that was \nproposed by a Congressman from Kansas, Kenny Hulshof, and that was to \ncreate farm savings accounts that the farmer could use to take excess \nmoney in good years and put it, tax-free, into a savings account and \nsave it for a time down the road where he knows he was going to have a \ntough year and he would have that money available. That is exactly \nsomething along the lines of what Senator Sessions is talking about. I \ndo think it is a great concept.\n  The problem I have with the amendment right now is that we have had \nno hearings on it in the committee, and we are not sure of whether it \ncan even be implemented as a part of this particular farm bill in \nconjunction with the crop insurance provisions that are in our bill. I \nhave talked to my dear friend Senator Sessions. I have told him I \nregret I will have to vote against it, but a vote against it is not a \nvote against the concept or against the fact that he has now come in \nand has thought outside the box, and I think he has a very good concept \nthat I would encourage the chairman to look at as we move in the next \nyear into the implementation of this farm bill. Let's have some \nhearings. Let's get some economists, some crop insurance folks to think \nabout it and see if we can't maybe even think about a stand-alone bill \nfor it and not wait for the next farm bill.\n  So I think it has merit. I just think trying to incorporate it into \nthis bill presents complexities that I don't think we can accommodate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I join my colleague and concur in his \nremarks on the Sessions amendment. For a lot of subjects before us we \nget good ideas, interesting ideas that come up via amendments on bills. \nThis isn't the first time it has happened. As Senator Chambliss said, \nthis idea has been talked about, floated around for a while. Senator \nSessions has perhaps focused it more than I have seen in the past on \nthe savings account idea.\n  But I think Senator Chambliss is right. This is a very complicated \nsubject. It involves a lot of different considerations and as well as \ninteractions with other programs in agriculture. I would just say to my \nfriend from Alabama that I would, with Senator Chambliss, be willing to \nhave some hearings on this next year, and I invite the Senator to \ntestify and bring some witnesses in, as Senator Chambliss says, some \nagricultural economists, some agricultural producers, and see what this \nproposal would do. If it has legs, if it has some merit, we could move \nit.\n  Just because we pass a farm bill doesn't mean that our committee is \ndormant for 5 years. We will be holding hearings and working on \nlegislation. The occupant of the chair, too, will be actively involved \nin a lot of those discussions next year as a valuable member of our \ncommittee.\n  So I would just say to the Senator from Alabama, I am going to join \nSenator Chambliss in opposing the amendment. Not that I am absolutely, \nirrevocably opposed to it, but it is a little bit too much of a change \non a bill now, without the kind of hearings and due diligence that we \nshould apply to it. So I will oppose it. But I will say this to Senator \nSessions: I look forward to having some hearings on it next year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his willingness \nto consider this. I do believe I have given a good bit of thought to \nit, and I have shared it with the committee for the last several or \ncouple weeks. But at any rate, I urge my colleagues to support it, \nrecognizing that it is a pilot program involving only 1 percent of the \nfarmers in America, and from that pilot program, we may learn that we \nhave a good program indeed. So I urge support for it.\n  I yield the floor, and I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 5\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am here to speak briefly on my \namendment, which is amendment No. 3810. I am going to reserve most of \nmy time for tomorrow because some of my colleagues want to address this \nbill.\n  Mr. President, America's farm safety net was created during the Great \nDepression. It was created to protect struggling family farmers from \nvolatile prices and from volatile weather. I think the reasons for that \nsafety net still remain today. That is why I am a strong supporter of \nthis farm bill.\n  I believe there are some forward thinking provisions in this farm \nbill, including with regard to energy, cellulosic energy--something \nnear and\n\n[[Page S15220]]\n\ndear to my heart. We have worked hard on those provisions. The \npermanent disaster relief is so important for the farmers in my State. \nI think the safety net that helped our farmers in the 2002 farm bill \nand allowed them to take risks and revitalize a lot of the areas in \nthis country are good. That is why I support this farm bill.\n  But I also believe there is a need for reform in this farm bill. I \nbelieve the money that is set aside for a safety net for our farmers \nshould be going to the hard-working farmers in this country and not to \nurban millionaires. When you look at what happened over the last few \nyears, there are scandals. There are people who should not have gotten \nthis money. There are art collectors in San Francisco and real estate \ndevelopers in Florida. When we look at where the money went, I think we \ncan conclude there are not a lot of farms in, say, the District of \nColumbia, where we stand today. Mr. President, $3.1 million in farm \npayments went to the District of Columbia, $4.2 million has gone to \npeople living in Manhattan, and $1 billion of taxpayer money for farm \npayments has gone to Beverly Hills 90210. The last time I checked, \nthere is not a lot of farmland in those areas.\n  I believe we can fix this problem. As Senator Dorgan said today, if \nwe don't fix it ourselves, someone is going to fix it for us. I believe \nthe people who live in farm States have an obligation to make sure \nthese programs are appropriate and that they are going to the right \npeople.\n  That is why I am proud that in this last farm bill, as a member of \nthe Agriculture Committee, we have included in this farm bill an end to \nthe three-entity rule. We have eliminated it. It will cut down the \nabuse by applying payment limits strictly to individuals and married \ncouples and to ending the practice of dividing farms into multiple \ncorporations so they get multiple payments.\n  I also support the Dorgan-Grassley amendment that puts some sensible \nlimits on the total number of subsidies. But also I believe it is very \nimportant that we put some reasonable limits on income eligibility.\n  Now, what we have here with our amendment is reasonable. Let me go \nthrough what the law is right now. Right now, the law, for full-time \nfarmers, says if you get at least 75 percent of your income from \nfarming, you have an unlimited amount of income and profit you can \nmake, and you can still get Government subsidies. That is how it works. \nIt says for part-time farmers, if you get $2.45 million--you may just \nbe an investor in Beverly Hills--you can still make up to $2.5 million, \nand you get the subsidies. We know that with the budget problems this \ncountry is facing, we need to make some sensible reforms.\n  The President has proposed a $200,000 limit on income for both part-\ntime and full-time farmers. The House-passed version has suggested a $1 \nmillion limit on income for full-time farmers and a $500,000 limit for \npart-time farmers. So it is more generous than the administration, but \nit is still a big change from what the current law is. Our Senate bill \nthat came out of committee, unfortunately, still allows for unlimited \nincome for full-time farmers, and then basically for part-time farmers \nends up after a number of years at $750,000.\n  What our amendment does, the Klobuchar-Durbin-Brown amendment--and we \nhave a number of people on the other side of the aisle who are going to \nbe supporting this as well, as well as the Department of Agriculture. \nIt simply says for full-time farmers, if you make in profit $750,000, \nat that point you are not going to get any more Government farm \npayments. Now, if you have a bad year, and disaster strikes and you go \nbelow that amount, you will be eligible for those payments. For part-\ntime farmers, some of the investors, the people who are making less \nthan 66 percent of their income from farming, if you make $250,000, \nthen, at that point, you are no longer eligible for these payments.\n  Now, I don't think this is something outrageous. I think this is good \npolicy. When I think about the farmers in my State, the average income \nof a farmer is $54,000. That is why as we look at this farm bill and \nwhat we want to do for the new and beginning farmers, we want to get \nmore farmers involved in agriculture. We want to do more for nutrition, \nconservation, and most important to me, moving to this next generation \nof cellulosic ethanol, we have to acknowledge that at some point, \nmultimillionaires who live in urban areas should not be getting these \nfarm payments.\n  So I am going to reserve the remainder of my time for tomorrow \nbecause my colleagues want to address this issue. I think we will have \na good debate. But I wanted to put it in people's minds tonight so they \ncan go back and talk to their staffs about how important it is and how \nsensible it is to put some reasonable income limits on this farm bill. \nRight now, our Senate bill has no income limits for full-time farmers \nand goes all the way up to $750,000 for part-time farmers. I believe we \ncan do better and still strongly support the family farmers in this \ncountry. I support them. My State is sixth in the country for \nagriculture; No. 1 turkey producer in the country. We have a lot of \ncorn. We have some great people who are revitalizing our State because \nof the hard work they did, and the 2002 farm bill helped them. We want \nto keep those strong reforms in place, keep the safety net in place, \nadd the disaster relief, add the conservation focus, but we also want \nto have some reasonable reforms so the money goes where it should go, \nand that is to our hard-working farmers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. First of all, I would like to take just a moment--we had \nan amendment No. 3530 which I think the committee has agreed to accept \nand will come to later, but I wanted to spend a moment talking about \nit.\n  Over the last 20 years, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has paid \nout $1.1 billion to dead farmers. Forty percent of them have been dead \nover 7 years; 19 percent of them have been dead over 11 years. Yet they \ncontinued to pay them. I very much appreciate the chairman and ranking \nmember for their consideration.\n  What this will do is to make USDA go back and say: If you haven't \ngotten your estate settled in 2 years, you have to be talking to us \nrather than us continuing to make farm payments to people who are no \nlonger alive. I appreciate their acceptance of that amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3632\n\n  I wish to set aside the pending amendment and call up amendment No. \n3632.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. COBURN. Thank you, Mr. President. This is a fairly \nstraightforward amendment. It fits with a lot of things they have done \nin this bill. This is about the EQIP program. This is about \nenvironmental capacity to save in terms of runoff, decrease load \nstreams, and do a lot of things in terms of the environment, and the \nbasic goals behind it are good. This amendment is very simple. All it \nsays is that you ought to be a real farmer to get EQIP money.\n  You ought to get two-thirds of your money from agriculture before you \nare eligible for getting this money. Why is that a problem? The problem \nis that our real farmers are not getting the vast majority of the \nmoney; it is our nonfarmers. If you buy 160 acres, what the marketing \nguy says is: I have a way for you to refence this land and build a new \npond, and it will increase the value and you can turn around and sell \nit, except the American taxpayers pay for 40 percent of the \nimprovements on it. You never have to run a head of cattle on it; you \nnever have to raise a crop on it. You can just invest in the land and \nqualify. That is not the intended purpose for EQIP or why we created \nit. I believe EQIP funds ought to go for what they are intended. What \nthis does is take the doctor who is play-farming or play-ranching and \nusing American taxpayer money to improve the value of his land so he \ncan turn around in a year and a half and sell it and make money. It \ndoesn't save us anything in terms of the intended purpose of EQIP.\n  All this says is that if you are a real farmer and you get two-thirds \nof your income from farming, agriculture, this would not apply to you. \nBut if you are gaming the system, gaming EQIP to advantage yourself, \nand not as a person in production agriculture but as an investor in \nland or as a speculator in\n\n[[Page S15221]]\n\nland, you ought not to be able to use these moneys to increase the \nvalue. Fencing hardly improves the environment. Yet we spend money out \nof EQIP for farms and ranches that are small and are not owned by real \nfarmers but gentlemen farmers who don't produce anything. Yet they go \nout and have fun on some land they own and they qualify. We ought not \nto be paying for that with American taxpayer money. It is \nstraightforward. It says you ought to be a real farmer before we allow \nEQIP money to be used to improve the environmental conditions on your \nfarm.\n  There is a marked increase in the demand for these EQIP dollars. We \nsee pivots. We can markedly decrease water consumption if we have \nmodern pivots. We help farmers to put them in. We use less water, get \nless runoff, and do more no-till farming. So the demand for the dollars \nassociated with EQIP, the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, was \ndesigned for working farms and working ranches, not for the weekend \nfarmer.\n  The Environmental Quality Incentive Program emerged as the most \nimportant USDA program providing financial assistance for conservation \non working farms and ranches and is measured by the number of \nparticipants and acres under contract--the largest financial assistance \nconservation program in all of USDA. Yet we have real farmers and \nranchers who cannot get enough help to make a difference when it comes \nto the environment.\n  I want real farmers who are really in it to produce agriculture to \nhave this money available, and I don't want the American taxpayers \npaying for somebody else who has the money to do it already but is \nusing their money to enhance the value of their property, and they are \nnot real farmers, not real ranchers, they are not a vegetable farmer, \nthey are not in production agriculture, they are not an orchard farmer, \nthey are not in timber, but, in fact, they own 40 acres of timber, and \ntherefore they qualify even though it is purely an investment and they \nhave no intent to harvest a crop, but they are utilizing taxpayer \nmoney.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Iowa has 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, when I hear the Senator describe how the \nmoney is going out, of course it sounds bad. No one wants EQIP money \ngoing for doctors who buy a little bit of acreage and want to put in a \npond and have a fishing hole. We don't want EQIP money going for that, \nand it should not go for that.\n  But the way the amendment is drafted, it just says two-thirds of your \nincome has to be from farming before you can qualify for EQIP. The \nproblem with that is there are a lot of young, beginning farmers who \nare farming, but they are not making enough money from the farm to \nsustain themselves, and they and their spouse need to work at other \njobs. They may have a night job and the spouse may have a job. Most of \ntheir income may not be from that farming venture, but the money they \nare earning is going into the farm and they are building up their farm \nasset base. I see this happening, and we don't want to discourage that. \nThose are the people who may need some EQIP money. They may need to \nbuild a fence for livestock production. That EQIP money ought to be \nthere for them to do that. Maybe they are improving their land and they \nneed a water-holding facility to provide livestock with water on an \naround-the-year basis. That happens in our State, and I am sure it \nhappens in Oklahoma too. They may not be getting two-thirds of their \nincome from farming for a while. Later, they may, as they build up \ntheir assets and become better farmers and they get more income from \nfarming.\n  So according to the Economic Research Service data, this amendment \nwould bar EQIP contracts for 71.2 percent of all producers who receive \nthem in 2006. You cannot say that 71 percent of all those people are \nthese rich doctors putting in a fence and putting their horses out \nthere. That may be a small part of these contracts, but it seems to me \nyou are going after a lot of people who deserve EQIP contracts to go \nafter some who don't deserve them.\n  The farms that would still qualify under the Senator's amendment \nwould tend to be relatively large farms--that is, with gross income on \naverage over $654,000. Again, these are the producers that have a \ngreater ability to pay for conservation. I repeat: the larger farms, \nwhere the producers get more than two-thirds of their income from \nfarming, average over $654,000 in gross income. If you compare that to \na beginning farmer, they would actually have more ability to pay for \nconservation on their own, but this amendment would hurt the younger \nfarmers with lower incomes and second jobs to make ends meet.\n  As I said, I just think this kind of a shotgun approach isn't the way \nto go. I wish there were some way to refine it to get at the very \nproblem the Senator spoke about.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. COBURN. If 72 percent of the people getting EQIP money today \nwould not get the money, that means 72 percent of the people who are \ngetting EQIP today get less than 66 percent of the money from \nagriculture. That is an even bigger problem. In fact, three quarters of \nthe people who are eligible aren't primarily getting the vast majority \nof their income from agriculture. Yet we are sending three quarters of \nthe money to those people. I see that as an even bigger problem.\n  Would the chairman work with me to try to figure out a way to exclude \nthose who are advantaging themselves and have no intention of working \ninto an agriculture position as a lifestyle or as a primary vocation? \nWould he agree to work with me so we might come to a point where we can \ndefine the difference between those who are primarily interested in \nagriculture and building a young farm and excluding those who are using \nthe American taxpayer money to improve the quality of their land so \nthey can turn around and sell it?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I could not agree with the Senator more. When I hear what \nhe says, the answer is, yes, I wish we could figure out how we do that. \nWe have not done that, and we should do that.\n  On the 71 percent, that might sound alarming, but that says to me \nthere are a lot of people out there farming who aren't making a lot of \nmoney on the farm. They do have some farm income, but think about it \nthis way: people who may be bona fide farmers or ranchers, but they may \nhave another business in town--maybe they are an elevator operator or \nsomething, but they are farmers.\n  I think we have to be very careful about this. I think there are a \nlot of these people in that 71 percent--I haven't looked at the \nbreakdown--who are these younger farmers and have to have some off-farm \nincome to help make ends meet or maybe they need farm income to put \naway for college savings or something.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the chairman yield for another question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Sure.\n  Mr. COBURN. Would the Senator think a certification as to intent by \npeople who apply for EQIP that their primary vocation is either now or \nis intended to be agriculture would be a way in which we might \naccomplish the goal? I am willing to withdraw this amendment if we can \nwork on that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That sounds interesting.\n  Mr. COBURN. I don't want the small farmer to be excluded, but I think \nthe amount of money going to nonfarmers is a lot greater than you think \nit is. It is not going to real farmers who have real needs and the vast \nmajority of the acres where we are going to make the biggest difference \non the environment. I ask if he would work with me between now and the \ntime the bill comes out of conference to see if we cannot address that, \nand if he would do so, as well as the ranking member, I will ask \nunanimous consent to withdraw this amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I give the Senator my word. I want the same thing he \nwants. It burns me up, too, to see some of these people who buy acres \nand they get EQIP money to put up a nice pond or a horse shed. I agree \nwith him. Maybe we can get our staffs and get people to think about how \nwe might fashion this to exclude those people from the EQIP program. I \nwould love to see that happen.\n\n[[Page S15222]]\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I say to the Senator from Oklahoma, also, he knows I \nsympathize with him on this issue. We talked about it. He talked to me \nabout a couple of specific instances that are just wrong. I talked \nearlier today about as hard as we try to prohibit abuses that crop up \nin farm programs, we know they are there. Whatever we can do to close \nthe loopholes, I would like to do it here. Obviously, I am happy to \ncontinue to work with the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield further, maybe the Senator is \nonto something in terms of intent or what they are doing, coupled with, \nperhaps, the productive capacity and what that land is actually \nproducing on an annualized basis.\n  Mr. COBURN. I think we can work that out.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 3632, withdrawn\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment, and I will work \nwith the chairman and ranking member on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, what is the pending business before the \nSenate? Is there a unanimous consent request as far as further \namendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, all time having \nexpired on the two amendments that were being debated, the time now \noccurs for a vote on the Sessions amendment.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Under the consent order, is it possible that a \nmodification to the amendment be sent to the desk?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will need further consent for \nthat.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3807, as Modified\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to send to the \ndesk a modification to my amendment No. 3807, as discussed with the \nchairman and ranking member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

ACTION BY PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS BASED ON REPORT.\n\n       (a) President.--Not later than 180 days after the date on \n     which the Congressional Bipartisan Food Safety Commission \n     established by section 11060(a)(1)(A) submits to the \n     President and Congress the report required under section \n     11060(b)(3), the President shall--\n       (1) review the report; and\n       (2) submit to Congress proposed legislation based on the \n     recommendations for statutory language contained in the \n     report, together with an explanation of the differences, if \n     any, between the recommendations for statutory language \n     contained in the report and the proposed legislation.\n       (b) Congress.--On receipt of the proposed legislation \n     described in subsection (a), the appropriate committees of \n     Congress may hold such hearings and carry out such other \n     activities as are necessary for appropriate consideration of \n     the recommendations for statutory language contained in the \n     report and the proposed legislation.\n       (c) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) it is vital for Congress to provide to food safety \n     agencies of the Federal Government, including the Department \n     of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration, \n     additional resources and direction with respect to ensuring \n     the safety of the food supply of the United States;\n       (2) additional inspectors are required to improve the \n     ability of the Federal Government to safeguard the food \n     supply of the United States;\n       (3) because of the increasing volume of international trade \n     in food products, the Federal Government should give priority \n     to entering into agreements with trading partners of the \n     United States with respect to food safety; and\n       (4) based on the report of the Commission referred to in \n     subsection (a) and the proposed legislation referred to in \n     subsection (b), Congress should work toward a comprehensive \n     legislative response to the issue of food safety.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the pending \namendment offered by friend and colleague Senator Kennedy.\n  This is an amendment that would make important changes to America's \nfood safety policy.\n  We clearly need to make a change. For far too long, we have gone \nwithout a comprehensive review of our food safety laws.\n  Ancient statutes remain on the books, standards have not been \nupdated, budgets have atrophied, and consumers have suffered from food \nborne illness.\n  In 2007, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, added the food \nsafety system to its ``High Risk List'' of government functions that \npose a risk to the United States.\n  The designation follows an extensive series of GAO, National \nAcademies of Science, and inspector general reports calling for major \nimprovements in our food safety system.\n  This year alone, we have witnessed 48 recalls of contaminated \nproducts regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, Food \nSafety Inspection Service, FSIS, and more than 150 recalls of \ncontaminated products regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, \nFDA.\n  Included in these statistics are recalls of more than 3 years of \nproduction of certain brands of peanut butter tainted with salmonella, \na full year of production of ground beef tainted with E. coli, and more \nthan 100 brands of popular cat and dog food.\n  In the past 2 months alone, there have been recalls of 5 million \nunits of frozen pizza and 1 million more pounds of beef tainted with E. \ncoli.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, \nthere are approximately 76 million cases of food borne disease each \nyear in the United States. While many of these cases are mild, CDC \nestimates that food borne illness causes 325,000 hospitalizations and \n5,000 deaths each year.\n  The food industry is one of the most important sectors of the \nnational economy, generating more than $1 trillion in economic activity \nannually and employing millions of American workers.\n  Unfortunately, over the past several months, consumer confidence in \nthe safety of our food supply has dropped precipitously, posing a risk \nto this sector of the economy.\n  According to the Food Marketing Institute's 2007 survey of consumer \nconfidence, the number of consumers confident in the safety of \nsupermarket food declined from 82 percent in 2006 to 66 percent today--\nthe lowest point since 1989. The same survey shows that consumer \nconfidence in restaurant food is even lower, at 43 percent.\n  Although the United States continues to have one of the safest food \nsupplies in the world, the authorities and standards we set and the \ninvestments in food safety we make are being surpassed by other major \nindustrialized nations.\n  A significant portion of the responsibility for this trend rests with \nCongress. While other countries have updated their food safety laws to \nreflect best available science, technology, and practices, we have \nallowed our statutes to become dated and obsolete.\n  We have underfunded this critical government function.\n  It is alarming that the safety of our food supply depends on ancient \nstatutes that were written to address vastly different food safety \nchallenges.\n  The Federal Meat Inspection Act was passed in 1906 partly in response \nto Upton Sinclair's accounts of Chicago's meat packing plants in his \nnovel ``The Jungle.''\n  There has been only one major review of our meat laws and that \noccurred 40 years ago.\n  The Poultry Products Inspection Act celebrates its 50th anniversary \nthis year and the Egg Products Inspection Act is more than 35 years \nold.\n  The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act was passed in 1938 and has \nnever been comprehensively reauthorized.\n  This is the key statute used by the Food and Drug Administration to \nregulate about 80 percent of our food supply.\n  Since then, although our understanding of food borne illness, \npreventative measures, microbiology, sanitation practices, and industry \nbest practices has been transformed by developments in science and \ntechnology, the core principles of these statutes remain in place.\n  Into this void has stepped an uncoordinated, irregular sweep of \ncrises-specific legislation, such as the Infant Formula Act of 1980 and \nImport Milk Act, as well as dozens of regulatory efforts to improve the \nsafety of specific products.\n  Agencies have faced legal challenges as to whether they have the \nauthority to implement some of these regulations.\n  It is time that Congress stepped forward to exercise oversight and \nensure that we comprehensively improve our food safety system.\n  That is why my colleague Senator Kennedy and I are offering an \namendment to the farm bill that would set a trajectory toward a \ncomprehensive review of the laws that underpin our food safety system.\n  Although food safety is one of the most dynamic functions of the \nfederal government and relies heavily on developments in science, \ntechnology, and best practices, there is no mechanism for Congress to \nregularly review developments and reauthorize the agencies that perform \nthese tasks.\n\n[[Page S15224]]\n\n  Already included in the bill we're considering is language that would \ncreate a Food Safety Commission, a mechanism for Congress, the \nadministration, academia, industry, consumer groups, and others to work \ntogether on comprehensive food safety reform and recommend specific \nstatutory language.\n  The Commission is tasked with studying the in our current system and \nmaking specific legislative recommendations to the President and \nCongress on how to improve our laws.\n  We have directed the Commission to do its work based on universally \nagreed upon principles--allocate resources according to risk, base \npolicies on best available science, improve coordination of budgets and \npersonnel.\n  This amendment goes further than that language. It directs the \nPresident to review these recommendations and findings and report his \nor her recommendations back to Congress in a timely fashion.\n  The language puts Congress on a track of holding hearings and moving \nsuch comprehensive food safety reform through the process.\n  Lastly, the language contains sense-of-the-Senate language that it is \nthe policy of the U.S. Senate to provide our food safety functions with \nadequate resources, that we increase the number of inspectors looking \nat food shipments, and that it is vital for Congress to move forward \nwith comprehensive food safety reform.\n  This amendment will compel the participation of all stakeholders in \nthe Commission process and will compel Congress and the Administration \nto act on its recommendations.\n  I offer this amendment and ask for my colleagues to support this \neffort to modernize our food safety system.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask that the second-degree amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3845) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask the amendment, No. 3539, as amended, be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment No. 3539, as amended, was agreed to.\n\n\n             CHESAPEAKE BAY WATERSHED CONSERVATION PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to engage the distinguished \nchairman and ranking member of the Agriculture Committee in a colloquy.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am happy to yield to my friend from Maryland.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I, too, am happy to engage my friend from Maryland in \ndiscussion.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. Chairman, all of us who represent Chesapeake Bay \nwatershed States in the Senate are grateful that the bill reported out \nby the Agriculture Committee recognizes the very serious challenge that \nwe have with excess nutrients and sediments in the bay. As I testified \nto your committee back in the spring, every year huge areas of the \nChesapeake Bay and its tidal tributaries become ``dead zones,'' which \noccur when there isn't enough dissolved oxygen for aquatic life to \nthrive. Not all the excess nutrients that create these dead zones come \nfrom agriculture, but a substantial part of them do. The Chesapeake Bay \nWatershed Conservation Program in your bill will go a long way in \nassisting farmers in our States implement projects to better manage \ntheir nutrient-rich runoff. The new program represents a significant \npart of the $700 million annually that scientists and agricultural \nexperts estimate is needed on the ground to bring the runoff to \necologically acceptable levels.\n  My question is just to clarify the intent of the committee regarding \nthis new program. Am I correct in my understanding that, although the \nChesapeake Bay Watershed Conservation Program uses EQIP authorities, it \nhas its own funding stream and therefore will not reduce the normal \nEQIP allocations to Maryland and the other Chesapeake Bay watershed \nStates?\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is correct, Senator. Section 2361 provides an \nadditional funding stream totaling $165 million from 2007 through 2012 \nto address the critical needs of the Chesapeake Bay. This funding is \nseparate from EQIP and is not intended to offset funding allocated \nunder that program.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I thank the chairman for that clarification. I would like \nto ask the distinguished ranking member, the same question. Is it your \nunderstanding that the legislation before us today provides a unique \nfunding stream for the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Conservation Program \nwithout reducing the normal EQIP allocations to the Maryland and the \nother Chesapeake Bay watershed States?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I am happy to confirm with the Senator from Maryland \nthat he understands the provision correctly. The Chesapeake Bay \nWatershed Conservation Program is to be implemented by the NRCS in \naddition to EQIP or any other existing conservation program. The \nChesapeake Bay basin is the watershed for our Nation's Capital and the \nBay is a national treasure. The committee is providing this \nextraordinary support for this extraordinary watershed and its farmers.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I thank the chairman and distinguished ranking member for \ntheir clarifications. I invite both of my friends to join me in \nvisiting the farms of the Chesapeake region in the coming year so they \ncan see for themselves how effectively and enthusiastically these \nneeded funds are being used to benefit both our farmers and our \ntreasured Chesapeake Bay watershed.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Akaka pertaining to the introduction of S. 2462 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/12/senate-section/article/S15224-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15224-S15225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VETERANS AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as chairman of the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs I have tried to advance two pieces of legislation--the \nVeterans' Traumatic Brain Injury and Other Health Programs Improvement \nAct of 2007 and S. 1315, the Veterans Benefits Enhancement Act of 2007.\n  Once again, Members on the other side are objecting to moving forward \nwith these bills--they are setting up a procedural roadblock. These \nbills deserve to be heard and debated and discussed, and I welcome \nthat, but Republicans will not allow that to happen. Let me make that \npoint again--we are only asking for debate. Not for the immediate \npassage of the bills that the Senate simply pass the bills as reported \nby the committee. Surely it is not too much to ask that the Senate be \nallowed to do its business.\n  Earlier today, the former ranking member of the committee, Senator \nLarry Craig, made the latest objection for himself and for the \nRepublican leadership.\n  This is new territory for a VA bill. When Senator Craig was chairman \nof the committee, he and I negotiated on a variety of legislative \ninitiatives leading up to our markup but could not reach agreement on a \nnumber of matters. At the markup, I offered amendments on a number of \nthe issues about which I had strong feelings. I did not, however, \ncontinue to pursue those matters on the floor. And I most assuredly did \nnot do anything to block Senate consideration of the legislation that I \nhad sought to amend. In fact, as ranking member, I worked with then-\nchairman Craig to gain passage of the legislation by unanimous consent.\n  There is much in S. 1233, the committee's omnibus VA health bill, \nthat needs to be enacted, like an increase in the reimbursement rate \nfor veterans who must travel long distances for VA care, and vital \nprovisions to help veterans from becoming homeless. Never, in my \nmemory, have we let a disagreement on one provision stand in the way of \npassing a legislative package, especially at such a critical time.\n  Senator Craig feels most strongly about allowing middle-income \nveterans to enroll for VA health care. In 2003, the Bush administration \nshut the doors to these veterans, and since that time, hundreds of \nthousands of veterans have been turned away. I want to be clear that \nthese veterans are not asking for a free ride. Indeed, they will be \nrequired to make copayments for their care. What they are asking for is \nentry into the system. We estimate that 1.3 million veterans want this \nopportunity. And some in this body are standing in their way.\n\n[[Page S15225]]\n\n  Many veterans have been denied VA health care under the current ban. \nTake, for example, California, where over 22,500 veterans have been \ndenied enrollment; or Texas, where 23,800 have been denied access since \n2003. This phenomenon is not limited to the larger States--17,000 \nveterans in Pennsylvania; 12,300 in Illinois; 36,000 in Florida; and \nover 14,000 in North Carolina have all been denied VA health care.\n  Also, I want to clarify that we are not talking about allowing \nveterans with ``upper-income'' entry into VA care. While the \nadministration, and some of my colleagues, characterize Priority 8 \nveterans as ``higher-income,'' that is not necessarily the case. The \ncurrent income eligibility threshold for VA health care is under \n$28,000 a year--which can hardly be classified as a ``high-income'' \nsalary. In my home State of Hawaii, where the cost of living is one of \nthe Nation's highest, the average salary for a veteran who has been \ndenied is $39,300 a year.\n  It is not just in Hawaii, but in many other States as well. For \nexample, in South Carolina, the threshold is $31,650 a year; in North \nCarolina, $32,000 a year is considered low-income. These are not \nmeaningless numbers--the dollar values represent the hard work of \nveterans who have served honorably and are now earning well below the \nmedian income for their area.\n  No, these are not poor veterans. But one devastating illness without \nhealth care coverage, and make no mistake about it, they will be \nimpoverished.\n  Many of these veterans do not have any other form of health \ninsurance. A recent study conducted by researchers at Harvard \nUniversity found that nearly 1.8 million veterans are uninsured. This \nsuggests that there are veterans in Priority 8 who are stuck in the \nmiddle between not making enough money to afford their own private \ninsurance and making too much to qualify for VA care. No veteran who \nserved their country honorably should be denied care when they need it \nbecause they were fortunate enough not to have been wounded in combat.\n  I also urge Members to read the text of the contested provision \nrelating to Category 8 veterans. If the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \nsees opening up enrollment as too much of a financial burden, the \nSecretary could simply publish a decision in the Federal Register to \nagain block these veterans. Congress is not seeking to overstep the \nSecretary's authority to determine who can come through VA's doors.\n  Finally, Senator Craig calls the inclusion of enrollment for middle-\nincome veterans, a ``last minute'' addition. I say with a smile, that \nwhile time does seem to stand still in the Senate, I would remind my \ncolleague that the bill enabling full enrollment was introduced last \nApril, it was the subject of a hearing last May, and was marked up by \nthe committee in June. This is not something that can be characterized \nas a ``last-minute'' change.\n  Now I turn briefly to address concerns raised about S. 1315, the \ncommittee's omnibus veterans benefits legislation. The proposed \nVeterans' Benefits Enhancement Act of 2007 is a comprehensive bill that \nincludes benefits for a broad constituency of servicemembers and \nveterans, particularly those who are service-disabled. Provisions in \nthis bill would also improve benefits for World War II Filipino \nveterans, virtually all of whom are now in their 80s or 90s.\n  While not providing Filipino veterans living outside the United \nStates with benefits identical to those provided to veterans living in \nthe United States, I am satisfied that the provisions in S. 1315 are \nequitable and should be adopted. It is important to note that S. 1315 \nwould fix a historical wrong.\n\n  Filipino veterans served under the command of the United States \nmilitary during World War II. They were considered by the Veterans' \nAdministration, the predecessor of the Department of Veterans Affairs, \nto be veterans of the United States military, naval and air service \nuntil that status was revoked by the Rescission Acts of 1946. \nTherefore, as a matter of fundamental fairness and justice, Filipino \nveterans' benefits should be similar to those of other veterans.\n  Those who oppose the pension provision in S. 1315 argue that the \npension that would be provided through this legislation is too high. \nHowever, pension benefits are designed to allow wartime veterans and \ntheir survivors to live in dignity--above the poverty level. I am \nsatisfied that the levels of pension designated in this bill would \nallow these veterans to live with such dignity, while finally giving \nthem the recognition that they so richly deserve.\n  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to take a good \nlook at the facts surrounding the provisions contained in both S. 1233 \nand S. 1315 that some on the other side are objecting to, and to \nrealize that opposing these bills on the current basis provided \neffectively denies valuable and meaningful benefits to our Nation's \nveterans.\n  In closing, I again stress that all we are seeking is a time \nagreement that will allow for debate. For those who believe that there \nare provisions in these two bills that should not be approved by the \nSenate, offer amendments, debate the merits, let the Senate vote. That \nis the least we can do as we seek to meet the needs of our Nation's \nveterans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/12/senate-section/article/S15225-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

SPRAGGINS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to recognize \nand say farewell to an outstanding Air Force officer, BG Benjamin J. \nSpraggins, upon his retirement from the Air Force after more than 34 \nyears of service. Throughout his career, Brigadier General Spraggins \nhas served with distinction, and it is my privilege to recognize his \nmany accomplishments and commend him for his service to the Air Force, \nthe Congress, and our grateful Nation.\n  Brigadier General Spraggins is a longtime resident of my home State \nand devoted public servant of Harrison County, MS. He enlisted in the \nU.S. Air Force on March 17, 1972. After over 6 years of successful \nenlisted service, reaching the grade of technical sergeant, Brigadier \nGeneral Spraggins received his commission from the Academy of Military \nScience, McGhee Tyson, TN. Following graduation from Officer Candidate \nSchool, Brigadier General Spraggins completed aviation school at Mather \nAir Force Base, CA, and RF-4C training at Shaw, Air Force Base, SC. \nBrigadier General Spraggins was then stationed with the 187th TRG at \nDannelly Field, AL, flying the RF-4C fighter aircraft. While stationed \nin the 187th, Brigadier General Spraggins served in many critical \npositions, including instructor, scheduling officer and assistant chief \nof standards and evaluations. He flew the RF-4C from 1979 to 1983 and \nwas a weapons instructor in the F-4D from 1983 to 1988 at the 187th \nFighter Wing. Brigadier General Spraggins completed his military flying \ncareer with over 2,500 hours in the T-37, T-43, RF-4C, and F-4D \naircraft.\n  On September 23, 1987, Brigadier General Spraggins was assigned to \nthe Combat Readiness Training Center, Gulfport, MS. During his tenure \nat the training center, he served in various positions, including range \ncontrol officer, director of operations, operations group commander, \nand finally as commander of the Combat Readiness Training Center. As \ncommander, Brigadier General Spraggins was responsible for operations \nand training of over 20,000 military personnel annually and provided \noversight for a $75 million budget.\n  Concurrently, Brigadier General Spraggins was sent to Andrews Air \nForce Base, DC, in 2002 to run the Crisis Action Team for the Air \nNational Guard. In 2003, he also served as the commander of the 186th \nAir Refueling Wing, where he was responsible for operations of KC-135 \naircraft wing, with\n\n[[Page S15226]]\n\nover 1,000 personnel and oversight of a $48 million annual budget. He \nwas the first member of the Mississippi Air National Guard to \nsimultaneously command two major units, the Combat Readiness Training \nCenter and the 186th Air Refueling Wing.\n  Brigadier General Spraggins was assigned to the Tennessee Air \nNational Guard in November 2005 as the chief of staff. In this capacity \nhe was responsible to the adjutant general for readiness of Tennessee's \nthree flying wings and three mission support units. In addition to \nduties as chief of staff, Brigadier General Spraggins also served as \nthe air deputy commander, joint forces Headquarters, Tennessee National \nGuard. Brigadier General Spraggins was also attached as the battle \ncommander for Air Force North, Tyndall AFB, FL. In this capacity he was \nresponsible for ensuring the air sovereignty and air defense of the \ncontinental United States.\n  During his long and distinguished career, Brigadier General Spraggins \nsuccessfully completed Squadron Officer School, Air Command and Staff, \nand the Air War College with the Air University. His decorations and \nawards include Legion of Merit, Meritorious Service Medal, Air Force \nCommendation Medal, Mississippi Magnolia Cross, Tennessee Meritorious \nService Medal, Combat Readiness Medal, Air Reserve Forces Meritorious \nService Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Air Force Longevity \nService Medal, Armed Forces Reserve Medal and the Air Force Training \nRibbon.\n  Upon the retirement of Brigadier General Spraggins after 34 years of \ndedicated service, I offer my congratulations to him and his wife Judy. \nBrigadier General Spraggins is a credit to both the Air Force and the \nUnited States of America. I know that I speak for all my colleagues in \nexpressing heartfelt appreciation to him. I wish Brigadier General \nSpraggins blue skies and safe landings and congratulate him on \ncompletion of an outstanding and successful career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/12/senate-section/article/S15226-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                        Corporal Tanner O'leary\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Corporal \nTanner O'Leary and his heroic service to our country. As a member of \nthe Army's C Company, 1st Battalion, 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment, \n82nd Airborne Division based in North Carolina, Corporal O'Leary was \nserving in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. On December 9, 2007, \nhe was killed in action in Afghanistan.\n  A native of rural Eagle Butte and a 2003 graduate of Timber Lake High \nSchool, Tanner joined the Army in 2005. His teachers remember Tanner as \na student who loved to learn. He was active in school science fairs and \non the football team. As his former science teacher recalls, ``Once \nTanner latched on to something he didn't let go; I know that was how it \nwas with him with the Army as well.''\n  Growing up on a ranch west of Timber Lake, Tanner was a hard worker \nwho enjoyed spending time with his family. He took great pride in his \ndaughter Alexis, and his family will always remember what a wonderful \nfather he was. Friends and family will miss Tanner's easygoing, fun-\nloving personality.\n  Corporal O'Leary gave his all for his soldiers and his country. Our \nNation owes him a debt of gratitude, and the best way to honor his life \nis to emulate his commitment to our country. I join with all South \nDakotans in expressing my deepest sympathy to the family and friends of \nCorporal O'Leary. He will be missed, but his service to our Nation will \nnever be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/12/senate-section/article/S15226-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FURTHER CHANGES TO S. CON. RES. 21\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, section 307 of S. Con. Res. 21, the 2008 \nbudget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee \nto revise the allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate levels for \nlegislation, including one or more bills and amendments, that \nreauthorizes the 2002 farm bill or similar or related programs, \nprovides for revenue changes, or any combination thereof. Section 307 \nauthorizes the revisions provided that certain conditions are met, \nincluding that amounts provided in the legislation for the above \npurposes not exceed $20 billion over the period of fiscal years 2007 \nthrough 2012 and that the legislation not worsen the deficit over the \nperiod of the total of fiscal years 2007 through 2012 or the period of \nthe total of fiscal years 2007 through 2017.\n  I find that Senate amendment No. 3551 offered by Senator Alexander to \nSenate amendment No. 3500, an amendment in the nature of a substitute \nto H.R. 2419, satisfies the conditions of the deficit-neutral reserve \nfund for the farm bill.

Mr. President, with only a few legislative days left to us \nbefore the Christmas holidays and the end of this session, we continue \nseeking to make progress in filling the many U.S. attorney vacancies \nacross our Nation and the high-level vacancies at the Justice \nDepartment.\n  Today, the Senate will confirm three more nominations for U.S. \nattorneys, including the nominations of Gregory A. Brower to the \nDistrict of Nevada, Diane J. Humetewa to the District of Arizona, and \nEdmund A. Booth, Jr. to the Southern District of Georgia. Two of the \nthree nominations--Ms. Humetewa and Mr. Brower--are replacements for \ntwo of the outstanding U.S. attorneys who were fired almost a year ago \nas part of the ill-advised, partisan plan to replace well-performing \nU.S. attorneys. I thank the home State Senators--Senators Reid, Ensign, \nMcCain, Kyl, Chambliss, and Isakson--for their consideration of these \nnominations.\n  We also are proceeding to fill one of the many high-level vacancies \nat the Department of Justice by confirming the nomination of Ronald Jay \nTenpas to be Assistant Attorney General for the Environment and Natural \nResources Division at the Justice Department. I thank Senator \nWhitehouse for chairing his hearing.\n  Over the course of this year, the Judiciary Committee's investigation \ninto the firing of United States attorneys and the influence of White \nHouse political operatives on Federal law enforcement has led to \nresignations at the highest ranks in the Justice Department, including \nthe Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, the Associate \nAttorney General, the chiefs of staff of the Attorney General and \nDeputy Attorney General, the White House liaison, as well as several \nWhite House officials.\n  When I met with Michael Mukasey before his confirmation hearing to \nreplace Alberto Gonzales as Attorney General, I emphasized the need to \nfill the many vacancies that remain at the Department with nominees who \nwill restore the independence of Federal law enforcement.\n  In the days before the congressional Thanksgiving recess, the White \nHouse made a show of releasing the names of a score of nominees for \nhigh-level positions in the Department of Justice. Yet, that \nannouncement was mostly bluster. We received the nomination of Mark \nFilip to be the Deputy Attorney General nearly 3 full weeks after the \nannouncement was made. Had the nomination been sent immediately \nfollowing the White House announcement, the committee could have \nconsidered Judge Filip's nomination in early December. As it was, after \na 3-week White House delay in sending up the nomination, I immediately \nset a hearing on his nomination for next Wednesday, December 19, once \nthe Senate received it.\n  Nearly a month after the White House announced its intent to nominate \nKevin O'Connor be the Associate Attorney General and Gregory Katsas to \nbe the Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Division at the \nDepartment of Justice we have only now received those nominations. We \nhave not yet been provided with their background materials to allow us \nto review them. Because of the administration's delay, we will not be \nable to consider those nominations before the end of the year.\n  The Judiciary Committee has reported 20 executive nominations this \nyear. To make further progress, the committee is holding back-to-back \nhearings next week, before the Christmas break, on six nominations for \nsenior leadership posts at the Justice Department and Executive Office \nof the President, including the recently received nomination to be \nDeputy Attorney General.\n  There are now 23 districts with acting or interim U.S. attorneys \ninstead of Senate-confirmed, presidentially appointed U.S. attorneys, \nover a quarter of all districts. Many of these vacancies, including \nseveral for which we consider nominations today, could have been filled \na year ago had the White House worked with the Senate.\n  In the course of the committee's investigation into the unprecedented \nmass firing of U.S. attorneys by the President who appointed them, we \nuncovered an effort by officials at the White House and the Justice \nDepartment to exploit an obscure provision enacted during the Patriot \nAct reauthorization to do an end-run around the Senate's constitutional \nduty to confirm U.S. attorneys. The result was the firing of well-\nperforming U.S. attorneys for not bending to the political will of \npolitical operatives at the White House.\n  When it comes to the United States Department of Justice and to the \nU.S. attorneys in our home States, Senators have a say and a stake in \nensuring fairness and independence in order to insulate the Federal law \nenforcement function from untoward political influence. That is why the \nlaw and the practice has always been that these appointments require \nSenate confirmation. The advice and consent check on the appointment \npower for U.S. attorneys is a critical function of the Senate.\n  I had hoped when the Senate unanimously voted to close the loophole \ncreated by the Patriot Act, passing S.214, the ``Preserving United \nStates Attorneys Independence Act of 2007,'' it would send a clear \nmessage to the administration to make nominations that could receive \nSenate support and begin to restore an important check on the partisan \ninfluence in law enforcement.\n  Yet, even as we closed one loophole, the administration has been \nexploiting others to continue to avoid coming to the Senate. Under the \nguidance of an erroneous opinion of the Justice Department's Office of \nLegal Counsel, the administration has been naming acting U.S. attorneys \nand interim U.S. attorneys sequentially. They have used this misguided \napproach to put somebody in place for 330 days without the advice and \nconsent of the Senate. This approach runs afoul of congressional intent \nand the law.\n  We will continue to make progress when we can, and I will continue to \nurge the White House to send the Senate consensus, qualified nominees. \nI congratulate the nominees and their families on their confirmation \ntoday.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/12/senate-section/article/S15228-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S15228]]\n                  NNSA SECURES HIGHLY ENRICHED URANIUM\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wish today to bring attention to the \nprogress being made by the National Nuclear Security Administration, \nNNSA, on the front of global nuclear non-proliferation. Yesterday the \nNNSA announced that 176 pounds of highly enriched uranium, HEU, had \nbeen secured from the Nuclear Research Institute in Rez, Czech Republic \nand safely returned to Russia. With the cooperation of several \ncountries, this nuclear fuel has been secured and returned to its \ncountry of origin, reducing the risk of it falling into the wrong \nhands.\n  Nuclear nonproliferation programs such as the NNSA's Global Threat \nReduction Initiative, GTRI, are some of the most important tools we \nhave to curb the threat of nuclear material being acquired by those who \nwish to do us harm. With the addition of this most recent shipment, the \nGTRI program has returned over 1300 pounds of HEU to Russia from \ncivilian sites worldwide. I applaud the work being done through the \nGTRI, and I look forward to the day when we no longer have to be \nconcerned with the possibility of an illicit acquisition of nuclear \nfuel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/12/senate-section/article/S15228-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SAUDI ARABIA ACCOUNTABILITY ACT\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I wish to express my support for Senator \nSpecter's Saudi Arabia Accountability Act of 2007, S. 2243. I am \npleased to cosponsor this bill, which addresses the importance of Saudi \ncooperation with the U.S. on counterterrorism issues.\n  It is also important, however, that we raise concerns about Saudi \nArabia's poor human rights record, weak rule of law, ongoing political \nand religious repression, and poor treatment of women. For instance, \nlast month a court in Saudi Arabia doubled its sentence of lashings for \na rape victim who had elected to speak out publicly about her case and \nher attempt at justice. According to human rights organizations, the \ncourt also harassed her lawyer, banned him from the case, and \nconfiscated his professional license.\n  Similarly, 2 of the country's leading reformers, the brothers \nAbdullah and Isa al-Hamid, were recently sentenced to 6 months in jail \nafter they themselves were arrested for reportedly requiring the Saudi \nintelligence forces to produce an arrest warrant when seeking to detain \npeaceful demonstrators protesting the lengthy imprisonment of their \nrelatives.\n  The State Department's 2007 human rights report notes that very \nserious problems persist in Saudi Arabia, including no right to \npeacefully change the government; infliction of severe pain by \njudicially sanctioned corporal punishments; beatings and other abuses; \ninadequate prison and detention center conditions; arbitrary arrest and \ndetention, sometimes incommunicado; denial of fair public trials; \nexemption from the rule of law for some individuals and lack of \njudicial independence; arbitrary interference with privacy, family, \nhome, and correspondence; and significant restriction of civil \nliberties--freedoms of speech and press, including the Internet; \nassembly; association; and movement. In addition, the Saudi government \ncommitted severe violations of religious freedom and has very strict \nlimitations on workers, especially for foreign workers. While the State \nDepartment continues to condemn Saudi Arabia for its abhorrent policies \non human trafficking--and place it in the worst tier for such abuses--\nthe President continues to waive sanctions that are supposed to be \ntriggered by this designation, in the interest of national security.\n  What message are we sending if we don't act on these pervasive human \nrights abuses in Saudi Arabia? Such abuses should not be overlooked or \nsidelined in the interest of national security. In fact, they are \ncritical to our national security and our ongoing efforts to combat al-\nQaida and related extremist threats. The United States must continue to \npush for freedom of speech, religion, and association, and the rule of \nlaw around the globe. I will continue to support S. 2243, but also \nencourage my colleagues to also speak up about the crucial role that \nfree and fair societies play in curbing human rights abuses and \nreducing the alienation, oppression and despair that feed extremism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/12/senate-section/article/S15228-3", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            IN CELEBRATION OF BRUNO NOWICKI'S 100TH BIRTHDAY\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 100th \nbirthday of my friend Bruno Nowicki, of Warren, MI.\n  Bruno has led a remarkable life. He was born in Sosnowiec, Poland, \nimmigrating to the United States as a young man. His love for his \nnative Poland is exceeded only by his love for Michigan and the United \nStates of America. He launched a career as a journalist and writer in \nPittsburgh and Chicago before moving to Detroit where he became a small \nbusinessman and raised a family. I had the privilege of appointing \nBruno's granddaughter, Genevieve Nowicki, to serve as a Senate page in \n1991.\n  Bruno is an expert chess player. He once played against Bobby \nFischer, and chess is an activity that he continues to enjoy today. \nYears ago, Bruno urged me to examine the educational benefits of chess. \nWe found that chess is proven to help students develop high order \nthinking skills, discipline and increased math skills. The Goals 2000: \nEducation America Act includes language that Bruno Nowicki inspired, \nand that I pushed for in the Senate, that allows Federal funds for low-\nachieving schools to be used for chess instruction as an enrichment \nprogram. This bill has helped bring chess into schools across America.\n  In Michigan, Bruno has been instrumental in acquiring and placing \nsculptures that pay tribute to his Polish heritage. The sculptures \nappear across the State, from the southeast, where he lives, to \nnorthern Michigan, serving as a reminder of the rich Polish heritage of \nso many people in Michigan and of Poland's significant contributions to \nAmerica's history and culture. A statue of Astronomer Nicolaus \nCopernicus sits in the Detroit Public Library. A sculpture of Frederic \nChopin is placed in Interlochen, home to a world-renowned fine arts \nschool. And a bust of Joseph Conrad graces the Hamtramck Public \nLibrary.\n  Conrad wrote: ``Each blade of grass has its spot on earth whence it \ndraws its life, its strength; and so is man rooted to the land from \nwhich he draws his faith together with his life.'' These words are \ncertainly apt for Bruno. In his 100 years, Bruno has been rooted in \nboth his Polish homeland and his American home in Michigan, drawing \nlife and strength from each and making Michigan the better for it.\n  The Polish birthday song ``Sto Lat'' includes the refrain ``I hope \nyou live one hundred years.'' Bruno was never quite willing to settle \nfor only 100 years. Now, as he enters his second century, I wish Bruno \nmany more years of happiness, and I offer my congratulations and my \nthanks for his friendship and his contributions to his beloved America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/12/senate-section/article/S15228-4", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15228-S15229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            100TH ANNIVERSARY OF PINNACLES NATIONAL MONUMENT\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nrecognize the 100th anniversary of Pinnacles National Monument, located \nin San Benito County, CA.\n  On January 16, 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed 2,080 \nacres of the Pinnacles National Forest Reserve as Pinnacles National \nMonument. This year, we celebrate its centennial anniversary. Part of \nan extinct volcano, the spectacular geology of Pinnacles National \nMonument has fascinated visitors for decades. A variety of flora and \nfauna flourishes in this unusual landscape, including an exquisite \nchaparral ecosystem and nearly 400 species of bees, the highest known \nbee diversity of anyplace on earth.\n  Situated near the San Andreas Rift Zone with the central coast to the \nwest and Gabilan Mountain Range to the east, Pinnacles National \nMonument now occupies over 26,000 acres 14,000 acres of which are \ncongressionally designated wilderness. With surrounding lands tended by \nfarmers whose ancestors homesteaded the region, and cowboys who watch \nover the cattle that graze on the expansive plains, Pinnacles National \nMonument offers a sublime glimpse into California's past.\n\n[[Page S15229]]\n\n  Pinnacles is home to 20 endemic species holding special Federal or \nState status, and is also the ancestral home range of the California \ncondor. Pinnacles is the only National Park site that releases and \nmaintains this extremely endangered bird species and is critical to the \noverall condor recovery effort. Pinnacles is also located within the \nPacific Flyway migratory route and contains the highest concentration \nof nesting prairie falcons of any national park in the country.\n  Only 100 miles from the urban centers of San Francisco and San Jose, \nPinnacles National Monument remains a haven of solitude for nature \nenthusiasts and offers a stunning reflection of California's rural \nhistory and heritage. For 100 years, Pinnacles National Monument has \nserved as a recreational escape for hikers, outdoor enthusiasts, and \nthose seeking a glimpse of California's rich history. It is a powerful \nreminder of the beauty of nature and the importance of conservation \nefforts.\n  I commend the National Park Service staff and volunteers for \nmaintaining the natural beauty and historical significance of Pinnacles \nNational Monument. I look forward to future generations having the \nopportunity to study and enjoy this unique piece of our State and \nnational history for another 100 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/12/senate-section/article/S15229-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 LEADERSHIP AT KANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wish today to applaud my alma \nmater, Kansas State University, and three of its students. Recently, \nthree Kansas State University students and a student from the \nUniversity of Delaware teamed up to win first place in a student case \nstudy competition at the ninth annual International Leadership \nAssociation conference in Vancouver, British Columbia.\n  Members of the winning team from Kansas State were Chance Lee, senior \nin sociology and political science with a minor in leadership studies, \nManhattan, KS; Lauren Luhrs, senior in human ecology and mass \ncommunications-public relations with minors in leadership studies and \nbusiness, Overland Park, KS; and Anthony Carter, senior in sociology \nwith a minor in nonprofit leadership, Colorado Springs, CO.\n  The Leadership Studies Minor at Kansas State University has been a \ntremendous success. The mission of the Leadership Studies at Kansas \nState University is to develop knowledgeable, ethical, caring, \ninclusive leaders for a diverse and changing world. Mr. President, this \nprogram is doing just that. I am proud of this program, my alma matter, \nand the three students who represented Kansas State University so well.\n  In the competition participating teams were given a 23-page document \nfrom the Harvard Business School which detailed specifics for \nleadership development at Goldman Sachs. The document provided key \ndetails for the case study, including the purpose of the leadership \ndevelopment program to be created. It also gave six factors that were \nessential in the design of the program: form and location, faculty, \ncontent and format, method, target audience, and governance and \nsponsorship.\n  I again congratulate these three students for their success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/12/senate-section/article/S15229-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO CHARLES M. EVERS\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I am honored to publicly recognize \nan Idahoan who has received one of our Nation's highest military \nhonors, the Silver Star Medal. United States Marine Corps SSG Charles \nM. Evers, of Lewiston, ID, was awarded this medal for ``conspicuous \ngallantry and intrepidity in action against the enemy while serving as \nPlatoon Commander, 3d Platoon, India Company, 3d Battalion, 5th \nMarines, Regimental Combat Team, 1 Marine Expeditionary Force Forward \nin Support of Operation Iraqi Freedom from 8 June to 12 June 2006.'' \nOver the course of a 4-day firefight, Sergeant Evers led his platoon in \nwithstanding and repulsing a platoon-sized enemy attack that, on the \nthird day, included a massive truck bomb that burst through the entry \ncontrol point at an observation post the Marines were defending. During \nthis fight, approximately 60 well-trained insurgents attempted, but \nwere unable to take the observation post held by Evers' 22 marines, a \nfight in which no Americans perished. Citing repeated decisive combat \nleadership under intense and sustained machine gun and small arms fire, \nGeneral James T. Conway, Commandant of the Marine Corps, recognized \nSergeant Evers' ``resolve'' and ``refusal to submit to the enemy's \nwill'' in the Silver Star Medal Citation.\n  As you know, the Silver Star is the Nation's third highest combat \nmedal behind the Medal of Honor and the Navy Cross, Distinguished \nService Cross or Air Force Cross. Sergeant Evers' extraordinary \nachievement recognizes his unflinching commitment to our Nation, his \nfellow soldiers and the mission for which he was trained. Sergeant \nEvers' courage and skill rivals his humility: when given the Silver \nStar, he said, ``I was just doing my job. I'm proud of my Marines. I \nled them and they did their job.''\n  I am honored and proud to call Sergeant Evers a fellow Idahoan, and I \nthank him for his bravery, patriotism and commitment to and support of \nthe military mission of the United States of America. Most of all, I \nthank him and his fellow Marines for continuing to defend my freedom \nand that of my family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/12/senate-section/article/S15229-3", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HONORING OLIN SIMS\n\n Mr. ENZI.

Mr. President, it is with the greatest pleasure \nthat I rise today to honor the University of Central Arkansas for its \n100th anniversary. The university is located in Conway, AR, which lies \nin the central part of my State.\n  The University of Central Arkansas began as the Arkansas State Normal \nSchool under the leadership of John James Doyne in 1907. In 1909, the \nfirst commencement ceremony was held to recognize 10 graduates. The \nschool conferred its first baccalaureate degree in 1922 and was renamed \nArkansas State Teachers College in 1925.\n  The school was renamed State College of Arkansas in 1967, but was \ngranted university status and renamed as the University of Central \nArkansas in 1975. Since then, UCA has continued to excel by \nestablishing the State's first Honors College, joining the National \nCollegiate Athletic Association, NCAA, and beginning its first doctoral \nprogram in 1998. Currently, the University of Central Arkansas has more \nthan 100 undergraduate courses of study, 33 master's degree programs, \nand 3 doctoral programs.\n  Arkansas has always made education a top priority and the University \nof Central Arkansas has a proud history of scholastic progress. The \nuniversity is an integral part of the Arkansas community and the \neducational opportunities available provide graduates with the skills \nneeded to succeed in today's workforce.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me today in congratulating \nthe University of Central Arkansas on its 100th anniversary and in \nwishing the university another 100 years of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/12/senate-section/article/S15229-5", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15229-S15230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MAINE MUTUAL GROUP INSURANCE COMPANY\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I recognize Maine Mutual Group \nInsurance Company, MMG, a premier regional property and casualty \ninsurance company that continues to grow and flourish. I am \nparticularly pleased that\n\n[[Page S15230]]\n\nMMG recently completed a major expansion of its headquarters this \nOctober.\n  Like many American success stories, MMG has humble roots. The company \nwas founded in Houlton, ME, in 1897, by a group of local farmers who \nwere concerned about the cost and limited availability of insurance in \nAroostook County. In 1906, the company moved to Presque Isle, where it \nremains today. In 1968, the company changed its name when it merged \nwith Maine Mutual Fire Insurance Company. It subsequently merged with \nUnited Mutual Insurance Company 10 years later. The company grew \nexponentially following these mergers, from a premium volume of under \n$1 million in 1968, to over $20 million by 1988, and over $107 million \nby 2006.\n  Evolving from a modest local business to a regional force, MMG \nexpanded into Vermont in 1981, New Hampshire in 1984, and Pennsylvania \nin 2006. In March 2002, the company restructured as a mutual holding \ncompany and adopted its present name. By 2006, MMG's policyholder \nsurplus reached a record high of $55.9 million, a 127-percent increase \nover the previous 5 years. And all the while, the company maintained \nits presence in Maine's northernmost county, Aroostook County, or ``the \nCounty'' as Mainers know it. The County finds itself hundreds of miles \nfrom urban and financial centers, and the fact that MMG remains in \nAroostook County speaks volumes to its commitment to the community and \npeople of this rural county.\n  Two months ago, MMG completed a $5 million expansion of its \nheadquarters in Presque Isle, adding 20,000 square feet to the facility \nand creating an additional 50 jobs. Anticipating further growth, the \nnew headquarters can accommodate about 200 employees. The phenomenal \ngrowth is first and foremost attributable to the hard work ethic of the \npeople in northern Maine and the company's outstanding leadership.\n  Additionally, in order to continue to grow its business, the company \nmust retain additional investment, and thankfully, through the new \nmarkets tax credit, NMTC, Coastal Enterprises of Wiscasset, ME, will \nsoon be enabled to make a sizeable investment in this company. The new \nmarkets tax credit program continues to promote investment and economic \ngrowth for rural communities throughout Maine. And that is why as a \nmember of the Senate Committee on Finance, I fought for and \nsuccessfully secured an extension of the NMTC through the end of 2008 \nto ensure this pivotal program wouldn't just expire at the end of this \nyear--but continue. I am not stopping there, and I am in the process of \nfighting for another extension. The credit's impact on our State cannot \nbe overstated. This expansion alone of a progressive, regional company \nin Maine Mutual Group reinforces the value and power of the New Markets \nTax Credit in strengthening our communities, exemplifying the best that \npublic-private cooperation can offer.\n  Maine Mutual Group's numerous achievements have not gone unnoticed. \nIn 1991, the firm gained the Governor's Award for Business Excellence. \nMore recently, MMG garnered the Maine Insurance Company of the Year \nAward in 2000 and 2005, and the New Hampshire Insurance Company of the \nYear Award in 2004. With all insurance companies operating within those \nStates being eligible for the awards, it is particularly impressive \nthat MMG bested larger national competitors several times over the last \ndecade.\n  In 2007, MMG was rated the top performer on Deep Customer Connections \nInc.'s Ease of Doing Business survey. In this survey, more than 8,000 \nindependent agents and brokers assessed the performance of over 220 \nproperty and casualty carriers, by comparing them in areas such as \nunderwriting responsiveness and promptness in handling claims, as well \nas providing effective technology. In addition, MMG was ranked the \nnumber one medium-sized company in Maine on the ``Best Places to Work \nin Maine'' list this year.\n  I congratulate MMG on a job well done, and I look forward to watching \nits bright future unfold. As MMG continues building on recent \nachievements, it is well positioned to pursue new market opportunities \nin the years ahead. MMG is truly a valued member of our business \ncommunity, and I am honored that it has served Maine so well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/12/senate-section/article/S15230-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JOHN MASSAUA\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I recognize a man who has gone \nabove and beyond for the State of Maine and the country as a whole. On \nDecember 31 of this year, John Massaua will step down from his position \nas the State director for the Maine Small Business Development Centers, \nSBDCs.\n  John joined the Maine SBDC as State director just over 6 years ago, \nwith a rare blend of private sector and nonprofit experience. I \nremember learning about John's background as a founding officer of \nStaples and becoming excited at the prospect of what he could do for a \nprogram that had long underachieved.\n  After more than 6 years as State director for the Maine SBDC, John's \nretirement will be a loss to Maine's 151,000 small businesses. For a \nprogram that counseled over 2,500 clients for more than 14,000 hours \nlast year, replacing his leadership will prove to be a difficult \nchallenge. John has demonstrated an unsurpassed dedication to his job, \nas reflected by the fact that the Maine SBDC returns $3.30 annually to \nthe Federal Government for each Federal dollar invested.\n  During John's tenure, the Maine SBDC achieved national recognition as \nan effective and worthwhile investment of taxpayer dollars. The Maine \nSBDC, which just celebrated its 30th anniversary, has helped create or \nretain 15,000 jobs and assisted 2,650 entrepreneurs in starting a \nbusiness. Since its inception, the Maine SBDCs have provided one-on-one \ncounseling to over 42,000 entrepreneurs, including over 200,000 hours \nof direct assistance and 3,000 workshops and courses. There is no doubt \nin my mind that Maine's nationally recognized program came of age under \nJohn's tutelage, and I will always be thankful that he built something \nof which the State of Maine can be proud.\n  John's personal accomplishments and awards that the Maine SBDC \nreceived over the past 6 years are far too numerous to count--for \nexample, during John's tenure he personally received the Thomas A. \nMcGillicuddy Award for Excellence, the Maine SBDC was a recipient of \nthe prestigious Margaret Chase Smith Quality Award, the Best of the Web \nAward, and in 2003 the Maine SBDC became only the fourth program in 4 \nyears to earn the ``T'' designation from the Association of Small \nBusiness Development Centers. This national accreditation authorizes \nthe Maine SBDC to formally provide technology support to Maine's small \nbusinesses and independent workers.\n  During the time that John was developing a program with a national \nreputation for regional excellence at the Maine SBDC, he also helped \nSBDCs on the national level through the Association of Small Business \nDevelopment Centers, ASBDC. The ASBDC is an association which \nrepresents the collective interests of SBDCs throughout the country, \nand on numerous occasions John was selected to serve on their board and \nwithin its various committees.\n  Not only was John beneficial to Maine's small business communities, \nbut he was a vital resource to me and my staff. I specifically remember \none instance, when in 2005, John testified before the Senate Committee \non Small Business and Entrepreneurship about the financial burden the \n63 State, regional, and territorial SBDCs were under. As expected, John \nprovided a well researched and persuasive argument as to why Congress \nshould provide additional funds to this vital and successful program. \nDue in large part to John's testimony and dedicated activism, we are \nfinally starting to see a commitment from Congress to provide more \nfunds to the SBDC program. For this, John should always be remembered \nand duly credited.\n  The State of Maine and small businesses across the country owe a debt \nof gratitude to John Massaua for his work to protect and improve \nsomething as crucial as the Small Business Development Center program. \nAlthough he will be missed, I applaud John's years of commitment and \nhard work in providing entrepreneurs with the management and \nprofessional expertise required to achieve success. I sincerely hope \nthat John and I can continue to work together ensuring that Maine \nmaintains a leading role in assisting our Nation's most committed and \ncreative small businesses.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/12/senate-section/article/S15231-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S15231]]\n                        RECOGNIZING JIM SHEEHAN\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to amend the Truth in Lending Act to provide \nprotection to consumers with respect to certain high-cost loans, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today we are facing a crisis in the mortgage \nmarkets on a scale that has not been seen since the Great Depression: \nover 2 million homeowners face foreclosure at a loss of over $160 \nbillion in hard-earned home equity; the Conference of Mayors recently \nreported, November 26, 2007, that they expect a decline of $1.2 \ntrillion in property values in 2008 because of the crisis; over one out \nof every 5 subprime loans is currently delinquent according to First \nAmerican Loan Performance, an industry research firm. These high \ndefault rates have frozen the subprime and jumbo mortgage markets and \ninfected the capital markets to the point where central banks around \nthe world have had to inject liquidity into the system to avoid the \ncrisis from spreading to other segments of the market.\n  One of the fundamental causes of this serious crisis is abusive and \npredatory subprime mortgage lending. The Homeownership Preservation and \nProtection Act of 2007, which I am introducing today with a number of \nmy colleagues, is designed to protect American homeowners from these \npractices, and prevent this disaster from happening again. The \nlegislation will: realign the interests of the mortgage industry with \nborrowers to insure the availability of mortgage capital on fair terms \nboth for the creation and sustainability of homeownership; establish \nnew lending standards to ensure that loans are affordable and fair, and \nprovide for adequate remedies to make sure the standards are met; and \ncreate\n\n[[Page S15236]]\n\na transparent set of rules for the mortgage industry so that capital \ncan safely return to the market without bad lending practices driving \nout the good.\n  The fundamental problem in the subprime market today is that the \nmortgage system has become extremely fragmented, with different \nentities responsible for selling, underwriting, originating, funding, \nand securitizing the loans. Too few of these entities have a stake in \nthe long-term success of the mortgage. A recent article in The \nEconomist, February 17, 2007, described the process succinctly:\n\n       Banks are traditionally supposed to know a bit about the \n     borrowers on their books. But, in many cases, their loans did \n     not stay on their books long enough for them to care. \n     Mortgages were written for a fee, sold to investment banks \n     for a fee, then packaged and floated for another fee. At each \n     link in the chain, the fees mattered more than the quality of \n     the loans. . . .\n\n  As the GAO concluded, ``Originators [mortgage brokers and lenders] \nhad financial incentives to increase loan volume, partially at the \nexpense of loan quality,'' October 10, 2007. For example, mortgage \noriginators have an incentive to get a borrower to take out a larger \nloan than he or she needs, and at a higher interest rate than that for \nwhich the borrower would qualify, because the originator gets a higher \ncommission for such loans.\n  Comptroller of the Currency John Dugan recently described the \ncorrosive impact of this system on underwriting standards. In a speech \nto the American Bankers Association October 9, 2007, Mr. Dugan said:\n\n       When a bank makes a loan that it plans to hold, the \n     fundamental standard it uses to underwrite the loan is that \n     most basic of credit standards that . . . the underwriting \n     must be strong enough to create a reasonable expectation that \n     the loan will be repaid. But when a bank makes a loan that it \n     plans to sell, then the credit evaluation shifts in an \n     important way: the underwriting must be strong enough to \n     create a reasonable expectation that the loan can be sold or \n     put another way, the bank will underwrite to whatever \n     standard the market will bear.\n\n  The vast majority of subprime loans were made to be sold, and, hence, \ntheir underwriting standards simply were not sufficient to ensure a \nreasonable prospect of repayment for too many Americans.\n  While the focus of much of the news coverage has been on the impact \nof the crisis on financial institutions and markets, I ask my \ncolleagues to keep in mind the affect this is having on individuals who \nare losing their homes, and on their neighbors, who are seeing their \nhome equity erode as foreclosures in their neighborhoods increase.\n  It is important to keep in mind that only about 10 percent of \nsubprime mortgages in the past several years have been made to first \ntime home buyers. This market has not been primarily about creating a \nnew set of homeowners; a majority of subprime loans have been \nrefinances. While maintaining access to subprime credit on fair terms \nis important, too much of the subprime market in the past several years \nhas actually put the homes and home equity of American families at \nrisk.\n  The legislation seeks to set high standards for brokers, lenders, \nappraisers, servicers, and Wall Street and provide for strong remedies \nto restore accountability to the system. Specifically, the legislation \nwill establish new protections for all borrowers including a \nprohibition on steering prime borrowers to subprime loans, which the \nWall Street Journal recently found was widespread in the market. The \nbill establishes a fiduciary duty for mortgage brokers towards \nborrowers. It provides for a duty of good faith and fair dealing toward \nborrowers for all lenders.\n  The bill will establish new protections for subprime borrowers and \nborrowers who get exotic mortgages. First and foremost, brokers and \nlenders will have to establish the borrowers' ability to repay the \nloan, including for interest-only and option ARMs. In addition, the \nbill prohibits prepayment penalties and YSPs on these loans, and \nrequires that these loans provide a net tangible benefit to the \nborrower.\n  The bill will tighten the definition of high cost loans and provide \nincreased protections for these borrowers, including a prohibition of \nballoon payments, financing of points and fees, prepayment penalties \nand yield spread premiums, YSPs.\n  The bill will provide strong remedies to make sure these standards \nare met. The bill puts more ``cops on the beat'' by allowing state \nattorneys general to enforce the provisions of the law, and it does not \npreempt State law. States should be allowed the flexibility to address \nnew abuses as they arise.\n  The bill will provide for limited liability for holders of a mortgage \nmade in violation of law, whether it is the original lender or a \nsubsequent investment trust. Unlike current law, which puts the burden \non the borrower to find the party responsible for causing the harm, the \nlegislation allows the borrower to go directly to the current mortgage \nholder for a cure.\n  The bill will also prohibit lenders from influencing appraisers, \nlimit the ``junk'' fees mortgage servicers can charge, and require them \nto credit payments promptly, require foreclosure prevention counseling \nor loss mitigation before a foreclosure can take place, and uuthorize \nthe hiring of additional FBI agents to fight mortgage fraud.\n  In the coming months, the housing crisis is going to get worse. We \nwill need to continue to press lenders and servicers to provide real \nrelief for homeowners threatened with foreclosure. FHA and the GSEs \nwill have to play an expanded role. But as we deal with the cleaning up \nthe current crisis, let us keep in mind the need to address the \nunderlying problems that have created the crisis, and move to address \nthose underlying causes by passing the ``Homeownership Protection and \nPreservation Act.''\n  Finally, I want to acknowledge the work of a number of my colleagues \non this issue. Senators Schumer, Brown, and Casey introduced a bill on \nthis topic earlier this year, S. 1299, from which I took some important \nprovisions. In addition, Senators Reed and Menendez both made important \ncontributions to the deliberations leading up to the introduction of \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na detailed summary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2452\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The legislation \n     tightens the definition of a ``high cost mortgage'' for which \n     certain consumer protections are triggered. The new \n     definition, which amends the ``Home Ownership Equity \n     Protection Act,'' (HOEPA) is as follows: first mortgages with \n     APRs that exceed Treasury securities by eight (8) percentage \n     points (with a range from 6 to 10 percent); second mortgages \n     with APRs that exceed Treasury securities by ten (10) \n     percentage points (with a range of 8 to 12 percent); or \n     mortgages where total points and fees payable by the borrower \n     are five percent (5 percent) of the total loan amount, or, \n     for smaller loans of less than $20,000, the lesser of eight \n     (8) percentage or $1,000. The bill revises the definition of \n     points and fees to include yield spread premiums and other \n     charges. It allows for up to two bona fide discount points \n     outside of the 5 percent trigger.\n     The following key protections are triggered for high cost \n         mortgages\n       No financing of points and fees. The bill prohibits a \n     creditor from directly or indirectly financing any portion of \n     the points, fees or prepayment penalties. These limitations \n     and prohibitions are designed to discourage lenders from \n     ``flipping'' the mortgage in order to extract additional \n     excessive fees.\n       Prohibition on prepayment penalties. The bill prohibits the \n     lender from imposing prepayment penalties for high cost \n     loans.\n       Prohibition of Yield Spread Premiums (YSPs). The bill \n     prohibits YSPs for placing a borrower in a high cost loan \n     that is more costly than that for which the borrower \n     qualifies. Mortgage brokers, who have originated about 70 \n     percent of subprime mortgages, receive higher compensation \n     through YSPs for steering borrowers to these higher cost \n     loans. This bill will eliminate the incentive to ``upsell'' \n     these borrowers.\n       Net Tangible Benefit. The originator must determine that a \n     high-cost refinance loan provides a net tangible benefit to \n     the borrower.\n       Prohibition on balloon payments. The bill prohibits the use \n     of balloon payments.\n       Limitation on single premium credit insurance. The bill \n     would prohibit the upfront payment or financing of credit \n     life, credit disability or credit unemployment insurance on a \n     single premium basis. However, borrowers are free to purchase \n     such insurance with the regular mortgage payment on a \n     periodic basis, provided that it is a separate transaction \n     that can be canceled at any time.\n\n\n            Title II--Subprime and Non-Traditional Mortgages\n\n       Definition of ``Subprime Mortgage'' and ``Nontraditional \n     Mortgage'': The legislation creates a new designation in the \n     law for subprime and nontraditional mortgages.\n       Subprime mortgages. Mortgages that have interest rates that \n     are 3 percentage points higher than Treasury securities of \n     comparable maturities for first mortgages and 5 percentage \n     points for second mortgages. This definition tracks the \n     Federal Reserve Board's definition of subprime lending for \n     the purposes of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) \n     reporting. In addition, the legislation includes an \n     alternative measure that is designed to prevent capturing too \n     many mortgages when the yield curve is unusually flat.\n       Nontraditional mortgages. These are mortgages that allow \n     deferral of the payment of interest or principal. Interest-\n     only and payment-option ARMs are the current examples of \n     nontraditional mortgages we see most often.\n     Requirements for making subprime or nontraditional mortgages\n       Ability to repay. A mortgage originator must establish that \n     a borrower has the ability to repay the loan based on the \n     fully-indexed rate, assuming full amortization. In making \n     this determination, the originator must consider the \n     borrower's income, credit history, debt-to-income (DTI) \n     ratio, employment status, residual income, and other \n     financial resources.\n       Require Escrows for Taxes and Insurance. While nearly all \n     prime mortgages include escrows for taxes and insurance, very \n     few subprime loans include such escrows. The legislation \n     would require these escrows for all subprime and \n     nontraditional loans.\n       Nearly all prime loans include escrows for taxes and \n     insurance. Yet, few subprime mortgages include these escrows. \n     Currently, unscrupulous mortgage originators entice \n     unsophisticated borrowers into taking out abusive loans with \n     promises of lower monthly payments, in part by comparing \n     their current payments, which often include escrows, with \n     proposed loans that do not include escrows in the monthly \n     payments and, therefore, appear lower. Then, when insurance \n     or tax payments are due, the borrowers, who often do not have \n     the resources to pay the taxes, are forced to seek new loans \n     to cover the required payments, generating a whole new set of \n     fees. Lack of escrows, in other words, becomes a tool for \n     ``flipping'' borrowers into yet another, high-cost loan.\n       Debt-to-Income Ratio. If a borrower's DTI ratio is greater \n     than 45 percent, a mortgage is assumed to be unaffordable \n     unless the originator can show, at a minimum, sufficient \n     residual income to afford the loan.\n       The ability to repay standard is largely based on guidance \n     published by the federal regulators in late 2006 and early \n     2007 and applied to the sub prime and nontraditional mortgage \n     markets.\n\n[[Page S15245]]\n\n     The following protections apply to borrowers who take out \n         subprime or nontraditional mortgages\n       No Prepayment Penalties. The legislation will prohibit all \n     prepayment penalties for subprime and nontraditional loans.\n       Prepayment penalties unfairly trap subprime borrowers in \n     expensive subprime mortgages. These penalties make it cost-\n     prohibitive to refinance into better loans, or strip out \n     equity when the penalty is paid. Studies done by the Center \n     for Responsible Lending (CRL) show that interest rates on \n     subprime loans are no lower for loans with prepayment \n     penalties--the ostensible rationale for these fees--than for \n     loans without these penalties, even after holding credit \n     scores, LTVs, and other factors constant. Moreover, the CRL \n     study shows that the odds of having a loan with a prepayment \n     penalty increases significantly for borrowers who live in \n     minority neighborhoods.\n       No Yield-Spread Premiums (YSPs). The legislation will \n     prohibit YSPs for subprime and nontraditional loans.\n       YSPs are payments made by lenders to mortgage brokers, \n     usually without the borrower's knowledge. In exchange for the \n     YSP, the lender charges the borrower a higher interest rate \n     than that for which he could have qualified. The industry \n     justifies YSPs as a way for the borrower to pay the broker's \n     fee and other closing costs without paying cash at the \n     closing table. However, numerous studies have shown that YSPs \n     result in higher costs for consumers. For example, a study \n     done by HUD (while Senator Martinez was Secretary) concluded \n     that half ($7.5 billion) of the $15 billion paid in YSPs at \n     the time of this study ``is not passed through . . . to \n     reduce closing costs.''. More recent research by HUD \n     indicates that fees tend to rise even as interest rates do--\n     exactly the opposite of what the industry says should \n     happen--and that this effect is more pronounced for minority \n     borrowers. Research sponsored by Freddie Mac also came to the \n     conclusion that borrowers who pay YSPs along with direct fees \n     pay more for loans, all other things being equal.\n       Net Tangible Benefit. The originator must determine that a \n     high-cost refinance loan provides a net tangible benefit to \n     the borrower.\n     Remedies\n       Individual borrowers who get loans in violation of these \n     provisions will be able to rescind (i.e. ``unwind'') the \n     loans. Alternatively, at the choice of the borrower, the \n     creditor or holder of the loan may cure the loan by making \n     the borrower whole.\n       Actual damages.\n       Statutory damages up to $5,000 per loan, regardless of the \n     number of violations per loan (up from $2,000 per loan in \n     current law), plus the sum of finance charges and fees.\n       Makes mortgage brokers liable for violations of TILA\n       No class actions for assignees who perform due diligence to \n     ensure they are not buying loans in violation of the law.\n       As in current law, creditors are subject to class actions \n     for making loans in violation of the law with damages capped \n     at the lesser of 1 percent of net worth or $5 million \n     (current law caps class damages at the lesser of 1 percent of \n     net worth or $500,000).\n       A key goal of the legislation is to realign the interests \n     of the mortgage production system with the interest of the \n     borrower. In recent years, as many observers have noted, the \n     incentives in the system have worked against the interests of \n     borrowers and resulted in larger loans, at higher rates, with \n     weaker underwriting, and without regard to the ability of the \n     borrower to repay the loans. As The Economist put it:\n       Mortgages were written for a fee, sold to investment banks \n     for a fee, then packaged and floated for another fee. At each \n     link in the chain, the fees mattered more than the quality of \n     the loans . . .\n       To insure that the quality of the loans does matter, a \n     reasonable amount of responsibility for making good loans \n     must travel with the mortgage. The legislation allows for \n     individual actions by borrowers who have been given illegal \n     loans to make themselves whole. There will be no class \n     liability for assignees who exercise due diligence to avoid \n     funding and buying these loans.\n       Moreover, it is crucial that the burden of curing an \n     illegal loan rest not with the victims, such as Dorothy King, \n     the elderly woman who testified before the Senate Committee \n     on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs in February, 2007. The \n     subprime borrower is often more vulnerable, less \n     sophisticated, lower income, and less likely to have access \n     to better lenders. For the subprime borrower, or most any \n     borrower, their home is their chief asset. If the borrower \n     faces the loss of her only real asset through a foreclosure, \n     for instance, as a result of a violation of the law, it is \n     simply not fair to put the burden on her to find a party that \n     can make her whole, spending months in the courts while she \n     faces the loss of her home. The sensible and fair thing to do \n     is to allow her to go to the only party that can give her \n     relief--the note holder. The note holder, which is typically \n     a large institutional entity such as a pension fund, \n     insurance company, hedge fund or the like, is in a far better \n     position to recover from another party who may have caused \n     the problem. In the long run, this process will bring more \n     discipline to the mortgage marketplace, the very kind \n     of discipline that has been missing over the past several \n     years.\n\n\n                        Title III--All Mortgages\n\n     All home loan borrowers get the following rights and \n         protections:\n       All mortgage originators--lenders and brokers--owe a duty \n     of good faith and fair dealing to borrowers. The duty of good \n     faith and fair dealing is widespread in state law with regard \n     to the execution of contracts. It would apply that duty to \n     the making of a mortgage contract, which is a new, but \n     reasonable application.\n       All mortgage originators have to make reasonable efforts to \n     make an advantageous loan to the borrower, considering that \n     borrower's circumstances. For example, this requirement would \n     prohibit a broker or lender from giving an adjustable rate \n     mortgage with a high likelihood of escalating costs to an \n     elderly person on a fixed income.\n       Mortgage brokers owe a fiduciary duty to their customers. \n     The bill designates mortgage brokers as fiduciaries of \n     borrowers. This means that brokers represent the borrower in \n     the transaction.\n       Today, brokers typically sell their services by telling \n     borrowers that they will do the shopping for the borrowers. \n     Indeed, the National Association of Mortgage Brokers (NAMB) \n     made the claim on their web site (until they were questioned \n     about it at a Senate Banking Committee hearing) that brokers \n     serve as ``mentors'' to borrowers to help them through the \n     complex process of getting a loan. An industry publication, \n     Inside B & C Lending, described mortgage brokers as being \n     particularly adept at convincing borrowers that they were \n     ``trusted advisors'' to the borrowers. The bill would simply \n     make the brokers live up to the role they often claim for \n     themselves--that of a fiduciary.\n       Prohibit steering. Mortgage originators are prohibited from \n     steering borrowers to more costly loans than that for which \n     the borrower qualifies. This provision is designed to \n     counteract the widespread problem of prime quality borrowers \n     being steered into subprime loans. This provision would \n     require originators to notify borrowers that they qualify for \n     higher quality loans, even if the originator does not offer \n     those prime loans.\n       Over the past several years, there have been estimates that \n     from 20 to 50 percent of subprime borrowers could have \n     qualified for prime loans. The Wall Street Journal \n     (``Subprime Debacle Traps Even Very Credit-Worthy,'' December \n     3, 2007) reported on a study it commissioned that found in \n     2006 that 61 percent of subprime loans went to ``people with \n     credit scores high enough to often qualify for conventional \n     loans with far better terms.'' HMDA data repeatedly shows \n     that minorities are given higher cost loans in \n     disproportionate numbers.\n       Limitations on Yield-Spread Premiums. Allows YSPs only in \n     the case of no-cost loans. (YSPs for high-cost, subprime, and \n     nontraditional mortgages would be prohibited). Where YSPs are \n     paid, brokers may not receive any other compensation from any \n     other source and prepayment penalties are prohibited.\n       As discussed above, mortgage brokers argue that YSPs are a \n     way for cash-constrained borrowers to cover closing costs, \n     including the broker fee. However, independent research has \n     consistently shown that mortgage brokers keep at least half \n     or more of the YSPs for themselves. For example, HUD research \n     showed that no more than half of all YSPs went to offset \n     closing costs. Other research commissioned by Freddie Mac, \n     showed that borrowers who paid a combination of direct fees \n     and YSPs paid significantly more in fees than borrowers who \n     got no-cost loans where a broker's compensation came \n     completely from the YSP. Research also indicates that there \n     is a significant racial component to YSPs. Racial minorities \n     pay even more in fees than similarly situated white \n     borrowers.\n       Limit Low- and No-Documentation Loans. The legislation \n     requires adequate documentation for mortgage loans. However, \n     it gives the Federal Reserve the authority to make exceptions \n     as deemed appropriate, presumably for prime loans.\n     Remedies\n       Individual borrowers who get loans in violation of these \n     provisions will be able to rescind (i.e. ``unwind'') the \n     loans. Alternatively, at the choice of the borrower, the \n     creditor or holder of the loan may cure the loan by making \n     the borrower whole.\n       Actual damages.\n       Statutory damages up to $5,000 per loan, regardless of the \n     number of violations per loan (up from $2,000 per loan in \n     current law).\n       Makes mortgage brokers liable under TILA for violations of \n     TILA.\n       No class liability for assignees.\n\n\n          Title IV--Good Faith and Fair Dealing In Appraisals\n\n     Requirements for Appraisers\n       Appraisers owe a duty of good faith and fair dealing to \n     borrowers.\n       No lender may encourage or influence an appraiser to \n     ``hit'' a certain value in connection with making a home \n     loan. In addition, a lender may not seek to influence an \n     appraiser's work, nor select an appraiser on the basis of an \n     expectation that he or she will appraise a property at a high \n     enough value to facilitate a home loan.\n       A crucial cause of the current mortgage meltdown has been \n     inflated appraisals. Many ethical appraisers complain that \n     lenders will only use appraisers who consistently value \n     properties at the levels necessary to allow the loan to \n     close. Appraisers who do not cooperate simply do not get \n     hired. This is particularly detrimental to the homeowner \n     because it leads the homeowner to believe he\n\n[[Page S15246]]\n\n     or she has equity where little or none may exist.\n       Appraisers must obtain bonds equal to one percent of the \n     value of the homes appraised.\n     Remedies available to borrowers\n       Lenders must adjust outstanding mortgages where appraisals \n     exceeded true market value by 10 percent or more.\n       When an appraisal exceeds market value by 10 percent (plus \n     or minus 2 percent) or more, a borrower has a cause of action \n     against the lender. A consumer who is awarded remedies under \n     this section shall collect from the appraiser's bond.\n       Actual and statutory damages up to $5,000.\n\n\n      Title V--Good Faith and Fair Dealing in Home Loan Servicing\n\n     Requirements for mortgage servicers\n       Mortgage Servicers owe a duty of good faith and fair \n     dealing to borrowers. James Montgomery, former Chairman of \n     Great Western Financial Corporation, and a former director of \n     Freddie Mac, said recently, ``Servicers make money on \n     foreclosure,'' (American Banker, December 4, 2007). This \n     standard would prevent servicers from unfairly profiting from \n     their servicing responsibilities.\n       Prompt crediting of payments. Servicers must credit all \n     payments on the day received. Payments must first be credited \n     to principal and interest due on the note.\n       Servicers can employ a scheme called ``pyramiding,'' by \n     which they hold a payment until it is late, use a portion of \n     the payment to cover the late fee, thereby causing the \n     remaining payment to be insufficient. When the next month's \n     payment is made, it is insufficient to cover the previous \n     shortfall and the new payment, generating another penalty \n     fee. The legislation will require both prompt posting of \n     payments and crediting of payments to principal and interest \n     before being charged to late fees or other charges.\n       All fees must be reasonable and for services actually \n     provided, and only if allowed by the mortgage contract. In \n     addition, an adequate notice and statement is required.\n       No force-placing of insurance without clear notice to the \n     borrower.\n       Currently, some servicers claim that the borrower does not \n     have insurance on the property and ``force-places'' such \n     insurance on the loan. Sometimes, that insurance is purchased \n     from an affiliate; oftentimes the servicer is given a \n     significant commission for doing so. Many times, as was the \n     case with the Fairbanks Capital case settled by the FTC in \n     2003, the borrowers already had insurance, but were charged \n     for the additional insurance in any case. As with the \n     pyramiding problems, these extra charges could often result \n     in the borrower being put into default.\n       Prior to initiating foreclosure. a servicer must attempt to \n     implement loss mitigation.\n       Even in the dire circumstances existing in the mortgage \n     market today, and despite the nearly universal calls for \n     action from regulators, government officials, and consumer \n     advocates, mortgage servicers have been extremely slow to \n     offer meaningful alternatives to foreclosure for most \n     borrowers. In fact, according to Moody's, only 1 percent of \n     subprime ARM borrowers have received any loan modifications \n     during the current crisis. Furthermore, a new study shows how \n     servicers use the foreclosure process to make additional fees \n     from the troubled borrowers, even borrowers in bankruptcy. \n     These conclusions are consistent with practices uncovered by \n     the FTC in its 2003 investigation of mortgage servicing \n     practices of Fairbanks Capital, one of the largest subprime \n     mortgage servicers at the time. This provision will insure \n     that adequate loss mitigation is offered to the borrower \n     prior to foreclosure.\n       Require servicers to report their loss mitigation \n     activities.\n       In order to see which servicers are meeting their \n     requirements under this provision, the legislation will \n     require public reporting of loss mitigation activities. The \n     lack of responsiveness in the current crisis indicates how \n     important public accountability is to maximize the number of \n     homes saved.\n     Remedies\n       Actual and statutory damages (up to $5,000).\n\n\n              Title VI--Foreclosure Prevention Counseling\n\n       Require that borrowers be notified of availability of \n     foreclosure prevention counseling both at closing and upon \n     default.\n       Require servicers, with the consent of the borrower, to \n     forward the borrower's name to a HUD-authorized foreclosure \n     counselor upon default.\n       It is widely agreed that reluctance by delinquent borrowers \n     to respond to communications from the lender or servicer \n     reduces the effectiveness of loss mitigation. The legislation \n     will help expedite contact with the borrower by having it \n     come from a 3rd party counselor.\n       The servicer must reimburse the counselor for its work.\n       Once a borrower is working with an approved housing \n     counselor, the servicer may not initiate foreclosure for 45 \n     days to give the parties an opportunity to work out a \n     mutually agreeable solution.\n\n\n                           Title VI--Remedies\n\n       Description of remedies are listed in each relevant title.\n\n\n      Title VIII--Give the FDIC and OCC UDAP Rulemaking Authority.\n\n       Currently, only the Federal Reserve may issue a regulation \n     establishing standards for determining unfair or deceptive \n     acts or practices (UDAP) for banks. The Office of Thrift \n     Supervision has the authority to do this for thrifts, and has \n     indicated its intention of issuing such a rule. This \n     provision would give other banking regulators the same \n     authority. These regulators have requested this authority, \n     and have indicated that they are willing to act.\n\n\n                            Other Provisions\n\n       The Federal Reserve Board will be responsible for writing \n     regulations to implement this Act.\n       The Act takes effect 6 months after date of enactment.\n       The legislation provides protections for renters in \n     foreclosed homes.\n       The legislation authorizes additional appropriations to the \n     FBI to fight mortgage fraud.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COLEMAN (for himself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 2455.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to improve and \nsecure an adequate supply of influenza vaccine; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today I join my colleague, Senator Pat \nRoberts, in introducing the Influenza Vaccine Security Act. Senator \nRoberts and I first introduced this legislation during the 109th \nCongress, in response to seasonal flu vaccine shortages, as well as the \ngrowing awareness of the need for pandemic flu preparedness. Some of \nthese provisions were incorporated into law, but the overall need to \naddress problems in education, tracking, and distribution related to \nseasonal influenza vaccine have not changed.\n  About 36,000 Americans die from the flu every year, and 200,000 more \nare hospitalized due to complications from the flu. These complications \nand deaths are largely preventable with a simple flu shot. Yet the \nprocess of getting a flu shot is not always simple. Since 2000, our \nNation has experienced multiple shortages of flu vaccine prior to \nThanksgiving, when demand is highest. What we have also experienced--\nand what received less attention--is the fact that at the end of the \nflu season, we often have surpluses. The millions of doses that were in \nsuch high demand earlier in the season go unused. We need to bring some \nstability into the vaccine market, to ensure that we have vaccine at \nperiods of high demand, and also sustain demand beyond the limited \nearly-season period.\n  The Influenza Vaccine Security Act will help create a stable flu \nvaccine market for manufacturers by increasing coordination between the \npublic and private sectors so that we can set targets and procedures \nfor dealing with both shortages and surpluses before they hit. It will \nalso create a buyback provision so that we can direct late-season \nsurplus vaccine to public health and bioterrorism prevention efforts, \ninstead of having it go to waste. The legislation will increase demand \nfor vaccine by improving education and outreach to populations with \nhistorically low rates of influenza vaccination.\n  Of course, vaccines do us no good if they can't get to the people who \nneed them, and in past shortages, we had problems matching existing \nstocks of vaccine to the high priority populations, like senior \ncitizens, who needed vaccines right away. The Influenza Vaccine \nSecurity Act also sets up a tracking system so the CDC and state and \nlocal health departments can share the information they need to ensure \nthat high priority populations will have access to vaccines. This \ntracking system is critical and will provide fundamental infrastructure \nnecessary not only to deal with our annual flu season, but avian or \nother pandemic outbreaks.\n  This legislation is supported by Trust for America's Health, the \nAmerican Lung Association, the American Public Health Association, the \nNational Association of County and City Health Officials, the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Physician Assistants, \nthe American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, the \nAssociation of American Medical Colleges, the Association for \nProfessionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, the Allergy & \nAsthma Network, Mothers of Asthmatics, the Asthma and Allergy \nFoundation of America, the Center for Biosecurity at the University of \nPittsburgh Medical Center, the Center for Infectious Disease Research & \nPolicy, the Immunization Coalition of Washington, DC, and the Service \nEmployees International Union.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have letters of support \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                December 11, 2007.\n     Hon. Hillary Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Pat Roberts,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Clinton and Roberts: The undersigned \n     organizations join in thanking you for your leadership in \n     protecting our nation's health. By introducing the Influenza \n     Vaccine Security Act of 2007, you address one of the most \n     critical issues confronting the public's health in the United \n     States--the challenge of ensuring an adequate and timely \n     influenza vaccine supply. According to the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the seasonal flu claims \n     as many as 36,000 lives each year and results in more than \n     200,000 hospitalizations. These numbers could skyrocket in \n     the case of an influenza pandemic.\n       The introduction of the Influenza Vaccine Security Act is \n     an important step toward improving the U.S. response to \n     outbreaks of seasonal flu. Among its provisions, the \n     legislation provides incentives to manufacturers to enter the \n     U.S. flu vaccine market and expand production capacity, \n     increases funding for vaccine research and development, and \n     increases flu surveillance and outreach, coordination, and \n     education. Also, public health officials must have the \n     flexibility to provide the medication where outbreaks are \n     most severe. Your bill provides the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services with the ability to prioritize vaccine \n     distribution to high-risk populations and to ensure \n     geographic equity.\n       In addition to preparation for seasonal flu, the \n     legislation takes important steps to prevent and respond to a \n     severe flu pandemic. We applaud the emphasis on outreach, as \n     the efficient, widespread distribution of seasonal flu \n     vaccines would allow healthcare providers to conduct \n     exercises to prepare for the event of a severe flu pandemic. \n     In addition, the provision allowing unused vaccines to be \n     redeployed to state and local health departments for mass \n     vaccination exercises will also be useful in preparation for \n     an influenza pandemic. Finally, allowing the Secretary to \n     purchase antiviral medications and N-95 respirator masks and \n     encouraging stockpiling\n\n[[Page S15248]]\n\n     of pediatric countermeasures will be critical to treating and \n     minimizing the effects of a pandemic influenza outbreak.\n       Prevention is the key to protecting and saving American \n     lives from seasonal flu outbreaks. Again, we want to commend \n     your leadership and thank you for introducing this very \n     important public health bill.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Academy of Pediatrics; American Academy of \n           Physician Assistants; American College of Occupational \n           and Environmental Medicine; Association of American \n           Medical Colleges; Association for Professionals in \n           Infection Control and Epidemiology; Allergy & Asthma \n           Network Mothers of Asthmatics; Asthma and Allergy \n           Foundation of America; Center for Biosecurity, \n           University of Pittsburgh Medical Center; Center for \n           Infectious Disease Research & Policy; Immunization \n           Coalition of Washington, DC; Service Employees \n           International Union; Trust for America's Health.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n\n                           American Public Health Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 3, 2007.\n     Hon. Hillary Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Pat Roberts,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Clinton and Roberts: On behalf of the \n     American Public Health Association (APHA), the oldest and \n     most diverse organization of public health professionals in \n     the world, dedicated to protecting all Americans, their \n     families and communities from preventable, serious health \n     threats and assuring community-based health promotion and \n     disease prevention activities and prevention health services \n     are universally accessible in the United States, I write to \n     thank you for your attention to and leadership on the \n     important public health issue of influenza. The Influenza \n     Vaccine Security Act is an important step to ensuring that \n     the country has an adequate supply of vaccine for seasonal \n     flu and addresses important issues related to pandemic \n     influenza.\n       We are pleased your legislation contains provisions to \n     increase the production of seasonal influenza vaccine that \n     will improve public health, as well as a provision expanding \n     the current influenza surveillance system. Improved \n     surveillance is not only important for seasonal influenza, \n     but is vital to an early, rapid response to an influenza \n     pandemic. APHA applauds the inclusion of a provision \n     directing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \n     increase the supply of antiviral medications and N-95 \n     respirator masks to ensure sufficient supply for responders \n     and children. In addition, we support the creation of a \n     tracking system for vaccine distribution, with a focus on \n     ensuring that vaccine is distributed to high priority \n     populations. Finally, your legislation would increase \n     outreach and education and improve its coordination, \n     especially the focus on increasing vaccination rates among \n     providers and medically underserved communities. We believe \n     this is a critical step in eliminating disparities in this \n     area.\n       Thank you again for your leadership on this important \n     public health issue. We look forward to working with you as \n     the Influenza Vaccine Security Act moves through the \n     legislative process. If you have any questions or need \n     additional information, please contact me or have your staff \n     contact Don Hoppert or Michealle Carpenter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Georges C. Benjamin,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    American Lung Association,\n\n                                   New York, NY, December 4, 2007.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: The American Lung Association \n     strongly supports your Influenza Vaccine Security Act of \n     2007. Thank you for recognizing the importance of prevention \n     in saving lives from annual flu outbreaks. Once enacted into \n     law, this legislation will confront a pressing public health \n     issue in the United States--establishing a continuous and \n     adequate supply of influenza vaccine. It will also allow the \n     United States to take initiative in improving its response to \n     outbreaks, such as accelerating participation in the global \n     influenza pandemic prevention effort.\n       According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     (CDC), the seasonal flu takes the lives of 36,000 people \n     every year. Such alarming numbers can have an effect on the \n     public health of the United States, as well as impact health \n     care costs. The American Lung Association is confronting this \n     issue through our national Faces of Influenza public \n     awareness campaign, which urges Americans to get their annual \n     influenza vaccination. The Lung Association also provides a \n     free, online Flu Clinic Locator, making it easier for the \n     American public to find flu shot clinics in their local area.\n       The Influenza Vaccine Security Act of 2007 addresses many \n     issues associated with influenza prevention and treatment. \n     This legislation offers vaccine manufacturers important \n     incentives to enter the U.S. flu vaccine market, expand their \n     production capacity, increase surveillance and outreach \n     efforts and coordination, and boost funding for ongoing \n     research and development of vaccines. This legislation also \n     provides the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services the \n     authority to prioritize the distribution of vaccines, \n     particularly among at-risk groups.\n       Your legislation also recognizes the importance of ensuring \n     that unused vaccines be redeployed to state and local health \n     departments. These provisions will be critical in responding \n     to domestic outbreaks and preparing for an influenza \n     pandemic.\n       The American Lung Association commends your efforts \n     regarding this high-priority concern and looks forward to \n     working with you to see the Influenza Vaccine Security Act of \n     2007 enacted into law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Bernadette A. Toomey,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n         National Association of County & City Health Officials,\n                                Washington, DC, December 11, 2007.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Pat Roberts,\n     Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Clinton and Roberts: I am writing today on \n     behalf of the National Association of County and City Health \n     Officials (NACCHO) to endorse the Influenza Vaccine Security \n     Act of 2007.\n       This bill would begin to address uncertainty in influenza \n     vaccine supply. NACCHO believes that federal vaccine policy \n     must explicitly recognize, support, and strengthen the unique \n     roles of governmental public health agencies in monitoring \n     vaccine availability at the local level, assuring that \n     immunizations are received by the most vulnerable and high-\n     risk populations, and intervening to correct maldistribution, \n     particularly during shortages and supply disruptions. \n     Tracking influenza vaccine supplies would assist local health \n     departments to learn which end-users may have excess vaccine \n     that they are willing to donate or sell so that it can be \n     reallocated voluntarily to nursing homes, health departments, \n     visiting nurses, or any other entity that serves a high-risk \n     population. During the 2004-2005 flu season, NACCHO and local \n     health departments learned many lessons about what \n     information is needed when vaccine shortages occur. We \n     appreciate the inclusion of a tracking system in your bill \n     that has potential to collect data at the local level and \n     provide estimates of supply on a county by county basis. The \n     funding authorized in your bill will provide a good start on \n     a national system of tracking influenza vaccine supply, which \n     will help prevent illness and death when supply shortages or \n     disruptions occur.\n       We also appreciate the inclusion in your bill of \n     demonstration grants to enhance the infrastructure of public \n     health departments and health care providers in order to \n     improve their ability to report and track influenza vaccine \n     supply. The ability of local health departments to serve \n     their communities will also be strengthened by the influenza \n     vaccine education and outreach grants included in the \n     Influenza Vaccine Security Act of 2007.\n       The shortages and maldistribution of influenza vaccine is a \n     critical issue that our nation will undoubtedly face again in \n     the future. This legislation would provide important tools to \n     help ensure that individuals that need influenza vaccine are \n     protected in the future. Thank you for your past support of \n     local public health. The nation's local health departments \n     look forward to continuing to work with you to safeguard the \n     public's health.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Patrick M. Libbey,\n                                               Executive Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Brown, \n        Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Levin, Mr. Bayh, \n        Mr. Burr, Mr. Martinez, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Leahy, \n        Mrs. Lincoln, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Rockefeller, \n        Mr. Isakson, and Mr. Bond):\n  S. 2460. A bill to extend by one year the moratorium on \nimplementation of a rule relating to the Federal-State financial \npartnership under Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram and on finalization of a rule regarding graduate medical \neducation under Medicaid and to include a moratorium on the \nfinalization of the outpatient Medicaid rule making similar changes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senators \nDole, Durbin, Feinstein, Stabenow, Salazar, Kerry, Brown, McCaskill, \nSchumer, Boxer, Levin, Bayh, Burr, Martinez, Clinton, Pryor, Leahy, \nLincoln, Hutchison, Chambliss, Rockefeller, and Isakson to introduce \nlegislation vitally important to the ability of our States to continue \nto fund their Medicaid programs and ensure access to health care \nservices for low-income constituents. The legislation would extend the \nexisting 1 year moratorium for an additional year on a\n\n[[Page S15249]]\n\nCMS rule limiting Medicaid payments to public and teaching hospitals as \nwell as the ability of States to fund critical healthcare programs for \nrural residents such as through Sole Community Hospital programs.\n  On January 18, 2007, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, \nCMS, published a proposed rule entitled ``Medicaid Program; Cost Limit \nfor Providers Operated by Units of Government and Provisions to Ensure \nthe Integrity of Federal- State-Financial Partnership'' that would make \nsweeping changes to public and other safety net provider payment and \nfinancing arrangements with State Medicaid programs. The proposed rule \nwould: impose a cost limit on Medicaid payments to public and other \nsafety net providers; impose a new Federal definition of public \nprovider status; and, greatly restrict the sources of non-Federal share \nfunding through intergovernmental transfers, IGTs, and certified public \nexpenditures, CPEs.\n  National advocates report that over 400 comment letters were \nsubmitted to CMS on the proposed rule, none of which expressed support \nfor the rule and the overall majority of which called for its \nwithdrawal. In addition, a budget neutral reserve fund to block this \nregulation was introduced by me and approved by the Senate this year.\n  CMS subsequently issued an additional regulation that would force \nbillions of dollars in additional Medicaid payment reductions to \nteaching hospitals, many of whom are public hospitals, hampering the \nability of those providers to provide essential services including the \neducation of the next generation of medical professionals despite a \nshortage of medical professionals. The proposed regulations would cut \nat least $5 billion in Medicaid funding for safety net hospitals \nnationwide over 5 years--weakening their effectiveness for all of us \nand jeopardizing the health of millions of vulnerable children and \nfamilies.\n  In response to these rules, 66 Senators and 283 Members of the House \nhave gone on record in opposition to the rules since they were released \nearlier this year. This includes a majority of the Finance Committee \nincluding Senators: Roberts, Snowe, Smith, Rockefeller, Kerry, \nBingaman, Salazar, Stabenow, Wyden, Lincoln, Schumer, and Cantwell.\n  Furthermore, Congress showed its strong opposition to the rules by \nincluding a one-year moratorium in the recent supplemental \nappropriations bill, P.L. 110-28. The moratorium prohibits \nimplementation of the rules for one year from the date of enactment of \nthe supplemental. The supplemental was negotiated extensively by \nCongress and the White House and a deal was reached on May 23. On May \n25--the day the President signed the supplemental, and the moratorium, \ninto law--the administration put the final rule on display and \npublished it in the Federal Register on May 29. The most damaging \ncomponents of the proposed rule remain in the final rule, including \nMedicaid cuts limiting public and other safety net providers to cost.\n  Since then, CMS has issued a third rule of major concern to public \nand teaching hospitals. On September 28, 2007, CMS released a new \nproposed rule governing the calculation of the Medicaid outpatient \nupper payment limit, UPL. Many believe this action was in violation of \nthe current moratorium enacted by Congress. For example, the outpatient \nregulation would exclude GME costs from the calculation of the Medicaid \nOutpatient UPL for all hospitals and would also eliminate many \nancillary services from the UPL calculation for all-inclusive rate \nproviders.\n  Major Medicaid reforms require a congressional role. By rushing to \npublish a final regulation, CMS has disregarded congressional \nopposition and attempted to usurp Congress's role. In addition, the \nstatus quo is now the administration's new policy, not what existed \nwhen Congress was in the process of enacting the moratorium. CMS's \naction requires states to prepare for implementation of the regulation \nand expend administrative resources to do so--all of this before \nCongress has the opportunity to address the key policy issues contained \nin the regulation.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nletters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2460\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF MORATORIUM ON IMPLEMENTATION OF RULE \n                   RELATING TO THE FEDERAL-STATE FINANCIAL \n                   PARTNERSHIP UNDER MEDICAID AND SCHIP AND ON \n                   FINALIZATION OF A RULE RELATING TO THE \n                   TREATMENT OF GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION UNDER \n                   MEDICAID; MORATORIUM ON THE FINALIZATION OF THE \n                   OUTPATIENT MEDICAID RULE MAKING SIMILAR CHANGE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) A proposed rule was published on January 18, 2007, on \n     pages 2236 through 2248 of volume 72, Federal Register, and a \n     rule purporting to finalize that rule was published on May \n     29, 2007, on pages 29748 through 29836 of volume 72, Federal \n     Register (relating to parts 433, 447, and 457 of title 42, \n     Code of Federal Regulations). This rule would significantly \n     change the Federal-State financial partnership under the \n     Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Programs \n     by--\n       (A) imposing a cost limit on payments made under such \n     programs to governmentally operated providers;\n       (B) limiting the permissible sources of the non-Federal \n     shares required under such programs and the types of entities \n     permitted to contribute to such shares; and\n       (C) imposing new requirements on participating providers \n     and States under such programs.\n       (2) A proposed rule was published on May 23, 2007, on pages \n     28930 through 28936 of volume 72, Federal Register (relating \n     to parts 438 and 447 of title 42, Code of Federal \n     Regulations) that would significantly change the scope of \n     permissible payments under Medicaid by removing the ability \n     for States to make payments related to graduate medical \n     education.\n       (3) Permitting these rules to take effect would drastically \n     alter the Federal-State financial partnership in Medicaid and \n     the State Children's Health Insurance Programs, undermine the \n     discretion traditionally accorded States, and have a negative \n     impact on States, providers, and beneficiaries in the \n     following manner:\n       (A) Implementation of the rule regarding the Federal-State \n     financial partnership would force billions of dollars of \n     payment reductions, thus hampering the ability of impacted \n     providers to provide essential services including allowing \n     those providers to be ready and available for emergency \n     situations and to provide care to the increasing numbers of \n     uninsured.\n       (B) Implementation of the rule regarding graduate medical \n     education would force billions of dollars in payment \n     reductions to teaching hospitals, thus hampering the ability \n     of those providers to provide essential services including \n     the education of the next generation of medical professionals \n     despite a shortage of medical professionals.\n       (4) By including a one-year moratorium in the U.S. Troop \n     Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq \n     Accountability Appropriations Act of 2007, Congress intended \n     to forestall administrative action to allow itself time to \n     assess the proposals and consider alternatives that would not \n     negatively impact States, providers, and beneficiaries.\n       (5) After Congressional approval of the moratorium \n     contained in the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, \n     Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act \n     of 2007, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services on May \n     25, 2007, submitted for publication its final rule, which was \n     not significantly different from the January proposed \n     regulation.\n       (6) The publication of a final rule in May regarding the \n     Federal-State financial partnership was not anticipated by \n     Congress and accelerates the negative impact on States, \n     providers, and beneficiaries, thus undermining the intent of \n     the moratorium passed by Congress.\n       (7) The publication of a proposed rule in May regarding \n     graduate medical education was not anticipated by Congress \n     and undermines the intent of the moratorium passed by \n     Congress.\n       (8) A proposed rule was published on September 28, 2007, on \n     pages 55158 through 55166 of volume 72, Federal Register \n     (relating to parts 440 and 447 of title 42, Code of Federal \n     Regulations) that would significantly change the scope of \n     permissible payments under Medicaid by redefining outpatient \n     hospital services and dictating methodologies for calculation \n     of the outpatient services upper payment limit.\n       (9) Congress did not anticipate continued changes after the \n     moratorium to reduce state flexibility to make adequate \n     Medicaid payments.\n       (10) Expansion and extension of the moratorium is necessary \n     to effectuate Congressional intent.\n       (b) Extension of Prohibition.--Section 7002(a)(1) of the \n     U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and \n     Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act of 2007 (Public Law \n     110-28) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``1 year'' and inserting ``2 years'',\n\n[[Page S15250]]\n\n       (2) by inserting ``or (D)'' after ``described in \n     subparagraph (A)'' in subparagraph (B);\n       (3) by striking ``or'' at the end of subparagraph (B);\n       (4) by striking the period at the end of subparagraph (C) \n     and inserting ``; or''; and\n       (5) by inserting at the end the following:\n       ``(D) finalize or otherwise implement provisions contained \n     in the proposed rule published on September 28, 2007, on \n     pages 55158 through 55166 of volume 72, Federal Register \n     (relating to parts 440 and 447 of title 42, Code of Federal \n     Regulations).''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 16, 2007.\n     Hon. Michael O. Leavitt,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Leavitt: We are writing to express our \n     strong opposition to the Medicaid changes contained in the \n     Proposed Rule CMS-2258-P, which was issued on January 18, \n     2007, As you know, bipartisan objections to the changes \n     called for in this proposed rule have been raised by Congress \n     and our nation's Governors since 2005. We urge you to \n     withdraw this rule immediately.\n       The Medicaid program is the foundation of our health care \n     safety net. As our nation's largest insurer, it provides \n     access to meaningful and affordable health care for more than \n     50 million people. It also keeps hospitals, doctors, nursing \n     homes, and clinics operating in our communities. Without this \n     critical source of funding, many providers would not be able \n     to afford to offer high-quality health care, especially in \n     rural areas.\n       Since its enactment in 1965, Medicaid has been a federal-\n     state partnership. The federal government has worked together \n     with the states to ensure health care coverage and access for \n     the most vulnerable Americans--children, pregnant women, the \n     elderly and the disabled. This shared responsibility has been \n     paramount, with states implementing the program within broad \n     federal guidelines.\n       The new proposed rule would usurp state flexibility and \n     fundamentally alter the nature of state funding for the \n     Medicaid program. We are particularly concerned with three \n     aspects of the proposed rule: (1) the new definition of a \n     ``unit of government;'' (2) the restrictions placed on \n     states' ability to fund their share of Medicaid expenditures; \n     and (3) the ``cost'' limit imposed on Medicaid provider \n     payments. We are also alarmed by CMS' refusal to provide any \n     state-specific data on the impact of this proposed rule, \n     which we believe could be much greater than a $5 billion \n     reduction in federal Medicaid spending.\n       The new definition of a ``unit of government'' contained in \n     the proposed rule is at odds with the definition adopted by \n     Congress in Title XIX (Section 1903(w)(7)(G)), as described \n     in House Report 102-310. The proposed rule adopts a federal \n     definition in which only those governmental entities with \n     taxing authority would be deemed governmental enough to \n     contribute to the non-federal share of Medicaid expenditures. \n     This is not what Congress intended. The statutory definition \n     of a ``unit of government'' respects the fundamental right of \n     states to establish subdivisions to suit their needs and best \n     carry out governmental functions. In the case of Medicaid, \n     federal law grants states the authority and flexibility to \n     provide health care through the most efficient and effective \n     methods possible. In most states, this means that state \n     university hospitals, public nursing homes, school-based \n     health centers, and other providers become an essential part \n     of the governmental health care infrastructure. We believe \n     the narrow definition of ``unit of government'' proposed by \n     this new rule would lead to substantial cuts for \n     public providers and limit access to the vital health care \n     services that millions of Americans depend upon.\n       Similarly, CMS is also singling out public providers by \n     restricting the type of public funds that can be used to \n     finance the state share of Medicaid expenditures. Under the \n     proposed rule, only funding derived from state and local \n     taxes would be allowed to fund the state share. By your \n     agency's own admission, inappropriate federal matching \n     arrangements have been largely eliminated over the last three \n     years through CMS' oversight activities. Given these \n     activities, it is unclear why the new restriction on public \n     funds is necessary or how it will further the overall efforts \n     of CMS to reduce Medicaid fraud and abuse.\n       Furthermore, this aspect of the proposed rule also seems to \n     contradict federal law. Section 1902(a)(2) of the Social \n     Security Act allows states to rely on ``local sources'' for \n     up to 60 percent of the non-federal share of program \n     expenditures. Current law does not limit the types of local \n     sources that may be used to only those sources derived from \n     tax revenue. Such a policy shift would hamper states \n     abilities to fund their Medicaid programs, and we question \n     CMS' authority to pursue such a far-reaching policy change.\n       Finally, we are concerned about the cost limit imposed on \n     public providers by this proposed rule. Under current \n     regulations, states are permitted to provide Medicaid \n     reimbursement to hospitals and other providers up to the \n     amount that would be payable using Medicare payment policies. \n     The proposed rule would reduce that limit to Medicaid costs \n     for governmental providers only, with no concurrent change \n     for private providers. Public providers, who \n     disproportionately serve the uninsured, should not be subject \n     to a more restrictive cost limit than private providers. Such \n     a reimbursement policy would have an adverse impact on \n     system-wide health care needs, such as trauma care, school-\n     based health care and medical education.\n       We understand and respect the efforts of CMS to ensure that \n     the Medicaid program is operating on a fiscally sound and \n     responsible basis; however, we believe the proposed rule has \n     gone far beyond what is necessary to secure fiscal integrity. \n     Instead, the proposed rule would undermine both the federal-\n     state partnership and the shared goal of ensuring health care \n     coverage and access, which are the hallmarks of the Medicaid \n     program.\n       While we are willing to work with you and CMS to strengthen \n     Medicaid, fundamental changes in Medicaid's financing and \n     payment mechanisms as envisioned in this rule can only be \n     adopted by Congress. For this reason, we request that you \n     withdraw the regulation.\n       We thank you for your prompt consideration of and attention \n     to this request. We also ask that our comments be placed in \n     the public record of the rulemaking.\n           Sincerely,\n         Senators John D. Rockefeller, IV, Gordon H.

A bill to provide that before the Secretary of Defense may \nfurlough any employee of the Department of Defense on the basis of a \nlack of funds, the Secretary shall suspend any nonessential service \ncontract entered into by the Department of Defense, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, for the last few weeks, the administration \nhas increased its rhetoric about a looming budget shortfall at the \nDepartment of Defense unless Congress passes an emergency spending \nbill. Most recently, the President threatened to lay off hundreds of \nthousands of Federal workers at DoD to make up for any shortfalls. This \nis simply unacceptable.\n  The Pentagon said as late as last week that the Department has \nsufficient funds in order to keep our fighting men and women in Iraq \nand Afghanistan supplied through late February to mid-March of next \nyear. Nonetheless, the administration continues to threaten to layoff \nworkers to make up for a non-existent gap in funding. The Department of \nDefense should not use Federal employees as pawns because the White \nHouse is playing politics with the budget.\n  As Chairman of the Governmental Affairs Oversight of Government \nManagement and Federal Workforce Subcommittee and the Armed Services \nReadiness Subcommittee, I have made oversight Government contracting a \npriority. In several hearings, I have heard officials and \nwhistleblowers testify about the systemic waste, fraud and abuse, in \nmany contracts. If the administration wants to save money, it should \nstart increasing oversight over contracts and drop those that are not \nperforming.\n  Rather than increasing their efforts to eliminate waste, fraud, and \nabuse in contracting that costs us billions every year, this \nadministration would rather lay off patriotic civilian Federal \nemployees who have dedicated their careers to the Federal Government. \nThe Federal Government is already facing looming crisis in retirements \nand is working hard to recruit new workers to fill vacancies. Using \nFederal workers to make a political statement is wrong. It sends a \nnegative message to prospective employees and hurts recruitment efforts \nin the long run.\n  Instead of looking to cut the Federal workforce to save money, the \nPresident should be holding contractors accountable to reduce costs and \nensure\n\n[[Page S15251]]\n\nthat our fighting men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan have the \nsupplies they need.\n  Today, I am introducing a bill that would send a clear message to the \nadministration that Federal workers are not bargaining chips.\n  The idea behind this legislation is simple, rather than laying off \nFederal workers to close a budget shortfall, the Pentagon should \nsuspend contracts for non-essential services.

Res. 402\n\n       Whereas Representative Henry John Hyde of Illinois was born \n     in Chicago, Cook County, Illinois, on April 18, 1924;\n       Whereas Henry Hyde excelled as a student both at Georgetown \n     University, at which he helped take the Hoyas basketball team \n     to the National Collegiate Athletic Association semifinals in \n     1943 and from which he graduated with a bachelor of science \n     degree in 1947, and at Loyola University Chicago School of \n     Law, from which he graduated in 1949;\n       Whereas Henry Hyde served his country for his entire adult \n     life, as an officer of the United States Navy from 1944 to \n     1946, where he served in combat in the Philippines during \n     World War II, in the United States Navy Reserve from 1946 to \n     1968, from which he retired at the rank of Commander, as a \n     member of the Illinois House of Representatives from 1967 to \n     1974 and Majority Leader of that body from 1971 to 1972, as a \n     delegate to the Illinois Republican State Conventions from \n     1958 to 1974, and as a Republican Member of the United States \n     House of Representatives for 16 Congresses, over 3 decades \n     from January 3, 1975, to January 3, 2007;\n       Whereas Henry Hyde served as the Ranking Member on the \n     Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of \n     Representatives from 1985 to 1991, in the 99th through 101st \n     Congresses, and as chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary \n     of the House of Representatives from the 104th through 106th \n     Congresses and the Committee on International Relations from \n     the 107th through 109th Congresses;\n       Whereas, in his capacity as a United States Representative, \n     Henry Hyde tirelessly served as a champion for children, both \n     born and unborn, and relentlessly defended the rule of law;\n       Whereas Henry Hyde demonstrated his commitment to the rule \n     of law during his tenure in the House of Representatives, \n     once stating, ``The rule of law is no pious aspiration from a \n     civics textbook. The rule of law is what stands between us \n     and the arbitrary exercise of power by the state. The rule of \n     law is the safeguard of our liberties. The rule of law is \n     what allows us to live our freedom in ways that honor the \n     freedom of others while strengthening the common good. . . If \n     across the river in Arlington Cemetery there are American \n     heroes who died in defense of the rule of law, can we give \n     less than the full measure of our devotion to that great \n     cause?'';\n       Whereas Henry Hyde was a key player in some of the highest \n     level debates concerning the response to the terrorist \n     attacks on our Nation on September 11, 2001;\n       Whereas Henry Hyde received the Presidential Medal of \n     Freedom, the Nation's highest civilian honor, on November 5, \n     2007, at a ceremony at which President George W. Bush \n     explained about Representative Hyde, ``He used his persuasive \n     powers for noble causes. He stood for a strong and purposeful \n     America--confident in freedom's advance, and firm in \n     freedom's defense. He stood for limited, accountable \n     government, and the equality of every person before the law. \n     He was a gallant champion of the weak and forgotten, and a \n     fearless defender of life in all its seasons.'';\n       Whereas Henry Hyde's greatest legacy is as the author, \n     during his freshman term in the House of Representatives, of \n     an amendment to the 1976 Departments of Labor and Health, \n     Education, and Welfare Appropriations Act--commonly referred \n     to as the Hyde Amendment--that prohibits Federal dollars from \n     being used to pay for the abortion of unborn babies, which \n     conservative figures estimate has saved at least 1,000,000 \n     lives;\n       Whereas Henry Hyde lived by the belief that we will all be \n     judged by our Creator in the end for our actions here on \n     Earth, which he once explained on the floor of the House of \n     Representatives by saying, ``Our moment in history is marked \n     by a mortal conflict between a culture of life and a culture \n     of death. God put us in the world to do noble things, to love \n     and to cherish our fellow human beings, not to destroy them. \n     Today we must choose sides.'';\n       Whereas Henry Hyde selflessly battled for the causes that \n     formed the core of his beliefs until the end of his life, and \n     was greatly respected by his friends and adversaries alike \n     for his dedication and will remain a role model for advocates \n     of those causes by virtue of his conviction, passion, wisdom, \n     and character; and\n       Whereas Henry Hyde was preceded in death by his first wife, \n     Jeanne, and his son Hank, and is survived by his second wife, \n     Judy, his sons Robert and Anthony and daughter Laura, 3 \n     stepchildren, Susan, Mitch, and Stephen, 7 grandchildren, and \n     7 step-grandchildren: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) notes with deep sorrow the death of Henry John Hyde on \n     November 29, 2007, in Chicago;\n       (2) extends its heartfelt sympathy to the family of Henry \n     Hyde;\n       (3) recognizes the life of service and the outstanding \n     contributions of Henry Hyde; and\n       (4) directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to the family of Henry Hyde.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, I am introducing a Senate \nresolution to honor the life and work of Congressman Henry John Hyde of \nIllinois. I authored this resolution because I knew Henry Hyde for over \n20 years. In fact, he and I were 2 of 16 Republicans who were first \nelected to the House of Representatives in 1974.\n  Congressman Hyde was a true leader in the House of Representatives. \nHe proved his leadership by authoring the ``Hyde Amendment'' to help \nprotect the lives of unborn children. Because of this long-standing \npolicy, innocent lives have been saved and taxpayers have not been \nforced to fund abortions.\n  Henry Hyde was intelligent, as was proved during his tenure as \nchairman of two different committees--the House Committee on the \nJudiciary and the House Committee on International Relations. In his 32 \nyears in the House of Representatives, he was dedicated to the rule of \nlaw as well as the expansion of freedom around the world.\n  He was a great Representative for the people of his district, and he \nleaves an important legacy for our Nation. It is with great respect \nthat I introduce this resolution in his honor.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/12/senate-section/article/S15252-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S15252]]\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 403--A RESOLUTION CONGRATULATING BOYS TOWN ON ITS \n                      90TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION\n\n  Mr. HAGEL (for himself and Mr. Nelson of Nebraska) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

CONVENTION ON SUPPLEMENTARY COMPENSATION FOR \n                   NUCLEAR DAMAGE CONTINGENT COST ALLOCATION.\n\n       (a) Findings and Purpose.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (A) section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. \n     2210) (commonly known as the ``Price-Anderson Act'')--\n       (i) provides a predictable legal framework necessary for \n     nuclear projects; and\n       (ii) ensures prompt and equitable compensation in the event \n     of a nuclear incident in the United States;\n       (B) the Price-Anderson Act, in effect, provides operators \n     of nuclear powerplants with insurance for damage arising out \n     of a nuclear incident and funds the insurance primarily \n     through the assessment of a retrospective premium from each \n     operator after the occurrence of a nuclear incident;\n       (C) the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for \n     Nuclear Damage, done at Vienna on September 12, 1997, will \n     establish a global system--\n       (i) to provide a predictable legal framework necessary for \n     nuclear energy projects; and\n       (ii) to ensure prompt and equitable compensation in the \n     event of a nuclear incident;\n       (D) the Convention benefits United States nuclear suppliers \n     that face potentially unlimited liability for nuclear \n     incidents that are not covered by the Price-Anderson Act by \n     replacing a potentially open-ended liability with a \n     predictable liability regime that, in effect, provides \n     nuclear suppliers with insurance for damage arising out of \n     such an incident;\n       (E) the Convention also benefits United States nuclear \n     facility operators that may be publicly liable for a Price-\n     Anderson incident by providing an additional early source of \n     funds to compensate damage arising out of the Price-Anderson \n     incident;\n       (F) the combined operation of the Convention, the Price-\n     Anderson Act, and this section will augment the quantity of \n     assured funds available for victims in a wider variety of \n     nuclear incidents while reducing the potential liability of \n     United States suppliers without increasing potential costs to \n     United States operators;\n       (G) the cost of those benefits is the obligation of the \n     United States to contribute to the supplementary compensation \n     fund established by the Convention;\n       (H) any such contribution should be funded in a manner that \n     does not--\n       (i) upset settled expectations based on the liability \n     regime established under the Price-Anderson Act; or\n       (ii) shift to Federal taxpayers liability risks for nuclear \n     incidents at foreign installations;\n       (I) with respect to a Price-Anderson incident, funds \n     already available under the Price-Anderson Act should be \n     used; and\n       (J) with respect to a nuclear incident outside the United \n     States not covered by the Price-Anderson Act, a retrospective \n     premium should be prorated among nuclear suppliers relieved \n     from potential liability for which insurance is not \n     available.\n       (2) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to allocate \n     the contingent costs associated with participation by the \n     United States in the international nuclear liability \n     compensation system established by the Convention on \n     Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage, done at Vienna \n     on September 12, 1997--\n       (A) with respect to a Price-Anderson incident, by using \n     funds made available under section 170 of the Atomic Energy \n     Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210) to cover the contingent costs in \n     a manner that neither increases the burdens nor decreases the \n     benefits under section 170 of that Act; and\n       (B) with respect to a covered incident outside the United \n     States that is not a Price-Anderson incident, by allocating \n     the contingent costs equitably, on the basis of risk, among \n     the class of nuclear suppliers relieved by the Convention \n     from the risk of potential liability resulting from any \n     covered incident outside the United States.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Commission.--The term ``Commission'' means the Nuclear \n     Regulatory Commission.\n       (2) Contingent cost.--The term ``contingent cost'' means \n     the cost to the United States in the event of a covered \n     incident the amount of which is equal to the amount of funds \n     the United States is obligated to make available under \n     paragraph 1(b) of Article III of the Convention.\n       (3) Convention.--The term ``Convention'' means the \n     Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage, \n     done at Vienna on September 12, 1997.\n       (4) Covered incident.--The term ``covered incident'' means \n     a nuclear incident the occurrence of which results in a \n     request for funds pursuant to Article VII of the Convention.\n       (5) Covered installation.--The term ``covered \n     installation'' means a nuclear installation at which the \n     occurrence of a nuclear incident could result in a request \n     for funds under Article VII of the Convention.\n       (6) Covered person.--\n       (A) In general.--The term ``covered person'' means--\n       (i) a United States person;

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Public Safety Employer-\n     Employee Cooperation Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. ___2. DECLARATION OF PURPOSE AND POLICY.\n\n       The Congress declares that the following is the policy of \n     the United States:\n       (1) Labor-management relationships and partnerships are \n     based on trust, mutual respect, open communication, bilateral \n     consensual problem solving, and shared accountability. Labor-\n     management cooperation fully utilizes the strengths of both \n     parties to best serve the interests of the public, operating \n     as a team, to carry out the public safety mission in a \n     quality work environment. In many public safety agencies it \n     is the union that provides the institutional stability as \n     elected leaders and appointees come and go.\n       (2) State and local public safety officers play an \n     essential role in the efforts of the United States to detect, \n     prevent, and respond to terrorist attacks, and to respond to \n     natural disasters, hazardous materials, and other mass \n     casualty incidents. State and local public safety officers, \n     as first responders, are a component of our Nation's National \n     Incident Management System, developed by the Department of \n     Homeland Security to coordinate response to and recovery from \n     terrorism, major natural disasters, and other major \n     emergencies. Public safety employer-employee cooperation is \n     essential in\n\n[[Page S15364]]\n\n     meeting these needs and is, therefore, in the National \n     interest.\n       (3) The Federal Government needs to encourage conciliation, \n     mediation, and voluntary arbitration to aid and encourage \n     employers and the representatives of their employees to reach \n     and maintain agreements concerning rates of pay, hours, and \n     working conditions, and to make all reasonable efforts \n     through negotiations to settle their differences by mutual \n     agreement reached through collective bargaining or by such \n     methods as may be provided for in any applicable agreement \n     for the settlement of disputes.\n       (4) The absence of adequate cooperation between public \n     safety employers and employees has implications for the \n     security of employees and can affect interstate and \n     intrastate commerce. The lack of such labor-management \n     cooperation can detrimentally impact the upgrading of police \n     and fire services of local communities, the health and well-\n     being of public safety officers, and the morale of the fire \n     and police departments. Additionally, these factors could \n     have significant commercial repercussions. Moreover, \n     providing minimal standards for collective bargaining \n     negotiations in the public safety sector can prevent \n     industrial strife between labor and management that \n     interferes with the normal flow of commerce.\n\n     SEC. ___3.

CONSTRUCTION AND COMPLIANCE.\n\n       (a) Construction.--Nothing in this subtitle shall be \n     construed--\n       (1) to preempt or limit the remedies, rights, and \n     procedures of any law of any State or political subdivision \n     of any State or jurisdiction that provides greater or \n     comparable rights and responsibilities than the rights and \n     responsibilities described in section ___4(b);\n       (2) to prevent a State from enforcing a right-to-work law \n     that prohibits employers and labor organizations from \n     negotiating provisions in a labor agreement that require \n     union membership or payment of union fees as a condition of \n     employment;\n       (3) to preempt or limit any State law in effect on the date \n     of enactment of this subtitle that provides for the rights \n     and responsibilities described in section ___4(b) solely \n     because such State law permits an employee to appear on the \n     employee's own behalf with respect to the employee's \n     employment relations with the public safety agency involved;\n       (4) to preempt or limit any State law in effect on the date \n     of enactment of this subtitle that provides for the rights \n     and responsibilities described in section ___4(b) solely \n     because such State law excludes from its coverage employees \n     of a State militia or national guard;\n       (5) to permit parties in States subject to the regulations \n     and procedures described in section ___5 to negotiate \n     provisions that would prohibit an employee from engaging in \n     part-time employment or volunteer activities during off-duty \n     hours;\n       (6) to prohibit a State from exempting from coverage under \n     this subtitle a political subdivision of the State that has a \n     population of less than 5,000 or that employs less than 25 \n     full-time employees;

or\n       (C) the laws or ordinances of any State or political \n     subdivision of a State that provides for the rights and \n     responsibilities described in section ___4(b), solely because \n     such laws or ordinances provide that a contract or memorandum \n     of understanding between a public safety employer and a labor \n     organization must be presented to a legislative body as part \n     of the process for approving such contract or memorandum of \n     understanding.\n       (3) Limited enforcement power.--In the case of a law \n     described in paragraph (2)(B), the Authority shall only \n     exercise the powers provided in section ___5 with respect to \n     those categories of public safety officers who have not been \n     afforded the rights and responsibilities described in section \n     ___4(b).\n       (4) Exclusive enforcement provision.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of this subtitle, and in the absence of a \n     waiver of a State's sovereign immunity, the Authority shall \n     have the exclusive power to enforce the provisions of this \n     subtitle with respect to employees of a State or political \n     subdivision of a State.\n\n     SEC. ___9.

Mr. President, I want to speak about the Sudan \nAccountability and Divestment Act of 2007. This bill was approved \nunanimously by the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs \nCommittee, and I am pleased to report that, in the same bipartisan \nspirit, it will soon be approved by the full Senate. I am indebted to \nRanking Member Shelby for his tremendous collaboration on this \nimportant measure. And I want to recognize Senator Durbin, as well--few \nhave been stronger leaders of the divestment effort, or fiercer \nadvocates for the people of Darfur.\n  This bill is aimed at ending the Darfur genocide. I strongly believe \nthat it is our responsibility to help bring that end about--not simply \nbecause genocide, everywhere and always, imposes a grave moral \nobligation on those with the power to stop it, but because many of us \nshare responsibility for this genocide in a much more concrete way.\n  Consider this hypothetical: One of our 50 States invests its \nemployees' pension funds in a wide range of stocks. Some of those \ndollars end up supplying capital to a multinational corporation, one of \nwhose subsidiaries operates in Sudan--mining, say, for copper or gold. \nThat firm pays the Sudanese government for mining rights, and in the \nfullness of time, money that began in America finds its way into the \nblood-stained coffers of Omar al-Bashir. What could those dollars \nbecome at last? A plane dropping fire on a Darfuri village; a knife \nheld to a woman's throat; weapons of murder and rape.\n  It is a chain of cause and effect in which American money may finally \nobjectively fund genocide--in which Americans may come to pay, through \nno fault or intention of their own, for crimes they abhor. If \nresponsibility means anything, it exists at every step of that chain. \nTo be sure, it grows heavier at each step; but just as it is certain at \nthe last step, it is present at the first.\n  That is why those who have recognized their place in that chain and \nwho have resolved to break it deserve our blessing and our support. \nTwenty-one states have begun to divest from Sudan, and similar work is \nunderway in about 20 more. At least 55 colleges and universities have \ndivested, and efforts are underway at about 50 more. Many large cities, \nnon-profits, and pension and mutual funds have joined this campaign--a \ncampaign that recognizes that our responsibility for Darfur can go \nbeyond speaking out, to actively depriving the Sudanese government and \nthe Janjaweed militia of some of their means of murder. Along with \nsanctions, Security Council resolutions, and a combined UN/African \nUnion force, divestment is part of a global movement to cut off funding \nand end, at long last, the Darfur genocide. Even if it succeeds, it \nwill have come more than 450,000 lives too late; but lost time and lost \nlives should only fire our urgency.\n  The Accountability and Divestment Act is Congress's latest step to \naid this global movement. It helps Americans\n\n[[Page S15374]]\n\nto divest from firms whose business props up the Sudanese regime, it \ngives them the tools to make socially responsible investment decisions, \nand it ensures that investors who choose to divest will be held \nharmless for those decisions. The bill has five key provisions.\n  First, it explicitly authorizes states and localities to divest from \ncompanies involved in those economic sectors that, by its own \nadmission, are Khartoum's main sources of foreign investment--\npetroleum, mining, and power production--along with military \nproduction. Investment in these sectors, more than any others, is \npropping up the Bashir regime and enabling its intransigence.\n  The divestment standards set by this bill are universal. It allows \ndivestment to take place in a unitary, federally sanctioned manner. \nThat alone should contradict the claim that this bill somehow violates \nthe Constitution's Supremacy Clause by establishing ``50 different \nforeign policies.'' Moreover, state divestment could hardly be \nconsidered unconstitutional when it is explicitly authorized on the \nfederal level. Paul H. Schwartz, legal counsel to the Sudan Divestment \nTask Force, and former clerk to two Supreme Court Justices, made the \ncase convincingly:\n\n       It is only logical that when a bill authorizing state \n     measures touching on foreign affairs becomes federal law, the \n     federal government has expressed a judgment that the measures \n     do not ``intrude'' into or ``interfere'' with federal foreign \n     policy, but rather complement that policy.\n\n  That is exactly what this legislation does. It outlines a targeted, \nfederal divestment policy and authorizes states and investors to act \nconsistently with that policy if they so choose. In doing so, the bill \nprotects the investors' right to be guided by conscience; it also \nallows investors to protect themselves from the financial and \nreputational risks posed by an affiliation with Khartoum.\n  Second, this bill allows mutual fund and corporate pension fund \nmanagers to cut ties, at their discretion, with companies involved in \nthe 4 key sectors. It also offers limited protection from lawsuits for \nthose choosing to divest, while preserving their normal fiduciary \nduties.\n  Third, it establishes the sense of Congress that private pension \nmanagers are already authorized to divest their public pension funds \nfrom businesses in the 4 sectors, in accordance with existing \nDepartment of Labor regulations.\n  Fourth, it requires federal contractors to certify that they do not \ndo business with firms involved in the 4 sectors, and it provides \nseveral punitive options, including debarment, if those contractors are \nfound to be lying. The bill does, however, authorize the President to \ngrant contractors a waiver if their operations in Sudan are found to be \nin the national interest; and it adds an extra level of accountability \nby mandating that the President report these exceptions to Congress on \na case-by-case basis.\n  I am aware that some have argued for an additional waiver on the \nbasis of ``substantial humanitarian work'' in Sudan, but I believe that \nthat criterion would fit within any conception of the national \ninterest, properly understood. In the end, the exposure mandated by the \npresident's case-by-case reports to Congress will be the best deterrent \nto firms that seek waivers on spurious grounds: They will be exposed to \nthe whole nation and forced to justify their actions to a highly \nskeptical public.\n\n  Fifth, the bill's authorities terminate when the government of Sudan \nends its murderous policies and returns to the community of law-abiding \nnations. The divestment campaign will end when, and only when, Sudan \nfully accepts the presence of the joint UN/AU peacekeeping force, \nceases attacks on civilians, demilitarizes the Janjaweed militia, \nallows the unfettered delivery of humanitarian relief, and grants the \nright of return to refugees. Anything short of those targets, \ndivestment must and will continue.\n  The international divestment campaign exists precisely to pressure \nKhartoum to meet those goals. It is stunning, Mr. President, that \npressure should even be needed to force a sovereign nation to end \ntargeted attacks on civilians. Yet that is the case; that is the \nradical evil we face.\n  Even still, some in this administration are urging us to treat \nKhartoum with kid gloves at this delicate time for peace negotiations, \nas the Justice Department put it in a letter 2 months ago. That would \nbe the same administration whose Special Envoy to Sudan declared \nAmerican action on the genocide imminent 11 months ago. That would be \nthe same administration whose president declared the crimes in Darfur \n``genocide'' more than two years ago, and has done next to nothing of \nsubstance since.\n  Ironically, one of those few substantive actions has been to endorse \na bill that originated in the Senate, the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Enhancement Act, which strengthened penalties on \ncompanies violating U.S. sanctions. That bill was approved unanimously \nby the Senate Banking Committee and adopted unanimously by this \nCongress. That bill, like this one, targets the Khartoum regime's \nfinancial supports; that bill, like this one, comes at a ``delicate \ntime'' for negotiations. As my colleague Senator Menendez asked an \nofficial of the State Department at a recent hearing of the Senate \nBanking Committee:\n\n       What is the difference? You have a sanctions regime that \n     you are all enthusiastically pursuing before the peace \n     conference in Tripoli, and yet you are back-pedaling on this \n     effort.\n\n  Honestly, I can't see my way through the contradiction. If the \nadministration endorsed tough measures then, it should do the same now, \nand if it wants to shirk our responsibility altogether, it should tell \nus why.\n  Of course, as the Administration has stalled and insisted that we \nrefrain from approving this critical legislation, talks have broken \ndown. The Tripoli conference that the State Department had been \nheralding as a great breakthrough at the Banking Committee's October \n3rd hearing ended up being canceled.\n  The truth is that economic pressure has seemed to be the only tool \nthat's proven successful in bringing Khartoum back to the table in the \nfirst place. That truth is in keeping with everything the regime has \nshown us in its 18 years of existence. As John Prendergast, Co-Chair of \nthe ENOUGH Project and former National Security Council and State \nDepartment Official, told the Banking Committee during our hearing.\n\n       Four times in 18 years, we have been able to change the \n     policies of the Government of Sudan.\n\n  In the mid-1990s, Khartoum renounced its support for international \nterrorist organizations, including al-Qaeda. Why? International \npressure and multilateral sanctions from the United States, its allies, \nand the Security Council.\n  In the same decade, Sudan ended its support of the slave trade. Why? \nAgain, multilateral sanctions led by the Security Council.\n  In 2005, the government signed a peace deal with rebels, ending a \ncivil war that had taken 2 million lives. Why? In large part, because \nof a coordinated divestment campaign and Congress's passage of the \nSudan Peace Act, which condemned the government's human rights record.\n  Just this year, the government acquiesced in the UN/AU peacekeeping \nforce. Why? Largely because of economic pressure from China.\n  Four times, the international community has brought some measure of \ncontrol to Khartoum's criminal behavior, and there is one common \nthread: sustained pressure. As Prendergast put it, the only way to end \nthe genocide is if ``multilateral, targeted pressures are increased.'' \nConversely, ``the deadly mistake that has been made for Darfur \nrepeatedly during the last 4\\1/2\\ years is to do precisely as the \nadministration proposes now to reduce pressure, to let up.''\n  After all, it makes perfect sense. What do we expect from those \ncapable of presiding over all this blood? What do we expect from \nkillers who, in the words of one survivor, ``are happy when they rape \nthey sing when they rape''?\n  Do we expect them to listen politely to our objections? Do we expect \nto change their minds?\n  No. All of our prayers, no matter how fervent, and all of our words, \nno matter how eloquent, are only noise to them. They do not speak the \nlanguage of should or ought. They speak the language of must. To the \ngenocidal killers and their sponsors, this bill is one more word in the \nonly language they know.\n\n[[Page S15375]]\n\n  And given everything we have learned from history and from simple \ncommon sense, all the talk of kid gloves would be hysterical--if it \nweren't infuriating.\n  Even if some in this administration haven't learned the lesson, I \nhave learned it in my bones. In 1945, my father, Tom Dodd, was called \nto Nuremberg, Germany, to help lead the prosecution of Nazi war \ncriminals. He wrote my mother that few things were more painful than \nbeing away from his family. I learned to walk and talk in his absence. \nBut he also wrote home: ``I will never do anything as worthwhile.''\n  What, today, could be more worthwhile? What could be clearer than the \nduty we owe to the 2.5 million displaced, the orphaned, the raped, the \ndead themselves? Even if they cannot fathom the chain linking us to the \nfire falling on their villages, or the knives against their throats, we \ncan; we can see it and choose to break it. Even if we bear only the \nsmallest fraction of responsibility, we can choose to act as if we bore \nall of it. Measure by measure and step by step and inch by inch, we can \nchoose to push with all our strength against death's machinery until it \ncracks at last.\n  Here is another step. I ask my colleagues to take it with me.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have regularly come to the Senate floor \nto speak about the genocide in Darfur.\n  For 4 long years, the world has watched this tragedy the killing of \nhundreds of thousands of innocent civilians, the torching of entire \nvillages, rape, torture, and untold human suffering.\n  More than 3 years have passed since the UN Commission of Inquiry \nconcluded that:\n\n     crimes against humanity and war crimes have been committed in \n     Darfur and may be no less serious and heinous than genocide.\n\n  Many of us on both sides of the aisle and in the international \ncommunity have repeatedly called for greater U.S. and global action to \nstem the humanitarian crisis in Darfur.\n  President Bush, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, and UN Secretary \nGeneral Ban Ki-moon have all called for greater action.\n  Just this week, a group calling itself the Elders including several \nNobel Peace Prize Winners and former heads of state spoke forcefully \nfor action in Darfur.\n  Despite these efforts, the Sudanese government has continued to show \nits contempt for its own people and the demands of the global \ncommunity.\n  The message was loud and clear earlier this year when the UN Security \nCouncil voted to deploy a 26,000 member peacekeeping force to Darfur. \nThis hybrid UN-African Union force will help stem the violence and \ncreate an atmosphere in which peace talks can move toward a long-term \npolitical agreement.\n  With the peacekeepers set to begin deployment on January 1, we are \nonce again witnessing the same old pattern from Khartoum. The Sudanese \ngovernment is now denying deployment of non-African peacekeepers, \ndespite their acceptance of this new force only a few months ago.\n  We have waited long enough for this murderous government to take \naction, to stop slaughtering its own people, to stop thumbing its nose \nat the international community.\n  That is why I commend the Senate for its action today to encourage \ncooperation by the Sudanese government.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced 2 bills that would have increased \neconomic pressure on the Sudanese regime. Each bill supported state and \nlocal divestment efforts, allowing each of us to do our part to end the \nmadness in Darfur by selling investments that help prop up the Sudanese \nregime.\n  I am pleased that Senator Dodd, as chairman of the Banking Committee, \nhas adopted ideas from these bills into the Sudan Accountability and \nDivestment Act of 2007. I thank him, as well as Ranking Member Shelby \nand others who have worked on this bill especially Senators Cornyn and \nBrownback, who joined me as lead sponsors of the legislation I had \nintroduced.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this critically-important \nlegislation, and I look forward to working with the House to send it to \nthe President for his signature as soon as possible.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am proud that the Senate will have taken \nstrong action tonight to help stop the genocide in Darfur. I would like \nto commend Senator Dodd for his hard work to get the Sudan \nAccountability and Divestment Act of 2007 passed. I would also like to \ncongratulate Senator Durbin who was the lead cosponsor of the first \nlegislation on this issue.\n  By passing this bill, the Senate is saying clearly to the government \nof Sudan that the American people do not want to fund genocide. We \nalready have a wide range of sanctions against Sudan, but this bill \nclosed an important loophole by targeting pension plans. The \nlegislation would make sure that the money we put away each month for \nour retirement does not go to fund companies which support the \ngenocidal regime in Sudan.\n  The House has already passed similar legislation with an \noverwhelming, and bipartisan, vote of 418-1. With Senate passage, we \nwill hopefully be able to move quickly to turn this bill into the law \nof the land.\n  As we pass this legislation the crisis in Darfur continues, with \nnearly 2 million people displaced and an estimated 450,000 people \nkilled. The real hope for the people of Darfur is a strong UN-AU \npeacekeeping force. But President Bashir is once again keeping that \nforce from moving forward, putting a man indicted by the International \nCriminal Court for war crimes on the committee overseeing these \npeacekeepers. He also continues to put other roadblocks in front of the \npeacekeepers, who should be in place and operating by January 1.\n  This legislation sends a loud and a clear message to the Sudanese \nregime that they must stop standing in the way of full implementation \nof the AU-UN peacekeepers. I hope that President Bashir is listening \nand that we will see that AU-UN force operational by January 1 of next \nyear. The U.S. Senate will be watching, the United Nations will be \nwatching, and the eyes of the world are on President Bashir.
