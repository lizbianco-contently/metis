Mr. President, during my time in public office, I have had \nthe opportunity to serve with many good men and women. During my time \nserving in Congress, I have had the opportunity to make a friendship \nwith Trent Lott.\n  Senator Daschle gave me the freedom, during the 6 years I was \nassistant leader and he was the leader, to spend all my time on the \nSenate floor, and I did that. Senator Daschle did other things, but he \ntrusted me. I hope I did the right thing--I sure tried to do that all \nthe time I worked with him--but I lived on the floor of the Senate.\n  During much of that time Trent Lott was the Republican leader, and we \nworked together over those years, I think, in a way that speaks well of \nour country. We made ``deals.'' Legislation is the art of compromise, \nconsensus building. Even though Trent Lott is certainly a true \nconservative, we were able, in his pragmatic fashion, to work things \nout.\n  Trent has an interesting background. He was born in Mississippi. His \nfamily settled in a place called Pascagoula. His father was a \npipefitter. His mother taught school. She was an elementary school \nteacher. The public school that Senator Lott attended now bears his \nname. He received a degree from the University of Mississippi and also \ngot his law degree from the same institution. That is a wonderful \ncommunity, Oxford, MS. I have had an opportunity to spend a little bit \nof time there. There is a beautiful community square. It is like I \nenvision the South as it used to be.\n  He married a beautiful woman, Tricia--Tricia Thompson Lott. They were \ncollege sweethearts. My wife, who is a shy woman--always has been--has \nworked with Tricia on a number of different issues and has been so \nenamored of her, with what a wonderful woman Tricia is. She is a hard \nworker. Whenever projects are involved, she does more than her share.\n\n  They have two children, Chet and Tyler. They have four grandchildren.\n\n[[Page S14710]]\n\n  Trent has been in Congress 34 years. He is the only person in the \nhistory of this country who has served as both the House and the Senate \nwhip. He has been a champion for Mississippi, as we all know, but he \nhas also been an important instrument in the Senate accomplishing what \nit has during the time he was here. I am disappointed that Senator Lott \nis going to be leaving the Senate, and I will miss him. I have been \nimpressed with his ability to get things done. Other than John Breaux \nand Trent Lott, there are no two people able to accomplish as much as \nthey did. John Breaux was a dealmaker, and the place he always went, as \na Democrat, to start his deal, was with Trent Lott. They developed a \nfriendship that lasts to this day. But as a result of their ability to \nwork together on different sides of the aisle, we were able to \naccomplish a great deal. During the Clinton years, much of what Senator \nBreaux was able to accomplish for President Clinton was as a result of \nhis relationship with Senator Lott.\n  There is no need for me to dwell on my friendship with Senator Lott \nother than to say he is my friend, I wish him well, and certainly I \nwish Tricia and Trent and their family the very best. They deserve it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/04/senate-section/article/S14710-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we will, indeed, be saying goodbye to \nour friend and colleague, Trent Lott, over the next few weeks. Senator \nReid and I will work out a time certain for tributes to Senator Lott \nand his extraordinary career sometime between now and the end of this \nsession.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Republican time in the morning \nbusiness coming up be divided equally between Senators Bond, Kyl, and \nCornyn, in that order.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement \nImplementation Act represents new opportunities. It is an opportunity \nto strengthen America's economic growth and it is an opportunity to \nforge a stronger relationship with a key ally in an important region of \nthe world.\n  We already know that trade agreements with countries help grow this \neconomy through increased exports, which translate to more new jobs for \nmany American workers. They also create lower prices and more choices \nfor the consumer.\n  This bill will do all of that by leveling the playing field for \nAmerican exporters and producers. As recently as 2006, 98 percent of \nPeruvian exports to America entered this country duty-free. But because \nof high tariffs, American exporters have not had anywhere near \nequivalent access to Peru's markets.\n  When this agreement enters into force, 80 percent of American \nconsumer and industrial exports to Peru will be duty-free immediately. \nThat is a tremendous benefit to thousands of American businesses, and \nmillions of American workers.\n  For my home State of Kentucky, this bill will do a lot of good as \nwell. Exports to world markets mean a lot to my State--Kentucky's \nexport shipments of merchandise in 2006 accounted for $17.2 billion, \nincluding $16.3 million worth of goods to Peru. Almost 16 percent of \nKentucky manufacturing workers depend on exports for their jobs.\n  New markets for Kentucky's transportation equipment manufacturers, \nchemical manufacturers, and machinery manufacturers will open up \nbecause of this bill, as will markets for Kentucky's many agricultural \nproducts.\n  By way of a comparison, 3 years after Congress approved a similar \ntrade deal with Singapore, Kentucky exports to Singapore have grown 68 \npercent. Kentucky and America can reap similar rewards again in a new, \nmore fruitful partnership with Peru by passing this bill.\n  Peru stands to gain as well. Greater ties to America can only help \nstrengthen security and stability in that country, a key ally in the \nWestern Hemisphere.\n  It is critical for America to remain engaged in that part of the \nworld, and it is vitally important for us to build strong ties with \ncountries that have made a commitment to freedom and democracy. Peru is \njust such an ally.\n  I thank my good friend, the senior Senator from Iowa, for his \nimportant work on this bill. Thanks to Senator Grassley, we are soon \nabout to vote on final passage.\n  I also want to echo his concerns about the current state of our trade \npolicy. Earlier this year, Democrats and Republicans came to an \nagreement on trade--in return for concessions on matters such as \noverseas labor issues, House Democrats would move several free trade \nagreements.\n  So far, today's Peru agreement is all we have. We haven't seen any \npositive movement on free trade agreements with Colombia or Panama. Let \nme just say with regard to Colombia, it is our most important ally in \nSouth America. It is embarrassing that we have not approved the free \ntrade agreement with Colombia. Once the issue of beef is addressed with \nrespect to South Korea, I hope we can see that agreement move along as \nwell.\n  I am disappointed the other Chamber hasn't been able to pass these \nagreements more quickly. We know they will strengthen our economy and \nwe know they will strengthen our bonds with some very important allies.\n  Again, going back to Colombia in particular, it has been making great \nstrides to combat the drug trade that ravages so much of that country, \nand has done much to cut down on the flow of illegal drugs to the \nUnited States. Why can't we move faster and show good faith with this \nally?\n  I hope the successful vote for passage we are about to have will pave \nthe way for more in the very near future. These trade agreements are \ngood for the American people, and good for our allies around the world, \nand we ought to enact them soon. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/04/senate-section/article/S14710-3", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I thank our minority \nleader, Senator McConnell, for outlining the importance of the Peru \nFree Trade Agreement and the other trade agreements. We have 3 short \nweeks to get to work and do the work we have not done so far this year. \nI wanted to address three aspects of it.\n  First, for the intelligence community, we must act, and we must act \nnow, to assure that the community has the ability and the tools they \nneed to fight terrorists.\n  Over the last 30 years, the world has experienced a technological \nrevolution, and our laws governing terrorist surveillance have not kept \npace. The old 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that I will \nrefer to as FISA was drafted to deal specifically with the technology \nin use at the time. This spring, a court ruled that because of the \nchange in technology, the old FISA law severely limited our ability to \ncollect intelligence. Essentially, it made us deaf to collection of \nvitally needed information.\n  Following that ruling, the Director of National Intelligence, Admiral \nMcConnell, told Congress the United States was unable to conduct the \ncritical surveillance of foreign terrorists planning to conduct attacks \ninside our country because of the outdated law. It not only affected \nour ability to protect the United States, but it also threatened the \nsafety and lives of our troops abroad.\n\n[[Page S14711]]\n\n  In May I heard that directly from the commander of our Joint Special \nOperations in Iraq, who told me the limitations in the old law \nprevented him from capturing key information needed to protect our \ntroops in theater. He could kill or capture a top al-Qaida leader, but \nhe was not able to collect signals intelligence on them. The bottom \nline is that terrorists were able to use technology and our own \noutdated laws to stay a step ahead of us.\n  Congress acted. On August 3 and 4, fortunately, we were able to pass \nthe Protect America Act. I was proud to be the lead sponsor of it \nbecause passage of this temporary law essentially put our national \nsecurity forces back in the business of collecting the information they \nneeded.\n  But this is only a stopgap measure and expires in February. It did \nnot include all of the reforms we wanted.\n  I hope this week the Senate will move to pass a permanent fix, or at \nleast a longer term fix, to our intelligence surveillance law. It is \ncritical we act before we leave for the holidays to make sure that our \nintelligence laws will be up to date and we will not run into a \ndeadline when we come back in January and have to rush through a bill \nat the end or leave our intelligence community deaf to the new \ncollections they need.\n  We have two bills before us. Unfortunately, the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee took the bill that came out of the Intelligence Committee and \nchanged it so much that it would gut our intelligence surveillance \nability. The committee ignored significant concerns expressed by the \nworking level officials in the Department of Justice and the \nintelligence community, the very operators who know how the system \nworks.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee ignored the concerns of its own \nminority members. The bill was voted out on a straight party line. The \ngood news is there is another option. Earlier this year, the Senate \nIntelligence Committee voted out a bipartisan bill to update FISA. \nAfter the members of our committee had months and months to study this \nprogram, most of our committee members went out to the agency to see \nhow it worked, to see the layers of protection built in to make sure it \nstayed within the law. We put together, Chairman Rockefeller and I, a \nbipartisan agreement which added more protections to the constitutional \nrights and the privacy rights of American citizens. We worked with the \nintelligence community representatives and the Department of Justice \nlawyers to make sure it would work.\n  This bill we reported out of the Intelligence Committee gives our \nintelligence operators and law enforcement officials the tools they \nneed to collect surveillance on foreign terrorists in foreign countries \nplanning to conduct attacks inside the United States or against our \ntroops, our allies. It is the balance we need to protect our civil \nliberties without handcuffing our intelligence agencies. I hope we can \ndo the right thing and bring that bill to the floor.\n  Now while we are working together to get our intelligence community \nthe tools they need, our military needs Congress to provide the funds \nto get them the equipment, supplies, and fuels they need in the field. \nWe have got men and women fighting for security in Iraq, in \nAfghanistan, and our own security. Regrettably, the Democratic \nleadership in Congress wants to hold these funds hostage to a far-left \nagenda which does not represent anything more than a sliver of popular \nopinion in this country. There is no excuse for stalling much-needed \nfunds for American troops. These are American troops fighting in the \nfield, and we are not giving them funds.\n  By kowtowing to the far left moveon.org and the Code Pink \nconstituency, some of the leaders of the Democratic Party in Congress \nwho have control of it are playing a dangerous game with the safety of \nour troops in the field and the readiness and morale of our troops here \nat home.\n  The latest partisan move comes despite the good news out of Iraq. \nEven the media, who has been opposed to our involvement in Iraq, is \nrecognizing that as a result of the new Petraeus strategy, a surge on \nthe counterinsurgency, working with the Iraqi security forces, our \nforces together with the Iraqis have been successful in eliminating key \nterrorist safe havens and hampering the enemy's ability to conduct \ncoordinated attacks. There has been a consistent and steady trend of \nprogress over the last 6 months.\n  There are positive stories describing Baghdad's marketplace coming \nback to life. All over the place violent attacks in Iraq are falling. \nEven some of the war's loudest and strongest opponents in the House \nhave acknowledged the signs of progress. But despite this, the \nleadership has failed to give us the opportunity to improve the funds \nour troops need in the field.\n  With only a few legislative days left, our soldiers, sailors, our \nairmen, and marines cannot afford more of the partisan delay. We have \ngot men and women risking their lives, and we are denying the funds \nthey need for support. That is unthinkable. That is unthinkable. We \nhave got to abandon the far left's strategies of retreat and defeat and \nallow our troops to do their jobs.\n\n\n                       Peru Free Trade Agreement\n\n  While we are talking about winning the war, there is also the war \nthat is the soft war, the war of economic progress and opportunity. \nThat is why, as Leader McConnell said, the free trade agreements are so \nimportant. We have the opportunity to help countries that are less \ndeveloped get the free markets, the economic opportunity, the \ndemocratic chances to influence their government that we treasure and \nthat have helped make our country successful.\n  One of the most important things we can do is adopt the free trade \nagreements. We have four agreements pending. If enacted, these four \npending FTAs would expand market opportunities between the United \nStates and countries that have nearly 126 million consumers.\n  Today's vote on the Peru FTA is very important. I urge us to support \nthat. This will generate U.S. exports, create jobs, enhance the well-\nbeing of farming communities such as those I represent in Missouri. Ask \nthese farmers and the small businesses how important these agreements \nare. Opening these markets would boost U.S. farm exports by $1.5 \nbillion. Under the Peru FTA, more than two-thirds of current U.S. farm \nexports will become duty free. Tariffs on all farm products would be \neliminated in 17 years.\n  The FTAs are vitally important. When FTAs are defeated, it is bad \nnews for progressive government supporting the United States. In \nparticular, it would be a blow to President Uribe in Colombia, who has \nbeen successfully fighting the leftist FARC terrorists, curbing illicit \ndrug production. He is the most important counterweight to the anti-\nAmerican vitriol of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela.\n  Chavez was rebuffed by students in his own country. We have an \nopportunity to establish good working relationships with Peru, with \nColombia, with Panama, to show the leaders of the opposition in \nVenezuela that there is a better way than Hugo Chavez and his blind \nadherence to the Castro model in Cuba.\n  Every President since World War II, Republican and Democrat, has \nfought to reduce the kind of trade barriers that triggered the Great \nDepression of the 1930s. This administration has followed that example. \nI hope that in addition to Peru, the leadership of Congress will seek \napproval of free trade agreements and pass them for South Korea, \nPanama, and Colombia. It is vitally important not only for free trade \nbetween those countries but for our standing in leading for security, \npeace, and freedom in Latin America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the last 2 weeks we have been back in our \nStates visiting with our constituents and reporting to them on the work \nof the Congress. I did the same. I was in Texas traveling across our \nState. People would ask me almost everywhere I went what is happening \nin the Congress, and specifically the Senate. I am sorry to say I had \nto tell them: Not much is happening. Here we are, 2 months into a new \nfiscal year and we have yet to pass 11 out of the 12 appropriations \nbills that literally keep the lights on and instead are working on a \ncontinuing resolution, or on auto pilot based on last year's budget and \nappropriations bills.\n  I guess I was a little embarrassed to tell them that the approval \nratings\n\n[[Page S14712]]\n\nwhich we have seen on the Rasmussen poll and others, the Gallup poll \nand others, appears to be well deserved. It is not a partisan matter. \nIt is not that Republicans like what is happening and Democrats do not \nlike what is happening, or vice versa, or independents like what we are \ndoing. The fact is, no one seems to be satisfied. Given the 11 percent \nor so approval rating, I have to believe that in large part it is due \nto the fact that we simply have not taken care of our business.\n  Nowhere in the rest of America could people fail to do as much as we \nhave failed to do in the Senate and survive. Whether it is your family \nbudget or it is the small business, you could not get away with it. \nOnly Congress can get away with it, I guess, to the extent it has, the \nfailures and inaction.\n  There are two areas particularly I want to talk about in the next few \nminutes, where this has grave national security implications.\n  First, as Secretary Gates, the Secretary of the Department of \nDefense, has told us, if they do not get emergency supplemental funding \nfor our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, they are going to have to begin \nto give people notices that they are going to run out of money in \nFebruary. But they have to issue the notices 60 days in advance, which \nmeans by December 15 there are going to be lots of folks who are going \nto be getting pink slips just in time for Christmas because the Senate \nhas failed to act on an emergency supplemental request to fund our \ntroops.\n  Frankly, I do not think we ought to be in that position. No. 1, it is \ncompletely inconsiderate of the families and the individual \ncircumstances of those individuals who are doing their best to support \nour men and women in uniform.\n  Secondly, it is completely unnecessary. If we would simply take care \nof our business and quit playing political games by tying deadlines to \nthe appropriation of emergency funds to support our troops, we could \nfund our troops and continue to have the debates here in the Congress \nabout what our policy ought to be.\n  Those debates are important. I respect people with different opinions \nthan mine. But we should not be doing it at the expense of our men and \nwomen in uniform or putting in jeopardy the jobs of people in civilian \nclothes who support our men and women in uniform, by tying the \nappropriation of this emergency funding to these deadlines to the \nemergency funding. I hope we will get this done and get it done \nquickly.\n  Also, we have, in fact, a middle-class tax increase getting ready to \ncome into full flower with the so-called alternative minimum tax. \nUnless we act, the 6 million people who currently pay this tax today \nwill grow to 23 million next year. So that is another victim, those \ntaxpayers are another victim of our inaction and failure to act in a \nresponsible way when it comes to getting our work done.\n  I want to join my colleague from Missouri, the ranking member of the \nIntelligence Committee, as well as my distinguished colleague from \nArizona, and focus a little bit here in the next 5 minutes or so on the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\n  As most Americans who have followed our debates here know, our \nability to listen in on conversations between terrorists and to stop \nfurther terrorist attacks on our mainland and our homeland, as well as \nover in Iraq and Afghanistan, depends on a robust intelligence-\ngathering capability.\n  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was a law passed back in \n1978, back in a different era, which served our purpose then and made \nsure that no intelligence gathering, no wiretaps could occur against \nAmericans. But the fact is that law has needed updating, has been \nupdated from time to time. But we need to make clear that when it comes \nto monitoring communications between terrorists and foreign nations, it \nis not necessary to prepare a mound of paperwork and have an army of \nlawyers process it through a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in \norder to get a permit to do so.\n  We have, as we all know, passed a temporary measure which will expire \nin February. But we need to act on this permanently and not continue to \njam all of our business into the last few weeks and put people in \ndoubt, particularly in the intelligence community, of whether they will \nhave the capability to detect and deter future terrorist attacks by \nemploying this capability.\n  Before we passed a temporary patch, I think, in August--or before we \nbroke for the August recess--because of a ruling by a judge and because \nof changes in technology, it had been reported in the press that we had \nlost about two-thirds of our intelligence-gathering capability. \nFortunately, we were able to fix that on a temporary basis.\n  But there are also other important parts of this legislation such as \nhow do we treat the telecommunications carriers that did what they were \nasked to do in the security interests of the American people and \ncooperated with the Federal Government? Are we going to provide them \nthe legal protection they are entitled to under the law or are we going \nto hang them out to dry and make them liable for lawsuits and damages, \nperhaps, and jeopardize the intelligence that we have gained with their \ncooperation?\n  That is the wrong way to treat these telecommunications carriers. We \nought to not reward them but at least do our duty with regard to these \ncitizens, corporate and individual alike, who cooperated with the U.S. \nGovernment in gathering intelligence and not punish them by hanging \nthem out to dry and making them the subject of numerous lawsuits and \nlitigation.\n  Just one quick example: When Joseph Anzack was kidnapped by al-Qaida \non May 12 while serving in Iraq and killed a few weeks later, you have \nto wonder if the paperwork that took roughly 10 hours to complete, \nalong with a group of lawyers before an authorization to monitor \ncommunications which directly implicated his kidnappers would have \nsaved his life. On that date, May 12, he and Alex Jimenez and Byron \nFouty were kidnapped. But a 10-hour delay in getting the FISA paperwork \ndone may have cost Joseph Anzack his life, and may have severely \nhampered the continuing efforts to find Alex Jimenez and Byron Fouty.\n  While the Protect America Act that passed in August, as I said, \nprovided a temporary fix to the problem, it will expire in February. I \njust ask our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, why are we \ndelaying the passage of this important fix to this temporary act? Isn't \nit important enough to make sure we do everything possible not to \nhamper our intelligence-gathering capability? We are, in fact, a nation \nat war, and we ought to act like it. That means arming our intelligence \ncommunity with the tools they need to detect terrorist communications \nand to deter future terrorist attacks.\n  I know 9/11 seems like a long way off in the minds of many, and many \nhave acted as if it never happened, but the fact is, unless we have \nrobust intelligence-gathering capability, and unless the Senate acts \npromptly to permanently grant the power to our intelligence community \nto detect these communications, we are at grave risk, and we should not \nbe as a result of Congress's inaction.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleague from Texas \nfor his comments about the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and \nwould like to expand on those a little bit more.\n  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act we sometimes refer to as \nFISA or the FISA law. It is important we understand why we need to \nupdate this FISA law. In a word, it has to do with the fact that \ntechnology has moved forward faster than our ability to change the law. \nAs a result, as the Senator from Texas just noted, we lost about two-\nthirds of the intelligence gathering on al-Qaida that we could have \nintercepted and were previously intercepting when it became clear we \nneeded to change the law to keep pace with the advances in technology.\n  In the Protect America Act we restored access to that information, \nand we are now back to collecting that information. But the Protect \nAmerica Act expires on February 1. As a result, we are now back to \nreauthorizing that act in a permanent way. We need to do so because, \nagain, if this authority lapses, we are back to where we were when we \nwere losing two-thirds of the information that we should be gathering \non al-Qaida.\n\n[[Page S14713]]\n\n  It is not as if we do not understand this is a serious problem. Al-\nQaida still exists. It has not been destroyed. We know what it has \ndone. We know what it would like to do. We know they continue to plot. \nIt is critical for us not to ignore the threat. Of course, the first \nstep in dealing with it is to do the best possible job we can in \nmonitoring communications between people who would do us harm.\n  We all agree that congressional oversight is important to the effort, \nand all of the legislation we have adopted has enhanced congressional \noversight. That is a good thing. That is not in question. But you do \nnot have congressional oversight so oppressive that the intelligence \nfolks cannot collect the information they need to collect. We need to \nbe careful that in redrafting FISA we do not actually impede our \nintelligence collection in the name of congressional oversight.\n  There are some problems with legislation that came out of our \ncommittee, the Judiciary Committee--some big problems--much less so \nwith the bill that passed out of the Intelligence Committee. Even \nMembers who objected earlier agreed, and I think have agreed, we can \nprovide the necessary statutory authorization for the President to act, \nand I think most would agree we have to have such authorization in \nplace to deal with groups such as al-Qaida. But their concern was we \nsimply wanted to have congressional authority for it, and that is what \nthe act has done.\n  We have to be careful that in granting the authority we do not attach \nso many conditions to it that, once again, it is impossible for the \nintelligence agencies to do the job we have mandated they do. As I \nsaid, the bill reported out of the Judiciary Committee, and to some \nextent even the bill from the Intelligence Committee, does tie down our \nintelligence agencies with too many limits on how they can monitor \nforeign intelligence organizations.\n  What we are really looking at is some of my colleagues' efforts to \ntake away core responsibilities and authority that the President has to \nprotect our Nation in gathering foreign intelligence.\n\n  Let me cite a couple of examples. The Judiciary Committee bill makes \nFISA the ``exclusive means''--that is the language--of gathering \nforeign intelligence absent express statutory authority. That is too \nnarrow. In other words, what it is saying is, if another intelligence-\ngathering tool is not actually authorized by a statute, then it cannot \nbe used to gather intelligence on a group such as al-Qaida.\n  One obvious example of this is grand jury subpoenas. They are \nauthorized by rules of evidence, not by a Federal statute. The way the \nJudiciary Committee bill appears to be written, the United States could \nnot even use grand jury subpoenas to gather information about al-Qaida. \nObviously, that is not an intended result--at least I would hope not--\nbut it is one of the things that would have to be fixed if we were to \nconsider the Judiciary Committee bill.\n  Another provision is in both bills, and it has been referred to as \nthe Wyden amendment, named after my good friend and colleague from the \nState of Oregon. But as that provision is written, a warrant would be \nrequired for any overseas surveillance that is conducted for foreign \nintelligence purposes and is targeted against a U.S. person.\n  Under current law, however, a warrant would not be required for \noverseas surveillance targeted at a U.S. person if that surveillance is \nconducted strictly for a criminal investigation. So you have the \nanomaly where a much lesser standard exists for mere criminal \ninvestigations and the tough standard for the intelligence community to \ntry to meet exists for gathering foreign intelligence against \nterrorists, when you want to be able to gather that intelligence and \nmay need to do so in a very quick fashion in order to prevent an \nattack.\n  So the Wyden amendment would create the anomaly whereby U.S. overseas \nsurveillance in the course of, say, drug trafficking or money \nlaundering does not require a warrant, but foreign surveillance against \na terrorist does. That is not a wise way to write the statute. It \nshould not be more burdensome to monitor al-Qaida than it is to monitor \na drug cartel. So that, obviously, would need to be fixed.\n  Moreover, many foreign terrorist organizations engage in both \nterrorism and ordinary criminal behavior such as drug smuggling or \nmoney laundering. This provision, unfortunately, creates the perverse \nincentive for U.S. agents to monitor a group for its criminal \nactivities rather than on account of its terrorist activities. The \nprovision literally makes it easier to monitor a group on account of \nits smuggling of marijuana than on account of the fact that it is a \nforeign terrorist organization. These kinds of artificial distinctions, \nobviously, make no sense and overly complicate the mission that is very \ndifficult to begin with that we have asked our intelligence community \nto engage in.\n  In another area the Judiciary Committee stripped provisions from the \nIntelligence Committee bill that protect from lawsuits those \ntelecommunications companies that have assisted U.S. intelligence \nagencies. This is very wrong. These companies were asked by the United \nStates to help monitor al-Qaida after the September 11 attacks. Being \npatriotic Americans who wanted to help the United States in responding \nto the threat, the phone companies agreed to provide the help, and now \nthey are being punished with lawsuits that damage these companies' \nreputations and are very expensive for them to respond. These companies \nhelped us after September 11. They are not going to help again if we do \nnot protect them from these types of lawsuits. The Intelligence \nCommittee bill included a provision in the bill to do exactly that. Yet \nthat provision was stripped, as I said, in the Judiciary Committee. It \ntook away the protection for those who helped monitor al-Qaida. We need \nto restore that protection for these folks who helped us.\n  The bottom line is, what is our goal? Do we want to allow our \nintelligence agencies to be able to use every legal tool at their \ndisposal to track al-Qaida communications or do we want to again tie up \nour intelligence agencies in restrictions and procedures and then have \nsome future 9/11 Commission--after, God help us, perhaps another \nterrorist attack--say Congress balled this up and included so many \nrestrictions on intelligence gathering that they were not able to find \nout this attack was about to occur?\n  We have to enable our intelligence agencies, not unduly restrict \nthem. Obviously, we need oversight to prevent abuses. That is included \nin the statutory language, and that is fine. But it does not make sense \nto impose other restrictions that primarily serve only the purpose of \npreventing us from collecting good intelligence. There is no excuse, in \neffect, for making the same mistake twice.\n  So, in summary, we are going to be dealing with the FISA reform on \nthe floor of the Senate very soon. We need to. The authorization that \ncurrently exists expires on February 1. We need to have something in \nplace before that occurs. The bill that came out of the Intelligence \nCommittee by and large will provide the intelligence collection \nauthority that is needed, although there are some problems with it as \nwell. But the provisions that came out of the Judiciary Committee will \nnot work. They will not allow our intelligence collection agencies to \ndo their job properly and, as I said, create the anomalous situation \nwhere it is easier to go after intelligence on a criminal enterprise \nthan it is against a terrorist organization. That cannot be.\n  So I hope my colleagues, when we bring this bill to the Senate floor, \nwill consider the future, the threat of groups such as al-Qaida, and \nunderstand it is up to us to ensure our Nation can be protected and not \nmake the same mistake we made before of unduly restricting our \nintelligence-gathering agencies in fulfilling the mission--the so very \nimportant mission--we have asked them to perform.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Peru Free Trade \nAgreement on which we will vote midafternoon today.\n\n[[Page S14714]]\n\n  The trade policies set in Washington, and negotiated across the \nglobe, have a direct impact on places such as Lima and Steubenville and \nCleveland and Hamilton, OH. That is why voters in my State and across \nthe country sent a message loud and clear in November demanding a \ndifferent trade policy, a new direction in our trade relations.\n  A new report this month from the Center for Economic and Policy \nResearch says jobs paying at least $17 an hour--roughly $35,000 a \nyear--and provide health insurance and provide some form of pension \ndeclined by 3.5 million people between 2000 and 2006. If that doesn't \nunderscore and emphasize the decline of the middle class, no statistic \ndoes.\n  Working men and women in Ohio know that job loss--a job paying \n$35,000 or $40,000 or $45,000 or $50,000 a year--does not just affect \nthe worker or the workers' families, as tragic as that is; job loss--\nespecially job losses in the thousands--can devastate communities.\n  Peru and proposed deals with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea are \nbased on the North American Free Trade Agreement, the so-called NAFTA \nmodel.\n  NAFTA's proponents promised the agreement would create new jobs from \nexports and that U.S. exports to Mexico would exceed Mexican imports by \nsome $10 billion. NAFTA supporters also promised it would end our \nimmigration issue or problem. More on that at another time.\n  Today, imports from Mexico exceed exports by about $70 billion. \nInstead of a multibillion dollar trade surplus with Mexico, as NAFTA \nsupporters promised, it has gone the other way manyfold, with a $70 \nbillion deficit.\n  When I was elected to Congress in 1992, the U.S. trade deficit was \n$39 billion. Today, after NAFTA, CAFTA, the Central American Free Trade \nAgreement, and after inclusion in the World Trade Organization, our \ntrade deficit has grown to over $800 billion. It went from $39 billion \nin 1992 to, a decade and a half later, $800 billion, which is an \nincrease of twentyfold.\n  What NAFTA is, and what that model of trade is, is simple: A \nmechanism providing a source of cheap labor for multinational firms.\n  The NAFTA model includes rules on investment and procurement that \nfavor large companies at the expense of workers, at the expense of \nsmall manufacturers in Akron, Toledo, Lima, Findlay, and all over my \nState, and at the expense of the democratic process.\n  The investor-State rules of the Peru Free Trade Agreement and these \nother proposed deals will allow corporations to enforce their rights \nunder the agreement in a private trade tribunal. These are decisions \nwhere a corporation can sue a foreign government if that corporation \ndoesn't like its foods safety rules or if it doesn't like its workers \ncompensation system or its consumer protection laws. A company outside \nof the United States can sue our Government when, for instance, our \nGovernment protests the import of toxic toys from China or protests \ncontaminated toothpaste or dog food or any of the consumer protection \nfood safety rules that protect our families and our children.\n  Now, here is what the investor-State rules mean. If Peru tries to \nmake improvements to its food safety, health, and environmental laws, \nlarge corporations have a mechanism now for challenging it in a private \ntribunal. This isn't a government making the decision, it is a private \ntribunal, with generally anonymous people and trade lawyers who almost \nalways decide in support of weakening trade protection laws and decide \nin support of whatever generally corporate interests are in those \ncountries and make that decision accordingly.\n  That is not bothersome enough. If Peru passes strong consumer \nprotection laws or a strong food safety law or a strong generic drug \nlaw to bring prices down for its consumers, an American company can \ncome in--a drug company, a toy manufacturer, a food processor--and sue \nthe Government of Peru, saying we don't like these laws, and a private \ntribunal will make the decision. That already has happened under NAFTA, \nand I can give examples. It also works the other way. A company in Peru \ncan challenge consumer law, a food safety law, a protection for our \nfamilies law, if you will, in this private tribunal.\n  Meanwhile, for other parts of the FTA with Peru, such as labor and \nthe environment, we rely on this administration to enforce it. There is \na history of this administration unwilling to use the existing \nenforcement mechanisms available to us--not just in terms of domestic \npolicy, where this administration has weakened environmental laws and \nconsumer protection laws and food safety laws, and they have done it \ninternationally. Almost one of the first acts President Bush did in \n2001 was all about the Jordan Free Trade Agreement. The Jordan FTA was \nonce held as a standard in labor provisions. It passed in 2000 during \nthe Clinton administration. I was as critical of President Clinton as I \nam of President Bush. It is not a partisan thing, but today the vote \nmay look like that. The Bush administration turned the other way while \nhuman trafficking was rampant in Jordan.\n\n  In Jordan, workers from Bangladesh come in, their passports \nconfiscated, and they work with fabric transshipped from China. So they \nbring fabric produced by textile companies in China--companies with no \nlabor standards, little environmental standards, and no real protection \nfor workers--they bring in the textiles from China and they bring the \nworkers in from Bangladesh. Those workers work sometimes 20 hours a \nday, often without breaks. These textiles are assembled into apparel in \nJordan in sweatshops and exported to the United States, without duty, I \nmight add, without tariffs.\n  President Bush's first U.S. Trade Representative, Robert Zoellick, \nsent a letter to Jordan's Trade Minister in early 2001, saying the \nUnited States would not use the FTA to enforce certain provisions, \nincluding the labor chapter. Even though Jordan had strong labor \nprovisions, the administration said we are not going to enforce them.\n  The Jordanian Government has taken steps to fix its human trafficking \nproblem but not because of the enforcement tools available in the trade \nagreement; it is only because of the pressure from world opinion.\n  There is more work to do in Jordan. Last week, it was reported that \nworkers at a Jordanian factory, working under a subcontract, are being \nthreatened with forced deportation after striking to protest the \nimprisonment of six coworkers.\n  The National Labor committee, which has done extraordinary \ninvestigative work in Jordan, reports that the factory owner threatened \nto also cut off workers' food and water. This is the kind of country we \npass trade agreements with which clearly has no regard for its workers, \nalthough in this case they were imported workers from somewhere else.\n  Remember, factories in Jordan get duty-free access to the U.S. market \nunder the Jordan FTA. How can we not be surprised at similar stories in \nPeru, Colombia, Panama or South Korea?\n  Workers and consumers get short shrift. Slave wages are OK, unsafe \nworking conditions are OK, unsafe products and food are OK, \ncontaminated food is OK. With a total lack of protection in our trade \npolicy, we are importing not just the goods but the lax safety \nstandards. We are not just importing toxic toys from China, with lead-\nbased paint covering our Frankenstein mugs at Halloween time, we are \nimporting the values of those countries. If we are going to outsource \njobs to China, Peru or Mexico or Bangladesh, they are going to send \nproducts back into the United States under production standards we \nwould never allow in this country. We once did, but we would never \nallow those standards today, with the workers, the environment, the \nsafety, and all of that. We are importing Chinese values, those kinds \nof values.\n  With the total lack of protections in our trade policy, the Peru Free \nTrade Agreement, similar to NAFTA, which it follows, puts limits on the \nsafety standards we can require for imports.\n  If we relax basic health and safety rules to accommodate Bush-style, \nNAFTA-modeled trade agreements, then I am afraid we should not be \nsurprised to find lead paint in our toys and toxins in our toothpaste. \nWe have seen recall after recall after recall: contaminated toothpaste, \ncontaminated apple juice and dog food, toxic toys with lead levels \nthousands of\n\n[[Page S14715]]\n\ntimes higher than we would accept in this country. Yesterday, in \nCleveland, I had a meeting and a rally with a couple of mothers who \nhave small children--Sonia Rosado and Sara Correra. They are alarmed \nand concerned about what to buy their children. They asked: What toys \ncan we buy that we know are safe?\n  Due to trade agreements, there are more than 230 countries, and more \nthan 200,000 foreign manufacturers exporting FDA-regulated goods to \nAmerican consumers.\n  Before NAFTA, we imported 1 million lines of food. The FDA regulated \nabout $30 billion imported food goods. Now we import 18 million lines \nof foods and at least $65 billion imported food goods. The FDA doesn't \ninspect 50 percent of these or 20 percent or 10 percent; they don't \neven inspect 1 percent of imported foods. They inspect six-tenths of 1 \npercent. That means for every 1,000 food shipments that come to the \nUnited States, they inspect 6. For every 150, they inspect 1. It is a \npretty lethal combination, when you think about buying products, \nwhether it is processed food or toothpaste or toys from a country such \nas China or a country such as Peru, that don't follow the same food \nsafety standards or protection standards we do. You have American \ncompanies hiring subcontractors in Peru or China, and those \nsubcontractors are told over and over that you have to cut costs, cut \ncorners, and maybe do whatever you have to do to cut costs. Well, that \nmeans putting lead in toys because lead-based paint is cheaper, easier \nto apply, shinier, and looks a little better sometimes. Then we have \nthese products come into the United States and we don't inspect them in \nany significant number.\n\n  So with this trade policy--and Peru is another extension of our trade \npolicy with China and another extension of our trade policy similar to \nthe North American Free Trade Agreement, the NAFTA model--we are doing \nit again. It is a lethal combination. It is a trade model that chases \nshort-term profits for the few, at the expense of long-term prosperity, \nlong-term safety, long-term health for the many. It is a model that \nworks for a few and doesn't work for overwhelming numbers of Americans.\n  Look at our trade deficit: $800 billion, almost $3 billion a day. \nLook at our manufacturing job losses: 200,000 in my State alone for the \nlast 5 years. Look at wage stagnation: The middle class no longer gets \na raise in many cases. Look at imported product recalls: Week after \nweek, sometimes day after day, the Consumer Product Safety Commission \nsays take that off the market, we can't keep selling that. Look at \nforced labor and child labor and slave labor: We know that is going on \nin China. We say: Well, their products may be a little cheaper. It \nhelps us with profits. Companies are doing pretty well. We will accept \nthat stuff.\n  Look what it does to communities. When a plant closes in Gallipolis \nor a plant closes in Springfield, OH, families face huge tragedies--\nneighbors who don't work at those plants, but neighbors see police \nforces cut, teachers laid off, fewer firefighters ready to take care of \nthem in an emergency. The tax base is eroded, public services decline. \nThey all go together. We are setting ourselves up for more.\n  The President says he wants Congress to approve new trade deals with \nPeru, which the Senate will do today, unfortunately, with Colombia, \nwith Panama, and with Korea. Secretary Gutierrez called yesterday for a \nvote on the Colombia Free Trade Agreement soon after the Peru vote. I \ninvite the President--I would love to see the President come to \nPortsmouth, OH, on the Ohio River, or sit down with a machinist in Lake \nErie or Toledo, or sit down with a tool and die maker, a tool and die \nshop owner in Akron. Their productivity is up. These workers are doing \nbetter and better in terms of productivity. That is a testament to \ntheir hard work and their skills, but our Nation's workers too often \ndon't share in the wealth. They are making more money. They are making \nmore profits in the history of our country, particularly since World \nWar II: As productivity goes up, so do wages go up. No more. Workers \nare more and more productive as they compete on a very unlevel playing \nfield with low income, very underpaid, sometimes slave labor, forced \nlabor, child labor workers in other countries. They are more and more \ncompetitive, but their wages stay flat.\n  The President wants these trade deals, and in 2002 Congress gave the \nPresident the authority to negotiate and to sign and seal these trade \ndeals. All Congress gets to do is vote yes or no. No amendments. No \nparticularly extensive debate. You have to vote yes or you have to vote \nno. You can't make any changes.\n  When I talk to workers in Marion or Mount Vernon or Dayton or \nMansfield about fast track--this kind of unusual rule that we operate \ntrade agreements under in the House and Senate--they ask: What is the \npoint of Congress being involved at all? All we do is say yes to the \nPresident.\n  The reason the President wants fast track is it silences opposition, \nit cuts out debate, and pushes through these unpopular trade deals. We \nall know in this body--every single Republican and every single \nDemocrat in this body--that these trade agreements--NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR \nwith China, trade agreement with South Korea, trade agreement with \nColombia, trade agreement with Peru and Panama--if they came to a vote \nin the United States among 300 million Americans, they would be soundly \ndefeated. We all know that. Many of us ran campaigns last year, in our \nelections a year ago, talking about these trade agreements and what \nthey mean.\n  The current system is not sustainable. People in Ohio and throughout \nthis country will not stand for more of it. Labor unions, environmental \ngroups, church groups, development groups are not out lobbying for the \nPeru Free Trade Agreement. People don't come up to me at schools or in \nchurch or in factories or in small businesses or walking down the \nstreet or when my wife and I go to the grocery store, and say: Hey, you \nought to pass another trade agreement because they are working well. \nOur trade deficit only went from $38 billion to $800 billion in 15 \nyears. They are really working. More jobs created; more manufacturing.\n  Of course, they are not asking us to vote for these trade agreements \nbecause they simply aren't working. Why would we do another trade \nagreement when NAFTA didn't work, when CAFTA didn't work, when PNTR \nwith China doesn't work, when these other trade agreements simply don't \nwork?\n  I think Americans want trade. I want trade. We want trade. We want \nplenty of it, but under rules that raise standards and ensure our \nexperts have a lasting and sustainable market for consumers. Trade can \nbe a development tool, but the way this administration pursues trade is \nnot promoting sustainable development. We want trade with countries \nthat will be a lasting market for American goods--a market for American \ngoods, not just a source such as Jordan has become, such as China is, \nsuch as Peru is becoming--not a source for cheap labor. The American \npeople want a pro-trade, pro-development, pro-working families, \nforward-looking approach.\n  We have a choice. We can work with the countries we want to trade \nwith, make sure they play fair, make sure they can purchase our \nproducts, make sure the standards of living go up in those countries \nover a long period, or we can continue to walk myopically, \nnearsightedly, blindly into even more of the same trade deals. We can \ncontinue free trade on the cheap, or we can respect the progress \nAmerica has made over the last century: our hard-fought labor laws, our \nfood safety laws, our consumer product laws that protect children, that \nprotect our families, that give us one more reason to be proud of our \ngreat country; or we can do what the President wants and what the \nleadership from the Republican Party in this Congress wants. We can \ntake two steps--we can take two steps back from this progress to \naccommodate lax labor and safety standards.\n  This Congress has a choice too. We can pass legislation to combat \nunfair currency, or we can continue to let China cheat. We can bolster \ntrade enforcement, or we can rely on the administration's discretion to \nenforce our trade laws. We can assist workers laid off to unfair trade, \nor we can continue to look the other way.\n  We have heard voters in Ohio and around the country call for big \nchanges to trade policy. We are hearing consumers demand accountability \nfor the\n\n[[Page S14716]]\n\nunsafe imports that are on our store shelves. Looking into the eyes of \nSara and her children yesterday, looking into the eyes of Sara \nyesterday, of her friend Sonia, and seeing the look she had about why \nisn't the government on our side on this--it does matter. We are \nhearing consumers demand accountability for the unsafe imports that are \non our store shelves.\n  Passing a trade agreement with Peru is not the change Americans \ndemanded last year, that Americans continue to demand now, and that \nAmerica will continue to demand in the years ahead.\n  I yield the floor and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of H.R. 3688, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3688) to implement the United States-Peru \n     Trade Promotion Agreement.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill be 90 minutes of debate equally divided.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words as to why I am \nstrongly opposed to the Peru Free Trade Agreement. Some of the points I \nmade last night, but I think they need reiteration. The untold story of \nthe economy in the United States is that the middle class is shrinking, \npoverty is increasing, and the gap between the rich and the poor is \ngrowing much wider. I am not going to stand here and tell you trade is \nthe only reason the middle class is shrinking, but I am going to tell \nyou it is a major reason, and it is an issue we have to deal with.\n\n  Mr. President, since George W. Bush has been in office, 5 million \nAmericans have slipped out of the middle class and into poverty, 8\\1/2\\ \nmillion Americans have lost their health insurance, median household \nincome for working-age families has gone down by nearly $2,500, over 3 \nmillion good-paying manufacturing jobs have been lost, 3 million \nAmericans have lost their pensions, wages and salaries are now at their \nlowest share of GDP since 1929, and we are in a situation now where the \nwealthiest 1 percent of Americans earn far more income than the bottom \n50 percent.\n  In the last number of years, technology has exploded and worker \nproductivity has increased. Yet in the midst of all of that, the middle \nclass is struggling desperately to keep their heads above water, and \npoverty is increasing.\n  I think the question this Senate should be spending a lot of time on \nanswering is why that is happening. Why is it that everything being \nequal, our kids will have, for the first time in the modern history of \nthe United States, a lower standard of living than we do? Why is it \nthat a two-income family today has less disposable income than a one-\nincome family did 30 years ago? In the midst of all this globalization, \nall of the explosion of technology, all of the increase in worker \nproductivity, there is more and more economic desperation in the United \nStates, and the only people who are doing very well are the wealthiest \n1 or 2 percent of the population.\n  Now, I think there is a real problem when you have unfettered free-\ntrade agreements which essentially allow corporate America to throw \nAmerican workers out on the street, move to China, move to other low-\nwage countries, pay people their 50 cents an hour, $1 an hour, and then \nbring their products back into this country. One of the great crises we \nare facing is we are not building manufacturing plants in the United \nStates and putting people to work at good wages with good benefits. Not \nonly are we losing blue-collar jobs, we are losing white-collar \ninformation technology jobs. And millions of parents all over this \ncountry are wondering what kind of jobs are going to be available for \ntheir kids.\n  The fact is, these free-trade agreements have not worked. I don't \nknow how many times and what people need to understand that. Just take \na look at NAFTA. I remember, because I was a Member of the House during \nthat debate, that the supporters of unfettered free trade told us over \nand over that NAFTA would increase jobs in the United States. But \naccording to the Economic Policy Institute, NAFTA has led to the \nelimination of over 1 million American jobs.\n  Now, why would you want to follow a paradigm, a trade policy approach \nwhich has failed in the past? If it has failed time and time again, why \nwould you keep doing the same thing? A manager of a baseball team who \nhas losing records year after year gets fired. That is what happens. \nThe team changes its approach.\n  Right now, we have a huge trade deficit. It is a growing trade \ndeficit. We are losing good-paying jobs. Pressure on wages is to push \nthem down into a race to the bottom. That is a failed trade policy.\n  Supporters of unfettered free trade told us that NAFTA would \nsignificantly reduce the flow of illegal immigration into this country \nbecause the standard of living in Mexico would increase. Well, guess \nwhat. They were wrong. It didn't happen. As a result of NAFTA, severe \npoverty in Mexico increased. It didn't go down, it increased, and 1.3 \nmillion small farmers in that country have been displaced, with real \nwages for the majority of Mexicans having gone down. All of this has \nled to a 60-percent annual increase in illegal immigration from Mexico \nduring the first 6 years of NAFTA alone.\n  What is happening in Mexico and in the United States and in many \nother countries today because of unfettered free trade is we are seeing \na huge increase in the gap between the people on top and everybody \nelse. I will give just one example. In Mexico today, a poor country, a \ngentleman named Carlos Slim has just surpassed Bill Gates as the \nwealthiest person in the world, worth over $60 billion, in a poor \ncountry. Incredibly, because of unfettered free trade and near liberal \ntype of economic policy, Mr. Slim is worth more than the poorest 45 \nmillion Mexicans combined. One man has more wealth than the bottom 45 \npercent, which happens to be 45 million Mexicans. That is one of the \nmanifestations of unfettered free trade.\n  And the situation is the same with China. I remember the debate about \nChina--we have a great market in China. If we open permanent normal \ntrade relations with China, it will create all kinds of jobs. Nobody \nbelieves that is true. We have a huge trade deficit with China, a trade \ndeficit that is growing. People today are doing Christmas shopping. \nWhen they go to the stores, the products they will find from A to Z are \nmade in China, not made in the United States. I can tell you that in my \nsmall State of Vermont, we have lost 25 percent of our manufacturing \njobs in the last 6 years--not just due to trade, but trade has played \nan important role.\n  All over this country, people are wondering why corporate America is \nnot reinvesting in Pennsylvania or Vermont or the rest of the country. \nWell, you know why. They are investing billions and billions of dollars \nin China, hiring people there at pennies an hour, and then they bring \ntheir products back into this country. And people are wondering: How do \nyou become a great economy? How do you lead the world? How do you have \ngood jobs for your kids if we are not producing the goods that our \npeople purchase?\n  You will remember, Mr. President, that 20, 25 years ago, the largest \nemployer in the United States was General Motors. They produced \nautomobiles. They paid people good wages, they had good benefits, and \nthere was a strong union. Today, the largest employer in the United \nStates is Wal-Mart, with low wages, minimal benefits, and vehemently \nantiunion.\n  What I also don't understand, in terms of this trade debate, is who \nthe\n\n[[Page S14717]]\n\nCongress thinks it is representing. You go out in my State and all over \nthis country, and people say: We do not like unfettered free trade. If \nyou want to be a political opportunist, and you don't care about the \nissue, you should vote against the Peru trade agreement. That is what \nthe people want you to do. In fact, according to a recent Wall Street \nJournal NBC news poll, 59 percent of Republicans--of Republicans--\nbelieve unfettered free trade has been bad for the U.S. economy. And a \nmajority of Democrats feel the same way. So I think maybe the Congress \nhas got to start saying to the large corporation CEOs, who in fact do \nvery well by unfettered free trade, that our job is not just to \nrepresent them but to represent the working families of this country.\n\n  This agreement will simply continue a failed trade policy. And, Mr. \nPresident, you know, because you are a new Senator as well, that during \nthe last campaign, many of us raised this issue about unfettered free \ntrade. What we heard from constituents was that they wanted a change in \ntrade policy. They wanted companies to start investing in America, not \nin China. They are worried about the future.\n  So the bottom line is, we have a failed trade policy, and before we \npass any more trade agreements, I think we need to take a hard look at \nwhat past trade agreements have done. I think we need a moratorium on \nthem, and we need to develop new trade agreements. Trade is a good \nthing, but we need new trade agreements that represent the working \nfamilies of this country so that we can see our wages and our incomes \ngoing up, not going down; our health care benefits going up, not going \ndown; so that we are not engaged in a race to the bottom; so that we \nare helping poor countries improve their standard of living, while our \nstandard of living is going up and not bringing everybody down.\n  I hope Members of the Senate will give serious consideration to \nrethinking our trade policies and voting this Peru trade agreement \ndown.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of \nthe United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement. Peru is no ordinary \ncountry, and the Peru agreement is no ordinary free-trade agreement.\n  Peru is a vibrant country. It is marked by the diversity of its \ndramatic and varied landscapes, abundant and rich wildlife, and strong \npeople. Peru provides a home to more than 170 million acres of forest \nand 84 of the 103 existing ecosystems on the planet. And it is the \nbirthplace of the Inca civilization, the builders of the incomparable \nMachu Picchu complex in the Andean highlands. Their descendants live on \ntoday in Peru's thriving indigenous communities. This remarkable \ndiversity of landscape, wildlife, and people deserves to be protected, \nand the strong labor and environmental provisions of the Peru agreement \nensure that it will.\n  Since 1958, when the United States entered into a free-trade \nagreement with Israel, we have entered into bilateral or regional free-\ntrade agreements with no fewer than 15 additional countries, and since \nthen Democrats have sought to make labor and environmental issues a \ngreater priority in trade agreements. We have had limited success until \nnow.\n  The Peru agreement is in fact a groundbreaking achievement. Months of \ncomplex negotiations involving numerous parties and difficult \ncompromises on all sides resulted in a landmark deal between Congress \nand the administration. Believe me, this is a very significant and \nunexpected breakthrough that was achieved not too long ago. We agreed \nto include strong labor and environmental provisions in all our pending \ntrade agreements beginning with the Peru Free Trade Agreement. That was \nthe understanding, all agreements beginning with Peru--truly a \nremarkable accomplishment, and we should be proud of what we have \nachieved. For the first time, the Peru agreement requires the parties \nto implement the five core International Labor Organization standards. \nFor the first time, the Peru agreement requires the parties to \nimplement seven core environmental treaties. And, for the first time, \nthe Peru agreement makes these labor and environmental provisions fully \nenforceable by subjecting them to the same dispute settlement mechanism \nthat applies to all other obligations.\n  Some may criticize the agreement as not going far enough, but these \nprovisions are in fact exactly what many of us in Congress in the labor \nand environmental movements have been seeking to include in trade \nagreements for decades. They will benefit workers, they will encourage \nenvironmentally sustainable development, and they will ensure the Peru \nagreement helps to export our fundamental values abroad at the same \ntime that it helps to export our products and services abroad.\n  The agreement also strengthens our ties with a stalwart ally in an \nincreasingly troubled part of the world. It is an agreement with a \nleading reformer in our hemisphere, it is an agreement with one of the \nfastest growing economies in Latin America, and it is an agreement with \nsolid commercial benefits for the United States. Mr. President, 98 \npercent of Peruvian exports to the United States already receive duty-\nfree treatment under various United States preference programs. This \nagreement levels the playing field and allows our exports to enjoy the \nsame benefits in Peru.\n  To cite one example, more than two-thirds of current United States \nfarm exports to Peru, including delicious Montana beef, I might add, \nand wheat, will receive immediate duty-free access to Peru under the \nagreement. All remaining tariffs on Montana and other U.S. agricultural \ngoods will be eliminated within 17 years.\n  For Peru, this agreement means better conditions for its workers, \nstrengthened protection for its amazingly diverse environment, and \ngreater integration into the world economy. Our neighbors to the south \ncan hope it will represent a first step toward increased prosperity, \ntransparency, and stability for the Latin American region as a whole.\n  This agreement demonstrates what Congress and the administration can \nachieve when we work together. I hope we can build on the success of \nthis agreement to heal the wounds of previous battles and I hope we can \nbegin to recreate a consensus for trade liberalization going forward.\n  But the Peru agreement is only one step in this process. Enactment of \na robust and modernized trade adjustment assistance program should be \nour next focus, certainly before this Congress considers additional \nfree trade agreements. We cannot express support for trade agreements \nunless we fulfill our responsibility to ensure that trade-displaced \nworkers, whether in manufacturing or the services sector, are able to \nretrain and retool for the 21st century economy. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues and with the administration on trade \nadjustment assistance reauthorization very soon.\n  For all these reasons, I am pleased to support the United States Peru \nTrade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act and I urge my colleagues \nto support it as well.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous \nconsent the time be charged equally against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I rise this morning to speak on the \nproposed free trade agreement with our friend and neighbor to the \nsouth, the country of Peru. This is, I believe, a critical piece of \nlegislation. The approval of this agreement would do wonders to advance \nUnited States interests in the region. This is a treaty that should be \napproved because it is good for our bilateral relations with this very \nimportant country, it is good for our overall relations with the \nregion, but most of all we should approve this treaty because it is \ngood for the United States\n\n[[Page S14718]]\n\neconomy and it is good for Florida's economy, it is good for bilateral \nrelations, and it is good for our overall security posture in the \nregion.\n  The legislation will make trade with Peru a two-way street, will \nbenefit small and medium-size businesses, and will reduce barriers to \nservices and to investments.\n  Over two-thirds of total U.S. exports are manufactured goods, so \nagreements that remove tariff and nontariff barriers in foreign \ncountries benefit all American manufacturers, large and small.\n  Implementation of this agreement would raise a total of U.S. \nmerchandise exports to Peru by over $1 billion in the first year. This \nagreement will add over $2 billion per year to the U.S. gross domestic \nproduct. Further, this agreement contains groundbreaking enforceable \ncore labor and environmental provisions. I know these are important.\n  It is not just is it good for business, but is this something that is \ngoing to also speak about our core values when it comes to labor \nstandards? Is it something that we believe will further the condition \nof the world as it relates to the environment?\n  This agreement includes provisions that will enhance both of those. \nFor the first time, future administrations will have the right to take \ndispute action if labor or environmental issues become a problem. So \nthis will have enforcement mechanisms built in. Never has this been the \ncase with any of our previous trade agreements.\n  So we have made maybe a marker, maybe a breakthrough in a way that we \ncan have more of these trade agreements come to pass that are good for \nour country, that are good for our economy and that of our neighbors, \nbut yet give people the sense of assurance that environmental and labor \nrights are going to be protected.\n  The first year of implementation will boost Florida's total economic \noutput by $140 million, create more than 900 jobs in the State I \nrepresent, and increase workers' earnings by $35 million.\n  In the next decade, it is estimated that Florida's total economic \noutput would increase by more than $760 million per year. Exports to \nPeru would support more than 4,900 jobs and increase workers' total \npersonal income by more than $180 million a year. Fifty-four percent of \nall U.S. high-tech goods exported to Peru are made in Florida. Twenty-\nthree percent of all U.S. exports to Peru are made in Florida. Florida \nis the hub for transportation, trade, finance, insurance, and several \nother professional services provided to companies from all over the \nworld doing business in Peru. More than half of all Peruvians visiting \nthe United States come to Florida.\n  Peru's democracy has successfully weathered serious security and \npolitical challenges to its institutions over the last decade. But it \nis a democratic country, and democracy has proven strong, and it has \nproven that it can, in fact, withstand challenges from all sides.\n  The decision by newly elected President Alan Garcia to support the \nUnited States-Peru TPA marks a turning point in our bilateral relations \nand political stability by providing for a secure and predictable \nframework for investors, protections for intellectual property rights \nand worker rights, and an innovative process for public scrutiny \nregarding the enforcement of environmental regulations.\n  Peru's democracy has successfully weathered serious security and \npolitical challenges to its institutions by the fact that elections are \nnow repeatedly held and that, in fact, these elections have an outcome \nthat is honored by all of the citizens of Peru which shows us they are \na country strongly on the path to democratic institution building.\n  But a great part of this is also economic success. We cannot just \nbuild democratic institutions; the people must believe by following the \nfaith of democracy, by following the path of trade and partnership with \nthe United States they can also better their lives; that, in fact, the \nfalse prophets who would preach to the people of Peru that the path to \ntheir better future lies in antagonism to the United States, lies in \nthe path of socialism, which has been proven to be a failure throughout \nthe world wherever tried, is to allow them an opportunity to have a \nsuccessful future by following the path of trade and partnership with \nthe world of beliefs in the globalized economy that all of us can \nbenefit from if it is done right, and if it is done with the right \nprovisions.\n  The fact is, at this point in time, we are at a significant \ncrossroads in our relations with Latin America. It is an area of the \nworld that as long as things are going fine oftentimes we choose to \nignore. But at the current moment in time, we find that in agreeing to \nthis proposal for and altering the trade agreement with Peru that we \nwould be rewarding the democratic institutions that have maintained \nPeru over the last decade, but also we would be telling them: We want \nto trade with you. We want to do business with you.\n  As we enhance the job creation in my home State of Florida, as I have \nsaid, as well as in the United States, there is no question that we \nwill also be enhancing job creation in Peru itself; that those people \nin Peru who aspire to a better life, who aspire to an opportunity \nperhaps to own their own small business, who aspire to have an \nopportunity to maybe have more yield and output from their agricultural \nproduction, those who benefit from the opportunities of trade and \ninvestment will all see the benefits and the fruits of this partnership \nwith the United States.\n\n  Now it is good for Peru. But broadly speaking, trade agreements are \ngood for America, and they are good for our relations with the region. \nSo, therefore, I would say we should approve this agreement today, we \nshould vote in favor of our trade agreement with Peru, but we should \nnot stop there. We should soon also see progress on our trade agreement \nwith Panama and our trade agreement with Colombia.\n  The template of this agreement, while we have additional protections \nas well as enforcement methods for labor and environmental rights, is \nthe template that we should use in moving forward the Panamanian Free \nTrade Agreement and the Colombian Free Trade Agreement. We have no \ncloser friends or neighbors than Panama and Colombia. We have no better \nfriends in the region than the Government of President Uribe, where in \npartnership with now two consecutive administrations, the United States \nhas taken a bold step forward in saying: We will help you, Colombia, to \nget rid of the narcoterrorists in your country. We will help you to \nachieve a better life and a more secure future for your own people by \nhelping you to defeat the people who will sow terror on your streets \nand in your highways.\n  In that we have made tremendous progress. As we have done so, we have \ndiminished the amount of illicit and illegal drugs from Colombia that \nare entering the United States and poisoning our American streets. But \nwe have done more than that. We have also helped them pacify their \ncountry. Their country is in a huge turnaround. Their country has \ntremendous economic growth. The Colombian people can now freely travel \nthe country. That is a result of the good efforts of the United States \nworking in partnership with the Colombian Government.\n  Colombia has a bright and tremendous future. Forty million people are \nin the country of Colombia. It is a very diverse country. From the \ncoast of the Caribbean to the Andes and the interior, it is a country \nof resourceful and tremendously ingenious people who would benefit \ntremendously from the opportunity of having a free-trade agreement with \nthe United States.\n  It is a free-trade agreement that will create jobs in America, that \nwill also enhance the opportunity for the same kind of economic growth \nand job creation that I have talked about with Peru.\n  The Panama agreement is a much smaller agreement. Panama increasingly \nhas become the trading hub of the Americas through the Panama Canal. \nAnd we now know that for more than a couple of decades, Panama has been \nin charge and has been running its own canal in a very successful way. \nNow they are enhancing it by expanding it.\n  The banking system, from Asia to the Americas, seems to be at a \ncrossroads through Panama. It is a country with which we should have a \ntrade agreement. We have one that is there.\n\n[[Page S14719]]\n\nIt is teed up. We should move it forward. It should be the next one we \napprove, with Colombia coming along not long after. But these are \ntremendously important. These countries look to these agreements as a \nway forward, as a way of enhancing their partnership with our country, \nand rejecting other ideologies.\n  You know we might as well talk about this. I think it is very \nimportant. On Sunday we had a very startling event occur in the region. \nVenezuela held an election in what was a proposal from an increasingly \nauthoritarian leader, Hugo Chavez, to become essentially President for \nlife. It was essentially to give him the authority to rule by decree, \nto declare a state of emergency and essentially suggest that all of the \ninstitutions of the country be suspended and he would be the sole \nruler.\n  It also went further, and it said the country would take a socialist \npath. Now, this is only the latest excess by a leader who is excessive \nin many ways, his rhetoric and his action. But this latest excess was \nrejected by the people of Venezuela.\n  I congratulate the people of Venezuela for taking this bold step in \nthe direction of not a single authoritarian person in charge of the \ngovernment but one who would allow a more democratic future for the \npeople of Venezuela. The people of Venezuela courageously went to the \nstreets, courageously demonstrated against tremendous oppression and \nrepression by the Venezuelan authorities, and continued to insist that \nthey have a free vote on Sunday, and they did.\n  They rejected the overreaching of President Chavez. But this ideology \nthat President Chavez preaches, the failed ideology that was preached \nby Fidel Castro that has taken Cuba on the path of destruction, \ndisaster, and desolation is now trying to be inflicted on the people of \nVenezuela, where they are now seeing the same kind of food shortage we \nhave seen in Cuba for almost a half a century beginning to manifest \nitself in a country that is so oil rich it is ridiculous.\n  The fact is, we see in the path to bilateral trade agreements with \nthe United States a rejection of these failed ideologies, a rejection \nof the Chavez way, and a welcoming of a partnership with the United \nStates, one that allows independence and democratic institutions to \nflourish, while at the same time improving the lives of the people of \nthe region.\n  I urge my colleagues to look forward also to the Colombian and \nPanamanian trade agreements. They should be coming. We need to proceed \nto move those forward. They are tremendously important for these \ncountries. Let's engage in this friendship, but let's take care of \nfirst things first and today resoundingly approve the free-trade \nagreement with Peru that is good for America, good for our Nation, but \nalso good for Peru, and for our relations with the region.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak for up to 5 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to make a very \nsimple statement; that is, about our food security in America.\n  For all of my life--as a farmer and a rancher and attorney general--I \nhave recognized importance of food security for America. On my desk in \nmy Senate office here in Washington, DC, there is a sign that says: \n``No Farms, No Food.''\n  It is important for all of us in this Chamber to recognize the \nimportance of the food security of the United States of America by \nmoving forward with the passage of the 2007 farm bill.\n  As the Presiding Officer well knows, the Agriculture Committee, under \nthe leadership of Senator Harkin and Senator Chambliss, worked very \nhard--worked for weeks and weeks and months and months--to come up with \nwhat is a very good farm bill. It is a very good farm bill that invests \nin the nutritional needs of our country. It is a very good farm bill \nthat helps us unveil the clean energy future of America and helps us \ngrow our way to energy independence. It is a very good farm bill that \ninvests such as no other farm bill ever has in the conservation \nopportunities we need to protect our land and our water in America. It \nis a very good farm bill in all respects, and it is paid for. It is a \nfarm bill that is paid for.\n  We have been on this farm bill now in the Senate for the last several \nweeks, since before Thanksgiving, and have not been able to move ahead. \nThe majority leader, Senator Reid, has propounded a proposal where we \nwould move forward with a set of discrete amendments, giving the \nRepublicans 10 amendments, having the Democrats have 5 amendments and 2 \nadditional amendments would be considered. It seems to me that is a \nvery eminently fair proposal, and I would ask my colleagues, both on \nthe Democratic side and the Republican side, to stand behind that \nprocedural framework so we can get onto the farm bill and get this farm \nbill across the finish line.\n  It is my view the people of America deserve no less from this Senate, \nand I am very hopeful we will be able to come to that agreement very \nsoon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/04/senate-section/article/S14719-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote that \nwas scheduled for 2:15 occur at 2:30, and the 15 minutes between now \nand 2:30 be equally divided in the usual fashion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise in opposition of the Peru Trade \nPromotion Agreement. While the Peru Trade Promotion Agreement includes \nimportant labor and environmental provisions, I do not believe that it \nrepresents a large enough departure from the failed NAFTA-style free \ntrade model to merit my support.\n  Instead of fast-tracking new trade agreements through Congress, we \nneed to take a deep breath and assess the impact of our failed trade \npolicies and take the country and our economy in a better direction.\n  We should focus on fixing the problems created by NAFTA and other \ntrade agreements, extending trade adjustment assistance for displaced \nworkers, reinvigorating our domestic economy, and creating jobs for \nhard-working Americans.\n  The inclusion of labor and environmental protections in the Peru deal \nis an important and positive development, but without an administration \nwilling to enforce these provisions, the promises ring hollow.\n  The Bush administration has an abysmal record when it comes to \nenforcing trade regulations, and it is not a stretch of the imagination \nto assume that their unwillingness to enforce regulations will extend \nto Peru.\n  Without strong enforcement of these important labor and environmental \nprovisions, they are nothing more than words on a piece of paper.\n  Already we are seeing the Peruvian government backtrack on the spirit \nof the environmental provisions included in the agreement. \nInternational environmental groups have documented a number of recent \nactions taken by Peru's government that provide a serious cause for \nalarm.\n  As an example, in September, a law was proposed to remove half a \nmillion acres from the Bahuaja-Sonene National Park and devote the area \nto oil and gas exploration and exploitation. The Superintendent of \nPeru's natural protected areas determined that excluding the zone from \nthe national park would violate both the Peruvian\n\n[[Page S14720]]\n\nConstitution and Peru's trade promotion agreement obligations. The \nwhistleblower in this situation was immediately fired from his post.\n  And in July, Peru offered concessions for oil and gas exploration and \nexploitation for over a fifth of the Peruvian Amazon rainforest despite \na report by the national ombudsman determining that elements of this \nprocess were illegal\n  What we are seeing with these recent developments in Peru related to \nenvironmental protections is that despite increased enforcement \nmechanisms in the free trade agreement for labor and for the \nenvironment, the NAFTA model perpetuates a ``race to the bottom'' that \nhas become the unfortunate hallmark of free trade agreements.\n  When trade agreements are used only as a tool to provide cheap labor \nfor American companies, everyone loses. The United States can be a \nleader in the global economy if we promote fair trade that creates \nsustainable markets for American goods and services, protects the \nenvironment and improves wages and standards of living for American and \nforeign workers.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as chairman of the Committee on the \nJudiciary, which has jurisdiction over our Nation's intellectual \nproperty laws, I feel compelled to comment on the intellectual property \nchapter of the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement.\n  In the Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002, Congress instructed the \nadministration to negotiate agreements with other nations that, among \nother things, reflect a standard of protection for intellectual \nproperty ``similar to that found in United States law.'' In many \nrespects, the intellectual property chapter of the Peru Trade Promotion \nAgreement meets that goal, for it will require Peru to raise its \nstandards of protection for our intellectual property.\n  I am concerned, however, that some aspects of the intellectual \nproperty chapter prescribe the rules for protection so specifically \nthat Congress will be hampered from making constructive policy changes \nin the future. The art of drafting the chapter is in raising \nintellectual property protections to a standard similar to ours, \nwithout limiting Congress's ability to make appropriate refinements to \nthe intellectual property law in the future. The flexibility necessary \nfor the proper balance is found in many provisions of the intellectual \nproperty chapter, for which I commend the U.S. Trade Representative. \nOther provisions, however, are too fixed and rigid, and may have the \nperverse effect of restricting the Congress's ability to make \nlegitimate changes in United States law, while keeping our \ninternational commitments. I expect that in the future, with improved \nconsultation between the Committee on the Judiciary and the Office of \nthe United States Trade Representative, we can avoid these concerns.\n  Our trade promotion law also instructed the administration to \nnegotiate agreements that provide strong protection for new and \nemerging technologies and new methods of transmitting and distributing \nproducts embodying intellectual property. This, too, is an objective I \nsupport. Under our laws, many such new technologies and consumer \ndevices rely, at least in part, on fair use and other limitations and \nexceptions to the copyright laws. Our trade agreements should promote \nsimilar fair use concepts, in order not to stifle the ability of \nindustries relying on emerging technologies to flourish.\n  Finally, a longstanding priority of mine has been the promotion of \naffordable, lifesaving medicines to address the public health problems \nafflicting many, primarily developing Nations--particularly those \nresulting from HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other epidemics. The \nUnited States made such a commitment in the 2001 Doha Declaration; I \nwas pleased that the U.S. Trade Representative reaffirmed this \ncommitment in May and that Peru's rights to promote access to medicines \nis preserved in this agreement.\n  There is much in the intellectual property chapter of this free trade \nagreement that I support. I look forward to the Judiciary Committee's \nbeing consulted by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative earlier, \nand more frequently, in the future, so that we can continue to improve \non these issues.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, when voters gave Democrats control of \nCongress, they wanted a new direction on trade policy. They wanted \ntrade agreements that would hold our trading partners to the same labor \nand environmental standards expected of U.S. companies. And they wanted \ntrade agreements that would level the playing field for U.S. \nbusinesses. Democrats listened.\n  I am supporting the Peru FTA because it is a new model for trade \nagreements that includes enforceable labor and environmental \nprotections. For the first time, the U.S. will have the right to hold a \ntrading partner accountable if labor or environmental issues become a \nproblem.\n  The Peru FTA benefits Wisconsin companies and workers. Wisconsin \nexports to Peru have increased from $9.3 million in 2002 to $43.5 \nmillion in 2006. This agreement will help trade between the U.S. and \nPeru flourish and keep businesses and jobs in Wisconsin, something I \ncouldn't say about several previous trade agreements. Further, the Peru \nFTA eliminates the current 10 percent tariff on U.S. goods entering \nPeru. This will remove barriers to Wisconsin exports and make Wisconsin \nbusinesses even more competitive.\n  The Peru FTA is the first step in a new direction for trade policy \nthat will enforce labor and environmental standards and help U.S. \nbusinesses gain access to new markets.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss H.R. 3688, the \nUnited States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement. Washington State is \nextremely trade dependent, and this agreement will have direct impacts \nto my constituents at home, particularly farmers growing asparagus. In \naddition, I am concerned about existing labor practices for miners in \nPeru.\n  The domestic asparagus industry has been economically injured by the \nAndean Trade Preference Act's, ATPA, extended duty-free status to \nimports of fresh Peruvian asparagus. There has been a 2000-percent \nincrease in Peruvian asparagus imports into the U.S. since ATPA was \nenacted. The asparagus industry suffered the greatest negative impact \nfrom the ATPA, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission's \nanalysis of the agreement. The effects of the agreement to Washington \nState's asparagus industry were dramatic.\n  Prior to the ATPA, there were over 55 million pounds of asparagus \ncanned in Washington State, roughly two-thirds of the industry. By \n2007, all three asparagus canners in Washington relocated to Peru. As \nasparagus production fell, I fought to provide assistance for these \nhard-working men and women whose industry had been devastated.\n  To mitigate the impacts to growers, I tried to get them trade \nadjustment assistance. I have secured funding over the past several \nyears to conduct research on a mechanical harvester to make this labor-\nintensive crop less costly to produce. Most recently, I helped secure \n$15 million in the farm bill for a market loss assistance program for \nasparagus growers. This funding will help farmers who have continued to \ngrow asparagus despite the challenges ATPA has presented. I am hopeful \nthat this program will help growers continue to invest in asparagus.\n  Many of our asparagus growers have turned to other crops, and this \nPeru trade bill will help them, along with many other farmers in \nWashington State. While I have serious concerns about the continued \neffects on the asparagus industry in the U.S. and in Washington State, \noverall this bill will have a positive impact for agriculture in \nWashington State.\n  I would also like to note my concern about labor practices for miners \nin Peru and the unintended negative impact that this agreement may have \non them.\n  A report by the Congressional Research Service indicates that while \nPeru endorses the International Labor Organization's core labor \nstandards in the PTPA, concerns remain about their compliance with and \nthe enforcement of these standards. I was discouraged to learn that \nwhile Congress was considering the PTPA, the Peruvian Government \nstalled in its efforts to secure statutory protections for miners and \ndeclared it illegal for metal miners to continue striking in support of \nstronger labor laws.\n\n[[Page S14721]]\n\n  As chair of the Senate HELP Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace \nSafety and an advocate for labor rights and workplace protections, I am \nconcerned that the Peruvian Government's most recent actions do not \nconvey a good-faith effort to reform its labor laws. I have worked \ntirelessly to ensure that miners in our own country have the safety \nprotections on the job that they deserve. In light of the tragic mine \ndisasters in West Virginia, I was proud to help write and pass the \nlandmark MINER's Act last year. Miners put their lives on the line \nevery day to provide for their families, and we must work to ensure \nthey have a respected voice at the table and that their rights are \nprotected.\n  While I believe this agreement will ultimately do more good than \nharm, I hope my colleagues will join me in encouraging the Peruvian \nPresident, Congress, and Labor Minister to fulfill their promise and \npass much needed labor reform legislation without hesitation.\n  As you may know, Washington State is the most trade dependent State \nin the Nation. From apples to potatoes to Microsoft and Boeing, we rely \nheavily on international trade. This trade agreement, when taken as a \nwhole, will do more to bolster the economy of my State and the Nation, \nand thus merits support.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in my view, the United States has pursued \nfailed trade policies for the past 20 years or more. This failed trade \npolicy is reflected in our record trade deficits with the world. This \nfailed trade policy has led us to accept a one-way street in trade \nwhere we allow too many countries access to our markets without \ninsisting that they give us reciprocal access to theirs.\n  I have opposed trade agreements when they were in the same failed \nmold as our past trade policy, when they clearly were not requiring a \nmore level playing field for U.S. manufacturers, farmers, and service \nsector employees, and when they failed to insist on basic \ninternationally recognized labor and environmental standards. However, \nI have supported trade agreements that leveled the playing field and \nthat did include strong and enforceable internationally recognized \nlabor and environmental standards.\n  I particularly commend the work of my brother, Representative Sander \nLevin, chairman of the House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee, and \nothers, for substantially improving the Peru Free Trade Agreement by \nreopening this agreement to incorporate enforceable worker rights and \nenvironmental standards in the body of the agreement. This is something \nDemocrats have been working to include in trade agreements for over a \ndecade. I agree with my brother who has characterized this \ngroundbreaking achievement as, ``an historic breakthrough on trade by \namending pending U.S. free trade agreements to incorporate a fully \nenforceable commitment that countries adopt and enforce the five basic \ninternational labor standards, subject to the same dispute settlement \nmechanism and remedies as other FTA obligations.''\n  This breakthrough is surely of critical importance. For the first \ntime in any FTA, the labor chapter requires both the United States and \nPeru to adopt and maintain domestic laws to implement the five core \nstandards incorporated in the 1998 ILO Declaration on Fundamental \nPrinciples and Rights at Work. These include, one the right to \norganize; two, the right to bargain collectively; three, prohibitions \non forced labor; four, protections for child labor; and five, freedom \nfrom employment discrimination.\n  The agreement also requires for the first time that the United States \nand Peru adopt and maintain domestic laws to implement the obligations \nin the seven multilateral environmental agreements that both the United \nStates and Peru are party to. All of these added obligations are \nsubject to the same dispute settlement mechanism that applies to all \nother FTA obligations.\n  Peru is a small economy and makes up less than 1 percent of overall \nU.S. trade, and in 2006 was only our 43rd largest export market. \nFurthermore, 98 percent of U.S. imports from Peru already enter the \nUnited States duty free under the Andean Trade Preferences Act and the \nGeneral System of Preferences. The Peru FTA will at least give American \nexports a more level playing field in Peru by allowing them to enter \nPeru duty free, which is currently not the case, although Peruvian \nproducts already enter the U.S. duty free.\n  As a rule, I do not like the idea of trade agreements coming up under \nfast-track procedures because it limits Members of Congress to an up-\nor-down vote with no chance to amend or improve it. Thankfully, we did \nnot extend fast- track authority. In this case, my brother, Sandy \nLevin, and others successfully amended this agreement through an \nhistoric bipartisan agreement which vastly improved the agreement. The \nchanges that were made represent an important break with the failed and \nflawed trade policies of the past and signify a better approach to \ntrade that supports American workers and protects the environment. For \nall of these reasons I will vote for the Peru Free Trade Agreement \nimplementing legislation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Senate will soon be voting on the \nfirst measure to implement a trade deal since the announcement last \nspring by the administration and some Members of Congress of an \nagreement to facilitate the consideration of trade legislation.\n  The centerpiece of that agreement was to be the inclusion in future \ntrade agreements of meaningful labor standards. In fact, because last \nspring's announced agreement was only a set of principles, and not \nactual language, the Peru Trade Promotion Agreement bill before the \nSenate is the first opportunity to review the details of that \nagreement.\n  I will touch on the new labor provisions included in the Peru \nagreement shortly, but the agreement is far more than just provisions \noverseeing labor standards. And in those areas, the trade agreement \nwith Peru comes up short. In fact, the agreement looks just like the \nprovisions in other trade agreements that have been stamped out over \nthe past decade and more by the NAFTA template--a failed model of trade \nthat has helped ship millions of family-supporting American jobs \noverseas, while too often failing to produce the promised enhanced \nstandard of living for the families of our trading partners.\n  Like those previous trade agreements based on the NAFTA model, the \nPeru agreement contains language identical to the devastating foreign \ninvestor rights provisions of NAFTA that undermine federal, state, and \nlocal protections for the environment, health, and public safety.\n  Like those previous trade agreements based on the NAFTA model, the \nPeru agreement renders meaningless our longstanding common sense \ngovernment procurement policies, including the Buy America law which \nrequires that taxpayer dollars be used by the federal government to \npurchase American made goods and services when they are a reasonable \noption.\n  Like those previous trade agreements based on the NAFTA model, the \nPeru agreement undercuts pro-environmental policies such as recycled \ncontent requirements, and undermines our ability to require imported \nfood to meet our safety standards. As the consumer advocacy group \nPublic Citizen has noted, the Peru trade agreement includes NAFTA \nprovisions that require the United States ``to treat imported food the \nsame as U.S.-produced food, even though more intensive inspection is \nneeded to compensate for Peru's weak domestic regulatory system.''\n  And like those previous trade agreements based on the NAFTA model, \nthe Peru agreement includes NAFTA provisions that undermine the right \nto affordable medicines for poorer countries established in the World \nTrade Organization's Doha Declaration.\n  With all of this NAFTA baggage included in the Peru agreement, one \nmight ask if there is any reason to believe this agreement won't just \nreproduce the same disastrous results we have seen from failed trade \npolicies over the past two decades.\n  And that brings us to the new language included in the Peru agreement \nstemming from the deal announced last spring between a number of \nMembers of Congress and the administration.\n  Regrettably, and perhaps predictably, that new language does not live\n\n[[Page S14722]]\n\nup to the billing it received at the time of the announcement. In fact, \naccording to an analysis done by Professor Mark Barenberg of Columbia \nUniversity, the new labor provisions are actually weaker than current \nlaw. Professor Barenberg compared the proposed new labor provisions \nwith those of trade deals already in effect, and found that the Peru \nagreement undermines existing trade laws, which Barenberg states are \nalready ``weak, unreliable, and inadequate to the task.''\n  For example, the Barenberg report notes that under current law, ``if \nPeru fails to comply with internationally recognized labor rights, then \nthe United States can impose unlimited sanctions against Peru, can \nprovide benefits to Peru in any area of foreign relations, or can \nwithdraw special trade benefits in whole or in part, to ensure that \nPeru comes into compliance. The U.S. can target specific sectors, \nproducts, or actors. The U.S. can impose sanctions or withhold benefits \nuntil those specified actors comply.''\n  But under the U.S.-Peru agreement, ``if Peru fails to comply with the \nvague labor ``principles'' or with Peru's domestic labor law, Peru can \nchoose to pay the United States only half the monetary value of the \ntrade benefits that accrue to Peru as a result of the violations--\ncreating a cost-benefit incentive for Peru to commit violations. If \nPeru chooses this monetary penalty, then the sanction is not targeted \non any sector or any actor. The Agreement establishes no system of \npositive benefits (carrots) to Peru for compliance.''\n  The Barenberg report gives another example. Under existing law, ``if \nPeru fails to comply with internationally recognized labor rights, then \nprivate parties in the United States, such as workers and labor unions, \nhave the right to petition the President to impose sanctions or take \nother measures against Peru to ensure compliance.''\n  But, while private parties, including trade unions are allowed under \nsection 301 of the Trade Act to file petitions with the President, \nalleging that a trading partner has violated a trade agreement, under \nthe U.S.-Peru Agreement, private parties are given ``no right to \ndirectly initiate complaints against Peru for violating its obligation \nto enforce the vague labor ``principles'' or domestic labor law. Only \nthe President may bring such complaints--and, in fact, the President \nhas never filed a complaint under the labor-rights provisions of any \nbilateral trade agreement.''\n  Here is still another example. Under existing law, ``if the President \ndecides that Peru is failing to comply with internationally recognized \nlabor rights, he can impose sanctions. He need not gain the approval of \nanother decision-maker.''\n  By contrast, under the U.S.-Peru agreement, ``if the President \ndecides that Peru is failing to comply with vague labor ``principles'' \nor domestic labor law, he cannot impose sanctions. He can only file a \ncomplaint that may lead to international arbitration to determine \nwhether Peru stands in violation. Hence, the decision to impose \nsanctions must be taken by two decision-makers, rather than one--the \nPresident and a panel of international arbitrators. And international \narbitrators will apply international law, which holds that an \nobligation to adhere to the vague labor principles does not entail an \nobligation to adhere to actual labor rights, let alone adhere to any \nconcrete performance measures or indicators.''\n  As others have noted, Professor Barenberg's report may explain why no \nmajor labor, environmental, human rights, or consumer protection groups \nhave endorsed the Peru agreement.\n  Our trade policies of the past two decades have been disastrous. They \nhave contributed to the loss of several million family-supporting jobs \nin this country. They have left communities across my State devastated, \nand I know the same is true in communities around this country.\n  Our trade deficit is still out of control, as we send more and more \nof our wealth overseas, much of it in the form of factories that \nprovided entire communities with decent, good-paying jobs. I hold \nlistening sessions in each of Wisconsin's 72 counties every year. This \nis my 15th year holding those listening sessions, listening to tens of \nthousands of people from all over Wisconsin. I completed my 1000th of \nthose sessions just about a year ago, and I can tell you that there is \nnearly universal frustration and anger with the trade policies we have \npursued since the late 1980s. Even among those who would have called \nthemselves traditional free-traders, it is increasingly obvious that \nthe so-called NAFTA model of trade has been a tragic failure.\n  I voted against NAFTA, GATT, and permanent most favored nation status \nfor China, in great part because I felt they were bad deals for \nWisconsin businesses and Wisconsin workers. At the time I voted against \nthose agreements, I thought they would result in lost jobs for my \nState. But, as I have noted before, even as an opponent of those trade \nagreements, I had no idea just how bad things would get.\n  Nor does the problem end with the loss of businesses and jobs. The \nmodel on which our recent trade agreements have been based \nfundamentally undermines our democratic institutions. It replaces the \njudgment of the people, as reflected in the laws and standards set \nforth by their elected representatives, with rules written by \norganizations dominated by multinational corporations. Food, \nenvironmental, and safety standards set by our democratic institutions \nare subject to challenge if they conflict with those approved by \nunelected international trade bureaucracies. Even laws that require the \ngovernment to use our tax dollars to buy goods made here, rather than \noverseas, can be challenged.\n  We cannot live in isolation. We are in a global economy, and it makes \ngood sense to have reasonable trade agreements with those who want to \ntrade with us--trade agreements that have broad-based support and that \nwill provide broad-based economic benefits to all sectors of our \neconomy and the economies of our trading partners. That is not what we \nhave now, and we shouldn't pass another bill to implement one of these \nflawed agreements until we can straighten out the twisted trade model \nthat has done so much damage to the personal economies of thousands of \nfamilies across the country.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the U.S.-Peru Free \nTrade Agreement, FTA. As my colleagues are aware, I am a strong \nproponent of free trade, having voted for every trade agreement that \nhas been negotiated during my 31 years in this body.\n  Despite that fact, I have concerns over some recent changes to the \nPeruvian agreement and, more specifically, the deal that was struck \nbetween the administration and the congressional Democrats on May 10. \nSpecifically, the changes to the intellectual property rights, IPR, and \nlabor chapters of this agreement will, I believe, become more relevant \nwhen we as a nation begin to negotiate future free-trade agreements \nwith deserving nations.\n  It is my sincere hope that I am wrong and that we will not in the \nnear future face serious challenges to our national labor laws as a \nresult of this agreement. Unfortunately, we will not have to wait, \nhowever, to realize the devastating effects that the new trade deal \nwill have on our IPR concerns.\n  The labor chapter of the U.S.-Peru Free Trade Agreement could put \nU.S. Federal and State labor laws at significant risk. Several \nprovisions of the labor chapter of the U.S.-Peru trade agreement create \nan unacceptable risk that the United States will be required to change \nimportant provisions of U.S. Federal and state labor law or be subject \nto trade sanctions. Given that the purpose of the May 10 agreement was \nto ensure that Peru adopted strong labor provisions, not the United \nStates, Congress's implementation of this agreement should provide an \nexplicit safe harbor for U.S. labor law.\n  Peru FTA requirement to adopt ``fundamental labor rights'' puts \nright-to-work, freedom of association and other major U.S. labor \nprovisions at significant risk. Article 17.2 of the Peru FTA requires \nboth Peru and the United States to ``adopt and maintain in its statutes \nand regulations, and practices there under, the following rights as \nstated in the International Labor Organization ILO Declaration on \nFundamental Principles and Rights at Work and its Follow-up (1998) (ILO \nDeclaration) where it affects trade between the\n\n[[Page S14723]]\n\ncountries. These rights are freedom of association, recognition of \ncollective bargaining, elimination of forced/compulsory labor, \neffective abolition of child labor, prohibition of worst forms of child \nlabor, and elimination of employment discrimination.\n  The Peru FTA does not provide any definition of these fundamental \nrights, leaving the interpretation of what constitutes ``freedom of \nassociation'' or ``collective bargaining'' to a dispute settlement \npanel appointed by the U.S. and Peruvian Governments.\n  Given the agreement's reference to the ILO declaration, it is widely \nexpected that such a dispute settlement panel would in fact look at and \nrely at least partially on the standards of the relevant ILO core \nconventions associated with these rights, much as the ILO does each \nyear in its followup reports required by the ILO declaration. The \nrecent push by House Democrats to have Peru enact very detailed changes \nto its treatment of--contract laborers as part of its implementation of \nthe agreement an issue not specifically addressed in the Peru FTA--\nconfirms the wide range of issues subject to this chapter.\n  The United States, which has only ratified two of the eight ILO core \nconventions, faces substantial risk that a panel will find that U.S. \nlabor law violates the Peru FTA, requiring the U.S. to change its law \nor face trade sanctions. Key U.S. laws subject to that risk include:\n  State right-to-work rules, which standard labor market analysis and \nseveral other countries, such as Canada, find imposes an improper \nrestraint on the ability of workers to bargain collectively or to \nstrike, as nonunion workers have the authority to vote on whether to \nstrike;\n  U.S. prohibitions on the admission to unions of persons connected \nwith the Communist Party or the Klu Klux Klan given that ILO standards \nrequire the admission of all applicants;\n  U.S. prohibitions in the National Labor Relations Act, NLRA, on the \ninclusion of supervisors in union, which is required by ILO \nconventions;\n  Exclusive bargaining rights provided under the NLRA, which are in \nconflict with ILO standards requiring minority unions be allowed to \nfunction;\n  Various Federal and State laws that place reasonable and balanced \nlimits on the right to strike, which are in conflict with the ILO \nconventions' prohibition on virtually all restrictions on the right to \nstrike;\n  U.S. laws permitting the permanent replacement of striking workers, \nwhich the ILO has indicated may pose a risk to the effective \nenforcement of the right of collective bargaining when it occurs on an \nextensive basis;\n  Fair Labor Standards Act minimum age of 14 and state laws where there \nare no minimum ages for children working in agriculture contravenes the \nILO minimum age convention; and\n  Lack of equal remuneration or comparable worth rules.\n  The Peru FTA is likely to require State labor law changes as well. By \nrequiring the adoption of these rights at the Federal level, the Peru \nFTA in combination with the U.S. Constitution's Supremacy Clause, \nArticle VI, section 2, is also expected to require any changes made at \nthe Federal level to preempt conflicting State law. As a result, State \nright-to-work rules or lower minimum age standards would face \nsignificant risk of being overturned by dispute settlement panels.\n  The Peru FTA requires parties to promote migrant worker rights. Annex \n17.6 requires the United States and Peru to engage in a wide range of \ncapacity building work. While much of it could be useful, its \nobligation to promote migrant rights, without regard to the legal \nstatus of a migrant, creates a troubling requirement that the United \nStates would be promoting rights for illegal immigrants at odds with \nCongress's direction. For years, I have been a steadfast supporter of \nfair intellectual property laws that are appropriately enforced. The \nConstitution itself provides for the creation of intellectual property, \nand it has been the process used by brilliant U.S. innovators to \ndevelop, market, and sale groundbreaking new products for years. In the \nsea of red trade deficits we have faced for so many years now, IP and \nthe innovative U.S. products that use its protection have been one of \nthe few areas where the U.S. has a trade surplus.\n  Traditionally, trade agreements have strengthened American innovation \nabroad. However, with the newly renegotiated text found within the \nU.S.-Peru FTA's IPR chapter, we see that we have walked back from the \nrigorous IPR protections found in previous agreements in favor of \nweakened provisions. These changes mainly affect one of America's most \nproductive industries, that of pharmaceuticals.\n  The U.S.-Peru FTA weakens IP protection in three ways:\n  First, the agreement does away with patent linkage. Linkage requires \na country, before it approves a generic medicine for sale, to ensure \nthat the brand-name medicine is no longer under patent. Without \nlinkage, governments can help facilitate patent infringement. Linkage \ndoesn't hinder access to medicines, and it is not about compulsory \nlicensing. It is about protection of basic patent rights. The proposed \nchanges replace this simple enforcement procedure with a complex one. I \ndon't see what that accomplishes.\n  Second, the changes shorten the period of data exclusivity for \ninnovative medicines, authorizing a shorter period than we require here \nin the United States. This change is not only unfair to U.S. innovators \nbut devalues the incentive for launching new drugs in developing \ncountries. Here is why. In developing countries, it is often difficult \nto enforce patent rights. But data protection is effective and \nrelatively easy to administer. It often provides the only real \nprotection biopharmaceutical companies have when they invest \nsignificant resources to launch new products. You take away the \nprotection and you take away the incentive to launch. It is hard enough \nto get companies to launch medicines quickly in these countries because \nthe markets are so small. If you shrink data protection, you \neffectively shrink the market even further.\n  Finally, the new template no longer requires countries to add time to \npatent terms for pharmaceuticals to make up for undue delays in \nmarketing approval or patent grant. We require patent restoration here \nin the United States, so why not abroad? Because, critics argue, patent \nterms are long enough as they are. But without patent term restoration, \nwe actually go the other direction. Without patent term restoration, \nthe effective patent term could actually shrink significantly.\n  From what I understand, the Democrats insisted on the changes to the \nIPR chapter in order to grant greater access to medicines for \ndeveloping nations. What is ironic to me is that these changes will do \njust the opposite.\n  All of these changes were ostensibly part of an effort to promote \naccess to medicines to poor people. A noble goal. But what is so absurd \nabout this is that the changes may actually have the opposite effect \nand harm U.S. competitiveness in the process.\n  Why would we backtrack on IPR? Some may say that we are rich enough \nso that we can afford to give away the fruits of our ingenuity. But \nthat is like saying we are rich enough to voluntarily close down our \nfactories so that our competitors can have a chance. We don't have that \nluxury.\n  Some say backtracking on IPR is necessary to help the poor and sick. \nThat, too, is wrong. IPR is all about incentives. If you protect IPR, \nthen people will have a stronger incentive to develop new and \ninnovative products and bring them to market faster. If you don't \nprotect IPR, then those incentives are greatly diminished. Here is what \nwe might expect with weak IPR protection:\n  There would be less incentive to launch products early in developing \ncountries. Innovative companies would have less reason to show up when \ntheir technology could immediately be copied and sold by others who \nmade no contribution to the R\n  If there were fewer brand-name launches, there would be fewer \ngenerics. As brand-name medicines go off patent, generic medicine \ncompanies can rely on the safety approvals and market secured by the \nresearch-based companies, making more generics available to more \npeople. Without the brand-name company securing the safety approvals \nand creating the market, fewer generics can enter the marketplace, and \nfewer people will get the medicines they need.\n\n[[Page S14724]]\n\n  As a result, the poor would not have access to the newest and most \neffective medicines.\n  It is easy and convenient to use IPR as a scapegoat for poor health \ncare systems. The reality is that access to medicines is helped, not \nhindered, by strong IPR protections. Problems in access to medicines \nare most often due to other factors, such as poor infrastructure, \ntaxes, tariffs, an ineffective health care system, and different \ngovernment funding priorities. By pointing at IPR, we divert attention \nfrom these much more critical problems. In sum, the changes we have \nfoisted upon Peru are harmful not only to U.S. interests, but also to \nthe very interests they purport to serve.\n  I applaud the USTR and her staff on their hard work in negotiating \nthis agreement, especially in the area of intellectual property rights. \nHowever, I know there are several Senators in this body who represent \nStates that contain numerous innovative companies that benefit from \nstrong intellectual property laws and enforcement. While the overall \nagreement strengthens American IPR, it does so in a way that is not as \nvigorous as agreements in the past.\n  Millions of jobs across the country depend on these laws.\n  I know firsthand that many countries around the world would like \nnothing more than to see the U.S. intellectual property laws and \nenforcement diminished. Why? Because they want to exploit us.\n  They want to be able to steal our inventions.\n  They want to be able to ripoff our best and brightest ideas. They \nwant our taxpayers to fund billions of dollars of extremely important \nresearch and then take it from us for free.\n  I have been assured by the administration that the issues that I have \nraised today will never become a problem for the United States. While I \nam confident that my concerns remain valid, I am unwilling to stand in \nthe way of the President's trade agenda. The Peruvian trade agreement \nwill provide needed trade benefits to many Utah businesses that \nexported $7.7 million worth of goods in 2006, not to mention the \noverall benefit of the agreement to the U.S. economy as a whole.\n  Therefore, I will reluctantly vote for the U.S.-Peru FTA before us \ntoday. However, I will not give up on improving future trade agreements \nin the critical areas of labor and intellectual property rights.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have never opposed a free trade agreement, \nFTA, although I have sometimes had reservations or concerns about \ndifferent elements of the agreements.\n  I believe free trade encourages economic growth, improves living \nstandards by making a wider variety of goods and services available at \nmore affordable prices, and creates good-paying jobs. In fact, exports \nfrom the U.S. account for more than 10 percent of our annual gross \ndomestic product and one in six manufacturing jobs are related to \nexported products.\n  I also understand that the benefits of trade accrue not only to \nAmericans, but also to workers in other countries; but this is also to \nour benefit. The more free trade encourages economic growth and job \ncreation around the world, the more demand there will be for high-value \nAmerican products and services. Trade fosters closer economic relations \nwith other countries and those economic ties generally lead to improved \npolitical relations, which benefits our national security.\n  For these reasons, I have been a strong, consistent, and vocal \nsupporter of free trade. And for these reasons, I take my vote against \nthe Peru FTA today extremely seriously. I have decided to oppose the \nPeru FTA not because I have any quarrel with Peru or because I am in \nany way opposed to expanding our bilateral trade relations with Peru. \nIn fact, I strongly support the original Peru FTA.\n  My opposition to the Peru FTA is rooted entirely in the agreement \nreached by the U.S. Trade Representative, USTR, with Members of the \nother body in May of this year. That agreement forced the U.S. to \nrenegotiate the Peru, Panama, and Colombia FTAs to add new requirements \nfor labor and environmental protections and weakened traditional trade \nagreement protections for certain U.S. intellectual property, IP, \nrelated to pharmaceutical products.\n  I am concerned about the labor and environment provisions, but I am \nsimply puzzled by the intellectual property changes. I am not sure what \nmy colleagues hoped to gain by weakening standard protections for U.S. \nintellectual property through this trade agreement. I see no reason why \nU.S. legislators would want to weaken the ordinary protections that are \nnormally accorded to pharmaceutical intellectual property in our \nbilateral trade agreements. Peru did not, in the course of \nnegotiations, ask us to weaken the IP requirements. Peru was perfectly \nwilling to abide by the greater protections of the original FTA.\n  If the goal of these changes was to provide better access to \nlifesaving medicines in Peru, I worry that their effect could have the \nexact opposite result. Countries with weaker IP protections will have a \ndifficult time encouraging U.S. companies to do business there. Respect \nfor private property--including intellectual property--is essential to \nencouraging innovation. Without assurances that new and creative \nproducts and services will not be stolen by unscrupulous competitors or \nforcibly devalued by governments, there is a reduced incentive to take \nthe economic risks that are necessary to achieve groundbreaking \ninventions.\n  And why should we expect that those who want to weaken protections \nfor U.S.-owned intellectual property will stop at pharmaceuticals? Are \ncomputers, movies, music, and other products that involve valuable U.S. \nintellectual property next? U.S. intellectual property is one of our \nmost valuable exports; it is not in the national interest of the United \nStates to unilaterally weaken protections for it.\n  I would like to share some statistics that underscore my concern for \nprotecting U.S. intellectual property. First, IP-related industries \nprovide some of the highest quality jobs in the U.S. According to some \nstudies, IP-related jobs pay as much as 40 to 50 percent more than jobs \nthat are not dependent upon intellectual property. That means that \ndevaluing U.S. intellectual property will hurt U.S. workers. Further, \neconomists estimate that over 50 percent of U.S. exports depend upon \nintellectual property protection of some sort, up from below 10 percent \n50 years ago. My colleagues know that theft of U.S. intellectual \nproperty is rampant overseas, costing U.S. companies many billions of \ndollars annually and costing the U.S. economy high-paying jobs. We \nshould use FTAs to enhance protection for U.S. intellectual property, \nnot weaken it.\n  Finally, I want to explain to my colleagues that I made my concerns \nknown to the USTR on several occasions. When I first began hearing that \nthe USTR might renegotiate the various Latin American FTAs to secure \nsupport in the other body, I made sure the USTR knew of my strong \nconcerns about weakening IP protections. As the discussions progressed, \nsix members of the Finance Committee wrote a letter to the USTR in May \nof this year outlining our very serious concerns with all of the areas \nunder renegotiation: labor, environment, and intellectual property. \nFinally, when the USTR, Ambassador Schwab, came to meet with members of \nthe Finance Committee this fall I again expressed my concerns about \nweakening the standard protections that had been traditionally accorded \nto IP in our other FTAs. Because the administration apparently made no \nattempt to address our concerns or to assure us that other actions \ncould be taken to enhance protections for valuable U.S. intellectual \nproperty, I am compelled to oppose the Peru FTA.\n  I urge my colleagues to give additional thought to whether it is wise \nto unilaterally weaken the intellectual property protections we \nnormally include in FTAs. These provisions better not be included in \nfuture FTAs or I will work for their defeat.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to support the legislation \nto implement the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement. The \nagreement promises to significantly strengthen our commercial and \nnoncommercial ties with Peru and represents a new era for U.S. free \ntrade agreements.\n  This agreement will significantly increase our goods trade balance \nwith Peru. As a result of U.S. unilateral preference programs, about 98 \npercent\n\n[[Page S14725]]\n\nof imports from Peru presently benefit from duty-free treatment. The \nagreement will move beyond one-way preferences to reciprocal \ncommitments. Immediately, 80 percent of the consumer and industrial \nproducts our firms export to Peru will be duty free; remaining Peruvian \ntariffs will phase out over 10 years. The International Trade \nCommission estimates that, upon the agreement's full implementation, \nU.S. exports to Peru will increase by $1.1 billion, while U.S. imports \nfrom Peru will increase by $439 million. Exporters across our country \ndepend on world markets. In my home State of Connecticut, this \nagreement will open an important new market for our manufactures of \ntransportation equipment, machinery, and electronics, among other \nproducts.\n  The gains are likely to be even more significant for America's \nservice industries. Take, for instance, the insurance industry, which \nhas played a vital role in Connecticut's economy. The agreement will \nenable U.S. insurance companies to establish a presence in Peru while \nensuring strong regulatory transparency, including license approval \nwithin 120 days. Similarly, Connecticut's vibrant financial services \nindustry stands to benefit from the agreement's robust financial \nservices chapter. Among other benefits, the chapter's provisions will \nenable U.S. asset managers to provide cross-border portfolio management \nservices, even without establishing a physical presence in Peru.\n  But the agreement's implications transcend commercial boundaries. It \nwill strengthen our alliance with Peru, a key ally in Latin America, \ncontribute significantly to Peru's economic development, and extend our \ncommitment to transparency and rule of law in Latin America.\n  The most recent free trade agreement this Chamber considered was with \nOman in 2006. Consistent with my longstanding record of supporting \ntrade as good for America's economy, and economic development in Arab \nand Muslim countries as important for peace in the world, I voted in \nfavor of legislation to implement the Oman FTA. But during \nconsideration, I voiced my concerns about the Oman FTA's labor \nprovisions, announcing in this Chamber that: ``I will not continue to \nsupport future free trade agreements unless the Administration becomes \nserious about negotiating labor and other improvements. . . .'' By \nincluding basic worker rights recognized by the International Labor \nOrganization, with full enforceability equal to all other provisions, I \nam satisfied that the Peru FTA addresses my concerns.\n  The inclusion of strong labor provisions, as well as unprecedented \ninclusion of multilateral environmental agreements, means this \nagreement's significance will extend beyond Peru. Indeed, this FTA \nrepresents a strong standard for our future bilateral free trade \nagreements. I applaud House Ways and Means Chairman Rangel and House \nTrade Subcommittee Chairman Levin for achieving consensus with the \nadministration to address these key issues.\n  I have high hopes for expanding our trading relationship with Peru \nand for continuing to responsibly open markets across national borders. \nAnd I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues to enact \nlegislation implementing FTAs that the administration has already \nsigned with Colombia and Korea.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I strongly support H.R. 3688, the United \nStates-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act, PTPA.\n  The agreement before this Chamber today stands as another important \nmilestone in the development of our relationship with Peru. The pending \ntrade bill will help level the commercial playing field and solidify a \ngenuine bilateral partnership based on free and fair trade that \nbenefits not only Peruvians, but also U.S. workers and businesses. \nRatification will also demonstrate to the people of Peru that we stand \nby them as an important democratic ally in a strategically vital region \nof the world.\n  As it currently stands, 98 percent of goods imported from Peru \nalready enter the United States duty-free. If this agreement is passed \nand fully implemented, 80 percent of U.S. exports of consumer and \nindustrial goods and over two-thirds of agricultural exports will gain \nduty-free access to the Peruvian market of some 29 million citizens. \nThe agreement also contains provisions that address intellectual \nproperty rights, electronic commerce, customs and trade facilitation, \nand these provisions will reduce barriers on investment. The U.S. \ncurrently exports nearly $2 billion in goods to Peru, a figure certain \nto grow as a result of increased access to this vibrant South American \nmarket.\n  While the economic benefits we will enjoy as a result of passing the \nPTPA are important, we must not ignore the political benefits as well. \nPeru stands as a shining example of the potential for democracy and \nopen markets in South America. Following free and fair elections in \n2006, Peru's economy continues to grow at an impressive rate of 8 \npercent annually, and its poverty rate has been on the decline since \n2001. It is also important to recognize the assistance the Peruvian \ngovernment has provided the United States in combating drug \ntrafficking, countering regional security threats, and providing for \nour energy needs. Implementation of this agreement will lead to greater \nprosperity and development for the Peruvian people, helping to \nstrengthen their nation and our relationship with them.\n  I have long advocated for economic freedom and open markets. Free \ntrade has long served to promote economic growth, generate jobs, raise \nwages and lower prices for American workers and consumers. I believe in \nthe ingenuity and resilience of the American worker and am not afraid \nof their ability to compete successfully in the global marketplace. \nAmerica is home to the best and the brightest, and should have the \nopportunity to play a significant role in an increasingly globalized \nmarketplace. By passing this agreement, we will reaffirm our commitment \nto nations that share our interest in open markets, economic freedom, \nand democracy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support swift passage of this important \nagreement.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I would like to briefly address H.R. \n3688, the Peru Trade Promotion Act. While this agreement stands to \nprovide significant benefits to our country's agricultural industry, it \ncomes with unfortunate consequences for our country's asparagus \ngrowers. My home State of Washington is one of the top asparagus \nproducing States in the country. However, since the passage of the \nAndean Trade Preferences Act, Washington has lost 21,000 of its 30,000 \nacres dedicated to asparagus and all three of Washington's asparagus \ncanning facilities have now moved to Peru. This is the reason that I \nworked so hard to include a $15 million Market Loss Program dedicated \nto asparagus growers in the Senate's version of the 2007 farm bill. \nThis program will support domestic asparagus producers, helping them \nplant and harvest more efficiently and remain competitive in the \ninternational market. In the past 17 years, the $200 million Washington \nasparagus industry has been reduced to a $75 million industry. To say \nthat I am concerned about this trade agreement's effect on Washington's \nasparagus farmers would be an understatement. I implore the Senate, as \nit continues negotiations on the farm bill to support these hard \nworking individuals remain competitive in our international economy.\n  With that said, the Peru Trade Promotion Act stands to significantly \nbenefit the majority of farmers both in Washington and throughout our \nNation. Under this agreement, Washington businesses will increase their \nexports to Peru by an estimated 45-62 percent and will immediately \neliminate significant tariffs on many key goods. For example, \nWashington leads the Nation in potato exports and the current tariffs, \nnow reaching up to 25 percent, will be eliminated immediately on most \npotato products. Washington's wheat farmers, whose exports are \ncurrently valued at over $314 million, will benefit greatly by the \nelimination of the 17-percent tariff on wheat. Washington's third \nlargest industry, beef, has much to gain from the elimination of the \n25-percent duty on beef. Dairy, our second largest farm industry will \nbenefit from the elimination of a tariff system that has reached as \nhigh as 68 percent for dairy products being exported to Peru. Perhaps \nthe most significant impact for Washington, however, will be for our\n\n[[Page S14726]]\n\nfruit growers. Washington ranks as the second largest fruit exporter in \nthe Nation, bringing in $833 million for the State. Duties on fruit \nexported to Peru are currently 25 percent and would be immediately \neliminated under the PTPA--a huge win for Washington and its fruit \ngrowers. Peru is a new growth market for Washington's fruit industry \nand the elimination of these tariffs will make our fruit much more \ncompetitive in the export market.\n  Given the significant benefits the vast majority of farmers in my \nState stand to reap from the Peru Trade Promotion Act, I will vote in \nfavor of it, despite my grave concern for its effect on our asparagus \nindustry. As PTPA is implemented, I will continue to fight to support \nasparagus growers through the Market Loss Program included in the \nSenate farm bill or any other means available to me and I strongly urge \nthis body to do the same. The PTPA will benefit many, but it is up to \nus to assist those whose livelihoods are affected in the process of its \nimplementation.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support and will \nvote for the Peru Free Trade Agreement.\n  On November 18, 2003, the administration formally notified Congress \nof its intent to initiate negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement, FTA, \nwith Peru. The United States and Peru announced a bilateral deal on an \nFTA on December 7, 2005, after resolving certain agriculture and \nintellectual property rights issues, as was signed April 12, 2006. The \nPeruvian Congress approved FTA legislation on June 28, 2006 by a vote \nof 79-14. Legislation to implement the Peru FTA was submitted by \nPresident Bush on September 27, 2007 and this legislation was approved \nby the Senate Finance Committee by voice vote on October 4. On October \n31, the House Ways and Means Committee approved implementing \nlegislation (H.R. 3688) by a vote of 39-0. The full House voted to \napprove the Peru FTA by a vote of 285-132 on November 9, 2007.\n  U.S. trade with Peru has doubled over the past 3 years, reaching $8.8 \nbillion in 2006. More than 5,000 U.S. companies export their products \nto Peru, and over 80 percent of these are small and medium-sized \ncompanies that stand to benefit significantly from U.S.-Peru Trade \nPromotion Agreement, PTPA. According to the American Farm Bureau \nFederation, after full implementation of the agreement, U.S. \nagricultural exports to Peru will increase by more than $700 million \nper year.\n  According to the Department of Commerce-International Trade \nAdministration, when the agreement enters into force, U.S. farmers and \nranchers will also become much more competitive by benefiting from \nimmediate duty-free treatment of 90 percent of current U.S. \nagricultural exports. Key U.S. agriculture exports such as cotton, \nwheat soybeans, high-quality beef, apples, pears, peaches, cherries, \nand almonds will be duty free upon entry into force of the Agreement. \nPeru will phase out all other agricultural tariffs within 17 years.\n  According to the United States Department of Agriculture, USDA, \nexports of farm products boost Colorado's farm prices and income. Such \nexports support about 10,100 Colorado jobs, both on and off the farm in \nfood processing, storage, and transportation. Agricultural exports \namounted to $852 million and made an important contribution to \nColorado's farm cash receipts in 2006 that totaled nearly $5.6 billion. \nThe State of Colorado depends on world markets and exported shipments \nof merchandise to 197 foreign destinations in 2006 totaling $8.0 \nbillion. This is an increase of 44 percent over the 2002 level of $5.5 \nbillion.\n  The USDA further states that as a leading source of farm cash \nreceipts at nearly $3.3 billion, Colorado's ranchers and beef industry \nbenefit from exports in a number of ways. For instance, Peru will \nimmediately eliminate the 25 percent duties on the beef products of \nmost importance to the U.S. beef industry--Prime and choice cuts. Peru \nwill provide immediate duty-free access for U.S. exports of standard \nquality beef through the establishment of an 800 ton tariff-rate quota.\n  The dairy industry in Colorado is the second largest source of state \nfarm cash receipts. Our dairy producers will benefit immensely from the \nPTPA. Peru will immediately eliminate its system of variable levies \nfacing U.S. exporters. Also, Peru will immediately eliminate tariffs on \nwhey. And, all Peruvian duties on dairy products will be eliminated \nwithin 17 years, with duties on some dairy products eliminated earlier.\n  The corn producers are Colorado's fourth largest source of farm cash \nreceipts. Colorado corn producers will benefit under the PTPA by \neliminating its system of variable levies facing U.S. exporters. Under \nthe current system, tariffs can be as high as the WTO ceiling of 68 \npercent on some corn products. Moreover, all currently applied duties \non crude corn oil will be phased out over 5 years; and on white corn \nand other corn products within 10 years.\n  The pork producers are Colorado's seventh largest source of farm cash \nreceipts. Peru will phase out all duties, which are currently as high \nas 25 percent, on fresh, chilled, and frozen pork within 5 years.\n  There are other markets that Colorado will benefit from as this \nagreement becomes a reality. The elimination of Peruvian tariffs on \nproducts such as computer and electronic products, machine \nmanufacturers and chemical manufacturers will provide a competitive \nboost to Colorado companies.\n  This historic agreement will provide a level playing field for \nAmerican workers and farmers, ensuring that the United States gets the \nfull benefit of trade with this dynamic market. In the early 1990s, the \nUnited States unilaterally opened its market to Peru, and nearly \neverything imported from Peru enters the U.S. market duty free. \nHowever, when Americans sell their goods to Peru, they face average \ntariffs of 11 percent for manufactured goods and 16 percent for \nagricultural goods. PTPA is meant to correct this unfair trade \nimbalance by eliminating nearly all tariffs on U.S. exports to Peru \nwithin a few years. The U.S. International Trade Commission estimates \nthis agreement will add $1.1 billion to U.S. exports and $2.1 billion \nto U.S. GDP. U.S. farmers and ranchers must continue to find a way to \nstay competitive in today's world market.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me today in supporting passage of the \nUnited States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senate will finish consideration of the \nU.S.-Peru Free Trade Agreement today, with a vote this afternoon. \nBefore getting into the merits of the FTA, I wanted to take a moment to \ndiscuss a broader issue. It is very unfortunate that the Bush \nadministration's only policy towards Latin America has been to \nnegotiate free trade agreements.\n  I just returned from leading a bipartisan delegation to Latin America \nand last year I headed a similar delegation to different Latin American \ncountries, including Peru. What we heard repeatedly there in almost \nevery country we visited was that the Bush administration had neglected \nthe region.\n  And, in fact, they are right. We have cut development assistance, \neliminated programs, and repeatedly overlooked our neighbors to the \nsouth. In the place of a robust and comprehensive policy of engagement, \nexchange, aid, and a variety of trade tools, we have a simplistic, \nsingular policy of free trade agreements.\n  The Bush administration's narrow approach has been harmful in many \nways. We have left a vacuum of diplomacy and engagement in many areas, \nwhich has allowed unconstructive forces space to expand influence. And \nour free trade strategy has been very divisive in many of the \ncountries--a foreign policy that divides rather than unites.\n  I support engagement with Latin America; I strongly support being a \nbetter neighbor, but I do not support this narrow policy tool that the \nBush administration has fixated on.\n  The Peru Free Trade Agreement is the first agreement that \nincorporates the new provisions on labor rights, the environment, and \naccess to medicines from the May 10 agreement with Speaker Pelosi, \nCongressmen Rangel and Levin, and Chairman Baucus.\n  These changes are significant. For the first time ever a trade \nagreement will include an enforceable obligation for each country to \nrespect core, internationally recognized labor standards.\n\n[[Page S14727]]\n\nI hope that this new provision will have a dramatic impact over time.\n  If they are faithfully enforced, they can help to reduce inequality \nand establish broader middle classes in the developing countries with \nwhich we have free trade agreements. I applaud these and other changes \nthat were part of that May 10 agreement.\n  While the May 10 agreement is very important, I have generally \nopposed free trade agreements for several reasons.\n  First and foremost, I think that for many years now, U.S. trade \npolicy has been one dimensional--we have had one agreement after \nanother, yet so many other aspects of economic policy have been \nabsolutely neglected.\n  While we have approved new FTAs with 12 different countries since \n2001, we still do not have an adequate trade adjustment assistance \nprogram. Studies show that those workers who lose their job due to \ntrade on average see a substantial cut in wages in their next job. We \nneed to do a better job of ensuring that these workers do not get left \nbehind before we move forward with more and more agreements.\n  While we have approved all of those new FTAs, the Bush administration \nhas absolutely fallen down on the job when it comes to enforcement of \ntrade agreements. The Clinton administration brought on average 11 \ncases per year against foreign trade barriers at the WTO. The Bush \nadministration has brought only a few more than 11 cases total over the \nlast 7 years. The Clinton administration was very aggressive in using \nother tools of trade policy to fight against unfair trade and \nunjustifiable trade barriers. The Bush administration has taken \nnumerous measures to weaken U.S. fair trade laws. The Bush \nadministration has been impotent in responding to China's currency \nmanipulation. The continued inaction on this critical issue has led to \na situation that could destabilize global financial markets and \neconomic prospects. While the May 10 agreement includes important new \nlabor provisions, the Bush administration has repeatedly demonstrated \nthat it will not enforce them.\n  It is hard for me to see how I can go home and tell my constituents \nthat I want to support more and more trade agreements when the present \nadministration has refused to aggressively support U.S. rights under \nour current trade agreements.\n  Finally, I remain concerned that U.S. free trade agreements have hurt \nmany American workers and unwittingly caused problems in some of our \nfree trade partners. The U.S. has lost about 3 million manufacturing \njobs since 2001. Many of these jobs have gone overseas, replaced by \nimports from low-wage countries.\n  These lost jobs are offset by lower prices, no doubt. But a lost job \nhas a more profound impact than our statistics account for. A lost job \nmeans a strain on a family. Large concentrations of lost jobs mean \nstrains on communities and local and State governments.\n  Also, as we saw in Mexico after NAFTA, these FTAs can be harmful to \ncommunities in our trading partners. More than a million Mexican \nfarmers lost their land and livelihood after NAFTA. NAFTA was supposed \nto end illegal immigration to the U.S.; instead by pushing poor rural \nfarmers off their land, it helped cause an explosion of illegal \nimmigration.\n  So I recognize that this FTA reflects major improvements from the \nprevious model. But, I still see many holes in U.S. trade policy that \nneed to be filled. So, reluctantly, I oppose the agreement.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and the \ntime during the quorum call be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 3 minutes on each side.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield myself 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise late in the debate because I know \nit is an important issue, and I find myself wanting to say to the \npeople of Peru that this Senator who comes from the State of New \nMexico, where almost half our people speak Spanish--a commonality \nbetween our two countries--would expect that I show the appropriate \nconcern for the people whom this treaty will benefit. That is why I am \nhere. It is entirely proper that the United States show more concern \nand more consideration and have more relationships of mutual benefit \nwith the countries of Central and South America, without a doubt.\n  I would like to have a few words from this Senator spread on the \nrecord to show that with what I have said, I concur. With this treaty, \nbe it not the best because those who look at it from the standpoint of \nthe best find fault here and there, it is as good as we are going to \nget and we ought to approve it.

I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, with today's passage of the United \nStates-\n\n[[Page S14728]]\n\nPeru Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act, we have taken a \nlong-overdue step to strengthen our relationship with Peru, a close \nfriend and important ally in Latin America. This agreement will result \nin new economic opportunities for U.S. farmers, manufacturers, and \nservice providers, and I am pleased that the Senate has finally voted \nin favor of its implementation.\n  None of this would have been possible without the leadership of two \nof our United States Trade Representatives, Susan Schwab and her \npredecessor, Rob Portman. I want to thank Ambassador Portman for his \nhard work at the negotiating table that resulted in a solid agreement \nthat will level the playing field for U.S. producers and exporters. \nAnd, I want to thank Ambassador Schwab for her dedication and \nperseverance that culminated in the May 10 bipartisan trade compromise, \nwhich set the stage for today's successful vote. Also meriting special \nmention for their tireless efforts are the Assistant United States \nTrade Representative for the Americas, Everett Eissenstat, and his \npredecessor, Regina Vargo.\n  Here in the Senate, I want to begin by thanking the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, Senator Max Baucus. He is a true leader on trade and \non the committee. And he is supported by a strong staff. That starts \nwith the Democratic staff director on the Finance Committee, Russ \nSullivan, and the deputy staff director, Bill Dauster, who were \ncritical to the process. I also want to thank his chief international \ntrade counsel, Demetrios Marantis, as well as the other members of the \nDemocratic trade staff, Amber Cottle, Janis Lazda, Chelsea Thomas, \nDarci Vetter, and Hun Quach, and two individuals serving on detail to \nSenator Baucus, Russ Ugone and Ayesha Khanna.\n  Of course, I am grateful for the outstanding effort of my staff as \nwell. First, my chief counsel and staff director, Kolan Davis, merits \nspecial mention. His legislative expertise has been instrumental in \nmoving countless bills and this is no exception. I also want to thank \nmy chief international trade counsel, Stephen Schaefer, as well as \nDavid Johanson, David Ross, and Claudia Bridgeford Poteet. And, I want \nto thank John Kalitka, who is on detail to my office from the U.S. \nDepartment of Commerce.\n  Finally, I want to thank Polly Craighill and Margaret Roth-Warren of \nthe Office of the Senate Legislative Counsel for their hard work on \nthis legislation. As always, Polly's patience and expertise have been \ninvaluable in producing a top-notch bill. Margaret is a relatively \nrecent addition to the office and already she is proving herself a very \nstrong asset to our legislative team.\n  Today's vote is long overdue. The May 10 compromise was expected to \npave the way for quick consideration of all four of our pending free \ntrade agreements, as well as the renewal of trade promotion authority. \nThat hasn't happened as quickly as I would have liked. Still, today's \nvote is a critical first step, and I hope we can use this vote to build \nmomentum toward implementing the next agreement in line, which is our \ntrade agreement with Colombia. We should move the Colombia trade \nagreement as soon as possible, and I will work hard toward that outcome \nin the 110th Congress.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today the Senate voted to approve H.R. \n3688, the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation \nAct. In July of 2006, I opposed this agreement when it came before the \nSenate Finance Committee because it lacked enforceable labor \nstandards--standards that Peru's President Alejandro Toledo indicated a \nwillingness to support. What a difference a year makes. As a result of \na landmark bipartisan agreement reached in May of this year, and for \nthe first time ever in a free trade agreement, our agreement with Peru \nencompasses meaningful and enforceable labor and environmental \nprotections.\n  The labor chapter of the agreement requires both the United States \nand Peru to adopt and maintain domestic laws to implement the five core \nstandards incorporated in the 1998 ILO Declaration on Fundamental \nPrinciples and Rights at Work: (1) the right to organize; (2) the right \nto bargain collectively; (3) prohibitions on forced labor; (4) \nprotections for child labor; and (5) freedom from employment \ndiscrimination. The environmental chapter requires both the United \nStates and Peru to adopt and maintain domestic laws to implement the \nobligations in seven multilateral environmental agreements to which \nboth the United States and Peru are parties. I have long championed the \ninclusion of enforceable labor and environmental standards in free \ntrade agreements, and I supported the agreement today because of these \nchapters. It is imperative that our trading partners be held to high \nlabor and environmental standards, and I would not stand in support of \nthis agreement had these provisions not been included.\n  The Peru Free Trade Agreement is a landmark achievement that makes \nthese provisions fully enforceable--subjecting these provisions to the \nsame dispute resolution system that applies to the commercial \nprovisions of the agreement. I urge the President, along with the \noffice of the U.S. Trade Representative, to hold Peru's government \naccountable to these provisions. By ensuring that these standards are \nfully enforced, the President can solidify this agreement with Peru as \na model for dealing with future trading partners.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/04/senate-section/article/S14728-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, winter is fast approaching. The Senator \nfrom Minnesota was out there with his snow blower and shovel already \nthis weekend. We had from 6 to 10 inches of snow in some portions of \nthe State, 6 inches in the metro area. It was minus 2 when I woke up \none day in the Twin Cities, in St. Paul. I traveled around the State. I \nthink it was around minus 8, minus 9, and that is not getting cold yet. \nIn that weather, we actually button the top button but no more.\n  The reality for many families is cold weather has a lot of people \ndeeply concerned about their ability to keep the heat on. Most of us \nlook forward to the coming of the holiday season as a time we get \ntogether with loved ones. For many Americans, this holiday season comes \nat a time when the cost of energy is skyrocketing. It is raising the \nlevel of anxiety as to whether they are going to be able to pay these \never-rising heating costs.\n  I will never forget a hearing I held for the Permanent Subcommittee \non Investigations. I actually did a hearing on the issue of energy \ncosts in my home State last year. I got a chance to listen firsthand to \nfolks who, last year, were impacted by rising energy costs. They bear \ndown on young and old alike.\n  I had the opportunity to meet Deidre Jackson, a single mother, \nworking professional, and college student who saw her heating bill go \nthrough the roof. Meanwhile, Lucille Olson told a story familiar to \nmany seniors of the struggle balancing the high cost of health care, \nprescription drugs, with heating bills that represented 30 percent of \nher monthly income. Unfortunately, for many seniors, this is not a \nbalancing act that is easily maintained. Stories abound of grandmothers \nand grandfathers having to choose between food, medicine, clothing, and \nheat. This should not happen in America in the 21st century.\n  It is for stories such as these that we have the Low Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program--LIHEAP--to provide heating and cooling \nassistance for folks who are struggling to get by. To many Americans, \nLIHEAP is a real lifeline. More than 70 percent of families receiving \nLIHEAP assistance have\n\n[[Page S14729]]\n\nincomes of less than 100 percent of the Federal poverty level. That is \nabout $21,500 for a family of four. These are truly families who cannot \nafford to see their heating bills double. In fact, the majority of \nhouseholds have at least one member who is elderly, disabled, or a \nchild under 5 years of age. These are the most vulnerable.\n  Unfortunately, current Federal funding levels are only sufficient to \nmeet the needs of about 16 percent of the eligible households. Many \nStates are trying to meet the needs of more households by providing \nsmaller benefits to each household. Meanwhile, rising energy prices are \nrapidly reducing the purchasing power of program grants. This is a bad \ncombination. In other words, folks in need are receiving less \nassistance while the cost of heating increases. Again, this is simply \nan untenable situation.\n  Consider that home heating prices are projected to reach almost \n$1,000 a year for a typical family, representing an increase of almost \n80 percent from the average cost during the winter of 2001-2002. It is \nin just 5 years that we have seen this incredible 80-percent increase \nin cost. In fact, data show we are looking at heating costs rising 15.2 \npercent this year and record levels for heating oil, propane, and \nelectricity. Experts predict that Minnesotans who use heating oil will \nprobably see an increase in their bill of 47 percent higher than last \nyear's level. Meanwhile, the cost of natural gas, which most \nMinnesotans rely on for their heating needs, is up 38 percent from the \naverage cost during the winters of 2000 to 2005.\n  The heating oil crisis we are facing this year is certainly partially \ndue to America's need to import more and more oil. I have always said \nthere is a national security need to end our dependence on foreign oil. \nThere is also a very focused need in terms of the impact it has on \nthose who simply cannot afford to pay their heating bills. We need to \nend their dependence on foreign oil. At the same time, we have to make \nsure to take care of those families in need today.\n  We have the tools to produce clean and renewable energy here at home, \nand our heating crisis is only one of the many reasons we need to \nfinish work on the bold energy package the Senate passed this summer \nand the strong farm bill we have before us now. Those are two important \npieces of legislation. I hope we can overcome this partisan divide in \nWashington that kind of tears us apart and precludes us from getting \nthings done.\n  I have sat with the Presiding Officer. We talked about renewables and \nenergy and seeing if we can find common ground. We need it in Maryland, \nwe need it in Minnesota, we need it in America. Unfortunately, as much \nas we would like to transform our energy production before this winter \nbegins, we don't have that option. But we can make sure Americans \nhaving a tough time getting by have the assistance they need to make it \nthrough a cold season. For many, it really is a matter of survival. The \nlarge percentage of increases in heating costs don't really hit home \nuntil you look at a utility bill. A lot of folks will see hundreds of \nadditional dollars on their heating bills this winter. That is a huge \nexpense for a family below the poverty level or for the elderly on \nfixed incomes.\n\n  I drive by a bus stop on Grand Avenue in St. Paul, about four blocks \nfrom my house. There is a bus that stops there that takes you to \ndowntown St. Paul. On a cold winter day, I look as I drive by. There \nmay be a senior, a working mom--and it is cold. I look at the cost of \nenergy and realize we have an obligation to try to do the right thing. \nThat is what LIHEAP is about.\n  In life, sometimes the unexpected happens. No matter how much we try, \nsometimes we just need a helping hand to get back on our feet.\n  During my hearings back home, I heard a story from a courageous woman \nfrom St. Paul, Lori Cooper, who, as a working professional, wife, and \nmother of a 21-month child, had to figure out how to make ends meet \nwhen her husband's health prevented him from working. With heating \ncosts rising, LIHEAP was critical in helping her family make it through \nthe winter.\n  Tragically, it is getting harder for States to help families like \nthis one get through winters like this because the appropriation levels \nhave not risen with the inflation since the 1980s. The Labor-HHS-\nEducation bill that the Senate has produced includes a welcome \nincrease, but it is still below the real amount provided 20 years ago. \nIf you look at where we were 20 years ago and factor in inflation, we \nare below that today. This would be much less problematic if we were \nnot dealing with skyrocketing heating costs, which is why this winter, \nas in the winter of 2005-2006, families need emergency LIHEAP \nassistance.\n  In 2006, I came to the floor with Senators Collins and Snowe to make \nthe case to this body that no one should have to make the choice \nbetween basic necessities and heat. Rising to that challenge, we \ndelivered an increase of $1 billion additional LIHEAP funding in 2006. \nToday, I proudly stand with my colleague from Vermont who, along with \n17 Members, introduced the Keep Americans Warm Act to meet the heating \ncrisis we will face this winter. This bill provides $1 billion in \nemergency LIHEAP assistance in addition to the funding currently \nincluded in the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to join the 19 of us who are standing behind \nthis bill, who are committed to meeting this urgent need. It took a lot \nof work to get emergency LIHEAP assistance passed in 2006. We worked \nvery hard. It was difficult. I know it will take a lot of effort this \ntime as well, but I am certain this Senate can come together to aid \nthose who are struggling to provide the bare necessity of heat. I have \nfaith in the potential of this body to act for the greater good, and I \nlook forward to working together to pass this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday the Director of National \nIntelligence, Admiral Mike McConnell, released the National \nIntelligence Estimate on Iran's nuclear weapons program. This NIE, \nwhich represents the best collective judgment of all 16 U.S. \nintelligence agencies, told us:\n\n       Our intelligence community has concluded with high \n     confidence that Iran halted its nuclear weapons program in \n     2003.\n\n  This is a major reversal of the intelligence community's previous \nintelligence assessment in 2005 that Iran was determined to develop \nnuclear weapons. The NIE states that the nuclear weapons program was \nhalted primarily in response to international pressure, which suggests \nthat Iran may be more vulnerable to influence.\n  Perhaps most significant is the DNI's conclusion that some \ncombination of threats of intensified scrutiny and pressures, along \nwith opportunities for Iran to achieve its security, prestige, and \ngoals might prompt Tehran to extend the current halt to its nuclear \nweapons program.\n  I commend Admiral McConnell and his colleagues for their decision to \nrelease unclassified conclusions based on this current intelligence. I \ndo not believe we can overstate the importance of this new information.\n  The effects of this NIE will be felt here, at the United Nations, \nthroughout Europe, across the entire Middle East, the world, and in \nIran.\n  The NIE closely parallels many of the conclusions of the Internal \nAtomic Energy Agency, the IAEA, the international organization, with \nthe most direct on-the-ground access to Iran's nuclear facilities. Once \nagain, the facts appear to be bearing out the conclusions of the IAEA. \nThis NIE, as well as the IAEA's analysis, should help inform and shape \nU.S. strategy on Iran.\n  President Bush has a responsibility to carefully consider the policy \nimplications concerning Iran with this new information, and I know he \nwill. He said in his news conference this morning that this new \ninformation which he has confidence in would be factored into our \npolicy regarding Iran.\n  The United States must pursue a clear and strategic policy toward \nIran\n\n[[Page S14730]]\n\nbased on this new intelligence and fact-based assessment to avoid the \ndisastrous mistakes of Iraq. Yesterday's NIE does not invalidate the \neffectiveness of previous efforts to use an international consensus of \npressure on Iran. We must be careful not to run from one end of the \npendulum all the way to the other.\n  As President Bush noted again this morning, the United States must \ncontinue to work with our friends and our allies to sustain an \ninternational consensus on Iran. I believe the President is correct: \nalliances, common purpose, common interests, focus, discipline.\n  Iran's objectionable words and actions are real, and they must \ncontinue to be addressed. That means a very clear-eyed and realistic \nsense of Iran and its motives. As I said in my November 8 CSIS speech \nregarding U.S.-Iran policy, the United States must employ a \ncomprehensive strategy regarding Iran: Iraq, the Israeli-Palestinian \nissue, the Middle East, a regional comprehensive strategy.\n  Yesterday's NIE reinforces the need for directed, unconditional, and \ncomprehensive engagement with Iran. The United States and the \ninternational community must use all--all--elements of our foreign \npolicy arsenal in offering direct, unconditional, and comprehensive \ntalks with Iran. The United States should be clear that all issues, our \nissues and Iran's issues, are on the table, including offering Iran a \ncredible way back from the fringes of the international community, \nsecurity guarantees, and other incentives.\n  We urgently need to adopt a comprehensive strategy on Iran that is \nfocused on direct engagement and diplomacy backed, as diplomacy must \nalways be backed, by the leverage of international pressure, isolation, \ncontainment, and military options.\n  The United States must employ wise statecraft to redirect deepening \ntensions with Iran toward a higher ground of resolution. That is what \nAnnapolis was about last week. America is the great power here. Iran is \nnot the great power. We must be the more mature country in testing the \nproposition that the United States and Iran can overcome decades of \nmutual mistrust, suspicion, and hostility.\n  That is diplomacy. Diplomacy is not talking to your friends; \ndiplomacy is not giving another country bonus points for us talking to \nthem. There is a reason for diplomacy. We should not squander this \nopportunity as we did in the spring of 2003 when we had an opportunity \nfor an opening to explore talks with Iran.\n  This initiative, by the way, in 2003, came from Iran. We are \nwitnessing a confluence of events in the Middle East and around the \nworld that presents the United States with new opportunities. There are \nhopeful and positive recent developments: Progress on North Korea's \nnuclear weapons program; the recent regional meeting in Istanbul on \nIraq; the momentum generated by last week's Annapolis Middle East \nmeeting where all Arab countries, including Syria, sat at the same \ntable with Israel; and yesterday's NIE assessment.\n  Now is the time for America to act and to lead, and to lead boldly, \nwith confidence, with our allies, focusing on a common purpose.\n  One dimensional optics, policies, and blunt black-or-white rhetoric, \nsuch as ``you are either with us or you are against us'' will not work, \nhaven't worked, and will fall short of what is expected from American \nleadership in the eyes of the world.\n  The world faces challenges and opportunities today that carry with it \nimplications well beyond this moment in time. American leadership is \nonce again being called on at yet another transformational time in \nhistory to help set a new course, a new framework for a rudderless \nworld drifting in a sea of combustible dangers.\n  In engaging Iran, the Middle East, and the world, we must be wide in \nour scope, clear in our purpose, measured in our words, and strong in \nour actions. Yesterday's NIE should not be overstated, but it also must \nnot be undervalued in shaping future policy with Iran and in the Middle \nEast.\n  Make no mistake, the NIE sets in motion a series of ripple effects \nthat will have serious consequences. This should be welcome news for \nthe United States and the world.\n  Mr. President, I thank you, yield the floor, and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The clerk will call the roll \nof the Senate.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, as Congress reconvenes this week after our \nobservance of the Thanksgiving holiday, we find a brisk wind blowing \nthrough the streets of the Nation's Capital. As cold temperatures begin \nto grip the country, Americans are turning up the heat in their homes, \nbut the elected leaders of our country should seize the opportunity to \nturn down the heat in Washington.\n  Three days ago, in his weekly radio address, the President placed the \nblame at the feet of Congress for the delays in enacting 11 of the 12 \nannual appropriations bills. But finger pointing does nothing--nothing, \nzilch--to solve the impasse, which began with White House threats to \nveto 10 of those funding bills. With 3 short weeks left in this session \nof Congress, it is time to close down the political posturing and \nrecognize we have a responsibility to govern.\n  As the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, it is clear \nto me that Congress is working with great diligence to find a way \naround our budget conundrum. Working hand in hand with Members of the \nminority, we are crafting an appropriations package that I expect will \ngarner bipartisan support. This package contemplates a reduction of \n$10.6 billion from the spending levels approved by Congress in this \nyear's budget resolution. And $10.6 billion is a lot of money. In \naddition, various controversial matters, some of which have been the \nsubject of veto threats, are eliminated.\n  Both Democrats and Republicans in Congress are attempting, in good \nfaith, to find a way around the veto threat demagoguery that has been \nemanating from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue for months. Now the White House \nneeds to put aside politics and recognize it is time to govern in the \nresponsible manner that is expected by the American people.\n  I urge the President--and he is my President, too, and I say it \nrespectfully--to stop the stale veto threats that have been the \nalbatross around the neck of responsible budgeting for months. The fact \nis the needs of this Nation have changed since the budget was submitted \nway back in February. That should come as no great surprise.\n  The Senate, on a bipartisan basis, has recognized these needs, and \nevents have made them crystal clear.\n  The crumbling state of our infrastructure was punctuated by a \ndeadly--and I mean deadly--bridge collapse in Minnesota. The Senate \npassed a bill containing funds for the bridge replacement and for \nrepairing bridges across the Nation by a vote of 88 to 7. That was the \nresponsible thing to do.\n  Soaring oil prices mean a cruel squeeze on low-income heating \nassistance. The Senate approved by a vote of 75 to 19 a bill providing \nincreased heating assistance. That was the responsible thing to do.\n  Investigations into the treatment of soldiers returning from Iraq and \nAfghanistan have underlined greater demands on the VA health care \nsystem. Legislation to increase funding for our veterans passed the \nSenate by a vote of 92 to 1. That was the moral thing to do.\n  More money is needed to improve the security of our borders. An \namendment to provide such funding passed the Senate 89 to 1. That was \nthe smart thing to do.\n  In July, the administration released its latest National intelligence \nreport that concluded al-Qaida has regrouped in Pakistan with the \nintention of attacking the United States again. The Senate passed a \nHomeland Security bill to increase funding for first responders by a \nvote of 89 to 4.\n  Rising crime rates in this country highlight the wisdom of additional \nfunding for law enforcement. The Senate passed legislation providing \nsuch funding for cops on the street by a vote of 75 to 19.\n  The rising cost of food means that there must be more funding for the\n\n[[Page S14731]]\n\nWomen, Infants and Children Program or 500,000 people will lose \nimportant nutritional support.\n  Yet despite all of these developments since the President submitted \nan inadequate spending proposal in February, the White House continues \nto demand an arbitrary and irresponsible ceiling on spending. The White \nHouse continues to stubbornly oppose bipartisan initiatives to invest \nmoney to solve the real problems that face the Nation.\n  Soon, the first session of this 110th Congress will draw to a close, \nbut there is still time to craft an appropriations proposal that makes \na sincere attempt to meet the President in the middle of the road. I \nthank Senator Thad Cochran and his ranking members for their efforts as \nwe move forward in completing the fiscal year 2008 appropriations \nprocess.\n  So the choice is clear--as clear as the noonday Sun in a cloudless \nsky. The President and the Congress must recognize that the people of \nthis country expect their leaders--that is us, the people downtown at \nthe other end of the avenue and those across the Capitol--to actually \ngovern and address the real problems facing the country.\n  Democrats and Republicans in Congress are willing to work to resolve \ndifferences and complete a fiscally responsible package of \nappropriations bills. But to do the people's business, the Congress \nmust be joined by a White House willing, at last, to jettison its \npolitical posturing, stop its political posturing. The tyranny of the \nveto threat has already dangerously delayed the Nation's priorities for \nfar too long.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/04/senate-section/article/S14731-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14731-S14733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TEMPORARY TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2007--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the American people are about to see what \nthe Democrats have tried to do all year and what we have been prevented \nfrom doing all year because of the obstructionism of the Republicans.\n  President Bush is out giving speeches that we have to do AMT. We have \nto take care of that. He is giving speeches all over the country. He \ngives press conferences talking about why we aren't doing AMT. \nEverybody watch. Here is why we aren't doing AMT. They do not want us \nto do it. They want, at the end of the year, to say: Look, the \nDemocrats are not doing AMT. Everyone should understand we are not \ndoing it because the Republicans, all 49 of them, backed by President \nBush, don't want us to do it.\n  Mr. President, we have offered them a proposal. We will have a vote \nwith a 60-vote margin on them all--on the bill the House has passed. \nThe bill has passed. The bill passed by the House fully funds AMT. They \nwon't let us vote on that. So I say: OK, let's vote on Senator Lott's \nproposal, which just eliminates AMT. And then I say: Let's work on the \nproposal we have from the Finance Committee that has come from Senator \nBaucus and Senator Grassley which has some extenders in it that we need \nto complete this year and then doesn't pay for the AMT. The Republicans \ndon't want the AMT paid for. How much more fair could we be? We are \ngiving them a vote on virtually everything dealing with AMT. But, no, \nthey won't do that. It is the way it has been going all year long. We \ncan't do the farm bill. We can't do anything around here, Mr. \nPresident. That is why we have had to file cloture 56 times. They have \nobjected even to bills they agree with just to eat up time around here.\n  So I am not going to ask consent to move, as we have previously. I \ngave the Republican leader a proposal earlier today, as I have in the \npast, to do just as I have outlined, covering every possible facet of \nAMT--60 votes on all of them. But, no, no votes on any of them. So now \nI am left with no alternative but to file cloture on the only measure \ndealing with AMT that is now before this body.\n  For the life of me, I don't understand what they are trying to \naccomplish. What I have heard recently, in the last hour or so, is that \nnow what they want to do is--we have certain tax provisions that are \nexpiring in 2011--they want to vote on those. Now, that is 3 or 4 years \naway, and we have something that is expiring in a matter of weeks. How \ndo those things tie together? They do not.\n  This is an effort to thwart the progress of our slim majority, 51 to \n49. The Republicans want to go around saying the Democrats aren't doing \nthe work of this country. Well, we have a long list of accomplishments \nwe are very proud of, but also the American people understand that we \nare agents of change and the Republicans are agents of the status quo. \nThat is what this is all about. They want things to stay the way they \nhave been, and we want to change things, and not only in Iraq. We don't \nhave another longstanding debate on that. We want to change the course \nin Iraq, and we want to change course in the way this country has been \nheaded for the last 7 years--into the economic doldrums. And here \ntoday, what we want to do is finish a part of what we believe is an \nobligation to this country, and that is to make sure that when the \nfirst of the year rolls around, 19 million Americans don't have a tax \nincrease. Everyone within the sound of my voice should understand, if \nthat comes to be, it can go to 16th and Pennsylvania Avenue because \nthat is what President Bush--he is the man who is pulling the strings \non the 49 puppets he has here in the Senate. That is too bad for the \ncountry.\n\n  I move to proceed to H.R. 3996. There is a cloture motion at the \ndesk. I ask the clerk to report it.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion having been filed under rule XXII, \nthe clerk will report the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 487, H.R. 3996, the AMT tax bill.\n         Harry Reid, Dick Durbin, Patty Murray, Max Baucus, Jay \n           Rockefeller, Patrick Leahy, Daniel K. Inouye, Herb \n           Kohl, Benjamin L. Cardin, Jeff Bingaman, Ted Kennedy, \n           Carl Levin, B.A. Mikulski, Barbara Boxer, Debbie \n           Stabenow, Maria Cantwell, Bill Nelson.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill be.\n  Has the Senator not asked consent to go to the House-passed bill?\n  Mr. REID. No, I said I wouldn't do that. I am sorry if there was some \nconfusion. I said I was not going to do that. I had been told by the \nstaff that there would be an objection, so I indicated I was not going \nto do that. I apologize to my friend.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. May I ask the Parliamentarian, what is the state of \nplay? On what was cloture just filed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to proceed to H.R. 3996 was made, \nand the motion to invoke cloture was filed on that.\n  The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I think we all can agree we should fix \nthe AMT. We should have done it much earlier this year. Shortly, I am \ngoing to present a unanimous consent agreement based on a very simple \nproposition: Our time is running short; therefore, we should start the \ndebate with the areas of broadest agreement and work from there.\n  So what can we all agree upon? We agree it is past time for Congress \nto act to ensure that 23 million American families do not face a major \ntax increase this year. While my side of the aisle believes we should \npermanently repeal the AMT, we are also prepared to ensure that middle-\nincome Americans get tax relief this year.\n  We agree tax extenders are important to small business, to parents \npaying college tuition for their children, to teachers who buy \nclassroom supplies with their own money. These issues are not \ncontroversial, and I believe a majority of the Senate supports them.\n  However, there is an area of strong disagreement. We disagree with \nthe proposition that taxes must be permanently raised in order to \nextend current tax policy. By patching the AMT and extending other \nexpiring provisions, we are simply maintaining the\n\n[[Page S14732]]\n\nstatus quo on tax policy. Why should some taxpayers be harmed when no \nsingle taxpayer will enjoy increased benefits?\n  So I recommend that we begin where there is a consensus--the AMT \npatch and tax extenders. We should require the controversial \nprovisions, those raising revenues, be subject to 60 votes. In \naddition, my side of the aisle would like an opportunity for votes on \nour vision for tax relief and AMT reform, all of which we understand \nwould be subject to 60 votes. Anything left at the end of the process \nwould also be subject to 60 votes.\n  This would be a fair process for the short amount of time we have \nbeen given on this bill. Let's not tie up the Senate over \ndisagreements; rather, we should build from areas of broadest \nconsensus.\n  I do not anticipate the majority leader agreeing to the unanimous \nconsent that I am going to now propound. I want to make sure he is \nengaged before I do that. Or maybe the chairman of the committee?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The leader mentioned to me he had an urgent meeting he \nhad to attend. It is up to the leader if he wants to propound his \nconsent now or later.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Montana. I gather he is \nsaying he will take care of the consent for their side? I thank the \nSenator from Montana.\n  I ask unanimous consent at a time to be determined by the majority \nleader, after consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate \nproceed to consideration of H.R. 3996, the House-passed AMT bill, and \nit be considered under the following limitations: There be 1 hour of \ndebate on the bill, equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees, followed by a vote on a motion to invoke cloture on the \nbill; provided further, that if cloture is not invoked, then the only \namendments in order to the bill be the following, and be offered in the \nfollowing order: A substitute amendment to be offered by Senator \nMcConnell or his designee, which is to be an unoffset AMT extension and \nan unoffset extenders package; a Baucus or designee first-degree \namendment to the McConnell substitute which is to be a set of offsets \nfor the extender package; a Sessions amendment related to AMT and \nexemptions; an Ensign amendment which is an AMT repeal and extends \nother expiring provisions; a DeMint amendment which relates to AMT and \nflat tax; provided further, that there be an additional 2 hours for \ndebate on the bill, equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees; that there be a time limitation of 2 hours for debate on \neach amendment equally divided in the usual form, provided that each \namendment would require 60 votes in the affirmative for adoption and \nthat each amendment that does not require 60 votes then be withdrawn; I \nfurther ask that, notwithstanding the adoption of any substitute \namendment, the other amendments be in order, and finally that following \nthe consideration of the above amendments, 60 votes be required for \npassage of the bill as amended, if amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is a very interesting proposal. I \nthink it is constructive. Now the Senate is engaging on this issue. At \nan earlier point, a couple or 3 weeks ago, the leader propounded a \nconsent on this subject, and it was objected to and the Senate took no \naction. But here the distinguished minority leader is suggesting a \nprocess. He is suggesting a way, perhaps, to resolve this question. I \nthink the basic implication of his suggestion is that we must and \nshould very definitely pass legislation this year that prevents about \n19 million Americans from paying the alternative minimum tax for tax \nyear 2007 when they fill out their tax returns next year.\n  There are provisions which are interesting, which I have not seen \nuntil this moment--I daresay which I think the leader has not seen \nuntil this moment--which have to be worked out before I think there can \nbe an agreement. But there may be something here, the beginnings of \nsomething so that we can work out an accommodation. I very much hope \nthat is the case.\n  Over the next hours and day or two perhaps we can find a way to reach \nan agreement on what the procedure should be, what amendment will be \noffered by whom, et cetera.\n  I again thank the distinguished minority leader, but on behalf of the \nleader, on behalf of Senator Reid, I must object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Montana. We will \ncontinue discussions in the hope we can get a result that is mutually \nsatisfactory to virtually all the Members of the Senate in the very \nnear future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I underline the urgency of curing this \nalternative minimum tax problem and also underline how strongly the \nSenators on this side of the aisle are attempting to get that \nlegislation passed as soon as possible. We tried, on this side, to get \nAMT legislation up before the Senate and passed so that American \ntaxpayers will not have to pay it. That was objected to by the other \nside. We made many attempts. There were many suggestions by the \nmajority leader to bring up legislation to prevent the alternative \nminimum tax from going into effect. They were all objected to by the \nother side. We are here again trying to get resolution.\n  The leader filed cloture on the House-passed bill so we can get a \nvote on the issue in an attempt to move the issue forward. I commend \nhim for that. Again it was, in a sense, objected to by the other side \nbecause they offered just now a package which is somewhat in the right \ndirection but also has complications in it which raise questions to the \ndegree we can fully get AMT passed. But I want to underline the \nimportance of this body passing legislation to prevent the alternative \nminimum tax from affecting about 19 million Americans. We all know this \nis a pernicious tax, it is a stealth tax. It was not intended to have \nthis effect on so many middle-income Americans. Unfortunately, it has \nthis effect because when it was enacted years ago it was not indexed, \nand each year more and more American taxpayers have to pay the \nalternative minimum tax. Soon we will get very much to the point where \nmost Americans--I will not say most, but a vast number of Americans \nwill have to pay the alternative minimum tax, and that is not what we \nwant. We did not intend that. We are trying to get it solved.\n  There is another issue, and that is this: The IRS has sent the 2007 \ntax forms to the printer. They were sent to the printer on November 16. \nSo each day that we dally here, each day the Congress does not correct \nthis problem, it means it costs the Government more money to correct \nthe forms, to correct the programs that it has to utilize when paying \ntaxes online, whether it is various providers--it is the wrong way to \ndo business.\n  It means a lot more frustration for taxpayers. Just think, if you are \na taxpayer and you are beginning to figure out what your income tax is \ngoing to be, and suddenly out of the blue, Congress does not change \nthis AMT, it causes huge problems. Just think of the withholding \nprovisions. Americans have a certain amount of dollars withheld from \ntheir income as taxes every year, from every paycheck, for example. The \ncalculation assumes the AMT, pretty soon, if it is not corrected--\nassume AMT will be corrected. If it is corrected, those changes have to \nbe made on the taxpayers when they withhold.\n  I hope, again, we get this done. Senator Grassley, the ranking member \nof the committee, and I have offered a proposal. We have a package we \nagree on, Senator Grassley and I, to take up and pass legislation which \nsays: OK, nobody has to pay AMT in 2007 who didn't pay it in the \nprevious year. That is the tax year 2007. We are providing it doesn't \nhave to be paid for. That is a big step. But I say that because it is\n\n[[Page S14733]]\n\nmy judgment that because the President--because Republicans so \nadamantly said it cannot be paid for, and because we need 60 votes, \nthat it will not be paid for. That is just a judgment I made. I suggest \nwe bring up legislation, pass an AMT patch for 1 year, and also include \nthe extender provisions which will be paid for.\n  That is where we are going to end up. Everybody knows that is where \nwe are going to end up. If that is where we are going to end up, let's \njust do it, not go through this kabuki here, these games, not use this \nas leverage to offer amendments that are going nowhere and will never \nbe enacted, that are just political. But we are unfortunately in a \nposition where we are not yet free to pass legislation that we know at \nsome point we are going to end up with; that is, AMT not being paid for \nand all the extenders paid for.\n  I again underline how much we on this side of the aisle are trying to \nget the AMT passed. Up to this point we are being blocked by the other \nside. We are going to keep trying. The earlier we get this passed the \nbetter because the forms can be sent out more quickly, the computer \nprograms changed more quickly, and we are going to keep at it because \nit is the right thing to do. And, second, we are going to do it anyway. \nIf it is the right thing to do and we are going to do it anyway, why \ndon't we do it now?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Casey pertaining to the introduction of S. 2407 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll of the Senate.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, about 2 hours ago, the Commerce Committee \nof the Senate took some action on a bill I offered along with my \ncolleague, Senator Lott from Mississippi. I wish to talk about the \nMedia Ownership Act of 2007 for just a moment. I hope, perhaps, the \nChairman of the Federal Communications Commission may take note and \nwatch what the Commerce Committee did.\n  This issue is very important. It has been around for a long time. It \ndeals with media concentration. Some years ago--in 2003--the then-\nChairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Michael Powell, \nrounded up two other votes and by a vote of three to two passed a new \nFCC rule allowing a relaxation of ownership limits for television and \nradio stations, and for newspapers, and here is what they concluded \nback then. It is almost unbelievable. They said it will be OK with them \nif, in the largest American cities, one company owned eight radio \nstations, three television stations, the newspaper, and the cable \ncompany--they would all be owned by the same company. They said that \nwould be just dandy.\n  Well, the fact is, it was not fine with me, and I fought it. Senator \nLott joined me back then. We offered a resolution of disapproval of the \nFCC rule and it passed the Senate. In the meantime, the Federal court \nof appeals stayed the rule, and so the rule never went into effect. But \nit was unbelievable to me that the Federal Communications Commission \nthought that what we really needed in this country was more \nconcentration in the media.\n  Well, the idea is not dead. The current Chairman of the Federal \nCommunications Commission came up recently with an idea of relaxing \nownership rules, and he announced--in an op-ed piece in the New York \nTimes and then in a press release he was going to propose a new set of \nrules that relax the ownership restrictions. So he said: We are going \nto announce the rule in November, and I am going to ask for a final FCC \nvote by December 18.\n  He says his proposed rule is a real compromise. It is going to allow \nthe ownership of the newspaper and a television station in each of the \n20 largest markets in our country. These top 20 markets, by the way, \ncover one-half of the population of America. He will relax the ban that \nexists on cross-ownership between newspapers and television stations.\n  Now, I do not know that anybody is lying awake at night in this \ncountry thinking about our most serious problems and deciding that one \nof the biggest problems in America is that \nnewspapers are not allowed to buy television stations. We have a cross-\nownership ban for good reason, in my judgment, but apparently the \nChairman of the FCC has been lying awake thinking: We have to fix this. \nSo he has come up with a rule that says: Well, let's let newspapers buy \ntelevision stations.\n  We just passed a bill, S. 2332, over in the Commerce Committee that \nwould stop what the FCC is doing and would not allow them to proceed \nwith the December 18 date. It would require that the American public be \nallowed to weigh in on these issues. We say in our bill that passed \nunanimously in the Commerce Committee that you have to have a process \nthat is fair to the American public. You cannot decide to announce, \n``Here is my rule,'' in November, and then drive it through to a \nconclusion in December.\n  The Chairman says: Well, but we had six hearings around the country. \nWe did this. We did that. None of those hearings would have given \npeople an opportunity to comment on this rule because the rule did not \nexist when he held the hearings. He waited until the hearings were all \ndone and then announced the rule and then has tried to jam this home by \nDecember 18. That is what the Chairman is trying to do. It is unfair, \nand it makes no sense.\n  With respect to concentration in the media, let me say this: I do not \nthink it has served this country's interest to have the concentration \nin radio and television, and it certainly does not serve this country's \ninterest to decide that we ought to allow the newspapers now to buy the \ntelevision stations. I think that concentration is injurious to this \ndemocracy. We need the free flow of information.\n  It is interesting, most of what people will see, hear, and read in \nAmerica today--Tuesday, December 4--will be controlled by about five or \nsix major corporations with respect to television, the Internet, radio, \nand the newspapers. About five or six major corporations in this \ncountry have a substantial amount of control of what kind of \ninformation is available to the American people. And some believe there \nneeds to be greater concentration?\n  We held a hearing recently in the Senate Commerce Committee, and the \nParents Television Council, which is considered to be on the right side \nof the political spectrum, came and weighed in with opposition to the \nproposal by the Federal Communications Commission. The witness was from \nLos Angeles. He said: I have in my office in Los Angeles, CA basic \nadvanced tier cable where I get 48 channels. But he said: That isn't 48 \ndifferent voices. Then he went down the list of who controls those \nchannels--Time Warner, etc. He just went down the list of the 4 or 5 or \n6 big companies that control those 40-some channels.\n  So it goes back to what I have said for long time. When the FCC is \ntrying to relax these ownership rules, they say: Well, you now have a \nlot more choices. You have more channels. You have more networks. You \nhave more Internet sites. My response was: Yes, there are more voices \nfrom the same ventriloquist. Really, this country is not, in my \njudgment, served well by a Federal Communications Commission that is \njust hell bent on deciding: We need to have greater concentration in \nradio, television, or newspapers.\n\n  Now, take a look at what has happened with radio concentration. In \none town in North Dakota--a town of about 40,000 or 50,000 people--one \ncompany\n\n[[Page S14734]]\n\nbought up all of the radio stations--all 6 of them. All six commercial \nstations were bought by one company from Texas. Does that make sense? \nIt does not to me. The FCC said it was just fine. So what happens with \nrespect to news-gathering in that town? Well, you end up with fewer \nnewspeople because when one company owns all the stations, they just \nconsolidate it all.\n  There is a real dispute about the story I'm about to tell you and I \ndo not know that anybody has ever gotten to the bottom of it. I have \nseen so many different stories. Late at night--at 2 in the morning--a \ntrain came through Minot, ND, and with anhydrous ammonia cars, \nderailed, went off the tracks, split some anhydrous ammonia cars, and \nthis deadly plume enveloped the city at 2 a.m. It caused a death, and \ncaused many injuries. Many went to the hospital. It caused great fright \namong the population, not knowing what was happening. We discovered \nlater it was a great danger to the population. Well, the emergency \nbroadcast function somehow did not work. But notwithstanding the fact \nthe system did not work, the townspeople could not get anybody to \nanswer the telephone at the local radio station. All the commercial \nstations were owned by the same company from another State. One \nwonders, what if those stations were owned by individual operators who \nlived in town? Do you think they would be able to track somebody down? \nI think so.\n  Now, the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission is \ngalloping off to relax media ownership rules because he thinks that is \nreally what is necessary. I met with him today, and I said: What is \nreally necessary--he knows this because Senator Lott and I have both \ntold him--is to do first things first; one, do a proceeding on localism \nto find out: How has all of this concentration affected localism? That \nis, we provide free licenses to use the airwaves for television and \nradio, in exchange for which they are responsible to serve local \ninterests.\n  So do we know what they are doing? No. The Chairman of the Federal \nCommunications Commission has admitted to me they do not know how many \nstations are using a service called voice-tracking. I will give you an \nexample of voice tracking:\n  You are driving down the road on a bright Tuesday morning in Salt \nLake City, UT, and you have the radio on and after the song ends, the \ndisc jockey comes on and says, ``It is a great morning here in Salt \nLake City. We have the Sun coming up over the mountains. We have a blue \nsky. We have a light 5-mile-an-hour wind. We are going to have a \nwonderful day, aren't we?''\n  It turns out the guy is broadcasting from a basement studio in \nBaltimore, MD, pretending he is in Salt Lake City, simply ripping \ninformation from the Internet to say: It is a bright, sunny day here in \nSalt Lake City. That is called voice tracking. Does that serve local \ninterests? It sure does not. So how many stations do this? How \nprevalent is that practice? Don't know. Neither does the FCC.\n  How about starting a proceeding on localism to find out whether those \nwho are using the public airwaves, free of charge--airwaves that belong \nto the American public, not the licensees--how about finding out how \nthey are serving local interests? Or how about a proceeding dealing \nwith public interest standards because there are public interest \nrequirements for the holding of a license for television and radio \nbroadcasting?\n  How about first things first? Why the rush to provide more \nconcentration allowing cross-ownership of television stations with \nnewspapers? The Chairman would say: Well, I am not trying to do more \nconcentration in radio and television; I am trying to allow newspapers \nnow to begin buying television stations. Why? Well, he said the \nnewspapers are not doing very well. I said: When did it become the job \nof the Federal Communications Commission to be the bookkeeper for \nnewspapers? My understanding about newspapers is they used to have a \nhigher profit margin. Now it has dropped to 16 to 18 percent profit \nmargins--pretty good profit compared to all other industries. All of a \nsudden, the FCC thinks the newspapers are having financial trouble and \nso they should relax the rules to allow cross-ownership? I just think \nit is wrong.\n  Senator Lott and I offered the Media Ownership Act of 2007 today in \nthe Commerce Committee. That bill was agreed to unanimously.\n  My hope is that the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission \nis watching and listening because this Congress, on a bipartisan basis, \nsays no to further relaxing the controls on cross-ownership. And this \nCongress, on a bipartisan basis, I feel, strongly believes we have too \nmuch concentration in the media. The Chairman of the Federal \nCommunications Commission believes, apparently, we need more. He is \njust dead wrong.\n\n  My hope is that in the coming couple of weeks he will understand that \nit would not be the best course for the Federal Communications \nCommission. It would be wise for the Chairman to decide not to advance \nto a December 18 final vote on the rule he is proposing. It is not in \nthe public interest. It is not doing what the FCC should do. My hope is \nhe will instead open a public-interest proceeding and open a localism \nproceeding and finish them to their conclusion and do a good job on \nthem. That would be a public service for this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and make a point of order that a \nquorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this morning I had an opportunity, which I \nrarely have, to watch the entire press conference of President Bush at \nthe White House. The press conference dealt largely with the subject of \nthe National Intelligence Estimate that came out yesterday about the \nissue of a nuclear weapons program in Iran. The NIE that came out \nindicated that--to the surprise of certainly myself and many others--\nthe country of Iran abandoned its nuclear weapons program 4 years ago, \nin 2003. I was surprised, and many others were, because we have heard \nfrom this administration repeatedly about the threat posed by Iran's \nnuclear weapons program including some weeks ago when President Bush \nraised the specter of a ``World War III.''\n  Now we learn the nuclear weapons program they indicated Iran was \ninvolved in was discontinued 4 years ago. That comes from our National \nIntelligence Estimate, which is a cumulative assessment of all our \nintelligence agencies.\n  It raises, I think, some very important and troubling questions. The \nquestions are not new questions, actually. It is: What did this \nadministration know? What did they understand? What did they find out \nand when? The American people, and certainly this Congress, has been \ntreated to a very generous conversation by the President and his \nadministration about the specter of the nuclear weapons program in Iran \nand how it must be stopped. I don't disagree at all with the contention \nthat the behavior of Ahmadinejad and of some of the terrorist elements \nin Iran and others is far outside the norm and is troublesome to this \ncountry. But that is not what I am talking about.\n  I am talking about the question of a nuclear weapons program and the \nrelentless language by this administration about the nuclear weapons \nprogram that was being pursued by the country of Iran.\n  The intelligence community now says that is not the case and has not \nbeen the case since 2003. I wonder if the administration knew, if Mr. \nHadley knew--I heard his briefing--did the President know about this \nnew assessment when 5 or 6 weeks ago he was giving another of his \nspeeches and raising the specter of World War III in connection with a \npresumed or alleged nuclear weapons program by the country of Iran. The \nAmerican people certainly didn't know what the National Intelligence \nEstimate had disclosed to us. We are told the Intelligence Community \ncame to this conclusion sometime\n\n[[Page S14735]]\n\naround this summer. Mr. Hadley originally said the intelligence folks \nalerted the White House and indicated that the President should back \noff a bit. He certainly did not back off.\n  The reason I raise these issues is because I remember back about 5 \nyears ago going to a room in which top-secret briefings were offered to \nMembers of Congress as a leadup to the war in Iraq. I remember directly \nthe Vice President, the National Security Chief, now the Secretary of \nState, Condoleezza Rice, I remember the discussion by the head of the \nCIA, I remember the top-secret material that was told us, which turns \nout not to have been accurate as a leadup to the Iraq war.\n  I remember when Secretary Powell, then-Secretary of State, went to \nthe United Nations and made the case describing things we had \npreviously been told about in many cases in top-secret briefings.\n  For example Powell talked about the danger of the mobile biological \nweapons labs that supposedly existed in the country of Iraq.\n  It turns out the mobile biological weapons labs did not exist. It \nturns out the mobile biological weapons laboratory story was from a \nfabricator from the country of Iraq, a former taxicab driver in \nBaghdad, as a matter of fact, someone who was telling this to the \nGerman intelligence community. And someone in the German intelligence \ncommunity wondered whether this person was credible and expressed \ndoubts about the person's credibility to the American intelligence \nservice. They nicknamed this man ``Curve Ball.''\n  So from a single source, a man named Curve Ball who, among other \nthings, used to drive a taxicab in Baghdad, the world is treated by \nSecretary Powell to a presentation at the United Nations saying Iraq \nhas mobile biological weapons laboratories which are a danger to all of \nus. It turns out not to have been true, a fabrication based on a single \nsource without credibility.\n  None of us were told that at the time, of course. The world wasn't \ntold that. We were just told that Iraq had mobile biological weapons \nlaboratories. We were told Iraq was buying aluminum tubes for the \npurpose of reconstituting their nuclear capability. The world was told \nthat by Secretary Powell. It turns out that was false as well. And it \nalso turns out that even as we were told that information, the \nadministration knew there were others inside the administration who did \nnot believe it, and yet that information was imparted to us as a set of \nfacts that represented the danger coming from the country of Iraq.\n  We were told that Iraq was attempting to purchase yellowcake from \nNiger for the purpose of reconstituting a nuclear capability. We \ndiscovered only later that the documents on that were fraudulent. We \ndiscovered they were forgeries. Again, the information given the \nCongress was inaccurate.\n  Yellowcake from Niger, aluminum tubes, mobile biological weapons \nlaboratories--not accurate, not true. It was presented to the Congress \nas fact, presented to the American people as fact prior to the Iraq \nwar.\n  There has been a great deal of discussion and also concern in the \ncountry, in this Chamber, about whether this administration is \npreparing to do something with respect to the country of Iran, and that \nhas been heightened by the language President Bush used recently, \nincluding language that said ``World War III'' in the context of the \ndanger of a nuclear weapons program in the country of Iran. That \nstatement was about 5 or 6 weeks ago.\n  We now know that the National Intelligence Estimate, representing all \nof the intelligence agencies in this country, has indicated that the \nnuclear weapons program of Iran that has been discussed so much by the \nadministration was discontinued in 2003.\n  I think there are serious credibility questions. The President held a \npress conference today that seemed to suggest that, well, there is no \nreal issue here. There is a very big issue, I say to the President, a \nvery big issue. This country needs to take action internationally to \ndevelop strategies based on what we know to be the truth, not what \nsomeone alleges to be true. This country needs to have good \ninformation, information that is not fabricated by a man named Curve \nBall who used to drive a taxicab. This country deserves better than \nthat.\n  In my judgment, this country has been failed in many ways, some by \nthe intelligence community, some by the administration, perhaps some by \nCongress. But we certainly deserve straight answers. We deserve the \nbest intelligence that is available.\n  Look, the fact is we face a challenging and difficult world. One part \nof that world is the country of Iran. I do not by being here tonight \nsuggest that Iran's behavior is not troublesome, or that they are not a \ndanger in their neighborhood. They are. But I have always believed that \nthe constructive approach to dealing with Iran and, yes, other \ncircumstances around the world is through diplomacy and negotiation and \naggressive diplomacy at that. This administration does not believe that \nis the right course. But I do believe that facing the world that we \nface, a very challenging world, a war against terrorism, this country \nwill be protected by good intelligence, by an intelligence community \nthat works.\n\n  I appreciate the fact that yesterday we were told finally that the \nIranians are not at the moment engaging in a nuclear weapons program. \nThey discontinued that in 2003. They say they have high reliability \nwith respect to that conclusion. I appreciate the fact that we are \ngetting that conclusion at this point. And if that is a valid \nconclusion, if that is the result of good intelligence--and I certainly \nhope our intelligence service has improved because they got it wrong \nabout 5 years ago. We need to be well served by the best intelligence \nservice we can be capable of producing.\n  I know today there are men and women risking their lives as members \nof our intelligence community. My thoughts are with them. I want the \nbest they can give us. And if yesterday's National Intelligence \nEstimate gives us opportunities to better understand what is happening \nin that region, then that advances our knowledge.\n  I will say this: I think this Congress and this administration need \nto have some straight talk about credibility because there are serious \ncredibility issues with respect to this issue that at this point have \nnot been answered at all, certainly were not answered in the \nPresident's news conference today.\n  The safety of this country hinges on our ability to have good \nintelligence. This war on terrorism is not a bunch of words, it is \nreal, and there are too many victims out there in this country today \nwho understand that reality. The way to protect our country in the \nfuture is to have a good understanding of what is going on in the \nworld, have good intelligence, have good information, and take steps to \nprotect ourselves. But it does not serve this country's interest by \nratcheting up the rhetoric and talking about World War III with respect \nto a country that the administration has alleged up to now has had a \nnuclear weapons program, only to find out that nuclear weapons program \nwas discontinued 4 years ago.\n  This Congress and this administration needs to have an aggressive \nconversation about credibility. We actually represent the same country. \nI am sure we want the same result. We want to protect this country. We \nwant a foreign policy that deals with reality and a foreign policy that \ndeals with truths that exist out there in a very challenging world.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Booker\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave soldier from Vevay, IN. \nSGT Kenneth Raymond Booker, 25 years old, died November 14th in \nMukhisa, Iraq. Sergeant Booker died of injuries he sustained when an \nimprovised explosive device detonated near his vehicle. With an \noptimistic future before him, Kenneth risked everything to fight for \nthe values Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around \nthe world.\n\n[[Page S14736]]\n\n  Kenneth graduated in 2000 from Switzerland County High School in \nsoutheastern Indiana. Shortly thereafter, he joined the Army, happy at \nthe prospect of serving his country. As a member of the 82nd Airborne \ndivision from Fort Bragg, NC, Kenneth served in Afghanistan and Iraq. \nHis exemplary service earned him an assignment in military intelligence \nat Fort Lewis, WA. Kenneth, however, preferred working in the field to \nan office and requested to transfer back to infantry.\n  Joining a Stryker Brigade Combat Unit at Fort Lewis, Kenneth returned \nto Iraq for his third deployment. Kenneth was a member of the 2nd \nBattalion, 23rd Infantry Regiment, 4th Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 2nd \nInfantry Division. He will be remembered by his friends and family for \nhis clever sense of humor, his love of hunting and target shooting, his \noutgoing nature, and above all, his outstanding dedication to his \ncountry. Kenneth is survived by his father, SSG Charles Booker; his \nmother, Becky Graham; and his brother, Kaleb Daniel Booker.\n  Today, I join Kenneth's family and friends in mourning his death. \nWhile we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take \npride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Kenneth. Today and always, Kenneth will be \nremembered by family members, friends, and fellow Hoosiers as a true \nAmerican hero, and we honor the sacrifice he made while dutifully \nserving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Kenneth's sacrifice, \nI am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the \nfamilies of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we \ncannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living \nand dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor \npower to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember \nwhat we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This \nstatement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am \ncertain that the impact of Kenneth's actions will live on far longer \nthan any record of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of SGT Kenneth Raymond Booker in \nthe official Record of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country \nand for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When \nI think about this just cause in which we are engaged and the \nunfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that \nfamilies like Kenneth's can find comfort in the words of the prophet \nIsaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord \nGod will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Kenneth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/04/senate-section/article/S14736-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL BIBLE WEEK\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the National \nBible Association and the most influential force ever known to mankind, \nthe Holy Bible.\n  Each day, about 168,000 Bibles are sold, given away, or otherwise \ndistributed in the United States. November 18 through 25 was National \nBible Week, which, along with the National Bible Association, I hope \nincreased that exposure to help spread the Good News contained within \nits pages.\n  The timing of National Bible Week couldn't be more appropriate since \nit encompasses the Thanksgiving Holiday. As you know, Thanksgiving \ncommemorates the story and the plight of the Pilgrims, who fled to the \nNew World to escape religious persecution and joined with their new \nneighbors to give thanks for offering their friendly aid and for coming \nto their rescue in a dire time of need. Like the Pilgrims, the Bible \nrecounts numerous cases of religious persecution of the children of \nIsrael and the extreme hardships suffered by many over thousands of \nyears. But the Bible also gives us hope, and the comfort of knowing God \nwill help us to persevere and endure.\n  The theme of neighborly assistance and thanks, as well as the many \nother valuable and moral lessons or guidance for treating one's \nneighbor and fellow man, are imparted in the Bible and even served as a \nmoral compass to our Founding Fathers. The Judeo-Christian Bible became \nthe cornerstone of our Constitution and the Bill of Rights.\n  As we now find ourselves in the midst of the Christmas season, \nNational Bible Week should serve as an important reminder to always \nturn to the Bible, recognize its wisdom and Divinely inspired words, \nand reflect on its meaning in our own lives, especially in how we \ninteract with and treat our neighbors.\n  Beyond serving as a personal moral compass on how to become a better \nperson and neighbor, the Bible reassures us of God's infinite love for \nHis creation. I encourage you to pick up and read the Bible and become \nawed by the history, lessons, and adventures found within its pages. As \nwe celebrate National Bible Week, let us share the positive message of \nthe Holy Bible with our families, friends, and neighbors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/04/senate-section/article/S14736-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     HONORING JUDGE CLYDE MIDDLETON\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

SMITH\n\n Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, on December 1, America lost a great \nand innovative educator and a wonderfully decent human being when Sally \nSmith passed away this week at the age of 78. Sally was the founder and \ndirector of one of America's most important teaching institutions, the \nLab School in Washington, DC.\n  Sally was a New York City native, and longtime resident of the \nDistrict. She graduated in 1950 from Bennington College, and received a \nmaster's degree in education from New York University in 1955. In 1967, \ninspired by her own son's difficulties in learning, she founded the Lab \nSchool.\n  Beginning with just her son and three other students, the Lab School \nhas now grown into an internationally renowned school for students with \nlearning disabilities. Sally's fundamental belief was that all \nchildren, no matter what the disability, have the potential, ability \nand ingenuity to learn. Sally created a unique and innovative learning \nenvironment where students are given the tools and encouragement needed \nto fulfill their goals. She also provided through the Lab School the \nresources needed for others to teach students with disabilities.\n  In 1976, Sally became a professor at the School of Education at \nAmerican University, where she ran the master's degree program \nspecializing in learning disabilities. The Lab School serves as the \nprimary training site for most graduate students in the program. Sally \nis the author of 10 books on education. Her teaching techniques have \nbeen showcased in a four film series on PBS.\n  My wife Lilibet and I are privileged to have been actively involved \nwith the Lab School over the last 11 years, and we came to know and \nadmire Sally. She was an American original and represented the best of \nour society.\n  Like all of Sally's many friends, Lilibet and I offer our prayers to \nthe Smith family. She leaves the world a better place than she found \nit. She will be missed by that world.\n  Sally is survived by her sons, Randall, Nick and Gary Smith; a \nsister; and one granddaughter.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/04/senate-section/article/S14737-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S14737]]\n                        TRIBUTE TO STAN GARNETT\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in a few days Stan Garnett will \nretire from the Food and Nutrition Service of the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, after 35 years of tremendous service to people in our \nNation and elsewhere in the world.\n  Stan's experience and dedication to fighting hunger and malnutrition \nextends beyond his 35 years with the Department of Agriculture. \nFollowing his graduation from college, Stan answered President \nKennedy's call to service abroad and spent 2 years in the Peace Corps \nin the Philippines. Thereafter, he joined Catholic Relief Services and \nspent 6 years administering food assistance programs in Southeast Asia \nand in Africa under tremendously difficult circumstances. He often \ntraveled by helicopter in battle zones in Vietnam to deliver food \nassistance to war refugees, and he also provided food aid in Nigeria \nduring the tragic Biafran conflict.\n  Following his work overseas, Stan returned to the United States and \njoined the Food and Nutrition Service of the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture in 1971. Over the years, Stan held many different positions \nwithin the Food and Nutrition Service, the majority of them pertaining \nto legislative and regulatory policy in Federal child nutrition \nprograms. Throughout his career, Stan served with accomplishment and, \nnot surprisingly, continued a steady ascent in the ranks at the Food \nand Nutrition Service of the Department of Agriculture, eventually \nserving as the Director of Supplemental Food Programs and Director of \nthe Child Nutrition Division.\n  Stan fulfilled those positions with great competence, but with \nintegrity and humility as well. In 9 cases out of 10, Stan knows more \nabout the issue at hand than anyone else in the room, but he never acts \nas if this is the case. Stan treats everyone equally--Members of \nCongress, members of his own staff, and the many people across the \ncountry who for so long have relied on Stan's expertise to help them \noperate child nutrition programs in their own communities. Stan is \nknown by all who come in contact with him as a generous and caring \nadministrator who is trusted by all.\n  After 35 years of Federal service, there is no question that Stan has \ncertainly earned a much-deserved retirement. His absence will certainly \nbe acutely felt, both within the Department of Agriculture and here in \nCongress. However, I have no doubt that one of Stan's biggest \ncontributions is to leave child nutrition programs in the hands of \ncapable colleagues who have benefited, as I have over the years, from \nhis tremendous expertise, and who will ensure a smooth transition as \nnew leadership assumes his responsibilities.\n  In so many respects, the Stan Garnett who will retire this year is \nstrikingly similar to the Stan Garnett who took up President Kennedy's \ncall to service by entering the Peace Corps as a young man. His \ncommitment to ending hunger and to promoting the economic security and \nnutrition of low-income families is as strong today as it was as a \nbright-eyed college graduate. Just as important, he has imparted this \nsame idealism and commitment to numerous young people who have had the \nprivilege to work with him over the years. To those who question what a \ncareer in public service can accomplish, I ask only that they look to \nStan's career.

Obama, Ms.\n\n[[Page S14743]]\n\n        Snowe, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Brown, Ms. Collins, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. \n        Lugar, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Smith, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Sununu, Mr. \n        Bingaman, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Casey, Ms. Mikulski, \n        Mr. Menendez, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. \n        Biden, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 2405. A bill to provide additional appropriations for payments \nunder section 2604(e) of the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of \n1981; to the Committee on Appropriations.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Keep \nAmericans Warm Act, which provides an additional $1 billion in \nemergency home heating aid under the highly successful Low Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program, otherwise known as LIHEAP. Most importantly, \nthis $1 billion in emergency home heating assistance would be in \naddition to the overall fiscal year 2008 appropriations for LIHEAP.\n  I am delighted this bill enjoys widespread bipartisan support from \nacross the political spectrum. As a matter of fact, this legislation is \nbeing cosponsored by 23 of my colleagues--16 Democrats, 6 Republicans, \nand 1 Independent.\n  I would like to recognize all of the cosponsors this morning: both \nSenators from Minnesota, Mr. Coleman and Ms. Klobuchar; Senator Obama; \nboth Senators from Maine, Ms. Snowe and Ms. Collins; both Senators from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kerry and Mr. Kennedy; Senator Brown; Senator Lugar; \nthe senior Senator from the great State of Vermont, Senator Leahy; \nSenator Smith; Senator Bingaman, the chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee; Senator Sununu; both Senators from New York, Mr. \nSchumer and Mrs. Clinton; Senator Casey; Senator Mikulski; Senator \nMenendez; Senator Stabenow; Senator Lieberman; Senator Cantwell; \nSenator Biden; and Senator Boxer.\n  Mr. President, the reason this legislation is being cosponsored by so \nmany of my colleagues is simple: Skyrocketing home heating prices in \nNew England, the Northeast, and the Mideast, are already stretching \nhousehold budgets beyond the breaking point.\n  In the wealthiest country on the face of the Earth, not one family \nshould go cold this winter. That is not what America is supposed to be \nabout. Not one senior citizen should have to choose between heating \ntheir homes or paying for their prescription drugs.\n  I am afraid if we do not act, and act aggressively, that is what is \ngoing to happen all across this country. While the official start of \nwinter is still about 3 weeks away, home heating prices in Vermont and \nin other parts of the country are already going through the roof.\n  According to the Central Vermont Community Action Council, many \nVermont families have been paying an incredible $3.47 a gallon for \nheating oil and as much as $3.71 a gallon for kerosene this year. \nNationwide, heating oil prices are already up 90 cents from last year, \nor more than double from where they were 4 years ago. Further, the \nprice of kerosene has also increased by 50 cents a gallon from last \nyear.\n  These rapidly rising energy prices right now are bad enough; but the \noverall projections of what people will pay for energy over the course \nof this winter is frightening.\n  The National Energy Assistance Directors Association has projected \nthat the typical household using heating oil will pay $2,157 to heat \ntheir homes this winter--a 47-percent increase from what they paid last \nyear. Those using propane will pay $1,765 this winter, or 30 percent \nmore than what they paid 2 years ago.\n  Before we got back into session this week, the debate over LIHEAP was \nbetween an 11.6-percent increase from last year, as included in the \nfiscal year 2008 Labor-HHS conference report, and the President's \nbudget proposal of a 21-percent cut--cut--from last year.\n  While the level of funding for LIHEAP included in the Labor-HHS \nconference report is a good starting point, even if this level \neventually becomes law, it would still be 31 percent below the $3.2 \nbillion provided in fiscal year 2006.\n  Making matters worse, the President vetoed the Labor-HHS conference \nreport, insisting on a $379 million cut to LIHEAP, among other things.\n  We hear a lot of talk in Washington about family values. Well, to my \nmind, a family value is that we do not let our fellow Americans go cold \nwhen the cost of home heating oil is exploding.\n  I thank all my colleagues. This legislation has brought forth \nwidespread bipartisan support from Senators all across this country. \nLet us be aggressive and pass this legislation so that in this great \ncountry nobody goes cold this winter. Thank you.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Conrad, Ms. Collins, and Mrs. \n        Lincoln):\n  S. 2406. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \npermit States to obtain reimbursement under the Medicaid program for \ncare or services required under the Emergency Medical Treatment and \nActive Labor Act that are provided in a nonpublicly owned or operated \ninstitution for mental diseases; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Medicaid \nEmergency Psychiatric Care Act of 2007. Original cosponsors this bill \ninclude two of my colleagues on the Finance Committee, Senators Conrad \nand Lincoln, as well as Senator Collins. Our legislation will improve \naccess to mental health treatment and remove an unfunded mandate on our \nnonpublic mental health treatment centers by allowing freestanding \npsychiatric hospitals to receive appropriate reimbursement for \nemergency treatment.\n  According to the CDC, visits to hospital emergency rooms rose 20 \npercent in the past 10 years. This situation is exacerbated by a \nshortage of short-term inpatient psychiatric care facilities leaving \npsychiatric patients with a serious mental illness with nowhere to go. \nIn fact, in 2003, there were 3.7 million visits to hospital emergency \ndepartment for mental disorders. If treatment remains unavailable, \npatients could become homeless or be housed as criminal offenders.\n  The Emergency Medical and Labor Treatment Act, EMTALA, requires all \nhospitals, including psychiatric hospitals, to stabilize patients who \ncome in with an emergency medical condition. However, an outdated \nMedicaid provision called the Institution for Mental Diseases, IMD, \nexclusion does not allow Medicaid reimbursement to nonpublic \npsychiatric hospitals for stabilizing care delivered to Medicaid \npatients between the ages of 21-64. This policy isolates adults with \nmental illnesses from all other Medicaid-eligible populations and \ncontradicts the principles of equal treatment and insurance parity for \ntreatment of mental illnesses.\n  When the IMD exclusion was created, individuals who were afflicted \nwith mental health conditions often were institutionalized for an \nextended time. Today, hospitalization for common mental health concerns \nsuch as mild depression does not generally occur, thus removing the \npotential for abuse of the system. This exclusion burdens these \nfacilities with an unfunded mandate and has caused severe financial \nburdens to psychiatric facilities--often amounting to millions of \ndollars a year. The IMD exclusion does not take into consideration the \nvast advancements that have transformed mental health services \navailable today, and actually restricts access to critical mental \nhealth services for those who, by today's standards, are in the \ngreatest need.\n  Emergency department overcrowding is a growing and severe problem in \nthe United States, and dedicated physicians and nurses who work in \nemergency rooms are reaching a breaking point where they may not have \nthe resources or surge capacity to respond effectively. Patients often \nface a long wait in the emergency room, sometimes for days, because \nthere is no bed or other appropriate setting available. Tens of \nthousands of dollars every day are being spent inefficiently on \nextended treatment in emergency rooms that is not the most appropriate \nor clinically effective care. Passage of this bill will help relieve \novercrowding in emergency departments and allow hospitals to provide \nthe appropriate care these patients deserve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CASEY:\n  S. 2407. A bill to provide for programs that reduce the need for \nabortion, help\n\n[[Page S14744]]\n\nwomen bear healthy children, and support new parents; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about members of the \nAmerican family whom we all care about, and I think all of us do in \nthis chamber and across America, but for whom we do not do nearly \nenough to support, and those members of the American family are \npregnant women.\n  I remember, as so many others do in the life of the family the times \nmy wife Terese learned that she was pregnant, and even through I, of \ncourse, cannot ever experience it directly, I knew and I know now \nthrough her and my sisters' experience that that moment is indelible, \nand it is unforgettable in the life of a woman, in the life of a \nfamily, the moment she finds out that she is pregnant.\n  For many women this is a moment, of course, of great joy. It is the \nmoment where they learn they are pregnant and they appreciate the \nmiracle of pregnancy. And perhaps it has been long awaited or in the \ncase of a particular woman and her family, perhaps it is something of a \nsurprise. But for many women, for many families, it is a welcome \nsurprise.\n  Many of these women do not need help beyond what their families can \nprovide them and what others may receive in terms of adequate support \nfrom our existing framework of support within this country, so they do \nnot feel they have any great burden at that moment.\n  But there is another circumstance other pregnant women may face. And \nfor those pregnant women, and for one, in particular, if we can imagine \nwho that person is in the life, in our own lives, people we have known, \nfor that woman the moment of discovery that she is pregnant \nunfortunately is not a moment of joy. For her it is a moment of terror \nor panic or even shame in some circumstances. She may be in a doctor's \noffice or a clinic or she may be at home. But for her that moment \nbegins a crisis, a real crisis in her life, in which she feels \noverwhelmingly and perhaps almost unbearably alone, all alone. She \ncould be wealthy, middle income, or poor. Most likely, in our country, \nunfortunately, she would be poor. But whatever her income, that woman \nat that moment in that circumstance feels very simply all alone.\n  A pregnant woman may have an abusive spouse or boyfriend, for \nexample, that person who is tormenting her at that moment, and that \nwill continue.\n  At that moment for her, she is all alone with no help at all. Another \npregnant woman may believe she cannot support or care for a new baby at \nthis point in her life. She too is all alone. Another woman might \nbelieve her financial situation is so precarious that she cannot care \nfor or raise a child. She may also feel alone and even helpless.\n  We know the staggering numbers in America today: 48 percent of all \npregnancies are unintended; excluding cases of after miscarriages, 54 \npercent of those unintended pregnancies end in abortion.\n  The response: ``cannot afford a baby,'' is the second most frequently \ncited reason why women choose to have an abortion. And 73 percent of \nwomen having abortions citing this reason: ``cannot afford a baby,'' \ncite this reason as a contributing factor in their decision.\n  So a woman who is facing the challenges of an unplanned pregnancy, \nthat may be a crisis for her, does not need, does not need a lecture \nfrom a politician and does not need a clinical reminder that she just \nhas a simple choice to make. The choice is never simple, never, and \nthis woman needs support and love and understanding. She needs to be \nembraced in a time of crisis in her life, not sent on her way to deal \nwith this question on her own.\n  She needs our help and she needs us to walk with her, not only \nthrough the 9 months of her pregnancy, but also for the early months \nand years of her child's life. We in the Congress, both House and \nSenate, both parties, need to address this issue in a comprehensive way \nthat meets those needs that woman has in her life.\n  Some Members in this body for years, and up to the current day, have \ninitiated good efforts. We should applaud those efforts and support \nthem. In some cases there is support for them. But I believe neither \npolitical party is doing enough for pregnant women in America today--\nneither party.\n  While there is tremendous disagreement about how best to do this, \nthere is one significant area of common ground. Despite all we hear in \nWashington, there is, on these questions, one area of common ground, \none thing we all agree upon, and that is, we all want to reduce the \nnumber of abortions.\n  We all want to help as many pregnant women, as many families as we \ncan. Many women who have had abortions do so very reluctantly. While \nchoice is a term that is widely used in this debate, many women who \nface unplanned pregnancies do not feel, do not feel they have a genuine \nchoice. And that is why for so many reasons I am introducing new \nlegislation, the Pregnant Women Support Act. With this bill it is my \nfervent hope that a new dialog, a kind of common ground, will emerge on \nhow we can reduce abortion by offering pregnant women real choices and \nreal help.\n\n  Let me outline a couple of provisions of the bill. This bill will, \nfirst of all, assist pregnant and parenting teens to finish high school \nand prepare for college or vocational training. Next, it will help \npregnant college students stay in school, offering them counseling as \nwell as assistance with continuing their education, parenting support \nclasses, and also childcare assistance.\n  Third, it will provide counseling and shelter to pregnant women in \nabusive relationships who may be fearful of continuing a pregnancy in a \ncrisis situation. It will establish a national toll-free hotline and a \npublic awareness campaign to offer women support and knowledge about \noptions and resources available to them when they face an unplanned \npregnancy.\n  It will give women free sonogram examinations by providing grants for \nthe purchase of ultrasound equipment. It will provide parents with \ninformation about genetic disability testing, including support for \nparents who receive a diagnosis of Downs syndrome. It will ensure that \npregnant women receive prenatal and postnatal care by eliminating \npregnancy as a preexisting condition in the individual health care \nmarket, and also eliminating waiting periods for women with prior \ncoverage.\n  It will establish a nurse home visitation program for pregnant and \nfirst-time mothers as an eligible benefit under Medicaid and the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, what we refer to here as SCHIP. We \nknow it means Children's Health Insurance.\n  One example of this home visitation program is the nurse-family \npartnership, an evidence-based program and national model in which \nnurses mentor young first-time and primarily low-income mothers, \nestablishing a supportive relationship with both mother and child. \nStudies have shown this program to be both cost effective and hugely \nsuccessful in terms of life outcomes for both mothers and their \nchildren. This legislation will increase funding for the Women, Infants \nand Children Program, known as the WIC Program, providing nutrition \nassistance, counseling and education, obesity prevention, breastfeeding \nsupport, prenatal and pediatric health care referrals, immunization \nscreening and referral, and a host of other services for mothers and \ntheir children.\n  Next, it will expand nutritional support for low-income parents by \nincreasing the income eligibility levels for food stamps. It will \nincrease funding for the childcare and development block grant program, \nwhich is the primary source of Federal funding for childcare assistance \nfor low-income parents.\n  Finally, it will provide support for adoption as an alternative to \nabortion and make the adoption tax credit permanent. I introduced this \nbill with the deepest conviction that we can indeed find common ground. \nI believe we can transform this debate by focusing upon the issues that \nunite us and not the issues that divide us.\n  As most people know who cover the Senate and understand what happens \nhere and where candidates stand, most people know this already, but I \nam a pro-life Democrat, and I believe life begins at conception and \nends when we draw our last breath.\n  I also believe the role of Government is to protect, enrich, and \nvalue life for everyone, at every moment, from beginning to end. I \nbelieve we as a nation\n\n[[Page S14745]]\n\nhave to do more to support women and their children when they are most \nvulnerable, during pregnancy and early childhood.\n  I also strongly support, and have for years, family planning \nprograms, because they avoid sometimes those dark moments when a woman, \noften alone, faces a pregnancy she feels she cannot handle. I also \nsupport family planning programs precisely because they reduce the \nnumber of abortions.\n  But that is not the issue I address today. Today, with this bill, I \nam focused on the woman who is pregnant, and I am asking myself, and I \nthink Congress and the administration, as any Congress and any \nadministration has to ask themselves this fundamental question: For \nthat woman who is facing that crisis in her life, we have to ask \nourselves, as a Congress and as a society: What more can we do? What \nmore can we do to help her? That is the question we must continually \nask. I think if we ask that question today, the answer, unfortunately, \nis: Not enough.\n  We are not doing enough. I believe there is more common ground in \nAmerica than we might realize on these questions, if only we focus on \nhow we can truly help and support that woman who wishes to carry her \npregnancy to term and how we can give her and her child what they need \nto begin healthy and productive lives together.\n  For the past 34 years, unfortunately, the issue of abortion has been \nused mostly as a way to divide people, even as the number of abortions \nremains and still remains unacceptably high. We have to find a better \nway.\n  I believe this legislation, the Pregnant Women Support Act, is a part \nof that better way. I believe we must look toward real solutions to the \nissue of abortion by targeting the underlying factors that often lead \nwomen to make the decision to have an abortion. This is precisely what \nthis act, the Pregnant Women Support Act, will do.\n  I really believe when it comes to this issue of helping a pregnant \nwoman, we need to consider what our obligations are. I think we can \nstate it very simply: We need to walk in solidarity with her, in her \npregnancy, especially when it is an unplanned pregnancy, and we need to \nsupport her and give her all the help we can at this time in her life.\n  That is exactly what this bill does for women who may find themselves \nin a position where they are facing one of the most difficult \nsituations in their life. The woman who has no one to turn to for \nadvice, for counsel, or for support, we have got to be there for her at \nthat moment and for a long time thereafter.\n  I truly believe there are few things more terrifying than the \nprospect of supporting another human being when you have no support of \nyour own. Unfortunately, far too many women face that decision, face \nthat crisis.\n  So I believe reducing the number of abortions should not be a \npartisan issue. It should not pit Republicans against Democrats. So \nwhat do I seek? I seek common ground, and I ask my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to join me in seeking real solutions that will unite \nus in providing life with dignity, before--before--and after the birth \nof a child, for a pregnant woman, for her family, and for her child. \nSurely, we must all agree that no woman should ever have to face the \ncrisis of an unplanned pregnancy all alone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/04/senate-section/article/S14745-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 58--WELCOMING FIRST MINISTER DR.

Res. 376\n\n       Whereas the Secretary of Commerce may provide fishery \n     disaster assistance under section 312(a) of the Magnuson-\n     Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. \n     1861a(a)) if the Secretary determines that there is a \n     commercial fishery failure due to a fishery resource disaster \n     as a result of natural causes, man-made causes beyond the \n     control of fishery managers to mitigate through conservation \n     and management measures, including regulatory restrictions \n     imposed to protect human health or the marine environment, or \n     undetermined causes;\n       Whereas the Secretary of Commerce has not proposed or \n     promulgated regulations to implement such section 312(a);\n       Whereas during 2007, the Governors of each of the \n     Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the State of Maine, and the \n     State of Rhode Island requested that the Secretary of \n     Commerce declare a commercial fishery failure for the \n     groundfish fishery under such section 312(a) and the Governor \n     of the State of New Hampshire has indicated his intention of \n     submitting a similar request;\n       Whereas since 1996, the Secretary of Commerce has had \n     regulations in place that require significant restrictions \n     and reductions on the catch and days-at-sea of New England \n     fishermen in the groundfish fishery;\n       Whereas New England fishermen in the groundfish fishery \n     have endured additional restrictions and reductions under \n     Framework 42, which has resulted in many fishermen having \n     just 24 days to fish during a season;\n       Whereas Framework 42 and other Federal fishing restrictions \n     have had a great impact on small-boat fishermen, many of whom \n     cannot safely fish beyond the inshore areas;\n       Whereas, as of the date of the enactment of this Act, each \n     day-at-sea a fisherman spends in an inshore area reduces that \n     fisherman's number of available days-at-sea by 2 days;\n       Whereas the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has provided \n     information to the Secretary of Commerce demonstrating that \n     between 1994 and 2006, overall conditions of groundfish \n     stocks have not improved and that spawning stock biomass is \n     near record lows for most major groundfish stocks;\n       Whereas the Commonwealth of Maine has provided additional \n     information to the Secretary that between 2005 and 2006, \n     total Massachusetts commercial groundfish vessel revenues \n     (landings) decreased by 18 percent and there was a loss for \n     related industries and communities estimated at $22,000,000;\n       Whereas the State of Maine has provided information to the \n     Secretary of Commerce indicating that since 1994, the impact \n     of groundfish regulations have eliminated 50 percent of \n     Maine's groundfish fleet, leaving just 110 active groundfish \n     fishermen;\n       Whereas the State of Maine has provided additional \n     information to the Secretary indicating that between 1996 and \n     2006, there was a 58 percent drop in groundfish landings in \n     Maine and a 45 percent drop in groundfish revenue from \n     approximately $27,000,000 to $15,000,000 and that between \n     2005 and 2006, groundfish revenues decreased 25 percent;\n       Whereas the State of Rhode Island has provided information \n     to the Secretary of Commerce indicating that, since 1994, \n     there has been a 66 percent drop in Rhode Island's groundfish \n     fishery landings and, between 1995 and 2007, groundfish \n     revenue decreased 20 percent from approximately $7,500,000 to \n     $6,000,000;\n       Whereas the Secretary of Commerce rejected requests from \n     Massachusetts, Maine, and Rhode Island to declare a \n     commercial fishery failure prior to establishing any \n     appropriate standard to implement section 312(a) of the \n     Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act; and\n\n[[Page S14747]]\n\n       Whereas for centuries, growth in New England's commercial \n     fishing industry has been intertwined with the history and \n     economic growth of the New England States and has created \n     thousands of jobs in both fishing and fishing-related \n     industries for generations of New England residents: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     Secretary of Commerce should--\n       (1) reconsider the October 22, 2007 decision to deny the \n     requests of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the State of \n     Maine, and the State of Rhode Island for a groundfish fishery \n     failure declaration;\n       (2) look favorably upon the request of the State of New \n     Hampshire for a groundfish fishery failure declaration; and\n       (3) immediately propose regulations to implement section \n     312(a) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \n     Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1861a(a)).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/04/senate-section/article/S14747-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CREATING AND EXTENDING CERTAIN TEMPORARY DISTRICT COURT JUDGESHIPS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 172, S. 1327.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1327) to create and extend certain temporary \n     district court judgeships.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier this year I introduced a bipartisan \nmeasure to address the emerging staffing needs of the Federal \nJudiciary, our coequal branch of government. This bill responds to \ndiscrete situations in five States regarding temporary judgeships. In \nMay, the Judiciary Committee voted unanimously to report this bill. It \nis now December. That is a delay of over 6 months. This sustained delay \ncan be attributed to a ``hold'' by a single Republican Senator.\n  I am glad that this hold has finally been lifted so that we can \nproceed. I am delighted that this bipartisan bill has finally been \napproved after such a needless delay. Had it been cleared for \nconsideration earlier, the House could have acted before the \nThanksgiving recess and the matter could be law. Instead, our proposal \nstill needs to be considered by the House and presented to the \nPresident in order to take effect.\n  In order to address fluctuations in a court's caseload, Congress can \nauthorize a judgeship on a temporary basis. These temporary fixes do \nnot undermine the independence that comes with lifetime appointment to \nthe judiciary because the judges who fill them are, in fact, appointed \nfor life, like all Federal judges. The positions are temporary in the \nsense that when they expire the next vacancy in the jurisdiction is not \nfilled, and the extra judgeship expires.\n  Last Congress, two of these needed temporary judgeships were allowed \nto expire. That was regrettable. One was in Nebraska and the other in \nCalifornia. That was unfortunate since they continue to have high case \nloads. This legislation restores the status quo in these busy districts \nby reauthorizing these two temporary judgeships. I know that Senators \nFeinstein, Boxer, Nelson and Hagel have been concerned about these \ncaseloads, and thank them for working with me and for cosponsoring and \nsupporting this bill to restore those judgeships.\n  In addition, temporary judgeships in three other districts are close \nto expiration. Caseloads in Ohio, Hawaii and Kansas remain at a high \nlevel, and allowing their temporary judgeships to lapse would put a \nserious strain on courts in those jurisdictions. This legislation would \nextend each of the five temporary judgeships for 10 years. This will \nallow Congress some flexibility with regard to future judgeship needs. \nSenator Brownback has expressed his concerns about this to me, as has \nMr. Regula in the House. I thank Senators Inouye, Akaka, Roberts, \nBrownback, Voinovich and Brown for cosponsoring and supporting this \nbill to extend those judgeships.\n  Next year, I will work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nto address judgeship needs in a comprehensive way. Indeed, I have asked \nsix Senators who are members of the Judiciary Committee, three \nDemocratic Senators and three Republican Senators, to serve as a task \nforce and report a proposal to Senator Specter and me before the end of \nthe year. I have asked Senator Schumer and Senator Sessions to head \nthis task force, and look forward to their report next month.\n  The five districts affected by this bill, however, cannot wait until \nnext year for action on this extension or their temporary judgeships \nmay well expire in the interim. This legislation will act as a \n``patch,'' allowing these districts to effectively operate until we are \nable to determine what additional judgeships are needed throughout the \nFederal judiciary.\n  The measure is supported by the Judicial Conference of the United \nStates, and I thank my colleagues for moving this legislation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread three times, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable; that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord, without further intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1327) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1327\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
